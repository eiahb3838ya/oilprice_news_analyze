2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - A portion of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone oil pipeline remained shut on Thursday for investigation of a possible leak on its right-of-way near St. Louis, Missouri, a company spokesman said. TransCanada shut the pipeline on Wednesday between Steele City, Nebraska and Patoka, Illinois and sent crews to assess the situation, spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email. The 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline is a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to U.S. refineries. Two pipelines operating near the release site will be excavated on Friday to determine the source of the leak, said Darius Kirkwood, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The agency is monitoring the response to the reported leak, he said. Canadian pipelines are already congested because of  expanding production in recent years, forcing the Alberta provincial government to order production cuts starting last month. Canadian heavy oil has attracted greater demand following U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s state oil company. The discount on Canadian heavy crude compared to U.S. light oil widened to $10.15 per barrel on Thursday morning from $9.40 earlier, according to Net Energy Exchange. TransCanada shares eased 0.2 percent to C$55.98 in Toronto. An official with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said on Wednesday that the release of oil had stopped and it planned to find the leak on Thursday. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Trading houses that resell Venezuelan crude oil have not yet found workarounds since the United States announced sanctions to cut off socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s revenue, according to shipping data and sources. Merchants, trading partners and Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA were expecting oil swaps and so-called triangulation of sales to be the easiest ways to continue shipping, as has happened when sanctions were imposed on other nations, such as Iran and Russia.  But the U.S. measures - tougher and deeper than past sanctions - have for now blocked a large portion of trading in Venezuelan oil worldwide as end-users are reluctant to take cargoes, leaving barrels stranded in the Atlantic basin, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. The lack of Venezuelan oil has U.S. refiners scrambling for replacements and threatens global trade that is worth $6 billion a year. The sanctions are affecting Europe-based trading firms including Trafigura and Vitol, which regularly offer Venezuelan oil to refiners, and PetroChina Co Ltd, which along with Russia’s Rosneft recoup money lent to Venezuela by reselling PDVSA barrels.  Almost 9 million barrels remain stuck in tankers waiting for payment or discharge instructions, according to Eikon data. Most are anchored in the U.S. Gulf Coast as self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido rushes to set up escrow accounts to receive proceeds. Trading companies have also delayed loadings of Venezuelan oil scheduled by PDVSA for February delivery, according to sources and data, because merchants are having trouble finding buyers. “No one who typically takes Venezuelan crude from us is lifting a single barrel,” a Trafigura trader said, referring to barrels offered on the spot market. “Buyers are not sure of the risks and how to ensure any payments are not remitted to PDVSA.” To be sure, PDVSA has not stopped exporting. There are more than a dozen tankers in the water headed for destinations like India, China and Singapore that have loaded since sanctions were imposed on Jan. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  Most vessels will not arrive at their destinations for several weeks, but they are for end-users like India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, which pays for Venezuelan crude by cash and oil swaps. Those exports, if completed, would amount to about 1 million barrels per day, short of the 1.4 million bpd average for the three previous months, according to Eikon.  The U.S. sanctions limit U.S. refiners to paying into escrow accounts that cannot be accessed by Maduro’s government, effectively cutting off shipments. Foreign firms that engage in oil trading involving the U.S. financial system or U.S. units are similarly restricted. Trafigura told Reuters the firm is following “all applicable sanctions.” Vitol did not immediately comment but has previously said that it is compliant with sanctions. PetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trading houses lifted some 255,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuela’s crude and fuel in 2018, or 20 percent of overall exports, according to PDVSA’s internal data seen by Reuters. Sales could flow temporarily if European branches of oil firms and trading houses find a way to sell Venezuelan crude in currencies other than U.S. dollars, but Europe is also mulling sanctions, meaning the window could close quickly. PetroChina, which resells Venezuelan oil to customers in destinations from the United States to Singapore, has recently reduced cargo lifting. The Aframax tanker Flavin chartered by PetroChina arrived in Venezuelan waters on Jan. 25, and was scheduled to load 500,000 barrels of fuel oil bound for Rotterdam, Netherlands. But the oil has not been loaded, in part due to sanctions, according to two sources involved in the case.  As of Feb. 7, the Flavin was still docked at PDVSA’s Amuay port, according to Eikon. Another PetroChina cargo, the Aframax Stride, was loaded on Jan. 25, but it is now anchored off the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the world pulled back sharply on Thursday on fears of a global growth slowdown spreading to Europe and renewed worries about any near-term resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions, while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a sixth session. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.10 percent, on pace for its biggest one-day drop in more than a month as it receded from two-month highs reached earlier in the week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.49 percent, as disappointing corporate updates from Publicis and other companies also weighed, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 benchmark index dropped 1.2 percent. The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next on expectations the bloc’s largest countries will be held back by global trade tensions and domestic challenges. Germany’s DAX stock index tumbled 2.7 percent as industrial output in  Europe’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month. Safe-haven assets gained, including Japan’s yen and gold. “Even though we are in the midst of earnings season, the macro environment is really impacting global risk sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago.  “Fears of a more dramatic slowdown in Europe are being joined with the fears around a slowdown in China. And the broad slowdown in global trade is having a direct impact on some of these economies and some of the results.” Heightened concerns about U.S.-China trade relations also rattled investors, including news that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are unlikely to meet before a March 1 deadline set by their governments to reach a trade deal, according to U.S. officials. “Europe kick-started us to the downside this morning and then there was follow-through from the Trump headline and all of a sudden you have an overdue sell-off on your hands,” said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258.8 points, or 1.02 percent, to 25,131.5, the S&P 500 lost 31.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,699.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 99.87 points, or 1.35 percent, to 7,275.41. U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp will buy rival SunTrust Banks Inc for about $28 billion in stock, the biggest bank deal in about a decade. Shares of both banks rose.  The downgrade in European growth expectations filtered into currency markets, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.1353. The dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.1 percent, firming for a sixth session in a row. The dollar’s gains come despite the Federal Reserve’s dovish shift on interest rates last week. “When analysing a currency’s exchange rate, it should be relative to a peer. So far it seems none of these peers have a competitive advantage, making the dollar the less unloved currency,” Hussein Sayed, strategist at forex broker FXTM, said in a note. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.6572 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Wednesday. Oil fell as the market confronted concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil group Total has evacuated its remaining staff from Venezuela and its bank accounts there have been blocked as a result of U.S. sanctions, the company’s chief executive said on Thursday. “The priority has been clearly the safety of all our people and everybody has been evacuated since last Monday,” Patrick Pouyanne, the CEO, told investors on the company’s earnings call, according to a Refinitiv Eikon transcript.  According to Total’s website, the company had a staff of 50 in Venezuela, but a source familiar with the operation there said the number had dwindled to just “administrative” staff who have now been evacuated.  The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela on Jan. 28 to cut off oil revenue to President Nicolas Maduro, who won re-election last year in a contest widely seen as fraudulent.  Pouyanne said Total will manage its Venezuela operations from Europe, instead of from the United States.

2019-02-08,"PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France plans to back an EU proposal to regulate Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, its foreign ministry said on Thursday, potentially threatening its completion and dealing a blow to Germany which has been trying to garner support for the project.  The European Union executive wants to extend its internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines before construction is completed, giving it a say over how the new gas link under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany is used. In its current form, Nord Stream 2, fully owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom, would not be compliant with tougher new rules foreseen for new infrastructure projects.  Diplomatic sources said earlier that Germany had been pressuring other European capitals to block the new directive. “France intends to support the adoption of such a directive. Work is continuing with our partners, in particular with Germany, on possible changes to the text,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a briefing. Any delay in building the pipeline would create uncertainty for Gazprom’s partners: Germany’s Uniper and BASF’s Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. The EU bloc is divided in its support for the project. Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries view the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as holding the EU hostage to Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritise the economic benefits. An EU source said earlier that France’s vote would be decisive, likely leaving Germany short of a blocking minority. Opponents of the pipeline worry it will weaken support for Ukraine by depriving Kiev of gas transit fees along the traditional route for Russian supplies, which fill over a third of the EU’s gas needs. The U.S. ambassadors to Germany, Denmark and the European Union urged EU members to vote against the pipeline. “Cancelling the project would send a clear signal that Moscow cannot get away unscathed with its aggression against neighbouring states, and its meddling in our democracies,” they wrote in a joint op-ed published by Deutsche Welle on Thursday. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Nord Stream 2 would not make Germany dependent on Russia for gas, stressing that Ukraine must remain a transit country. “Do we become dependent on Russia due to this second gas pipeline? I say ‘no’, if we diversify at the same time,” Merkel told a news conference in Bratislava. Uniper, which has so far spent about 600 million euros (525.42 million pounds) out of the 950 million it earmarked for the project, said its assumption was that Nord Stream 2 would still be realised. “This is a project for the next decades and therefore, to a certain extent, independent of current events,” a spokesman for the group said.     A spokesman for Wintershall said the group would closely watch any further developments. If the proposed regulation musters enough support, negotiations on final draft rules could begin as early as next week.

2019-02-08,"BENGHAZI, Libya, Feb 7 (Reuters) - East Libyan military forces control a pumping substation for the El Sharara oilfield but the main production area is still occupied by armed tribesmen, a field engineer said on Thursday. The Libyan National Army (LNA), based in the east of the politically divided country, said on Wednesday it had seized the 315,000 barrels per day field from tribesmen and protesters who forced operations to halt when they took the site on Dec. 8. The engineer, who asked not to be identified, said a convoy of LNA vehicles had arrived at a substation about 20 km (12 miles) from main field, which extends for 40 km (25 miles) in Libya’s southern desert. He said the field perimeter was not fenced off and said the LNA was still trying to negotiate access to the main facility with the tribesman and protesters, who had taken the field demanding salary payments and development funds. The National Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil firm based in the west of Libya, shut production as a result of the protest and declared force majeure, a waiver on its contracts. The LNA, loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a commander whose powerbase is the eastern city of Benghazi, had demanded on Wednesday that production resume and force majeure be lifted. NOC and the internationally recognised government, also based in the Tripoli in Libya’s west, declined to comment. Oil output from the OPEC state has been disrupted since conflict erupted in 2011 and a political wedge was driven down the middle of the country. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure. Haftar’s LNA seized Benghazi, Libya’s second-largest city, in 2017, expelling Islamist and other fighters there. The LNA said last month it was launching an offensive to fight militants and secure oilfields in the south. A resident in Ubari, a town close to El Sharara, said one LNA unit had attacked by an unknown group in the area. Reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli and Ulf Laessing

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France warned its citizens in Chad on Thursday to be extra vigilant after its fighter jets struck a heavily-armed rebel convoy that crossed last week from southern Libya aiming to destabilise President Idriss Deby. French warplanes destroyed about 20 pick-up trucks in a third day of air strikes on Wednesday after Deby asked Paris for support. France sees him as key to a wider regional fight against Islamist militants. “Given the air operations which the French military are carrying out in northeast Chad and to prevent any malicious act against them, French nationals are urged to be more vigilant,” the embassy said in a message to its 1,500 citizens in Chad. The strikes, which started on Sunday, come as Chadian rebels have increased their activities in southern Libya since vowing last year to overthrow Deby. The Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a rebel Chadian coalition created in 2009 after almost toppling Deby, has said it was behind this week’s incursion, which saw some 50 pick-up trucks drive almost unopposed more than 600 km (372.82 miles) into Chadian territory. “Bombings are continuing today. Several dozen vehicles have been destroyed and there are many seriously wounded,” a senior UFR official told Reuters, declining to say how many had died. “We will not return to Libya. We will wage war inside Chad.”   Army spokesman Patrik Steiger said there had been no French air strikes on Thursday and the military was assessing the state and intentions of the convoy.  A statement after a Chad government meeting said Deby had informed ministers “the column of mercenaries” had been completely destroyed. Deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in 1990 in a military coup. International observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office since, and last year he pushed through constitutional reforms that could keep him in office until 2033. France intervened in 2008 to stop the UFR toppling Deby, but President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants a new relationship with France’s former colonies and the era of propping up leaders is over. However, France considers its former colony as vital in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa and based its 4,500-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force in the capital N’djamena  The incursion, which Chadian troops had initially attempted to stop, underscores how Deby’s fight against Islamist militants in the region has strained his military and hit the oil-dependent economy, leading to growing dissatisfaction in one of the world’s poorest nations.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday the country will decide around 2022 whether state-owned utility EDF will be allowed to build new nuclear reactors. In November, Macron said France would reduce the share of nuclear in the power mix to 50 percent by 2035, down from 75 percent today, and said that a decision on whether to build new nuclear plants would be taken mid-2021. Because of repeated delays and budget overruns of EDF’s EPR reactor model under construction in Flamanville, northern France, Macron’s government has not yet committed to building new reactors once old reactors close.  “We will decide around 2022 about what France does with the new generation of EPRs, depending on the outcome of studies and any progress made,” Macron said during a debate with young people in the Saone-et-Loire region.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations-led inquiry into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi said on Thursday that evidence pointed to a brutal crime “planned and perpetrated” by Saudi officials. Khashoggi’s killing by a team of Saudi operatives on Oct. 2 provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive. U.S. intelligence agencies believe Crown Prince Mohammed ordered an operation to kill Khashoggi, a critic and Washington Post columnist, and say his body was dismembered and removed to a location still publicly unknown. Riyadh denies the prince had any involvement in the murder. “Evidence collected during my mission to Turkey shows prime facie case that Mr. Khashoggi was the victim of a brutal and premeditated killing, planned and perpetrated by officials of the State of Saudi Arabia,” Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur for extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, said in statement issued in Geneva. She said her Jan 28-Feb 3 mission to Turkey with a team of three experts “could not firmly establish whether the original intention was to abduct Mr. Khashoggi, with his murder planned only in the eventuality of this abduction failing.”  Saudi officials had “seriously undermined” and delayed Turkey’s efforts to investigate the crime scene at its Istanbul consulate, where Khashoggi had gone to get papers needed for his wedding, she said.  Neither the Saudi government communications office nor Turkey’s foreign ministry gave immediate responses to requests for comment on the report. “CLEAN-UP OF THE CRIMES SCENES” Delayed access to the consulate and residence and “clean up of the crimes scenes”, had severely limited the potential for the Turkish criminal forensic investigation to “produce telling evidence”, Callamard added. After Khashoggi’s first visit to the consulate on Sept 28, Saudi planning included “the travel of the three teams that carried out the operation; the presence of a lookalike of Mr Khashoggi who was seen leaving the consulate; the presence of a forensic doctor; the escape of the teams’ members and, of course, the disposal of Mr. Khashoggi’s body.” It was “unconscionable” that Saudi authorities continued to fail to disclose the whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains, “after having admitted that he met his death within their custody in their consular premises,” she added. Callamard said her team had access to part of “chilling and gruesome audio material” of Khashoggi’s death obtained by the Turkish intelligence agency. She had also been promised access to forensic and police reports critical to her inquiry. A Saudi public prosecutor’s spokesman said late last year that 11 Saudis had been indicted and referred for trial over the case, with authorities seeking the death penalty for five. Saudi Arabia has denied Turkey’s request for extradition of the 11 suspects, amid conflicting claims for jurisdiction, Callamard said. She had “major concerns” about the fairness of the trial proceedings and had sought an official visit to the kingdom. Callamard is due to submits her final report in June to the U.N. Human Rights Council, including recommendations on formal criminal accountability.

2019-02-08,"CUCUTA, Colombia/TIENDITAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Trucks carrying humanitarian aid for crisis-stricken Venezuela arrived in the Colombian border city of Cucuta on Thursday as diplomatically-isolated President Nicolas Maduro appeared set to block its entry amid an escalating political crisis. The arrival of the aid convoy, which includes supplies provided by the United States, has increased the pressure on Maduro hours after a European Union-backed group called for dialogue and elections and warned against interventionism. Maduro has rejected the aid convoy as a “political show” and vowed to remain in office despite dozens of nations around the world disavowing his leadership and recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s rightful head of state. Escorted by police motorcycles, the trucks pulled into Cucuta, where Venezuelans were waiting to see whether Maduro’s government would clear the border road he has blocked and allow the humanitarian shipments to pass. The crowd waved signs denouncing Maduro as a “cancer” and celebrated the arrival of the convoy. “This gives me such hope, especially for the family that I left behind, my children, my wife,” said Israel Escobar, 42, a Venezuelan who came to Cucuta a year ago to sell ice-cream on the streets. “This is one more step towards ending that terrible regime.” Across the border on the Venezuelan side, a group of around 60 protesters demanded that the aid be let through.  Maduro has overseen an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat and fuelled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region. An estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC country since 2015, some 800,000 of whom have ended up in Colombia.  But Maduro showed little sign of relenting on aid, as a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela remained blocked with a cistern and two shipping containers. “The so-called ‘humanitarian aid’ operation is a show, a cheap show, a bad show,” Maduro said in interview with Mexican newspaper La Jornada published on Thursday. “You can be sure that it won’t disturb Venezuela.” On Thursday, he appeared in an event at the presidential palace as part of a campaign by government supporters demanding an end to U.S. aggression against Venezuela. Elliott Abrams, Washington’s special envoy on Venezuela, said the aid effort was being coordinated with Guaido’s team but that the aid would not be forced into Venezuela.  “Let it in, that’s what we’re asking, let it in,” Abrams told reporters at a State Department briefing, calling on members of Venezuela’s armed forces to persuade Maduro to step down or to disobey his orders. He said the supplies would be delivered to Venezuelans when it was “logistically safe” to do so.  Washington last week implemented crippling sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which are expected to exacerbate the hyperinflationary economic crisis. Offering a counter-point to Washington’s hard-line stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that have kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections.  The EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis. EU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini said a resolution ultimately must come from the people of Venezuela. “This is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,” Mogherini said. Maduro via Twitter welcomed the call for dialogue.  Critics have said three previous dialogue processes have allowed the ruling Socialist Party to stall for time without making major concessions on key issues including imprisoned opposition politicians and electoral transparency. Guaido has galvanized the opposition since taking over as head of Venezuela’s National Assembly in January. Last month, he declared himself interim president, opening the door for Washington and others to recognise him as the legitimate leader. Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, has maintained power with the backing of Venezuela’s military. One Venezuelan Air Force general and several Venezuelan diplomats abroad have turned on Maduro and recognised Guaido.  The websites of Venezuelan embassies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico on Thursday posted statements recognising Guaido, which the embassies quickly dismissed as the work of hackers, reiterating “absolute support” for Maduro. The International Monetary Fund, which a new government in Caracas would likely call on for financial assistance, is awaiting guidance from its member countries on whether to recognise Guaido, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers renewed their push on Thursday to penalise Saudi Arabia for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and address the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, introducing legislation to bar some arms sales and impose sanctions on those responsible for his death.  Democrats Bob Menendez, Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Murphy and Republicans Todd Young, Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins introduced the bill one day before the Feb. 8 deadline for President Donald Trump’s administration to submit a report to Congress on whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s killing. Congressional aides said they had been given no indication that the administration would meet that deadline. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, a United Nations-led inquiry into the Khashoggi’s murder said on Thursday that evidence pointed to a brutal crime “planned and perpetrated” by Saudi officials. Among other things, the “Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019” would impose mandatory sanctions on anyone found responsible for the death of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for the Washington Post. Menendez, Graham and other lawmakers had tried to pass similar legislation last year, during the previous Congress, but it failed to advance. The Senate did unanimously pass a resolution blaming bin Salman for Khashoggi’s killing and a measure that would have barred U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen. However, the Republicans who then led the House of Representatives did not allow a vote on the legislation. Trump has resisted legislative efforts to rebuke the Saudis, pointing to weapons sales as an important source of U.S. jobs. His administration is also reluctant to disturb the strategic relationship with the kingdom, seen as an important regional counterbalance to Iran, arch-rival of U.S. ally Israel. Graham, a close Trump ally who nonetheless has led the push for a strong response to Saudi Arabia, said he expected strong bipartisan support for “serious sanctions.”  “While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behaviour of the Crown Prince – in multiple ways – has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him, in my view, beyond toxic,” Graham said in a statement. “I fully realise we have to deal with bad actors and imperfect situations on the international stage. However, when we lose our moral voice, we lose our strongest asset,” Graham added. Democrats now control the House and have been more open to legislation penalizing Saudi Arabia. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on relations with Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, where he opened the door to new restrictions on weapons exports to the kingdom.  Besides putting new limits on weapons sales, the Senate legislation announced on Thursday would bar U.S. refuelling of aircraft for the Saudi-led coalition engaged in the civil war in Yemen. It would also impose sanctions on anyone blocking humanitarian assistance in Yemen, sanction anyone supporting the Iran-backed Houthi rebels fighting Yemen’s internationally recognised government, demand “an accountability report” for anyone involved in the Yemen conflict who commits war crimes, and mandate a report on human rights in Saudi Arabia. “Seeing as the Trump Administration has no intention of insisting on full accountability for Mr. Khashoggi’s murderers, it is time for Congress to step in and impose real consequences to fundamentally reexamine our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and with the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,” Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the world pulled back sharply on Thursday on fears of a global growth slowdown spreading to Europe and renewed worries about any near-term resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions, while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a sixth session. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.10 percent, on pace for its biggest one-day drop in more than a month as it receded from two-month highs reached earlier in the week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.49 percent, as disappointing corporate updates from Publicis and other companies also weighed, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 benchmark index dropped 1.2 percent. The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next on expectations the bloc’s largest countries will be held back by global trade tensions and domestic challenges. Germany’s DAX stock index tumbled 2.7 percent as industrial output in  Europe’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month. Safe-haven assets gained, including Japan’s yen and gold. “Even though we are in the midst of earnings season, the macro environment is really impacting global risk sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago.  “Fears of a more dramatic slowdown in Europe are being joined with the fears around a slowdown in China. And the broad slowdown in global trade is having a direct impact on some of these economies and some of the results.” Heightened concerns about U.S.-China trade relations also rattled investors, including news that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are unlikely to meet before a March 1 deadline set by their governments to reach a trade deal, according to U.S. officials. “Europe kick-started us to the downside this morning and then there was follow-through from the Trump headline and all of a sudden you have an overdue sell-off on your hands,” said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258.8 points, or 1.02 percent, to 25,131.5, the S&P 500 lost 31.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,699.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 99.87 points, or 1.35 percent, to 7,275.41. U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp will buy rival SunTrust Banks Inc for about $28 billion in stock, the biggest bank deal in about a decade. Shares of both banks rose.  The downgrade in European growth expectations filtered into currency markets, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.1353. The dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.1 percent, firming for a sixth session in a row. The dollar’s gains come despite the Federal Reserve’s dovish shift on interest rates last week. “When analysing a currency’s exchange rate, it should be relative to a peer. So far it seems none of these peers have a competitive advantage, making the dollar the less unloved currency,” Hussein Sayed, strategist at forex broker FXTM, said in a note. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.6572 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Wednesday. Oil fell as the market confronted concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year. U.S. crude fell 2.44 percent to $52.69 per barrel and Brent was last at $61.70, down 1.58 percent on the day.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition on Wednesday said it would use a U.S.-based fund to receive some of the country’s oil income in a key step to bankroll its efforts to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.  The fund would receive income accrued by state-run oil firm PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] since last month, when U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters. Guadio, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, last month declared himself to be the South American country’s interim ruler. White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the United States would consider lifting sanctions on senior Venezuelan military officers if they recognise Guaido as interim leader. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely,” Bolton wrote on Twitter. Aside from one senior general, who recognised Guaido in a video and urged others in the military to do the same, most of Venezuela’s top military officers have not defected from Maduro. Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela’s top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug of war as the United States has made aggressive moves to remove it from Maduro’s control and imposed sanctions on OPEC-member Venezuela’s oil industry. “This is already quite advanced, I hope that next week it can be announced by our representative in the United States,” Paparoni said, though he did not give details about the nature of the U.S.-based fund or the financial institution involved. Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation. Maduro was re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham. Yon Goicoechea, a member of Guaido’s policy team, told Reuters that Guaido was in contact with PDVSA’s international partners and they were willing to keep operating in Venezuela. He did not identify the partners. Guaido’s team is planning for a post-Maduro government with an emergency arrangement to supply fuel domestically, given widespread shortages across Venezuela, Goicoechea said. Most Latin American and European countries also recognise Guaido, although Italy so far has not. Guaido has reached out to Italy’s ruling coalition seeking its support. Maduro, who retains control over the state, denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him. He is supported by China and Russia, while Slovakia on Wednesday joined Italy in defying the coordinated action of European Union nations and the United States. The opposition has also sought to prevent the government from selling gold, believing that it is using the proceeds to try to stay solvent as the sanctions cut off other revenue streams.  But Maduro’s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led National Assembly, Paparoni told a news conference. Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital bought the largest amount, 27.3 tonnes of gold, and a Turkish firm bought 23.9 tonnes, Paparoni said. “We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold,” Paparoni said. Venezuela had gold reserves of 132 tonnes between the central bank’s vaults and the Bank of England at the end of November, according to central bank data. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Noor Capital said it “does not engage in any illegal or prohibited transactions.” In recent days, at least five tankers carrying gasoline, gasoil for power generation and naphtha have been ordered to unload at Venezuela’s ports as fuel inventories dwindle. PDVSA issued court orders for most of the tankers to discharge, according to shipping and PDVSA sources.       Guaido asked Italy’s ruling coalition leaders in a letter to meet with his representatives as he seeks their explicit backing. Italy’s hard-right League has expressed strong support for Guaido, but coalition partner the 5-Star Movement has not, making Italy the only major European Union nation not to recognise him as Venezuela’s interim head of state. League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s office on Wednesday said he would meet Guaido’s envoys on Feb. 11. As the world’s countries line up to support either Maduro or Guaido, the United Nations warned against using aid as a pawn. The United States has sent food and medicine to Venezuela’s border, even though it is unclear how it will get past the objections of Maduro. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. The International Committee of the Red Cross has doubled its budget in Venezuela in recent weeks and is also helping Venezuelan migrants in neighbouring Colombia and Brazil, ICRC President Peter Maurer said in Geneva.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is ready to have a closer relationship with the United Kingdom after Brexit so that the contentious Irish border backstop would never have to be used, the Brexit pointman for the bloc’s parliament said.  Speaking after he met British Prime Minister Theresa May, in Brussels to demand that the backstop is removed from the Brexit deal, Guy Verhofstadt said the bloc could only upgrade the accompanying declaration on their new relationship. “It’s important that Mrs. May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop,” Verhofstadt told journalists.    “Our proposal is to try to solve the problem in the political declaration.” Verhofstadt said a no-deal Brexit would spell “disaster” in both the UK and the EU and that May’s cooperation with Britain’s opposition Labour party - which wants a permanent customs union with the bloc after Brexit - was essential to overcoming that risk. “It’s important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation,” Verhofstadt said. “If we go towards a customs union, the backstop will never be used.” EU leaders have repeatedly said it would be impossible to replace the backstop, because it is required to ensure no hard border, once a focus for sectarian violence, between Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS/ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens and Alstom’s plan to create a European rail champion collapsed on Wednesday after EU regulators blocked the deal, prompting Germany and France to call for an overhaul of EU competition policy to better meet global challenges. The European Commission also rejected a bid by German copper company Wieland-Werke AG to buy a business unit from Aurubis, Europe’s biggest copper smelter, similarly arguing the deal could have pushed up prices for consumers.  The two vetoes are likely to spur efforts by France and Germany to loosen EU competition rules so as to take a more global than solely European view of mergers and potentially to allow EU ministers to have a say. Shortly after the Commission’s announcements, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules to facilitate large cross-border mergers. France’s Alstom said the veto was a clear set-back for industry in Europe, while Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of Germany’s Siemens, said Europe urgently needed to reform its industrial policy to help its companies compete. “Protecting customer interests locally must not mean that Europe cannot be on a level playing field with leading nations like China, the United States and others,” Kaeser said in a statement. Proponents of the bloc’s strict merger regime, however, argue such changes could lead to opaque and unpredictable rules. The Commission has approved over 3,000 mergers in the past 10 years and blocked only nine, including those on Wednesday. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager dismissed Siemens and Alstom’s argument about merging to compete with their bigger Chinese state-owned rival CRRC in the European market. “We don’t see the Chinese coming. The Chinese are nowhere, not at all in Europe,” she told a news conference. Shares in Siemens were little changed by the announcement, which was widely expected. However, Alstom stock gained more than 4 percent. Broker Berenberg said the market had been overly focused on the potential benefits of the rail merger, and ignoring that Alstom’s earnings could double by 2025. Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge told reporters the company was looking into new avenues for expansion, saying future growth would be “more organic”. (Graphic: Alstom and Siemens shares  link: tmsnrt.rs/2I3mEHg). Siemens and Alstom had wanted to combine their rail operations to compete more effectively with CRRC globally, backed by the French and German governments, which favour creating industrial champions. However, Vestager said she blocked the deal to protect competition in the European railway industry. “Without sufficient remedies, this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signalling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high-speed trains,” she said. In the copper case, Vestager said rolled copper would become even more important in an age of electrical vehicles. She said the companies in both deals were not willing adequately to address the regulator’s competition concerns and their concessions fell short. The rail deal also triggered criticism from national competition agencies in Germany, Britain, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands. Siemens makes the ICE trains for Deutsche Bahn and also builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Alstom is the manufacturer of France’s signature bullet train, locally known as the TGV. The rolling-stock maker also sells urban and suburban trains as well as signalling systems. Canadian rival Bombardier welcomed the Commission’s decision. “It would have severely undermined the health and competitiveness of the whole European rail market, leaving European consumers, both as rail users and tax payers, to pay the price,” said Daniel Desjardins, Bombardier general counsel and company secretary. Bombardier, which sources say also held talks with Siemens in 2017, would have faced a rival with operations more than  double its size in the European market, even though the merged group, in revenue terms, would only have been half the size of CRRC.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The European Commission’s decision to block a tie-up between Alstom and Germany’s Siemens is fuelling speculation over possible merger talks between the French rail business and Canada’s Bombardier, lifting both companies’ shares on Wednesday. EU anti-trust regulators rejected the Alstom-Siemens deal, saying that it would have hurt competition and led to higher prices for consumers, despite concessions offered by the companies. The deal’s collapse helped Bombardier avoid the creation of the world’s second largest rail company that would be roughly twice its size.  It also gives the Canadian plane and train maker “a better set of options,” when weighing strategies like potential mergers, said Toronto-based AltaCorp analyst Chris Murray. “Ultimately the need to consolidate in the industry has not gone away.” Rail companies are eyeing consolidation to reduce costs through scale in a market dominated by China’s state-owned CRRC, the world’s largest train maker. Following the news, Berenberg analysts upgraded Alstom to a ‘buy’ rating and set a new price target of 42 euros ($47.9), noting that Alstom may now seek an alternative deal with Bombardier’s Berlin-based transportation division.  “We believe there is a higher chance for anti-trust approval than the Siemens/Alstom tie-up due to lower European market share in high speed rail and signalling,” Berenberg said in a note to clients. Bombardier aims to turn its transportation unit, the company’s largest division by revenues, into a $10 billion business by 2020, even as it sheds money-losing plane programs. Sources, including French officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, agreed that a potential Alstom-Bombardier merger would likely face less resistance from regulators, but one noted that such a deal could require divestitures in France. Still, a potential Alstom-Bombardier merger would have less strategic value than a tie-up with Siemens, which is strong in higher-margin signalling assets, the sources said.  Bombardier, which wants to grow its signalling business, is strong in lower-margin rolling stock, with “Alstom a bit in between,” the French officials added. “If you merge Alstom with Bombardier, you end up with a lot of ‘iron’ put together” one of the officials said. Bombardier, which held its own failed merger talks with Siemens in 2017, would not specifically discuss future prospects or say how the collapse of the Alstom-Siemens tie-up impacts the company. “We will keep looking at opportunities to create the best value for our shareholders,” Bombardier said in a statement. An Alstom spokesman said any future rail consolidation in Europe would be examined in light of the failed Siemens-Alstom tie-up. “If the rules do not change, it is difficult to imagine the consolidation of our sector in Europe.” Alstom stock in Paris was up 4 percent at 2:32 p.m. EST (1932 GMT) after hitting its highest since Dec. 18, while Siemens shares in Frankfurt were down 0.96 percent. Bombardier shares rose more than 7 percent in early afternoon trading in Toronto.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany will seek to reform competition law during its European Union presidency in 2020, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday, hours after antitrust regulators blocked a rail deal between Siemens and Alstom. The European Commission said the deal would have hurt competition and led to higher prices for consumers, dismissing the companies’ argument that it would help them better compete against Chinese rival CRRC. Following the EU veto, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said that Europe should look at changing its rules to facilitate cross-border mergers and create European champions which can compete with rivals from China and the United States. Altmaier launched a committee of antitrust experts last year to modernise German and European competition law with the goal of safeguarding Germany’s competitiveness. The committee has identified several themes to look into such as whether antitrust laws need to be amended to enable internationally competitive digital companies. But the moves have concerned some and fears of being left behind China and the United States with their different antitrust frameworks should not drive the debate in Europe, Peter Alexiadis, a partner at Gibson Dunn said. “The EU is a thought leader in antitrust, and has been for a number of years. There is no reason why it should not continue to do so, especially in combination with international fora such as the OECD. In a global marketplace, unilateralism will get us nowhere in the field of antitrust,” he said. Still, there is room for updating the rules, he said. “We probably need to move away from the straightjacket of concerns about short term price rises and develop our views about an idea of consumer welfare that is more dynamic and more consistent with important emerging public policy values common across all EU Member State political cultures,” Alexiadis said. Another issue being looked at by the committee is whether the antitrust regime needs to allow for more innovation and investment in key technologies. The committee will also examine whether competition laws can be integrated with consumer protection and consumer protection laws. The committee is due to present proposals later this year. Changes in EU merger rules need to be approved by all 28 EU countries and consent from European Parliament.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp’s quarterly profit edged up as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset bleak North American sales, although the firm’s shares slipped as it cut its annual net income outlook.  Japan’s biggest automaker attributed the smaller forecast to unrealised losses from equity investments, but, in an indication that business was still strong, it kept its full-year operating profit view unchanged at 2.4 trillion yen (16.9 billion pounds). The automaker posted Asian sales of 464,000 units in the third quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier, as strong demand in China for its cheap-and-cheerful Corolla and Levin sedans continued into the end of 2018.  Popularity of its luxury Lexus brand also helped it buck a broader slowdown in the world’s biggest auto market.  Toyota’s global sales rose 2.8 percent to 2.71 million units with Asia making up for the slack in North America, where its sales slid 7.5 percent to 680,000 units. “When one region is underperforming, other regions can compensate for that weakness. Likewise, when some vehicle models are underperforming, other models can compensate,” Executive Vice President Shigeki Tomoyama told reporters at a briefing. “It’s a work in process, but as we diversify our markets and our models, little by little we’re starting to see this happen.” Toyota shares dropped as much as 1.5 percent on Wednesday, but recovered slightly to end down 0.7 percent in a broader market that was mostly steady. For an interactive chart on Toyota's operating profit, vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2Ro1enH Toyota has been hit hard in the United States by slowing sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and the Camry, as well as by its steep discounting to boost sales over the past two years as overall demand stagnates. In contrast, the Corolla, Levin and Camry were Toyota’s top three selling models in China in 2018, outselling larger ones like the RAV4 SUV crossover, as buyers reined in expenses amid an economic slowdown exacerbated by a Sino-U.S. trade war. For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' vehicle sales in the U.S., China, see tmsnrt.rs/2RjnBuA Toyota sold 1.47 million vehicles in China in 2018, up 14 percent, and aims to lift sales to 1.6 million this year, even as it and other automakers brace for another tough year there. Auto sales in China last year contracted for the first time since the 1990s, hurt by the phasing out of purchase tax cuts on smaller cars and the trade war. The world’s No.2 economy grew at its slowest in almost three decades in 2018, and the pace is expected to weaken further this year. But Japanese automakers, such as Toyota, Honda and Nissan, are expected to benefit from warming political ties between Tokyo and Beijing at a time when the Sino-U.S. trade war is weighing on rivals such as Ford. However, niche players such as Japan’s Mazda Motor have not been able to escape the broader China weakness. Mazda’s China sales sank 36 percent to 62,000 units in the third quarter, due partly to bleak sales of its Axela sedan that is priced slightly above than sold by many of its competitors.   Mazda’s global sales fell 7 percent, but the lower-volume automaker still raised its annual earnings view as its quarterly operating profit dropped less than expected. For an interactive chart on Japanese automakers' annual global vehicle sales, see tmsnrt.rs/2RnFOr2 Toyota cut its full-year net profit forecast by about 19 percent to 1.87 trillion yen. It did not say which investments hit its net profit, but it is a major shareholder in Subaru, whose shares tumbled more than 30 percent in 2018, and Akebono Brake Industry, whose shares tanked 40 percent. Toyota booked an operating profit of 676.1 billion yen for the third quarter, slightly below the market’s average estimate of 680.8 billion, according to Refinitiv, but up 0.4 percent from a year earlier.

2019-02-08,"KAKRIPUR/MAHABAN, India (Reuters) - As night fell on the bucolic northern Indian hamlet of Mahaban, Gopi Chand Yadav gathered blankets and a flashlight to spend the night sitting on a wooden platform in his field. His task: to use bamboo sticks to ward off stray cattle from intruding and eating a maturing mustard crop. Like Yadav, many thousands of farmers stay awake to guard their farms over a cold winter or face losing their crops to the cattle - a double whammy for growers already reeling from a plunge in Indian crop prices. While stray cows ambling around towns and villages have always been a feature of life in rural India, farmers say their number has increased sharply in recent years to the extent that they have become a menace, and blame the policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government. Protecting cows - considered sacred to Hindus - was one of the measures meant to shore up support in the heavily populated, Hindi-speaking belt across northern India that has been a heartland of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP). Instead, it is creating a backlash, even among Hindu farmers.  “We already had enough problems and now the government has created one more,” said octogenarian farmer Baburao Saini from Kakripur village, about 85 kilometres (50 miles) from New Delhi. “For the first time, we’ve been forced to stay in the fields to protect our crops.”     More than 50 farmers Reuters spoke to in Mahaban and nine other villages in Uttar Pradesh state said they would think twice before voting for Modi’s BJP in the next general election, due by May. The cattle issue and low farm prices are major reasons behind their disillusionment with a party that most say they voted for in the last election in 2014. Modi swept Uttar Pradesh at that poll, winning 73 of 80 seats in India’s most populous state, with rural voters swayed by a promise of higher crop prices, and as Hindu farmers supported the BJP amid tensions with the minority Muslim community. Modi is trying hard to claw back support among India’s 263 million farmers and their many millions of dependents after the BJP lost power in December to the opposition Congress in three big northern states where agriculture is a mainstay. Indian farmers keep cows to produce milk, cheese and butter, but to harm or kill a cow, especially for food, is considered taboo by most Hindus. Most states in India have long outlawed cow slaughter, but after coming to power in 2014 the BJP ratcheted up its distaste for trade in cattle, launching a crackdown on unlicensed abattoirs in Uttar Pradesh and on cattle smuggling nationwide. At the same time, a wave of attacks on trucks carrying cattle by Hindu vigilante groups has scared away traders, most of whom are Muslims, bringing to a halt the trade even in bullocks, which are not considered sacred. Rising sales of tractors and increasing mechanisation mean that more animals are redundant for use in farming. The farmers Reuters spoke to said they revered cows as most devout Hindus would, but a sudden halt in the trade of cattle had hit the rural economy. In their view, the government should come up with more cow shelters and let cattle traders deal in other animals without fear of attack. “The government has only enforced the laws by closing down unlicensed abattoirs and cracking down on cattle smuggling,” said BJP spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal, who added that he runs a cow shelter of 1,300 cattle. “We’re not trying to hurt either any community or the rural economy.” Fodder prices have gone up by more than a third in the past year and most farmers cannot afford to keep cows after they stop producing milk, said farmer Rajesh Pahalwan as he smoked a hookah pipe in the village of Manoharpur. Six farmers sitting with him mainly nodded in agreement. In India, the world’s biggest milk producer, about 3 million cattle become unproductive every year. In the past, Hindu farmers would sell unproductive cows to Muslim traders and about 2 million of these would end up smuggled to Bangladesh for meat and leather. But that trade has now been throttled by the government crackdown, trade and industry officials say. That has led to many unproductive cattle being abandoned, farmers said, but governments - both state and federal - have failed to construct new shelters, leaving rising numbers of stray cattle that are feeding on crops, or even garbage. “The government clearly did not think of alternatives before putting these curbs in place,” said farmer Deepak Chaudhary, who grows wheat on the outskirts of Mathura, considered to be the birthplace of the Hindu God Krishna. “As Hindus, we treat cows as sacred but these unwarranted measures have upended the economics of farming.” The government did provide some relief in its interim budget last week as it announced a cow welfare programme costing 7.50 billion rupees (80.79 million pounds) in the year beginning April. But there are hardly any “adequate measures to rehabilitate” cattle, said Fauzan Alvi, vice-president of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association. “Forget about cows, we cannot sell even a single animal to even our relatives thanks to cow vigilante groups which are aided and abetted by the BJP,” said the wheat farmer Chaudhary. Modi has in the past condemned violence by cow vigilantes, but critics and opposition politicians say some of the right-wing Hindu groups involved have links to his party, a charge the BJP denies. Nearly 85 percent of India’s farmers own less than 2 hectares (5 acres) of land, so even a relatively small area damaged has a big impact on their livelihood. Only two weeks ago, some cattle ravaged an acre of wheat grown by farmer Chandra Pal in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. “My investment went down the drain after some stray cattle trampled and ate up the crop,” he said. Many farmers in Uttar Pradesh are now using barbed wire to stop animals from entering their farms, but that is expensive.  “We have been at the receiving end of anti-farmer policies of the government and the problem of stray cattle is just another blow to us,” said farmer Amar Chand, from Maholi village who voted for Modi in 2014. “Unlike the previous general election, farmers are not solidly behind Modi, who’s on shaky ground this time round.” Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav and Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Martin Howell and Alex Richardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-election-cattle-insight/stray-cows-add-to-modis-farmer-woes-as-indian-election-looms-idUKKCN1PV04C,2019-02-08,"As night fell on the bucolic northern Indian hamlet of Mahaban, Gopi Chand Yadav gathered blankets and a flashlight to spend the night sitting on a wooden platform in his field.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump asked U.S. Congress in his State of the Union address on Tuesday to pass legislation to boost the nation’s ageing infrastructure, without providing details on how to go about paying for it or how much it would cost. Trump, who vowed in 2016 as a candidate to back $1 trillion of infrastructure spending over 10 years, was vague about his plans. “Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure,” Trump said in his speech. “I know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a necessity.” Trump did not put a price tag on the effort, in contrast to his 2018 State of the Union address when he called on Congress “to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.” A number of administration officials, including Acting Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler, will be holding events around the country this week to discuss infrastructure, while a U.S. House panel will hold a hearing on infrastructure needs on Thursday. In February 2018, Trump asked Congress to authorise $200 billion in federal money over 10 years to spur road, bridge and other projects mostly funded by states, cities and the private sector.  That plan was roundly criticized and never voted on in Congress, which was then controlled by Republicans. Democrats now control the House of Representatives and are demanding that Trump back new revenue as a condition of moving forward with an infrastructure plan. Reuters reported last month that the administration was considering an infrastructure plan for as long as 13 years. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure, said on Tuesday he has been holding discussions with administration officials about an infrastructure plan. DeFazio says the United States has at least $2 trillion in infrastructure needs, including 140,000 bridges that need substantial attention and 40 percent of the nation’s highways that need to be rebuilt. “It is past time to make these investments,” DeFazio said. “We are in a crisis.” DeFazio’s committee will hear Thursday from Amtrak chief executive Richard Anderson, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Democrats previously proposed raising $500 billion by issuing 30-year bonds and using revenue from indexing fuel taxes to rise with inflation.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A bank in Portugal has blocked Venezuela’s attempt to transfer $1.2 billion (927 million pounds) to Uruguay, a lawmaker said on Tuesday as the opposition to President Nicolas Maduro warned of the theft of public funds, while the United States sent food and medical aid to the Venezuelan-Colombian border.  Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation, with the United States and a growing number of other nations recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president.  Pope Francis on Tuesday expressed willingness for the Vatican to mediate Venezuela’s mounting crisis if both sides seek it. Russia, which along with China has backed Maduro in the crisis, underscored its view that the crisis can be resolved only with negotiations between the government and opposition. Guaido, who declared himself interim president last month, is scheduled to meet later on Tuesday with business leaders at Venezuela’s main business group, Fedecamaras, to discuss an economic recovery plan under a future transition government in the OPEC-member South American country. Maduro’s adversaries have warned that Venezuelan officials are seeking to drain state coffers ahead of a potential change of government. Portugal-based Novo Banco halted the $1.2 billion transfer of Venezuelan government financial assets to Uruguayan banks, legislator Carlos Paparoni said during a congressional session, a day after Guaido said authorities were trying to move funds. “I’m pleased to inform the Venezuelan people that this transaction has until now been halted, protecting the resources of all Venezuelans,” Paparoni said. Venezuela’s Information Ministry, which handles all media inquiries, did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Lisbon-based Novo Banco, which is 75 percent-owned by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star Funds, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Major European nations including Britain, Germany, France and Spain joined the United States on Monday in recognising Guaido, while members of a separate regional bloc, the so-called Lima Group, kept the political heat on Maduro. In power since former President Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013, Maduro has been accused by critics of running the OPEC nation of 30 million people like a dictatorship. Critics have called last year’s disputed presidential vote in which Maduro won re-election a sham, and the mainstream opposition boycotted it. Trucks carrying food and medical supplies sent by the United States to be stockpiled until it can be brought into Venezuela will arrive later this week at Guaido’s request and will be prepositioned at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta, U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan said.  It is unclear how the supplies will get into Venezuela without Maduro’s blessing and cooperation of the Venezuelan military, which has remained loyal to his government and is stationed on the Venezuelan side of the border. The pope, speaking to reporters aboard his plane while returning from a trip to Abu Dhabi, confirmed that Maduro had written a letter to him but said he had not yet read it. Maduro told Italian broadcaster Sky TG24 on Monday that he had sent the letter to the pope “for help in the process of facilitating and reinforcing dialogue.” Asked about a possible direct mediation effort by the Vatican, the pope said, “I will read the letter and see what can be done, but the initial condition is that both sides ask for it. We are willing.” Given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to address the Venezuela situation in his annual State of the Union address in Washington later on Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Venezuela crisis could be solved only by getting the authorities and  opposition to talk to each other, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. “We continue to believe that the only way to exit this crisis is by sitting the government and opposition down at the negotiating table,” Lavrov was quoted as saying by RIA. “Otherwise it will simply be the same regime change that the West had done many times.” Reporting by Vivian Sequera and Angus Berwick in Caracas; Additional reporting by Sérgio Gonçalves in Lisbon, Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Katya Golubkova in Moscow; and Philip Pullella aboard the papal plane; Writing by Will Dunham; Editing by Paul Simao",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics/venezuelas-funds-transfer-blocked-opposition-lawmaker-says-idUKKCN1PU2C0,2019-02-08,,"Venezuela's funds transfer blocked, opposition lawmaker says"
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s parliament on Tuesday passed a bill aimed at curbing violent protests in response to three months of anti-government demonstrations by the grassroots “yellow vests” movement. Despite criticism that the law could curb civil liberties, it passed the lower house, the national assembly, by 387 votes to 92 thanks to the comfortable majority enjoyed by President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist LREM party. It will now be discussed in the upper house, but the assembly has the last word. The “anti-casseurs” (anti-hooligan) law bans protesters from hiding their faces, gives police greater powers to extract potential trouble-makers from demonstrations, and grants local authorities the right to ban individual protesters. The “yellow vest” movement erupted in November as a protest against fuel taxes but has morphed into a broader revolt against inequality and Macron’s presidency. It takes its name from the fluorescent vests that motorists in France carry in their cars. Rioters ran amok in Paris during the early street protests, torching cars, smashing luxury boutiques and defacing the Arc de Triomphe. It was among the worst violence the capital has experienced since a 1968 student uprising.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. officials said on Tuesday that foreign actors did not have a significant impact on computer systems and other equipment underpinning the November 2018 congressional elections, despite reports of hacking attempts. The statement by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security contrasted with U.S. officials’ view that the 2016 presidential election was the target of a sophisticated Russian hacking and propaganda campaign to help Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hilary Clinton. The two agencies said the U.S. government has found no evidence that foreign governments or agents had an impact last November, when Democrats won control of the House of Representatives.  Neither political campaigns nor electronic voting machines or other infrastructure was significantly affected, they said in a joint statement. They declined to provide further details. U.S. prosecutors are investigating whether President Donald Trump’s campaign worked with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election. Trump has denied any collusion, and Moscow has also denied involvement. Security experts have warned for years that U.S. election infrastructure — voting machines, voter registries and other computer systems — could be manipulated to change vote tallies or prevent people from casting ballots.  The 2016 election also illustrated how hackers can compromise candidates by releasing internal emails and other sensitive documents, and by working to sway public opinion through social media. Ahead of the November 2018 election, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials warned that foreign actors were continuing their manipulation efforts. Prosecutors charged a Russian national with participating in a Kremlin-backed plan to interfere in the election. Congress approved $380 million last year to help safeguard voting systems and federal officials worked with the state and local governments that administer elections to limit their exposure to interference.   Some state and local governments reported attempts to access their networks ahead of the November 2018 election, but U.S. officials said they were able to prevent or limit access. On the night of the Nov. 6 election, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there were no signs that voting systems had been breached.  The National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect Republican candidates, said it was the target of a hacking attempt last year. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, running for re-election in West Virginia, also said his social-media accounts had been hacked. U.S. intelligence officials warned last week that Russia and China are already targeting the 2020 presidential election.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jurors in the U.S. trial of accused Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman began their second day of deliberations in a federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday. Guzman, 61, is accused of leading Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, which became one of the most powerful drug trafficking organizations in the world. He twice escaped from prison in Mexico, and will face the possibility of life in a U.S. prison if convicted. The 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named for the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.     Prosecutors said he trafficked tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels. The defence argued that Guzman was set up as a “fall guy” by Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large. The 12 jurors began deliberating on Monday afternoon after receiving instructions from U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan. They are seven women and five men whose names have not been disclosed for security reasons.  At least three jurors are immigrants, three are Spanish speakers and several have ties to law enforcement.  Almost all of them had heard of Guzman before the trial began, but said they could be impartial. The only exception was a woman from Ethiopia who said she had “no clue” who he was. The jury sent the judge two notes with legal questions on Monday afternoon.  In the first, they asked whether a “drug war” could be considered “part of a drug trafficking crime with specific reference to the weapons charge.” Jurors heard extensive testimony about deadly wars between Guzman and rival drug traffickers during the trial. One of the 10 criminal counts Guzman faces is that he used weapons in furtherance of his drug crimes. Cogan told the jury they could not consider the weapons charge until they had found Guzman guilty of one of four drug-related counts. He said they were free to consider evidence of drug wars while weighing those counts.  In the second note, the jury asked whether “ephedrine is considered methamphetamine.” Witnesses in the case testified that ephedrine is one of the ingredients used to make methamphetamine. Cogan told the jurors that they would have to refer to the evidence in the case.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - HMV, the British music retailer that collapsed after Christmas, has been sold to the owner of Canada’s Sunrise Records in a deal that will save 100 stores and 1,487 jobs, its joint administrators said on Tuesday. Sunrise Records CEO Doug Putman said he was delighted to acquire “the most iconic music and entertainment business in the UK”, and would aim to replicate his company’s success in Canada. The administrators said 27 stores were not included in the deal and would close immediately, resulting in 455 redundancies. HMV, Britain’s best known record store chain, has been hit by competition from online rivals and music streaming services. The group, which opened its flagship store on London’s Oxford Street in 1921, was rescued from a previous collapse in 2013 by restructuring specialist Hilco, but it collapsed again in December, blaming a 30 percent fall in the DVD market. Putnam, the owner of toy and games distributor Everest Toys, said however that physical music and entertainment formats had a future, and he would aim to replicate the success of Sunrise Records, which he bought in 2014. “We know the physical media business is here to stay and we greatly appreciate all the support from the suppliers, landlords, employees and most importantly our customers,” he said on Tuesday.

Deloitte said its Real Estate Crane Survey, covering Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and Belfast, showed sustained or increased activity across sectors including offices, hotels, retail, education and student housing. Manchester had 78 sites under construction — more than the U.S. cities of Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago as measured by Deloitte’s North American Crane Index. “To have construction figures this healthy is somewhat of a surprise given a myriad of market uncertainties,” Deloitte Real Estate partner and regional head Simon Bedford said. The Deloitte survey struck a more upbeat note than the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers’ Index for the construction sector which on Monday showed the slowest growth in the industry in January since the winter weather of early 2018. Bedford said big businesses were looking to build support operations in regional cities while small and medium-sized regional businesses were continuing to grow.

2019-02-08,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - A major bloc of Latin American nations and Canada will discuss on Monday how to maintain pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to hold new elections as he faces widespread calls to resign after last year’s disputed presidential vote. Sources briefed on the matter said that the 14-nation Lima Group looked set, though, to hold off imposing further sanctions on the Maduro government when it meets in Ottawa. Most group members say Maduro should quit in favour of opposition leader Juan Guaido - who declared himself interim president last month - and are calling for a new presidential election in the troubled OPEC nation. The United States, which is not a member of the group, also wants Maduro gone. “How can we continue to support the opposition to keep the pressure up on the regime and push for new elections? Certainly that’s something we’ll be looking at,” said a Canadian government official. Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse and the exodus of millions of Venezuelans, said in an interview that aired on Spanish television channel Antena 3 on Sunday: “We don’t accept ultimatums from anyone,” adding: “I refuse to call for elections now - there will be elections in 2024.” Maduro, who has maintained the critical support of the military, has said Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. Monday’s meeting in Ottawa will also discuss how to aid the people of Venezuela, including through immediate humanitarian assistance, said the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Last month, the Lima Group announced a travel ban on senior Venezuelan officials and a freeze on their foreign assets. The Canadian source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, declined to comment when asked whether more punitive measures could be imposed. Two sources briefed on the talks said such an announcement was unlikely for now. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration last week issued sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA in a move likely to cut revenues for a country hit by medicine shortages and malnutrition. Trump, in an interview that aired on Sunday, said military intervention in Venezuela was “an option.” Trudeau spoke on Sunday to Guaido and the two “discussed the importance of the international community sending a clear message regarding the illegitimacy of the Maduro regime,” Trudeau’s office said. The challenge for participants is that Mexico, a member of the Lima Group, opposes any measures to oust Maduro, who also has the backing of Russia, China and Turkey. While European Union governments will soon move to recognise Guaido as interim president, members are set to use cautious language for fear of setting a precedent for political crises, said diplomatic sources. That does not sit well with nations such as Columbia, which neighbours Venezuela. “The most important issue now is to get Europe in line and to deepen the isolation of Venezuela and its backers,” said a government official in Bogota, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel share a responsibility to work towards global peace and prosperity, with both hoping for a prompt, democratic solution to Venezuela’s leadership crisis. Merkel, on a two-day visit to Japan, said that Germany recognises opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation’s interim president, joining many European nations, and said he should organise new elections as soon as possible. “Guaido is the person with whom we are talking and who we expect to initiate an election process as quickly as possible, and he is the legitimate interim president for this task from the German perspective and also from the perspective of many European partners,” Merkel told a news conference with Abe. “And we hope that this process is as short as possible and of course peaceful,” she added. Abe emphasized his cooperation with Merkel during a visit aimed a forging an “alliance of multilateralists” to resist U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach to trade and China’s pursuit of narrow national interests. “Our responsibility towards working for global prosperity and security has merely increased,” he said, adding that the two leaders would work for a global order “based on rules.” Merkel referred to an EU-Japan trade deal that entered into force on Feb. 1, saying: “All in all, a trip at a time in which we have demonstrated that, even at times when multilateral agreements are in difficult straits, we are ready to conclude such things.” “..very good win-win situations can occur when all partners talk to each other. Of course, fairness and reciprocity are part of this, but that is what we advocate.”  Abe did not comment on Guaido’s status, but he said Japan wanted a stable, democratic and prompt solution to Venezuela’s political crisis. Several European nations have joined the United States in recognising Guaido as interim president, intensifying a global showdown over Nicolas Maduro’s socialist rule. Merkel said Germany would do everything possible to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but she did not want to see Britain’s divorce deal with the EU - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - renegotiated. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would seek a “pragmatic solution” to a parliamentary impasse over the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union when she tries to reopen talks with Brussels less than two months before Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29. “There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market, even when Northern Ireland isn’t part of it because it is part of Britain, while at the same time meeting the desire to have if possible no border controls,” Merkel said. “To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted,” she added. “We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreement if everyone shows good will.” Reporting by Elaine Lies; additional reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; editing by Darren Schuettler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-germany/japan-germany-share-responsibility-to-work-towards-global-peace-pm-abe-idUKKCN1PT0XO,2019-02-08,,"Japan, Germany share responsibility to work towards global peace - PM Abe"

2019-02-08,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - A special government-appointed inquiry excoriated Australia’s financial sector for misconduct on Monday, referring two dozen cases to regulators for possible legal action but leaving the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. Regulators will be subjected to a new oversight body and the financial industry’s pay will be overhauled to remove conflicts of interest, according to the recommendations of the so-called Royal Commission. But the recommendations stopped short of measures that would threaten the A$400 billion (222 billion pounds) industry’s dominant position. The recommendations come after the public inquiry heard 11 months of shocking revelations of the financial industry’s wrongdoing, including that fees were charged to the accounts of dead people and that cash bribes were paid over the counter to win mortgage business, wiping A$60 billion from the country’s top finance stocks.  The conservative government, which was initially opposed to the setting up of the inquiry, promised it would act on all the 76 recommendations. While the changes are likely to make the financial sector more liable to be punished for violations, banks in the world’s fourteenth-biggest economy have been spared any enforced breakup or interference in the way they choose to lend money. The inquiry said it would be costly and disruptive to separate banks providing products and advice. “I don’t know that it was a missed opportunity but a lot of people were thinking that he would force structural separation,” said Pamela Hanrahan, a professor of commercial law at University of New South Wales, who advised the inquiry, referring to its Commissioner Kenneth Hayne. “There are parts of the community that might have expected the commissioner to go in a bit harder ... but he has left a very clear pathway for whomever is in government and for the industry to think about what they need to change.” The inquiry recommended sweeping changes to the business and pay models of mortgage and insurance broking, financial advice and pension fund management. Authorities were urged to consider laying charges for misconduct like charging fees for services not rendered, including instances at major lenders Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. Misconduct reached into the sector’s upper echelons, with top wealth manager AMP Ltd engaging in board-level deception of a regulator over the deliberate charging of customers for financial advice it never gave. Firms were found to prey on some of society’s most vulnerable customers, highlighted by the case of an insurer who used aggressive sales techniques to sell an opaque product to a young man with Down Syndrome. “The price paid by our community has been immense and goes beyond just the financial. Businesses have been broken, and the emotional stress and personal pain have broken lives,” Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said. The recommendations included banning trailing commissions for mortgage brokers, forcing financial planners to disclose any fees they receive for selling products, and banning banks from charging default interest for farm businesses affected by drought. Regulators also needed greater oversight after they were accused of working too closely with the banks. When misconduct was revealed, it either went unpunished or the consequences did not reflect the seriousness of what had been done, the inquiry found. Australia’s corporate regulator said in response to the report that it would prioritise serious matters referred to it by the Royal Commission for possible prosecutions. Ahead of the report’s release, which came after the close of market trading in Sydney, shares in the “Big Four” banks closed up about 1 percent as investors looked forward to some certainty around the new regulatory framework. However, wealth managers, whose reputations were shredded in the inquiry, were punished with IOOF Holdings Ltd stock closing down 4.5 percent and AMP sliding to a record low. The broader market closed 0.5 percent higher. “The key macro issue we have been interested in is if this was going to further reduce the banks’ willingness to lend, which would be a further headwind to the economy which is already under some pressure,” said Andrew Ticehurst, a strategist at Nomura. “At this stage, it does not appear to be the case. It would be a bit milder than expected.” Fallout from the Royal Commission has already prompted banks to tighten lending practices in their core mortgage businesses, contributing to some of the biggest housing price falls in a generation. The report comes ahead of an election expected in May in which falling house prices could be a hot-button issue. The government is fighting for its survival with opinion polls suggesting an election victory for the centre-left Labour party.   Labour says it expects to adopt all the commission’s recommendations. While Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also said he will take up the recommendations, he has warned against overreaching and cutting off credit flows.   The report from Hayne, a former High Court justice, found that the industry’s problems were exacerbated by an unwillingness to accept responsibility. “That is, there remains a reluctance in some entities to form and then to give practical effect to their understanding of what is ethical, of what is efficient, honest and fair, of what is the right thing to do,” the report said. National Australia Bank Chairman Ken Henry came in for particular criticism after appearing dismissive during his public interrogation by the commission’s barristers. “I thought it telling that Dr Henry seemed unwilling to accept any criticism of how the board had dealt with some issues,” Commissioner Hayne wrote, adding he was “not as confident as I would wish to be that the lessons of the past have been learned”. Australian Banking Association chief Anna Bligh said banks “accept full responsibility for these failings and they know that they must now change to ensure that this never happens again”. “Banks are determined to learn the lessons, to fix the problems and to make it right,” she said.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - With creativity and goodwill, Britain and the European Union can still perhaps resolve the issue of Irish border arrangements after Brexit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. Speaking at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Merkel said Germany did not want to see Britain’s divorce deal with the EU - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - renegotiated. “But, we have an agreement for the future relationship and in this future relationship (agreement), one can of course settle questions that are still being discussed such as the question we have with the backstop,” Merkel said. “There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market even when Northern Ireland isn’t part of it because it is part of Britain while at the same time meeting the desire to have, if possible, no border controls,” she said. “To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted,” she added. “We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreement if everyone shows good will.” British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would seek a “pragmatic solution” to a parliamentary impasse over the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union when she tries to reopen talks with Brussels.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Growth in Britain’s construction industry ebbed in January to its weakest since icy weather beset the sector last March, as uncertainty around Brexit dragged particularly on commercial building work, a business survey showed on Monday. The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 52.8 in December, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 52.4. Growth in the housebuilding and civil engineering sectors slowed sharply and activity contracted in the commercial sector for the first time since March, when construction was hit by unusually cold temperatures. Construction firms hired staff at the slowest pace since July 2016, just after the Brexit referendum, as optimism soured ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union, scheduled in less than two months’ time. “Delays to client decision-making on new projects in response to Brexit uncertainty was cited as a key source of anxiety at the start of 2019,” Tim Moore, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit, said. A similar survey of the manufacturing sector also showed a sharp slowdown underway, caused by a cooling global economy as well as Brexit uncertainty. Prime Minister Theresa May, under pressure from her own Conservative Party, wants to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a contested Irish border arrangement, something Brussels has rejected. Investors have urged the government to ensure an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973. The closely watched IHS Markit/CIPS survey of services companies, which accounts for the bulk of private-sector activity, is due on Tuesday.

2019-02-08,"MYANMAR-THAI BORDER (Reuters) - Thousands of people sporting traditional ethnic costumes and Karen rebel fighters showing off their guns marched, sang and danced last week to celebrate 70 years since the start of the struggle for greater autonomy from Myanmar. Boasting more than 5,000 soldiers, the Karen National Union (KNU) is one of the most powerful and best-established of the country’s myriad militia groups that have fought the government since shortly after Myanmar gained independence in 1948. The KNU’s parade served as a reminder that the biggest priority of the Aung San Suu Kyi’s administration - ending decades of ethnic wars - remains elusive. Suu Kyi has struggled to make progress with autonomy-seeking ethnic minority rebels, who have accused her government of a high-handed approach and ignoring their grievances and aspirations. The KNU celebrations took place at a remote base in the mountains straddling the Myanmar-Thai border. “The history of the revolution for 70 years is a very rough one. As someone who has been involved in the revolution for 50 years, I can say it’s very tough and the sacrifices were very big,” Man Nyein Maung, one of the KNU’s executive members, told the Irrawaddy online news magazine. The celebrations lasted several days and nights with a folk dance competition and theatre performances before a military parade and speeches on a cloud-shrouded, dusty parade ground carved from the hills at the crack of dawn. A banner hoisted above the grounds listed some of the group’s political demands, including calls to “retain our arms” and to “decide our own political destiny”. One of the dance groups was made up of women wearing yellow scarves, with their hair tied in a bun and an exposed fringe. Their yellow shirts with green patterns contrasted with their white face powder and red lipstick. The performers mingled with villagers and soldiers of the Karen National Liberation Army, the KNU’s armed wing. The men smoked cigarettes as they watched, some with heavy bullet belts draped around automatic rifles, and with insignia in red, white and blue displayed on their uniforms. The KNU signed a ceasefire with the government in 2012 after more than six decades of conflict that had driven tens of thousands of refugees into Thailand. Some have come back although about 100,000 remain in the refugee camps on the other side of the border, according to the United Nations. While major clashes have been avoided, the KNU’s relations with the Myanmar army remain tense. Suu Kyi has struggled to secure peace elsewhere in the country and long-simmering conflicts in the north and the west have intensified in recent years. In 2017, a military offensive drove out 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from the western state of Rakhine to Bangladesh, creating one of the world’s largest refugee crises.

2019-02-08,"PARIS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Mobile communications industry body GSMA has proposed its members discuss the possibility that Chinese network vendor Huawei [HWT.UL] is excluded from key markets, amid concerns such a development could set operators back by years. The European Commission is weighing a de facto ban on Huawei’s 5G network equipment for next-generation mobile networks in the European Union due to security concerns, sources in Brussels have told Reuters. GSMA Director General Mats Granryd has written to members proposing to put the debate around Huawei onto the agenda of its next board meeting, a spokesman for the federation told Reuters on Saturday. The meeting will be held in late February on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress, the industry’s biggest annual gathering, in Barcelona. “It is to be confirmed for now,” he said. Some Western countries, including the United States and Australia, have restricted Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, citing concerns that its equipment may contain ‘back doors’ opening it up to cyber-espionage. Western governments are also concerned that China’s National Intelligence Law requires its companies and people to collaborate in espionage efforts. Huawei, the global market leader with annual sales of more than $100 billion, denies the existence of any back doors. The company and its founder Ren Zhengfei have repeatedly denied they would spy for China. Many operators rely on Huawei to build out 5G networks, and a de-facto ban would be a considerable setback for Europe’s efforts to stay competitive in communications, with implications for connected factories, self-driving cars and medical technology. Deutsche Telekom, Europe’s largest telecoms company, has said that, if it had to rip out Huawei equipment from its existing networks, this could delay its plans to roll out new services by two to three years.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain complained about the European Union calling Gibraltar a “colony” in a piece of draft legislation on Friday, highlighting how the EU is lining up behind Spain in its territorial dispute as Britain quits the bloc. The 27 remaining member states agreed to offer Britons visa-free travel to the EU after Brexit in March, even if talks on a broader withdrawal treaty collapse, on condition that Britain offers the same terms to EU citizens visiting for up to 90 days. But diplomats said Britain’s ambassador to the EU had objected to the wording of the text; it placed the 33,000 people of Gibraltar in a different category from UK citizens — with the same travel rights — and it also spelled out Spain’s claim to sovereignty over “The Rock” at the United Nations. In particular, it stated: “Gibraltar is a colony of the British Crown. There is a controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over Gibraltar.” Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman insisted Gibraltar was not a “colony”. The port at the mouth of the Mediterranean, ceded to Britain by Spain in 1713 after a war, was a “crown colony” when Britain joined the European bloc in 1973 but London reclassified it as a “British overseas territory” in 2002. “Gibraltar is not a colony and it is completely inappropriate to describe in this way,” a British spokeswoman said. “Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family.” The wording has, however, been used in other EU texts. The European Court of Justice said in rulings in 2006 and 2017 that Gibraltar was “a colony of the British crown” and not part of the United Kingdom.  Britain had not raised specific objections to the wording in those cases, officials said, but was irritated by Spain’s push to push the phrase and the sovereignty dispute into legislation in the present circumstances. Spain’s claim to sovereignty makes use of U.N. rules on decolonisation. Those, among other things, limit the weight given to the preferences of people living in a territory; Gibraltarians favour remaining British, despite having voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Spain had sought a more sweeping reference to UN resolutions on colonies, diplomats said, but France objected to protect its interests in some of its own overseas territories.  The text agreed by the 27 governments will be discussed by the European Parliament and the EU executive in order to finalise a regulation giving Britons visa-free access. Recalling how EU policy on Gibraltar had so far largely favoured Britain, which joined the bloc before Spain, a senior EU official told Reuters recently: “Now the table has turned.” “The Union position ... was the British position ... But with Brexit, the Union position is now the Spanish position. We will always take the side of a member against a non-member,” the official said. Spain has already secured a right of veto over whether future Brexit arrangements can apply to Gibraltar. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez held up an agreement on the current withdrawal treaty in November over the issue and said Spain would seek joint sovereignty after Britain leaves the EU.   Spanish sources said this week that Madrid would insist on excluding Gibraltar from all agreements between Britain and the EU once Britain has left. But there is concern among other EU countries that Madrid’s hard line could disrupt efforts to ease Britain out of the bloc.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Nissan is cancelling plans to make the next model of its X-Trail sports utility vehicle in Britain, less than two months before the country is due to leave the European Union, broadcaster Sky News said on Saturday. Nissan first said four months after Britain voted in June 2016 to leave the EU that it would manufacture a new model of the SUV in Britain, which was seen as a major vote of confidence in the country’s manufacturing future. The main production plant for the current X-Trail is in Japan, while Nissan’s plant in Sunderland, northeast England, makes the smaller Qashqai SUV and other models. “Precise details of Nissan’s impending announcement were unclear this weekend, but sources said it was likely to initially involve abandoning the X-Trail production plans which had been announced in the autumn of 2016,” Sky reported. A UK-based spokesman for Nissan declined to comment. Sky said the announcement due on Monday was not expected to lead to immediate job losses at the Sunderland plant, as the X-Trail is not currently made there, but would raise doubts about further Nissan investment in Britain. As well as the X-Trail, Nissan said in 2016 it would build the next generation Qashqai SUV in Britain after receiving government assurances over Brexit, in what was seen at the time as a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May. However, the failure of Britain’s government so far to negotiate a smooth exit plan from the European Union has made car manufacturers less willing to use Britain as a European manufacturing center. Investment in Britain’s car industry halved last year, data showed on Thursday, and car production by Nissan in Britain fell by more than 10 percent. Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said leaving the EU on March 29 without a transition deal to preserve the smooth flow of parts and finished vehicles across EU borders would cause “permanent devastation” to the British car industry.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish police seized a substantial quantity of firearms and a suspected explosive device near the border with Northern Ireland on Friday as part of an investigation into the activities of militant Irish nationalist groups there. The searches took place near the County Louth village of Omeath, which lies on a small peninsula separating part of the border between European Union-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. The currently seamless border will become the United Kingdom’s only land frontier with the EU when it leaves the bloc, scheduled for the end of March. Police on both sides have warned that any hardening of the border as a result of Brexit, with the potential return of customs posts, could be a target for the small number of militant groups still active in Northern Ireland after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence in the province. “During the searches to date Gardaí (Irish police) have recovered a substantial quantity of ammunition of varied calibre along with a mortar tube (pending examination by Garda ballistics experts),” the police said in a statement. The recovery of the ammunition was part of ongoing police investigations targeting militant groups based in the area. The army’s bomb disposal unit was assisting at the scene, the statement added. A militant group calling itself the “IRA” said this week it was responsible for a car bomb which detonated outside a court house in the Northern Irish city of Londonderry in January, highlighting the threat still posed by groups opposed to the peace agreement. No one was injured in the blast, which the group said was not linked to Brexit.

2019-02-08,"REYNOSA, Mexico (Reuters) - Central Americans who fled violence for refuge in the United States risk kidnapping or death under a new U.S. plan to deport them to murderous and cartel-wracked Mexican border cities while their asylum cases are processed. The city of Reynosa, and a nearby stretch of the Rio Grande that divides Texas from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, is by far the busiest crossing point along the northern Mexican border for migrants seeking asylum in the United States. But Reynosa is a wasteland of vandalised and abandoned homes in a state that is a key battlefield in Mexico’s bloody drug wars. With cartel factions fighting for lucrative drug trafficking routes, civilians are often caught in the crossfire.  On Tuesday, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump launched a plan to return Central American asylum-seekers to Mexico rather than have them wait in the United States - dubbed the Migration Protection Protocols. The first return of an asylum-seeker took place in Mexico’s west coast city of Tijuana, at the opposite end of the border from Reynosa. U.S. authorities plan to gradually widen the program to other legal ports of entry, including Tamaulipas, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “We’re returning them to where they came in,” said DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman. Last year, 32,521 people asked for asylum in the Rio Grande Valley sector that skirts the river in southern Texas, after being caught by border agents on river banks and in fields, or after walking up to ports of entry - more than half the cases for the entire 2000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Asked to comment on the risks of returning migrants to a country afflicted with disappearances and violent crime, Waldman said: “That’s no more dangerous than some of these violent parts of the United States, like Chicago.” In 2017, FBI data indicates that Chicago, one of the most violent cities in the United States, had a homicide rate of about 24 murders per 100,000 residents, similar to the level in Tamaulipas cited by the interior ministry. In Mexico, however, around 90 percent of crimes went unreported last year, the national statistics office estimated, while the data does not include unresolved disappearances, reckoned by Geovanni Barrios, president of Justicia Tamaulipas, at over 34,000 in Tamaulipas alone.   The border zone has become a central theatre of conflict since the Mexican government launched a militarised effort against the cartels in 2006 and they began fragmenting. According to information from the defence ministry, 130 soldiers have since died in Tamaulipas, more than in any other Mexican state. Now, splinter groups of the Gulf and Zeta drug cartels fight pitched battles for territory in armoured vehicles emblazoned with their emblems. Hundreds of unidentified bodies lie in unmarked graves. The U.S. State Department has a “Level 4: Do Not Travel” warning for five Mexican states including Tamaulipas, more frequently levelled in active war zones. The project of securely hosting Central Americans while U.S. immigration judges adjudicate their cases seems a pipe dream, according to Reynosa’s mayor, Maki Ortiz. “We don’t have the capacity. We don’t have the resources, the infrastructure or the budget for them,” Ortiz said, adding that no one had earmarked the extra funds for a city that barely has the means to combat its criminals. Unlike recent caravans of migrants that headed for Tijuana, often several hundred people strong, most of those who journey to Reynosa make their way alone, or aided by clandestine people smugglers. Dependent on those smugglers to guide them for a steep fee over the Rio Grande with the assent of cartel factions that control parts of the riverbank, they wait nervously in “safe houses” for their appointed crossing hour. Or they ponder their options in the Senda de Vida shelter - the only one to accept Central Americans - in a district dominated by the Gulf cartel, who are blamed for multiple kidnappings and disappearances. Migrants at the shelter are warned not to venture out alone. “I’ve never even seen the city since I arrived at the bus terminal,” said Maria Alfaro, 51, a Honduran cook staying in the shelter. Too old to find work in a factory in Honduras, she came to Mexico hoping for job, she said. A Salvadoran she befriended in a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican town of Tapachula turned out to be a member of the Zeta cartel, she said - an assertion supported by a local press clipping seen by Reuters. When she tried to escape him, he sent associates to kidnap her from a bus station and hauled her to a house where the gang members made her their sex slave, she said, her voice breaking. Weeks later, she escaped. But she said she feared the gang’s criminal ties in Honduras would put her at risk of being hunted down if she went home.  So she went north, planning to ask for asylum in the United States.  “The United States takes better care of people, doesn’t it?” she said. Keeping accurate figures for the Central Americans who go missing is difficult because migrants are in transit, often illegally, and anyone accompanying them is unlikely to notify authorities, said Barrios, of Justicia Tamaulipas. Pastor Hector Silva, founder of Senda de Vida, said numerous Central Americans in his shelter had disappeared after venturing out against his advice, the most recent case a few weeks earlier.  Each time, Silva said, his visitors left their few possessions, as if they meant to return within minutes.  Sometimes families or friends found the missing migrants and paid a ransom before it was too late, he said.  In the shadow of the international bridge, with a U.S. flag fluttering just over the river, a cross carved with the words “Memoria Migrantes” stands as a bleak memorial to those who were never heard from again.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter and weakness at its investment bank overshadowed the first annual profit in four years for Deutsche Bank. Germany’s largest lender has been trying to turn itself around under a new leadership, but has faced a series of hurdles, including allegations of money laundering, ratings downgrades and failed stress tests.  Deutsche has also become the subject of rampant merger speculation, and Friday’s earnings figures underscore that the company still has a long way ahead to post a sustainable profit. Time is running out for the bank to turn around on its own, making a merger with rival Commerzbank more likely, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Results were a mixed bag, with Deutsche posting a full-year profit of 341 million euros ($390 million), compared with a net loss of 735 million euros in 2017. “Our return to profitability shows that Deutsche Bank is on the right track,” said Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who took over last April and has embarked on plans to cut more than 7,000 jobs in an overhaul of the bank.  “In 2019, we aim not only to save costs but also to make focused investments in growth,” he said.  Sewing, in an interview with Reuters TV, said he was optimistic that profit would grow in 2019. But it was not all good news. On the downside, the fourth-quarter net loss of 409 million euros was greater than the 268 million euros expected on average by analysts, according to a consensus report on the bank’s website. The quarter was marked by continued weakness in its key trading business. Revenue at its cash-cow bond-trading division plunged 23 percent.   For the investment bank as a whole, revenue dropped 5 percent in the fourth quarter. Executives said that negative headlines about police raids on the bank in November dented business. “The weakness in investment banking is striking,” said Alexandra Annecke, fund manager with Union Investment, which holds the bank’s stock.  “It needs to finally be possible to stop the loss of market share,” she said. Analysts at Citigroup said they feared that Deutsche’s investment bank would continue to lose ground to competitors. A downgrade in market expectations for future earnings is possible, they added.  The bank’s shares lost more than half their value in 2018, though they have recovered slightly over the past month. They opened slightly higher early in Frankfurt but were down 3.1  percent by 1200 GMT. Sewing, in a call with analysts when asked about merger speculation, said that the bank was focused on executing its plan and that he had a “lot of confidence”. He later told journalists the bank was fully focused on its “homework” of turning around the bank.  Sewing also denied there was any pressure from the German government to merge. “I do not feel that. And there is no intervention either,” he was quoted as saying by German broadcaster n-tv.  Speculation of a merger between the two has heightened under the tenure of Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who has spoken in favor of strong banks. His team has met frequently with executives of Deutsche, Commerzbank and major shareholders. Deutsche is considered one of the most important banks for the global financial system, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. But the German lender has been plagued by losses and a scandal. A $7.2 billion U.S. fine in 2017 for its role in the mortgage market crisis was a major blow that spooked clients and concerned regulators. The European Central Bank has set conditions for a possible merger between Deutsche and Commerzbank, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported on Friday, citing banking supervision sources.  Both banks would need achieve sustainable profitability to be allowed to merge, according to sources cited in the report. Shareholders may need to inject further capital, it said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as Trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high-level talks. Trump, speaking at the White House during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, said he was optimistic that the world’s two largest economies could reach “the biggest deal ever made.” The Chinese trade delegation said in a statement that the  talks made “important progress,” China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. No specific plans for a meeting with Xi were announced, but Trump said there could be more than one. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were invited to bring a U.S. negotiating team to Beijing around mid-February, with dates still pending. The White House also said in a statement that its scheduled March 2 tariff increase on $200 billion of Chinese goods was a “hard deadline” if no deal was reached by March 1. At the end of the talks next door to the White House, Liu told Trump that China would make a new, immediate commitment to buy more U.S. soybeans. An administration official later clarified the amount as a total of 5 million tonnes, effectively doubling the amount bought by China since resuming limited purchases in December. U.S. soybean sales to China, which totalled 31.7 million  tonnes in 2017, were largely cut off in the second half of last year by China’s retaliatory tariffs and the announcement drew a positive reaction from Trump, who said it would “make our farmers very happy.” The Chinese delegation said China will expand imports of U.S. agricultural, energy, service and industrial products, according to Xinhua. While China has previously offered increased purchases of U.S. farm, energy and other goods to try to resolve the trade disputes, negotiators also dug into thornier issues, including U.S. demands that China take steps to protect American intellectual property and end policies that Washington says force U.S. companies to turn over technology to Chinese firms. Lighthizer said there was “substantial progress” on these issues, including verification mechanisms to “enforce” China’s follow-through on any reform commitments it makes. “At this point, it’s impossible for me to predict success. But we’re in a place that if things work out, it could happen,” Lighthizer said at the Oval Office meeting. Later, he told reporters that the U.S. objective was to make China’s commitments “more specific, all-encompassing and enforceable” with a mechanism for taking action if China fails to follow through, but declined to provide details. Reuters previously reported that such an enforcement mechanism could carry the threat of U.S. tariffs. Asked whether the two sides discussed lifting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, Lighthizer said they were not part of the talks. “The two sides established a consensus in principle for an implementation mechanism framework,” Xinhua said, adding without elaborating that the United States had agreed to “earnestly respond to China’s concerns”. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined during a regular news briefing in Beijing to give any details on a possible Xi-Trump meeting. A person familiar with the discussions said a broad range of concerns about access to Chinese agricultural markets were raised in the talks but little progress was made. Washington has warned it will more than double tariffs on  $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent if significant headway on a trade deal was not made by March 1.  Trump said he did not think he would need to extend the deadline. “I think when President Xi and I meet, every point will be agreed to,” Trump added. But Trump has vetoed multiple proposed trade deals with China, choosing to push ahead with tariffs on Chinese goods to gain leverage. “Analysts mostly remain deeply sceptical that a genuine trade deal can be done on this time frame,” economists from Commonwealth Bank of Australia said in a note. “We are less pessimistic since these negotiations are being conducted by senior politicians, not by trade bureaucrats,” they added. “Both sides also have an incentive, and arguably a growing incentive, to get a meaningful deal done.” Earlier, Trump said on Twitter he was looking for China to open its markets “not only to Financial Services, which they are now doing, but also to our Manufacturing, Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!” The U.S. complaints on technology transfers, and intellectual property protections, along with accusations of Chinese cyber theft of American trade secrets and a systematic campaign to acquire U.S. technology firms, were used by Trump’s administration to justify punitive tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, but has suspended some and is allowing some purchases of U.S. soybeans during the talks. Chinese officials have said their policies do not coerce technology transfers. The Chinese delegation said China will actively respond to U.S. concerns on intellectual property and creating a fair market environment, Xinhua reported.  The U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are just one front in Trump’s efforts to upend the global trading order with his “America First” strategy. He has also imposed global tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, washing machines and solar panels and has threatened to raise tariffs on imported cars unless Japan and the European Union offer trade concessions.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - With just 56 days until Britain leaves the EU, Jo Elgarf has begun stockpiling food in case politicians fail to strike an exit deal, but she says she cannot do the same with vital drugs her disabled daughter needs. Four-year-old Nora has cerebral palsy and epilepsy and relies on imported Epilim and Keppra daily to stop her suffering seizures. Elgarf wants to stock up on the drugs in case supplies are hit but she can’t because they are only available on a monthly prescription.  For Nora, “this could be matter of life and death,” Elgarf told Reuters at her home in southwest London. “It could mean being sent off in an ambulance to hospital with a massive seizure that lasts five minutes plus. She cannot miss those medicines. There’s no ifs and buts about it and we cannot use alternatives either.” With the clock ticking, British lawmakers are still struggling to agree a withdrawal treaty with the European Union, having comprehensively rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s agreement last month. The default position means Britain will leave on March 29 without a deal in place unless something can be agreed beforehand. That has led to fears that supply chains will be severely disrupted leading to shortages of food and medicines. According to the British government, about three-quarters of medicines used by the state-run National Health Service (NHS) come via the EU. May, a Type 1 diabetic, has said she herself relies on insulin produced in another EU country. Last August, Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined plans to ensure Britain had an extra six weeks of supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  In January, he said Britain had bought 5,000 fridges to hold medicines, making him the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, and secured warehouse space. “Making sure patients continue to have access to the medicines they need is paramount...,” said health minister responsible for Brexit planning Stephen Hammond. “We are working extremely closely with industry to make sure there are significant supplies of these drugs in the UK,” Hammond wrote in an article last week. But some Britons do not share that confidence, and anecdotal evidence from newspaper readers suggests people are stockpiling everything from children’s painkillers to medicines for serious conditions.  For Elgarf, a member of anti-Brexit Facebook group “48 per cent Preppers” - a reference to the percentage that voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum - that is not an option, and that has left her fearful. “It doesn’t matter even if I had all the money in the world, I can’t go and buy these medicines because they are prescription-only. I have no way of securing my child’s future,” she said. It is not just patients and their families who are concerned.  The chief executive of a body running hospitals in Birmingham, England’s second-biggest city, warned last week there was a risk operations could be canceled because of a drug shortage. “In the event of a chaotic, no-deal exit, many NHS trusts could quickly run out of vital medical supplies,” Dr Dave Rosser wrote in a memo to his board of directors. He said “well-informed and non-political NHS sources” had estimated goods from Europe across the English Channel “could be reduced to between one-third and one-fifth of current daily volumes for a period of at least some months.” According to the Brexit Health Alliance, an industry body, 45 million patient packs go to the EU from the UK every month, and 37 million packs go the other way.  “Any divergence from these harmonized standards by the UK in the future, and a lack of agreement on cooperation with the EU on medicines and medical devices, would mean that supply chains are at risk,” it said.  One unintended consequence of the concern is that patients stocking up on medicines might bring about problems themselves.  “Hospitals, pharmacies, (family doctor) surgeries and patients should not stockpile medicines at any point during this process,” health minister Hammond said. “Doing so risks shortages for other patients. If everyone does what they are supposed to, we are confident the supply of medicines will continue uninterrupted whatever the Brexit outcome.” Writing by Michael Holden; editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-stockpiling/a-matter-of-life-and-death-uk-stockpiles-drugs-as-no-deal-brexit-feared-idUKKCN1PQ3JZ,2019-02-08,,A matter of life and death?

2019-02-08,"PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France, Germany and Britain have opened a new channel for non-dollar trade with Iran to avert U.S. sanctions, although diplomats say it is unlikely to allow for the big transactions that Tehran says it needs to keep a nuclear deal afloat. Washington’s major European allies opposed last year’s decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to abandon the 2015 deal, under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear programme. Iran has threatened to pull out of the deal unless the European powers enable it to receive economic benefits. The Europeans have promised to help companies do business with Iran as long as it abides by the deal. “It is a political act,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters after a meeting of EU counterparts in Bucharest. “It is a gesture to protect European companies.” Washington says that, although Iran has met the terms, the accord was too generous, failing to rein in Iran’s ballistic missile programme or curb its regional meddling.  New U.S. sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to abandon business with Iran, and Washington said on Thursday that it did not expect the EU effort, known as the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), to change that.  “We do not expect the SPV will in any way impact our maximum economic pressure campaign,” a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said. “The United States questions the efficacy of the SPV and remains committed to fully enforcing its sanctions,” said a senior Trump administration who spoke on condition of anonymity. The European trade vehicle was conceived as a way to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods. However, those ambitions have been toned down, with diplomats saying that, realistically, it will be used only for smaller trade, for example of humanitarian products or food.  “It won’t change things dramatically, but it’s an important political message to Iran to show that we are determined to save the JCPOA (Iran deal) and also to the United States to show we defend our interests despite their extraterritorial sanctions,” one European diplomat said. The EU has spent months preparing the system and it will take several months more to become operational. Britain’s Jeremy Hunt said the three countries were working closely with Tehran to finalise arrangements: “Registration is a big step, but there is still more work to be done,” Hunt said. The Instrument In Support Of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, is registered in France and will be headed by German banker Per Fischer, a former Commerzbank director. The three European powers are shareholders and hope other states will join later, although a senior German official said this was not imminent. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said the mechanism was a good first step. The European powers must now establish a budget for INSTEX and define its rules. Iran must also set up a mirror company.  “It seems that Iran should set up the same system inside Iran to organise rial transactions for Iranian companies,” Araqchi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency. The U.S. Embassy in Germany said it did not expect INSTEX to blunt its effort to pile economic pressure on Tehran. Even as European powers and the European Union have worked to preserve the nuclear deal, relations with Tehran have been worsening. The EU this month imposed its first sanctions on Iran since the nuclear pact, in response to the ballistic missile tests and assassination plots on European soil. In a symbolic move, the EU added two Iranian individuals and an Iranian intelligence unit to its terrorist list. The three big European powers are also assessing whether to push for new sanctions on Iran over its missile programme, diplomats have told Reuters. “We are clear; this commitment does not in any way preclude us from addressing Iran’s hostile and destabilising activities,” Hunt said.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares ended a choppy trading session flat on Thursday as disappointing economic data, including a technical recession in Italy, gradually sapped an early boost provided by a dovish tone from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The STOXX 600 ended the day up 0.04 percent but rose a strong 6.1 percent in January, its best monthly performance since October 2015, as global markets recovered from a turbulent 2018.  Economic indicators showed, however, that concerns for the European economy were warranted. German retail fell at the fastest rate in 11 years, British car production posted its biggest drop since 2009 and euro zone growth was the slowest in four years. A Bloomberg report that Deutsche Bank was expecting a government-brokered merger with rival Commerzbank if efforts to restructure fell short of targets also hit the banking sector. The German lenders fell 4 percent and 6.7 percent respectively.    “It is a double whammy for the eurozone, Italy has slipped into recession and there is increased chatter of a Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank merger”, commented CMC analyst David Madden.  Milan’s FTSE MIB slipped 0.2 percent while Frankfurt’s DAX also dipped 0.1 percent.  Higher crude prices and a strong update from Shell helped to support the market with the oil index rising 1.8 percent, the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe.  Royal Dutch Shell jumped almost 4 percent as annual profits rose by more than a third to $21.4 billion, the highest since 2014. “Time for investors to give credit where credit is due,” wrote Bernstein analyst Clint Oswald, saying Shell remained one of his top picks for this year. “We think 2019 will be a repeat, guidance will be maintained, and 2020 targets are on track,” he added. There were also strong results from Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company, which rose 4.6 percent after posting higher half-year sales, helped by strength in India and China. There was also a lot of activity in the telecoms sector, with the Dutch telecoms company KPN up 6.2 percent on speculation of a bid by Brookfield Asset Management. Telecom Italia jumped about 5 percent after the U.S. hedge fund Elliott raised its stake, escalating a power battle over the group with top shareholder Vivendi. The Swiss watchmaker Swatch tumbled 6.1 percent after posting lower-than-expected results amid a downturn in Asia and France, while a disappointing update sent Germany’s Software down 4.8 percent to the bottom of the STOXX. Analysts have been steadily cutting profit expectations for European firms. According to Refinitiv IBES, fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to have grown less than 4 percent, versus more than 10 percent expected last month.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House warned traders on Wednesday not to deal in Venezuelan gold or oil following its imposition of stiff sanctions aimed at forcing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power. National security adviser John Bolton tweeted that traders should not deal in gold, oil or other commodities “being stolen” from the Venezuelan people, as opponents of Maduro’s government worried that a Russian-operated plane had shipped gold out of Caracas on Wednesday afternoon. The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Venezuela’s self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, by phone on Wednesday, reiterating support for his “fight to regain democracy.” On one side of the tussle for control of Venezuela, an OPEC member that has the world’s largest oil reserves but is in dire financial straits, Guaido and Western backers led by the United States are insisting on an immediate transition and fresh elections. On the other, Maduro, with backing from Russia, China and Turkey, says he will remain for his second six-year term despite accusations of fraud in his re-election last year and the economic meltdown. Venezuela’s struggle to pay its debts even to allies Russia and China amid a sharp drop in oil output has been exacerbated by the new sanctions, which will make it very hard to sell oil to its main client, the United States.  In that context, the arrival in Caracas of a Boeing 777 plane from Moscow on Monday led to speculation Maduro’s government was shipping more gold reserves out of the country, following shipments of $900 million of gold to Turkey last year. That was part of a strategy to increase the central bank’s liquidity. The flight, operated by Russia’s Nordwind Airlines, left Venezuela at 4.52 pm local time (2152 GMT), a Reuters witness said. Another Russian-operated flight, a Boeing 757 cargo plane, arrived at the airport an hour earlier via Cape Verde, according to publicly-available flight data. There are no routine flights between the two countries. Venezuelan lawmaker Jose Guerra, a former central bank economist, told the opposition-run National Assembly his understanding was that the Nordwind plane would take some gold reserves to Russia. The bank did not respond to a request for comment. Sources told Reuters private military contractors who do secret missions for Moscow were in Venezuela last week. Elliott Abrams, the recently-appointed U.S. envoy for Venezuela, said Washington was looking around the world for more assets of the Maduro government, including gold holdings and bank accounts. The Kremlin said this week it expected Venezuela to pay its debts. Russia, which like China has loaned and invested billions of dollars to OPEC member Venezuela, called on Guaido to drop his demand for a snap election and instead accept mediation. But given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue between the government and opposition, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time. Guaido’s envoy to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, said the only dialogue they were interested in would be a negotiation for Maduro’s departure and new elections. Government officials insist the next presidential election will be in 2025. Responding to a call by Guaido, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Venezuela on Wednesday, some waving Venezuelan flags while drivers of cars and buses honked in support. “I want this government to go, it has been a total humiliation for the country,” said Lucy Cordoba, 51, a government worker in the poor hillside town of Petare at the edge of the capital, where she said trash had not been collected for a year and water was scarce.  Cordoba said her children were among the more than 3 million Venezuelans who have left the country in the past couple of years. One went to Peru, and another to the Dominican Republic.    More than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the U.N. human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump and Guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after Venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to Guaido’s arrest. Abrams said action against Guaido would be “foolish.”  Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions. Wills Rangel, a board member of state oil company PDVSA, told Reuters the company was having problems unloading fuel imports because the sanctions were complicating payments. Maduro, 56, says Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. He told Moscow’s RIA news agency on Wednesday that Trump ordered “the government of Colombia and the Colombian mafia to kill me,” reprising an accusation of plots he has made over the years and which Bogota and Washington routinely deny. Maduro is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers and has made daily visits to troops. “Do you want to be a coward?” he yelled in a call and response session with hundreds of soldiers on Wednesday. “No, president,” they shouted back.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - BT Group’s outgoing CEO Gavin Patterson said he was handing over a company with the momentum needed to see through a major restructuring and withstand pressures ranging from demands from regulators to aggressive competition in consumer broadband. Philip Jansen, a former Worldpay chief executive, takes the helm at Britain’s biggest broadband provider on Friday, eight months after Patterson launched a cost-cutting plan to tackle financial and operational underperformance. Patterson signed off with better-than-expected third quarter numbers and a forecast that full-year earnings would come in at the top end of guidance. But the outlook made clear the challenge facing Jansen. “We continue to expect regulation, competition, cost inflation and legacy product declines to impact in the short term before being more than offset by improved trading and cost transformation by our 2020/21 financial year,” Patterson said. He said in May he would cut 13,000 jobs to tackle problems ranging from criticism of BT’s fibre broadband plan to an underperforming IT services business. BT’s shares, down 31 percent since Patterson took over in 2013, reversed falls early on Thursday to trade up 1.5 percent at 237 pence at 1154 GMT.  Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said Patterson had had his critics in recent years, but the results meant he was leaving on an upbeat note. “That’s not to say BT is out of the woods though,” he said. “Competition is fierce in mobile and broadband, and falling profits at Openreach are a timely reminder that regulation has the potential to limit progress at any time,” he said. Patterson said the highlights of his tenure included buying Britain’s biggest mobile operator EE and moving into sports broadcasting, two moves that transformed BT’s consumer business. Put there were negatives, including an accounting scandal in  Italy two years ago and a rocky relationship with Britain’s telcoms regulator. Patterson said in retrospect he could have launched the restructuring plan a year earlier. “Time goes very quickly as a CEO and you need to move today rather than move tomorrow,” he said. BT said it was stepping up planning for Britain leaving the European Union in March, including a disorderly exit that it and other businesses fear. “We need to plan for all eventualities including a disorderly transition,” Patterson said. BT was building up stock of key equipment such as broadband hubs and set-top boxes in case there were delays in the supply chain, he said. It was also making sure it could continue to serve customers through its European subsidiaries and would not have problems moving data about. “Like everyone else we are expecting it hopefully to be a negotiated managed exit but are prepared for the worst if it were to happen,” Patterson said. The stockpiling costs would be covered by its working capital provisions, the company said. BT reported revenue of 5.98 billion pounds, down 1 percent, and core earnings of 1.88 billion pounds, down 3 percent, for the quarter to the end of December, beating analysts’ expectations of 5.93 billion pounds and 1.82 billion pounds respectively. Revenue and earnings grew strongly in its consumer business, helped by a September price increase and higher handset costs, offset by a decline in its enterprise business and in its Openreach networks arm, which was hit by regulated price cuts. It said adjusted core earnings for the year to end-March would be around the top end of guidance of 7.3 billion to 7.4 billion pounds.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will take a few days to formulate proposals to put to the European Union in an attempt to resolve the issue of Irish border arrangements after Brexit, foreign minister Jeremy Hunt told BBC radio on Thursday. British lawmakers on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to reopen her Brexit treaty with the EU to replace a controversial Irish border arrangement - the backstop - but promptly received a rejection from Brussels.     “We will put those proposals together. It is going to take a few days to do that,” Hunt said. “I happen to believe there is potential along all the different routes that have been discussed. But we need to put those together, make sure they meet the concerns the EU has expressed and then I think ... we will have a proper discussion,” he said. Hunt said it was too early to say if an extension to the Brexit process would be required. Britain is due to leave on March 29. “I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before March 29 then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation,” said Hunt. “But if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary.” The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, told MPs on Thursday that parliament’s planned February recess would be cancelled so it could make progress on “key business”. The government has also said it is looking at extending the hours during which parliament sits. Asked about Hunt’s comments, May’s spokesman said: “The prime minister’s position on this is unchanged: we will be leaving on March 29. “We are determined to have everything in place in order for us to leave on March 29,” he added. “The fact that recess won’t be taking place and Members of Parliament will be sitting shows you that we are taking all available steps to make sure that March 29 is our exit date.” Reporting by James Davey and Kylie MacLellan; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-europe/uk-to-formulate-irish-border-proposals-in-a-few-days-hunt-idUKKCN1PP0XP,2019-02-08,,UK to formulate Irish border proposals 'in a few days' - Hunt
2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union can offer Britain more assurances over the Irish border ‘backstop’ in a political declaration on post-Brexit ties if London moves towards accepting a permanent customs union, a leading EU lawmaker dealing with Brexit said. Danuta Hubner spoke to Reuters as British Prime Minister Theresa May headed back to Brussels to demand the renegotiation of the legal withdrawal treaty she agreed with the EU but cannot get ratified at home. May wants to replace the emergency Irish border fix with unspecified “alternative arrangements” to ensure no return of extensive border checks on the island of Ireland, something the EU says is vague and not enough of a guarantee.  “‘Alternative arrangements’...relates to the future. What can be added or changed in the political declaration is to ensure some new arrangements that would solve the issue of a hard border,” Hubner said on Wednesday evening. “Key to this is the conversation with Corbyn. Cross-party dialogue must yield some new elements for the future...The only thing we have not yet tried is a shift of the UK’s red lines,” she said of May’s talks with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn wants Britain to be in a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, something May has opposed so far as it would hinder Britain’s ability to pursue independent trade deals around the world. “If there is no openness on the UK side to include those assurances in the political declaration on the future EU-UK ties, the process could mechanically take us to no-deal.” The political declaration is a non-legally binding document that accompanies the legally binding withdrawal deal negotiated by the EU and May’s government. The British parliament resoundingly rejected that deal two weeks ago and has told May to reopen negotiations with the EU on it. Hubner said the EU would not blink on refusing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement or replacing the backstop. “A step further would risk undermining the single market. If the single market loses its integrity, it would be the end of the EU,” she said. “It’s not just about Ireland.” “The risk of no-deal Brexit has grown.” Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Gareth Jones and Angus MacSwan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-hubner/eu-could-offer-more-backstop-assurances-if-uk-moves-on-customs-union-eu-lawmaker-idUKKCN1PP17R,2019-02-08,,EU could offer more backstop assurances if UK moves on customs union - EU lawmaker

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has won the backing of parliament to seek changes to her Brexit deal, thanks in large part to a peace accord between both eurosceptic and pro-EU factions within her divided Conservative Party.  The strategy, which emerged this week, has been dubbed the Malthouse Compromise after one of its proponents, lawmaker Kit Malthouse. It courts Brexiteers with a promise to ditch an unpopular Irish border policy in favour of an alternative and appeals to pro-EU Conservatives by pledging safeguards against the risk of disruption if no exit deal can be agreed with Brussels. Although the plan takes its name from low-key junior housing minister Malthouse, its political weight come from the senior figures who helped draft it. These include former education minister Nicky Morgan, a prominent campaigner for close ties with the European Union, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a powerful Conservative eurosceptic faction. To get any Brexit deal ratified May needs to secure parliament’s approval. But her party is divided over the best way to leave the EU, and earlier this month comprehensively rejected an exit deal she negotiated with Brussels. Without an exit deal, Britain could face significant economic disruption.  The key point of disagreement in Britain is the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to prevent the revival of border controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland. Many pro-Brexit MPs, including the Northern Irish party which props up May’s government, fear Britain could end up tied to EU rules indefinitely or that the backstop could drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  The Malthouse plan has not been set out in a formal document. But based on reports of leaked communications and statements by its backers, it can be broken into two parts: a modified set of negotiating aims and a fallback option in case that fails.    The group backs an alternative withdrawal agreement, which is closely modelled on the existing agreement, but includes a different backstop arrangement. The new backstop would be based around a zero-tariff free trade agreement rather than its current basis of a shared customs area between Britain and the EU. It relies on technological solutions to move checks on goods away from the border. This proposal was first announced in December. If negotiations with Brussels fail, the government should seek a basic transition agreement involving an offer to keep paying into the EU and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. In return, Britain wants to extend current trading terms beyond the end of the ‘implementation’ period - utilising a clause in international trade law - if a permanent trade arrangement has not been agreed by then. May’s rejected divorce deal envisages a transition, or implementation, period till the end of 2020 during which trade would continue on current terms. May has not fully endorsed the plan, but it is one of three options she is considering as she prepares to return to Brussels. They are: 1. A right for Britain to unilaterally decide it will leave the backstop. 2. A time limit on the backstop. 3. Alternative backstop arrangements, along the lines of those put forward by Malthouse.  Tuesday’s vote in parliament allows May to present a united front in the hope of persuading Brussels to reopen the deal, but it is not specific about what she must change. This raises the risk that the peace deal in the party is only temporary. A chorus of EU voices has dismissed the prospect of renegotiating the legal text governing Britain’s withdrawal, which was signed off by all 27 other EU countries last year. If whatever May is able to secure from the EU falls short of her party’s expectations, she could face a repeat of the heavy defeat her original deal suffered in parliament. May has promised to report back to parliament by Feb. 13 at the latest.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Time is too short to find an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop and Britain’s divorce deal with the European Union will not be re-opened for negotiation, the EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday. “We ourselves talked of so-called alternative arrangements which could prevent the return of a hard border. Only, no one, on either side, was able to say what arrangement would be needed to ensure controls on goods, animals and merchandise, without having a border,” Barnier told France’s RTL radio.  “We have neither the time, nor the technologies.” Barnier expressed hope that British Prime Minister Theresa May’s meeting with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn might yield new proposals.

2019-02-08,"BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian rescue teams have recovered the bodies of 99 people buried after the rupture last week of a Vale tailings dam, and with over 250 people still missing, relatives at the disaster site are fast losing hope. No survivors have been found in the area of the dam burst since Saturday, indicating the death toll could rise to as many as 360 people, which would make it Brazil’s deadliest-ever mining accident. Some relatives of people unaccounted for are joining rescue teams in the hope of at least finding their loved ones’ bodies, buried after the dam on Friday released a river of slurry - the muddy byproduct of iron ore processing. “We don’t have strength to even cry any more. We keep coming to try to find the body, so we can have a burial,” said Tereza Ferreira Nascimento, a resident of the nearby town of Brumadinho, who likely lost her brother Paulo Giovanni Santos. With the help of another of her brothers, Pedro, she was digging through an area in a small field that had been swept by the wave of mining waste. A worker who narrowly escaped the crushing of the company cafeteria told Reuters he doubted anyone inside had made it out alive.  U.N. human rights experts earlier on Wednesday called for an official investigation into the disaster. Baskut Tuncak, a U.N. expert on the disposal of hazardous substances, urged Brazil to prioritize dam safety evaluations and block new tailing dams until safety could be ensured. A Minas Gerais state court ordered on Wednesday that no more licenses should be issued to projects using the type of dam similar to that of Brumadinho. Vale said on Tuesday it would spend 5 billion reais ($1.3 billion) decommissioning dams like the one that collapsed. That announcement sent the miner’s shares higher as analysts said it provided greater clarity on iron ore output going forward. Vale will cut 10 percent of its output by decommissioning 10 dams, Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said. The plan triggered a 9 percent rally in Vale shares, as well as a broader bounce in Chinese iron ore futures and shares of rival companies. Vale’s initiative aims to pre-empt tough questions about its safety record in the wake of Friday’s disaster, coming after a similar deadly dam collapse in 2015 at the nearby Samarco mine, which Vale co-owns with BHP Group. The plan involves suspending operations at mines producing about 40 million tonnes of iron ore and 11 million tonnes of pellets per year, Schvartsman said. Shares in Vale’s rivals BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group rose, lifting Australia’s metals and mining index.  “In our reports published over the last few days, we highlighted that the two main uncertainties in the area of financial impact were the impact on short and medium-term production and potential legal actions stemming from the event,” XP strategist Karel Luketic said in a research note.  Vale’s announcement “helps ease worries relative to the first uncertainty mentioned, production,” Luketic said. He said XP was maintaining its forecast for iron ore priced around $65 for the years covered by the production plan, but added the cuts “could support prices above that level.” A Vale shareholder group has asked Brazil’s securities regulator CVM to investigate the company’s conduct, alleging Vale did not fulfill its obligation to disclose the risks and impact of its activities at the mine.  Vale said it will postpone its planned February earnings and production releases until March as a result of the disaster.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China opened a pivotal round of high-level talks on Wednesday aimed at bridging deep differences over China’s intellectual property and technology transfer practices and easing a months-long tariff war. Cabinet-level officials, led by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, met in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House, with only a month left to reach a deal before a March 2 U.S. deadline to increase tariffs on Chinese goods. But details of the closed-door talks were scant, with  official statements seen as unlikely before they conclude on Thursday. A USTR spokeswoman declined comment on the discussions. The talks began with an awkward silence on both sides of a long negotiating table during a photo opportunity, broken when Lighthizer made joking remarks about table positioning and appearing in photographs of a dinner between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in December. It was at that meeting in Buenos Aires that leaders of the world’s two largest economies called a 90-day truce to try to work out trade differences through negotiations. Wednesday’s meeting was the highest-level gathering since then. Liu, who is Xi’s top economic adviser, is expected to meet with Trump on Thursday.  Seated next to Liu was People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, a reform-minded official has advocated further opening of China’s financial services markets, with officials from the  Finance and Commerce ministries also present. Trump’s top trade, finance and economic officials flanked Lighthizer on the U.S. side, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and White House advisers Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro.    The talks began two days after the United States charged Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide. Meng was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which is seeking to have her extradited. Mnuchin and Ross have insisted that there is no link between the trade talks and the Huawei case. The talks in Washington are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Chinese officials are willing to address core U.S. demands to fully protect American intellectual property rights and end policies that Washington has said force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms. The U.S. complaints, along with accusations of Chinese cyber theft of U.S. trade secrets and a systematic campaign to acquire U.S. technology firms, were used by the Trump administration to justify punitive U.S. tariffs on $250 billion (£191 billion) worth of Chinese imports. Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2 if an agreement cannot be reached. He has also threatened new tariffs on the remainder of Chinese goods shipped to the United States. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own, but has suspended some and is allowing some purchases of U.S. soybeans during the talks. Chinese officials deny that their policies coerce technology transfers.  They have emphasized steps already taken, including reduced automotive tariffs and a draft foreign investment law that improves access for foreign firms and promises to outlaw “administrative means to force the transfer of technology.” China is fast-tracking that new law, with the country’s largely rubber-stamp parliament likely to approve it in March. A crucial component of any progress in the talks, according to top Trump administration officials, is agreement on a mechanism to verify and “enforce” China’s follow-through on any reform pledges that it makes. This could maintain the threat of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods for the long term. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, asked whether anecdotal evidence of tariff effects had influenced the Fed’s decision not to hike interest rates on Wednesday, said the duties so far have not had a material effect on economic output. “The concern, for me, is a longer drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth could result in sapping business confidence,” Powell told a news conference. “Uncertainty is not the friend of business.” Some business executives expressed hopes for progress in the talks, including Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. Aircraft exports have thus far been spared from retaliatory Chinese tariffs. “We do see some convergence happening, we think both countries are leaning forward and we anticipate some successful conclusions to those trade talks,” Muilenburg told CNBC. A breakthrough deal was unlikely this week as both sides may wait to reveal their best offers, said Erin Ennis, senior vice president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “I don’t think there’s going to be any big outcome,” Ennis said of the talks. “Hopefully they make some good progress that will set them up to be able to get to completion at the end of the 90 days.” But the Chinese side would likely have to bring to the table a new offer that goes significantly beyond its previous offers to significantly increase purchases of U.S. goods, including soybeans, energy and manufactured goods.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament has demanded that Prime Minister Theresa May renegotiate a Brexit divorce deal that the other members of the European Union say they will not reopen. Less than two months until the United Kingdom is due by law to leave the EU, the options include a disorderly Brexit, a delay to Brexit or no Brexit at all. Below is a summary of what is due to happen next: Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had refused to hold talks on Brexit with May, said after the vote on Tuesday night that he was now prepared to meet with her. That meeting is due to take place at 1500 GMT on Wednesday, with a source in his party saying Corbyn would tell May a no-deal exit must be taken off the table and she should pursue his party’s “alternative plan” for Brexit. May’s Conservatives do not have a majority in parliament and many of her own MPs and the small Northern Irish Party which props up her government oppose her deal as it stands, so winning the support of Labour would help ensure she can get it through parliament. The meeting is not expected to result in a breakthrough. On Tuesday, MPs backed a symbolic call on the government to stop a potentially disorderly no-deal exit, sending a signal that most oppose such a departure. It does not bind the government but May said she would talk to MPs to discuss how that outcome could be prevented by securing a deal which parliament could support. May also said she would engage seriously with a compromise plan put forward by Conservative MPs which seeks to draw a line under internal divisions that have so far prevented parliament approving a deal. It courts Brexiteers with a promise to ditch an unpopular Irish border policy in favour of an alternative, and appeals to remain-supporting Conservatives by pledging safeguards against the risk of disruption if no deal can be agreed with the EU. May has said she will speak to the EU to seek the changes demanded by parliament, but she has no confirmed plans to travel to Brussels yet. EU27 ambassadors are due to meet on Wednesday to discuss Brexit, and May will speak to European Council President Donald Tusk by phone at 1745 GMT on Wednesday. On Tuesday Tusk said the divorce deal was not up for renegotiation. May will also speak to Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar later on Wednesday. May said the government would bring a revised deal back to parliament for a vote as soon as possible. Before the previous vote, parliament held five days of debate but it is not clear whether there would be another lengthy debate before any subsequent vote. May said that if she did not bring a deal back for a vote by Feb. 13, she would make a statement to parliament and put forward a motion for debate on Feb. 14. MPs will be able to put propose amendments to that motion. An attempt by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper and Conservative Nick Boles to give parliament the power to request a delay to Britain’s March 29 exit was defeated by MPs on Tuesday, but Boles said he would renew that effort on Feb. 14 if a deal has not been passed by then.  “We remain committed to ensuring that we don’t reach the cliff edge on 29 March without a deal,” Boles and Cooper said in a statement on Tuesday. May also said that if she brings a deal back for a vote and it is rejected, she will put forward a motion the following day which MPs will be able to propose amendments to.  All EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels on March 21-22. This could be an opportunity for an eleventh-hour deal, or it would be the last chance to agree an extension of the Article 50 negotiation period and delay Brexit to avoid no-deal disruptions.  If May does not get a deal approved by parliament by March 29, Britain faces a disorderly exit, or may be forced to seek an extension of Article 50 to give more time to reach an agreement. It is not certain the EU would agree to this. Some MPs, including Labour leader Corbyn, have said it is now “inevitable” that the government will have to seek an extension regardless, as there will not be enough time to pass the necessary legislation for Britain’s exit before March 29. Last week the leader of Britain’s lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, said the date might need to be pushed back by a couple of weeks. The bloc will vote to elect a new European Parliament on May 23-26. The new chamber would sit from July 2, a date that is shaping up to be the EU’s limit for any extension of Article 50.  The EU says Britain would have to organise European Parliament elections on its soil if it were to delay Brexit beyond that as otherwise its people would be deprived of their democratic representation while still being in the EU. The bloc fears Britain would not do that. Some in the EU also fear that, should Britain vote, it would elect a staunchly eurosceptic representation to the European Parliament that is already expected to have a larger contingent of EU critics influencing the bloc’s policies.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Brexit negotiators have spent two years looking at alternatives to the backstop insurance policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and have not found any that work, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Wednesday. British lawmakers ordered Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday to renegotiate the divorce deal she struck with the European Union in November to remove the backstop, which would require some EU rules to apply in British-ruled Northern Ireland until an alternative plan can be found to keep the border open.  Brexit minister Stephen Barclay said possible options to resolve the issue included time limits, exit clauses and technological solutions. But Coveney told national broadcaster RTE that none of those proposals were new. “We have been through all of these things. We have tested them and we have found that they do not stand up to scrutiny, and now we have a British prime minister advocating again for the same things that were tested,” Coveney said. “What we are being asked to do here is to compromise on a solution that works and to replace it with wishful thinking. That’s what’s being asked of the Irish government and we won’t do it.” May has said she will seek “legally binding changes” to the divorce deal but has been met with a blunt response from the EU, with European Council President Donald Tusk, among others, backing Dublin in saying it was not up for renegotiation. Coveney said there were mechanisms to get around some of the challenges May faces but the only way to do so was through the accompanying political declaration on future EU-UK ties. Unlike the binding divorce agreement, the non-binding declaration can be renegotiated to ease concerns on the backstop, he said. However both sides were “running out of road” to prevent Britain crashing out of the bloc at the end of March without an agreement, he added. Coveney also challenged May to stand by previous statements that the backstop was necessary to rule out a return of checks between British-run Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland. He rejected any view in London that the potential economic damage to Ireland from a no deal Brexit would weaken its resolve. In a speech later on Wednesday, he said: “It is vitally important that politicians in Westminster understand the overwhelming wish across society in Northern Ireland not to return to the borders and division of times past.” “Anybody who allows that to happen will be judged harshly by history and rightly so. This government in Dublin is not going to allow it and I want to be crystal clear, there are some things that are more important than economic consequences.” Editing by Alison Williams and Angus MacSwan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland-coveney/ireland-says-brexit-backstop-alternatives-tested-none-work-idUKKCN1PO18N,2019-02-08,,"Ireland says Brexit backstop alternatives tested, none work"

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain must spell out quickly what changes it envisages to the Irish “backstop”, an arrangement to avoid a hard border between EU member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland after Brexit, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday. Britain’s parliament late on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to seek changes from the European Union in the negotiated divorce deal, which includes the backstop. The EU has repeatedly said the deal cannot be reopened. [L5N1ZU1MC] The House of Commons, the lower chamber, also voted late on Tuesday in favour of an amendment ruling out a no-deal Brexit, though that measure is not legally binding. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29. “It is important that the British lower house spoke out yesterday against a disorderly Brexit as no one can have an interest in that,” Maas said. “But the British government has not yet said what changes to the Northern Ireland backstop it envisages. It must now say quickly what it wants because time is running out,” Maas added. “We are ready to talk. Our position is clear: the Withdrawal Agreement is the best and only solution for an orderly exit.” The comments from Maas, a leading member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, suggest Germany could be open to fresh talks on the backstop, the main obstacle to concluding the Brexit divorce deal. Many British lawmakers, especially in May’s governing Conservative Party, fear the backstop will trap the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit. Ireland and the rest of the EU say there is no credible alternative to the backstop, which would prevent customs and other checks having to be conducted after Brexit on the border between the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland. “On the backstop, Germany and the whole (European) Union stand firmly at Ireland’s side. We will not allow Ireland to be isolated on this issue,” Maas said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling fell sharply on Tuesday after British lawmakers voted down a proposal in parliament that could have prevented a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit. With two months left until Britain is due by law to leave the European Union, parliament instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to renegotiate an exit treaty that the EU says it will not change.   Growing expectations that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit have fuelled a 3 percent rally in the pound this month against the dollar and the euro. Many traders expected further gains for sterling on Tuesday, but instead the pound tumbled after lawmakers rejected a plan to legislate a delay to Brexit next month if May fails to secure concessions from Brussels. “We are looking again at the Brexit deadline of March 29 as a cliff-edge event ... That disappointed many betting on a sterling recovery,” said WorldFirst head of FX strategy Jeremy Cook. He said there were more downside risks for sterling in the days ahead. Lawmakers did pass another amendment, put forward by Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady, that was intended to strengthen May’s hand by giving her a clear mandate for a renegotiation in Brussels. But traders said that fears of a no-deal Brexit were driving the pound down. “She (May) is taking a risky task going back to Brussels to renegotiate,” said Joseph Trevisani, a senior analyst at FX Street in New York.  “As long as May controls the process, sterling is not going to collapse, but the market is still clearly worried about a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.” At 2130 GMT, sterling was down 0.7 percent at a three-day low of $1.3057. It also sank 0.8 percent to 87.56 pence against the euro, the day’s low. Other investors were less concerned by Tuesday’s votes.  “With the Conservative party finally uniting behind Theresa May, reducing general election risks, we see such negative tail risk scenarios as still unlikely to play out,” said Mohammed Kazmi, a portfolio manager at UBP in Geneva. “Sentiment towards UK assets will now be determined by the next round of negotiations,” he added. The pound remains well below a 3-1/2 month high of $1.3218, and a spike in volatility in the derivatives market reflects deepening fears about where Brexit, and Britain’s economy, are heading. Brady’s amendment calls for the Irish backstop arrangement written into May’s Brexit divorce deal, agreed with Brussels, to be removed and replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid customs checks between EU-member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit. Many in May’s party oppose it, fearing it could trap Britain in a permanent customs union.  Market nervousness was reflected in a rise in implied sterling volatility on options markets, which has fallen steadily since the start of the year. Overnight implied volatility in particular raced to near 23 vol, the highest since Jan. 15, when lawmakers defeated May’s Brexit deal.        One-month implied volatility rose to its highest in a week and a half at 11.2 vol, a day after seeing the biggest one-day rise since November.

2019-02-08,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian man charged with the murder of eight men who disappeared over several years pleaded guilty to the charges on Tuesday, police said, in a case that shook Toronto’s gay community. Bruce McArthur, a 67-year-old landscaper, was arrested last January, and most of his victims, some of whose remains were found on a property where he worked, had ties to the Gay Village area in downtown Toronto. Toronto police have been criticized by some in the LGBTQ community for taking years to solve disappearances dating back to at least 2010 in the Gay Village neighbourhood. Detective David Dickinson, who spoke to media at the Ontario Superior Court, said the motive for the killing was not yet known. Dickinson said sentencing would take place Feb 4 with victim-impact statements on the same day. Police confirmed the names of the victims as Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Mahmudi, Dean Lisowick, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, Skandaraj Navaratnam and Abdulbasir Faizi. McArthur will likely have the mandatory minimum of life imprisonment and be eligible for parole in 25 years, according to University of Ottawa Faculty of Law assistant professor, Kyle Kirkup.  “I hope that there will be some solace for the families and friends of the victims, and for the community more broadly,” said Rachel Giese, editorial director of the Daily Xtra, a Canadian news outlet for LGBTQ community. “However, I don’t think this doesn’t end the questions about how this was handled by the police, and what will be done to make sure there will be true justice for the victims, for the families, and for the community.”     Reporting by Tyler Choi; Editing by Bernadette Baum",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-canada-crime-serial/canadian-serial-killer-pleads-guilty-to-murder-of-eight-people-idUKKCN1PN26D,2019-02-08,,Canadian serial killer pleads guilty to murder of eight people
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a controversial Irish border arrangement - and promptly received a flat rejection from Brussels. Two weeks after overwhelmingly rejecting May’s Brexit deal, parliament backed a proposal intended to send her back to Brussels with a stronger mandate to seek changes that were more likely to win their support. At the same time, they rejected a proposal to give parliament a path to prevent a potentially chaotic ‘no-deal’ exit by making May ask Brussels for a delay if she cannot get a deal through parliament. With two months left until Britain is due by law to leave the EU, investors and allies have urged the government to clinch a deal to allow an orderly exit from the club it joined in 1973. “Tonight, a majority of honourable members have said they would support a deal with changes to the backstop,” May said, only two weeks after her divorce deal was crushed in the biggest parliamentary defeat in modern British history. “It is now clear that there is a route that can secure a substantial and sustainable majority in the house for leaving the EU with a deal,” May said, adding she would seek “legally binding changes”. The Irish backstop is an insurance policy that aims to prevent the reintroduction of a hard border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland, a crucial part of a 1998 peace deal that ended decades of sectarian violence, and preserve frictionless trade.  However, critics said it could bind the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules indefinitely. The proposal, put forward by influential Conservative lawmaker Graham Brady and passed by 317 votes to 301, called for the backstop to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”, and said parliament would support May’s Brexit deal if such a change was made. However, Brussels has repeatedly said it does not want to reopen a treaty signed off by the other 27 EU leaders. Speaking immediately after the vote in parliament, a spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk said the backstop was part of the withdrawal deal and not up for negotiation, a stance echoed by the Irish government. “This is a deal which was negotiated with the UK, by the UK, signed off by the UK and the prime minister - and now it looks as though this evening, essentially, there is a row-back and a reneging on the commitments that were made,” said Irish European Affairs minister Helen McEntee. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said there could be no renegotiation and demanded a “credible” British proposal.  If the British parliament cannot find a majority for a way forward, the United Kingdom will leave the largest global trading bloc without any deal, a scenario that businesses fear will bring chaos to the world’s fifth biggest economy. Neither May nor her ministers spelled out what compromises she would seek from the EU, but suggestions include securing a time limit to the backstop or allowing a unilateral exit clause - elements that defeat its purpose, according to the EU. Hardline pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers made clear that their support for May on Tuesday was conditional on her securing a deal they approved of.  “The backstop is not going to get through this parliament,” Steve Baker, a leading member of the group, told Reuters. “Change the backstop, fix the date of the end of the implementation period, and agree a plan C.” However, EU diplomats played down May’s chances of being able to present a substantially different deal to the British parliament in a decisive vote expected to take place on Feb. 13.  “May will now come back to Brussels and be rebuffed,” one diplomat said. “The House of Commons will have to vote again mid-February on plan C. And it will have to be plan A all over again, but with even more pressure of no-deal Brexit looming.” Members of parliament (MPs) on Tuesday rejected two amendments that set out a clear path for parliament to prevent a no-deal exit if May cannot get a deal passed next month. However, they did later approve a symbolic proposal calling on the government to stop a potentially disorderly no-deal exit, sending a signal that a majority oppose such a departure. It provided no mechanism for preventing a no-deal Brexit, but kept open the option that members of parliament could try to take the initiative in the “amendable” vote that May has promised for Feb. 14 if she cannot get a deal approved. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would meet May to “find a sensible Brexit solution that works for the whole country”, listing changes that Labour wanted to see, but that May has shown no sign of supporting. Sterling, which recently hit a 2-1/2-month high of $1.3218 on hopes that a no-deal Brexit would be avoided, fell about 0.8 percent. [GBP/] “This isn’t a good night for the country,” Labour lawmaker Wes Streeting tweeted. “The prime minister voted against her own deal to go back to Brussels for something she’s said is impossible. MPs voted against ‘no deal’ - but also voted to make ‘no deal’ more likely.

The Justice Department alleged that Huawei Device Co Ltd and Huawei Device USA Inc committed wire fraud and obstructed justice by stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile to test smartphones’ durability. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington said a corporate representative for Huawei would appear at the arraignment. Huawei did not immediately comment. Separately, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have also charged Huawei and its affiliates with bank and wire fraud on allegations that they violated sanctions against Iran. That separate 13-count indictment made public Monday. No arraignment date has been set in that case, which has added to Washington’s tensions with Beijing. T-Mobile had accused Huawei of stealing the technology, called “Tappy,” which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones. Huawei has said the two companies settled their disputes in 2017. The charges add to pressure from the U.S. government on Huawei, the world’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker. Washington is trying to prevent American companies from buying Huawei routers and switches and pressing allies to do the same. Court records show the two Huawei units has retained several high-profile lawyers including former Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole, a partner at Sidley Austin LLP; former Justice Department lawyer David Bitkower, a partner at Jenner & Block; former federal prosecutor Robert Westinghouse, a partner at Yarmuth LLP; and two lawyers at Steptoe & Johnson LLP.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European Parliament committee proposed on Tuesday that Britons should enjoy visa-free travel to Europe after Brexit, regardless of whether the bloc’s divorce with Britain goes smoothly or becomes a damaging, abrupt split.  The committee’s decision — adopted unanimously with 53 votes in favour — must be endorsed by the full parliament next month, which is likely as other EU institutions have backed a move to relaxed visa requirements for Britain after Brexit, provided London reciprocates. The parliamentary motion covers both a scenario under which Prime Minister Theresa May breaks the deadlock at home and manages to get the divorce deal she negotiated with the EU ratified by the UK parliament, as well as a no-deal Brexit.  It will also have to be agreed to by the EU’s executive Commission and the European Council, which represents all member states of the union.  EU visa exemptions cover short trips of up to three months and currently some 60 countries in the world, from Argentina to Japan to Ukraine, benefit from the system.  The visa waiver is designed for business and tourism and does not grant the right to work in the EU.  Parallel talks among EU states on letting Britons visit without visas following a no-deal Brexit were delayed last week, diplomatic sources said, after Spain raised objections over Gibraltar, a British territory to which Madrid lays claim. Spanish diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Madrid would insist on excluding Gibraltar from any Brexit deal, as it plans to revive its bid for shared sovereignty over the rocky outpost. The dispute between Madrid and London has already threatened to derail the whole Brexit negotiation process, but a last-minute deal with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cleared the way in November for the 27 EU states to approve the divorce package. But Britain is struggling to ratify the deal, which parliament rejected on Jan. 15. MPs seeking alternatives to May’s troubled plan will hold a series of votes later on Tuesday. The EU insists reciprocity is a key element of its visa policy and Britain has also said it wants to allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity after Brexit. Some countries in the EU’s ex-communist east are nevertheless concerned that Britain could try to curb their citizens’ travel after Brexit. Unease among Britons over migrant workers from those and other poorer EU states was a key factor in the narrow 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU.  Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus have long complained that their citizens are excluded from a scheme that allows most Europeans to travel to the United States, and Americans to visit Europe, without needing a visa.

Northern Irish police said the main focus of the investigation was on the New IRA - one of a small number of groups opposed to a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of violence in the British-run province. “We also caution those who collaborate with the British that they are to desist immediately as no more warnings will be given,” the statement to the Journal said. No one was injured in the blast outside a courthouse on Jan. 19 but the incident highlighted the threat still posed by militant groups opposed to the peace agreement. Police in Northern Ireland and European Union member Ireland have said that a return to a hard border between the two after Britain leaves the EU, complete with customs and other checks, could see a return to strife. In the statement the group denied that Brexit was a motivating factor for their actions. “All this talk of Brexit, hard borders, soft borders, has no bearing on our actions and the IRA won’t be going anywhere.” “Our fight goes on,” it said.

May is under acute pressure to find a way out of Britain’s worst political crisis since World War Two after her proposed deal for leaving the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament earlier this month. The new plan aims to broker peace between Conservatives who voted ‘leave’ and those who voted ‘remain’ in the 2016 Brexit referendum and has been endorsed by senior figures from both sides. The small Northern Irish party that props up May’s minority government has also indicated its support.  It courts Brexiteers with a promise to ditch an unpopular Irish border policy in favour of an alternative, and appeals to remain-supporting Conservatives by pledging safeguards against the risk of disruption if no deal can be agreed with the EU. But, its chances of success depend on the both official endorsement from May, and a change in policy from EU negotiators.  The EU has so far been unwilling to consider reopening the withdrawal agreement it reached with May, and which was subsequently rejected  by parliament in a Jan. 16 vote. That would be required under the new plan in order to replace the Irish backstop, a policy designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland if no better agreement can be reached. The new plan - dubbed the Malthouse Compromise after one of its backers Kit Malthouse - was announced on the eve of a debate in parliament over May’s response to the rejection of her original deal. May has not yet commented on the Malthouse plan. But she has already said she wants to go back to the EU to renegotiate the backstop, without setting out what changes she is seeking. She is hoping that MPs signal their support for this, and add pressure to the EU to reopen talks by voting to approve a statement calling on her to replace it with “alternative arrangements”. The Malthouse plan itself will not be directly discussed or voted upon during the debate, but its backers are hoping May will verbally endorse it as a way to unite the party.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Royal Mail Plc reined in its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday and spoke of a larger than expected decline in letter volumes, sending its shares down as much as 18 percent to a record low. Hit by reduced letter volumes as more people switch to email, Royal Mail has been reviewing its operations and testing methods including automation, to deliver post and parcels as its attempts to cut costs have been slower than expected. “While the rate of e-substitution remains in line with our expectations, business uncertainty is impacting letter volumes,” said Chief Executive Officer Rico Back, who took the top job last year. The company also said it would focus on protecting margins in its General Logistics Systems (GLS) business, and warned of slowing GLS volume growth next year as a result. GLS, formerly run by CEO Back, is a ground-based parcel network which operates in 41 countries and nation-states in Europe as well as eight states in the U.S. and in Canada. It accounts for a fourth of the company’s revenue. The former British postal monopoly said it expected adjusted operating profit before transformation costs to range between 500 and 530 million pounds for the year ending March 31, below its previous forecast of 500-550 million pounds. That represents a big fall on its adjusted operating profit before costs of 694 million pounds ($914 million) a year ago. Royal Mail shares traded 7 percent lower at 278.8 pence at 0855 GMT, after hitting an all-time low of 246.6 pence in early deals. This was well below the 330 pence price at which they were floated more than five years ago. The company, which was recently downgraded from the blue-chip index to the mid-caps, said the decline in addressed letter volumes, excluding political parties’ election mailings, would likely be wider than its forecast range of 4-6 percent in 2019-20. It expects addressed letter volumes to fall 7-8 percent for the current year and said the volumes were likely to be outside its forecast medium-term range next year. The company’s update prompted Liberum analysts to say they expect downward pressure on consensus for 2019-2020 due to the cautious guidance on UK letter volumes and GLS growth. However, the parcels business in the UK performed well over Christmas, with the number of parcels handled in the December trading period up 10 percent to 164 million.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States should bear responsibility for the consequences of its sanctions on Venezuela, China said on Tuesday, after Washington imposed sweeping restrictions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA.   The latest U.S. sanctions announced on Monday appear to be aimed at pressuring President Nicolas Maduro to step down and to build on the momentum that has mounted in recent weeks against him at home and abroad.  Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week with U.S. backing, and who is supported by most Western countries, says Maduro stole his re-election and must resign to allow new, fair polls. China has said it opposes unilateral sanctions. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said historical experience showed foreign interference “only makes situations more complicated”. “The relevant country’s sanctions on Venezuela will lead to the deterioration of conditions of people’s lives,” Geng told a regular news briefing in Beijing, referring to the United States. “They should bear responsibility for the serious consequences from this,” he said. China has lent more than $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy.  But the financing dried up as the South American country’s economy began spiralling downward in 2015, pressured by plummeting oil prices. The Trump administration had long held off targeting Venezuela’s oil sector for fear that it would hurt U.S. refiners and raise oil prices for Americans. White House officials had also expressed concern about inflicting further hardship on the Venezuelan people.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Former world number one Andy Murray has undergone a hip resurfacing surgery in London, the 31-year-old Scot said on Tuesday. Murray has struggled to regain form since undergoing hip surgery last year and was knocked out in the first round of the Australian Open earlier this month, having said the tournament could be his last as a professional. His post on Instagram featured an X-ray picture of his hip. “I now have a metal hip,” Murray wrote in his post. “Feeling a bit battered and bruised just now but hopefully that will be the end of my hip pain.” In an emotional news conference in Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open, Murray announced he would retire this year, preferably after a farewell appearance at Wimbledon. The two-time Olympic champion told BBC this month that surgery was the only option if he wanted to extend his career. “There is a strong possibility I won’t come back and play after an operation. I want to play tennis, but not with the hip I have right now,” he said. The ATP Tour posted a tweet in support for Murray: “Get well soon Andy, we know you will do everything to get back on tour!” Three-time Grand Slam Murray initially had surgery on his right hip in January 2018 and has played 15 matches since returning to action last June. He was due to play in next month’s Marseille Open but withdrew from the tournament last week.

2019-02-08,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale SA’s shares plunged on Monday, wiping out 71.34 billion reais ($18.96 billion) in market value, after a tailing dam collapse on Friday killed scores of people at one of its mines, less than four years after a similar disaster. Vale shares fell 24 percent to close at 42.65 reais, their steepest daily drop ever in percentage terms. Brazil’s stock market was closed on Friday when the disaster occurred. Vale’s ADR fell 8.1 percent on Friday and 18 percent on Monday, to close at $11.20, the lowest close since December 2017. Prosecutors, politicians and victims’ families called for punishment, as fears grew that the death toll from the disaster, already 65, could soar into the hundreds. Fines, lawsuits and a regulatory crackdown were expected. The company suspended dividend payments late on Sunday. “The fact is that Vale’s share drop was even steeper than some market participants expected,” said Igor Lima, a fund manager and partner at Galt Capital in Rio de Janeiro. “At the same time, the reaction of the government and other public agencies has been quite a bit stronger than in the Samarco accident,” he said, referring to a 2015 mining dam burst involving a Vale joint venture. “This reaction has brought quite a lot of uncertainty about the size of the financial punishment Vale will have to handle.” Brazil’s top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said. HSBC and Jefferies have already cut their recommendations for the shares to hold from buy. Other analysts have held back, saying they are trying to figure out potential damages. A law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Vale and its top executives in a New York court.  Previ, Brazil’s largest pension fund and a major shareholder at the mining company, said in a statement that it could absorb the impact from the steep share price drop without the need to eventually sell any of its holdings.  “Billions of dollars in Vale’s assets have already been frozen as we discussed this weekend,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations LLC in Milwaukee, adding that the lost production from the affected mine could be made up elsewhere in Vale’s system. “There remains a fair chance that all of Vale’s dams (which exceed 100 in count) will also be coming under great scrutiny going forward,” said Underhill. Vale bond prices also fell, with the yield on its August 2026 bonds jumping to 5.7 percent from 4.6 percent early on Friday before the dam bust, according to Market Axess Bondticker.  Fitch downgraded the company’s debt on Monday to BBB- and placed it on ratings watch negative. Late on Friday, Standard & Poor’s put Vale’s debt under review for possible downgrade. So far, Brazilian courts have issued orders to freeze 11.8 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in Vale’s accounts to cover rescue efforts and damages. The company had around 24 billion reais in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter.   Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients they anticipated regulatory changes for tailings dams because it was the second disaster in less than four years, after the fatal 2015 dam burst at Samarco Mineracao, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Group.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will deliver the annual State of the Union address next week after accepting an invitation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had postponed it due to the partial shutdown of the U.S. government. The nationally televised address from the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, now set for Feb. 5, presents Trump with a powerful opportunity to appeal directly to the American public to support his policies, including his demand that Congress fund a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The speech had originally been scheduled for Jan. 29, but Pelosi cancelled it last week, saying it should not be delivered until a partial government shutdown was over. The record-long shutdown, brought about by a fight between the White House and Democrats in Congress over his wall funding demands, ended on Friday after 35 days, paving the way for the speech to go ahead. In a letter to Trump on Monday that she posted to Twitter, Pelosi said the two had spoken and agreed on the new date. “It is my great honour to accept,” Trump wrote in reply. In mid-January, Pelosi had suggested to Trump that he reschedule the speech, citing security concerns related to the shutdown, and the next day Trump blocked an overseas trip Pelosi had planned in a move many saw as retribution. Last Wednesday, Trump told Pelosi he was looking forward to delivering the speech as scheduled, but Pelosi - the top ranking Democrat in Congress - quickly yanked her invitation in what was widely seen as an effort to deprive Trump of the national spotlight in the middle of the border wall fight.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy was expected to lose $3 billion from the partial federal government shutdown over President Donald Trump’s demand for border wall funding, congressional researchers said on Monday as 800,000 federal employees returned to work after 35 days without pay. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the cost of the shutdown would make the U.S. economy 0.02 percent smaller than expected in 2019. More significant effects will be felt by individual businesses and workers, particularly those who scrambled to make ends after not being paid. Overall, the U.S. economy lost about $11 billion during the five-week period, the CBO said. It expects $8 billion to be recovered, however, as the government reopens and employees receive back pay. The longest shutdown in U.S. history ended on Friday when Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding - without money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall - as the effects of the shutdown intensified across the country. The Republican president had demanded that legislation to fund the government contain $5.7 billion for his long-promised wall. He says it is necessary to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling, while Democrats call it costly and inefficient. A committee of Republican and Democratic lawmakers have scheduled an initial meeting on Wednesday, which will be open to the public, as they try to negotiate a compromise on border security before the Feb. 15 deadline. That session is likely to see little more than opening statements by lawmakers. Subsequent meetings could be conducted in private, where the hard bargaining would take place, several congressional aides said. Owing to rules governing legislation in the House of Representatives requiring a 72-hour period for lawmakers to review legislation before having to vote on it, the committee might have to wrap up its work by around Feb. 10 in order to meet a Feb. 15 deadline for congressional approval.  Trump said he would be willing to shut down the government again if lawmakers do not reach a deal he finds acceptable on border security. On Sunday, he expressed skepticism such an deal could be made. Trump has also said he might declare a national emergency to get money for the border wall. Democrats would likely challenge that in court. Democratic lawmakers said the CBO report served as a stark warning to Trump against another shutdown. “Families across the nation are still trying to recover from a month of missing paychecks and overdue bills, but the president is already threatening a second shutdown if he doesn’t get his way,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat.  Most employees should be paid by Thursday for back wages, which one study estimated at $6 billion for all those who worked without pay or were furloughed. Contractors and businesses that relied on federal workers’ business face huge losses, although some lawmakers are pushing legislation to pay contractors back as well. Federal workers poured out of Washington’s public transportation system on Monday. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai greeted employees in the lobby, while the Securities and Exchange Commission offered  doughnuts, fruit and coffee. The National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday it had been unable to send investigators to 22 accidents during the shutdown, including 15 aviation accidents resulting in 21 deaths. “These 22 accidents now require investigative action,” the safety agency said, but added that evidence “may have been lost.” The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was reviewing five weeks of auto safety recalls that had been submitted by automakers, but has not yet begun posting them publicly.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slid on Monday as optimism about the end of a U.S. government shutdown faded and growth worries reared their head again. The pan-European STOXX 600 lost 0.97 percent, its biggest fall since Jan. 3, as a profit warning from Caterpillar cemented investors’ pessimistic mood after data showed the second consecutive drop in Chinese industrial profits in December.   The double whammy of negative industrial news drove investors to dump risky assets, with banks, tech, autos and oil among the worst-performing. Investors have remained highly sceptical of European stocks despite a relatively robust rally year-to-date. “Medium-term threats to European unity, the European economy’s still-anaemic growth and its dependence on trade do make us cautious toward European risk assets,” said Blackrock global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill in a note.  A profit warning from Caterpillar, the U.S. heavy machinery and vehicle maker seen as a bellwether for global economic activity, drove European stocks further down and abruptly ended an early rally in mining shares. Italian heavy machinery maker CNH Industrial tumbled 3.8 percent, the biggest faller on the FTSE MIB. Reflecting investors’ fears about global growth, financials were the biggest drag on the STOXX 600, with HSBC, Santander, Allianz, and BNP Paribas down 0.8 to 1.8 percent.  Oil majors BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Total tumbled as Brent crude futures suffered their biggest one-day drop in a month on evidence of yet more growth in U.S. crude supply.  The oil sector fell 1.9 percent, its biggest loss in five weeks. In single-stock moves, German biotech firm MorphoSys led losers with a 7.7 percent fall after a U.S. court ruled three Morphosys patents invalid, in a lawsuit against Janssen Biotech and Genmab.  “MorphoSys’ management commented that it is disappointed and will consider all of its options (including a potential appeal),” wrote Deutsche Bank analysts, cutting their target price on the stock to 125 euros from 130.  Genmab shares were up 2.5 percent.  Another big loser was Alstom, which fell 3.6 percent after the French group and Germany’s Siemens offered new concessions to try to satisfy the European Commission’s antitrust concerns over their plan to merge.  Despite the last-minute concessions, their efforts to create a European rail champion could yet be scuppered. Shares in Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro dropped 4.3 percent as aluminium prices fell following the United States’ decision to lift sanctions on the world’s second largest aluminium producer United Company Rusal.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro oversaw a display of the army’s Russian hardware on Sunday, with anti-aircraft flak and tank rounds pounding a hillside to show military force and loyalty in the face of an international ultimatum for new elections.     Maduro, 56, is confronting an unprecedented challenge to his authority after opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president, citing a fraudulent election. Guaido has won wide international support and offers amnesty to soldiers who join him.  On Sunday, Israel and Australia joined the countries backing the 35-year-old leader, and President Donald Trump’s administration said it had accepted Venezuelan opposition figure Carlos Alfredo Vecchio as the country’s diplomatic representative in the United States. Early on Sunday, alongside Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino, Maduro watched a platoon of soldiers release volleys of rocket-propelled grenades, machine-gun anti-aircraft fire and tank rounds at hillside targets, the Russian ordnance kicking up clouds of dust at the Fort of Paramacay, an armoured vehicle base. Maduro said the display showed the world he had the backing of the military and that Venezuela’s armed forces were ready to defend the country. Maduro says Guaido is taking part in a coup directed by Trump’s hardline policy advisers, who include Cold War veterans John Bolton and Elliott Abrams. “Nobody respects the weak, cowards, traitors. In this world, what’s respected is the brave, the courageous, power,” Maduro said.  “Nobody should even think of stepping on this sacred soil. Venezuela wants peace,” he said. “To guarantee peace, we have to be prepared.”  From Feb. 10 to 15, the military is planning larger exercises that Maduro described as the “most important in the history of Venezuela.”  The show of force was accompanied by a government publicity campaign online based on the slogan “Always Loyal, Never a Traitor,” and followed a high-profile defection by the country’s top military diplomat in the United States on Saturday. The Fort of Paramacay, about two hours west of the capital, Caracas, was itself the site of an uprising in 2017, when about 20 soldiers and armed civilians attacked the base. The leader of the attack, which was quickly subdued, said he was calling for a transitional government.  Maduro on Sunday denounced an alleged conspiracy aimed at spreading rebellion in the army, saying thousands of messages were being sent to soldiers every day over WhatsApp and other social media platforms from neighbouring Colombia. He later jogged with soldiers and boarded an amphibious vehicle at a navy base. Guaido also sent a message to the military on Sunday, asking for support and ordering it not to repress civilians during an event in which supporters handed out copies of a proposed amnesty for people accused of crimes in the Maduro government. “I order you not to shoot,” he said. “I order you not to repress the people.” At a U.N. Security Council debate on Saturday, Russia and China strongly backed Maduro and rejected calls by the United States, Canada, Latin American nations and European powers for early elections. Both Russia and China are major creditors of Venezuela. Since the government of Maduro’s late mentor, Hugo Chavez, the OPEC nation has invested heavily in Russian weaponry, including Sukhoi fighter jets and heavy armour. The strategic alliance was in evidence last year, when two Russian nuclear-capable bombers landed in Venezuela. Reuters reported on Friday that private military contractors who do secret missions for Russia flew into Venezuela to beef up security for Maduro. In an interview that aired on Sunday, Maduro rejected a European ultimatum to call elections within eight days and said Guaido violated the constitution by declaring himself interim leader. He said European nations should leave Venezuela, if they so wanted. “Fortunately, we don’t depend on Europe. And those arrogant, overbearing attitudes, looking down on us, because we are ‘sudacas,’ inferior to them,” he told CNN Turk. “The leaders of Europe are sycophants, kneeling behind the policies of Donald Trump,” he said, adding he was open to dialog and that meeting Trump was improbable but not impossible.  Washington urged the world on Saturday to “pick a side” on Venezuela and financially disconnect from Maduro’s government. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, warned on Sunday against violence or the intimidation of American diplomats in Venezuela or Guaido, saying such action would trigger a response from the United States. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro, with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has led millions to leave the country and with inflation seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise Guaido if Maduro failed to call new elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was “absurd” and the Venezuelan foreign minister called “childlike.”  The United States, Canada, most Latin American nations and many European states say Maduro stole his second-term election win last May. The former union leader cruised to victory after blocking the main opposition candidates from running. Turnout was low. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan voiced his support for Maduro in a phone call on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader and self-declared president Juan Guaido has asked British authorities to stop President Nicolas Maduro gaining access to gold reserves held in the Bank of England, according to letters released by his party on Sunday. Maduro has been disavowed by a broad group of Western nations and Latin American neighbours that accuse him of undermining democracy, and a growing number of countries have recognised Guaido as legitimate interim leader of the troubled OPEC nation. Since last year Maduro’s government has been trying to repatriate gold from the Bank of England, fearing it could be caught up in international sanctions against his administration. Those holdings jumped to around $1.3 billion after Venezuela’s central bank closed out a gold swap deal with Deutsche Bank, sources told Reuters last week. In letters to British Prime Minister Theresa May and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Guaido said Maduro government officials were seeking to sell the gold and move the proceeds to Venezuela’s central bank. “I am writing to ask you to stop this illegitimate transaction,” wrote Guaido. “If the money is transferred ... it will be used by the illegitimate and kleptocratic regime of Nicolas Maduro to repress and brutalize the Venezuelan people.” The Bank of England and May’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, the bank has declined to comment on questions about Venezuela’s gold, citing client privacy considerations. Venezuela’s central bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Losing the gold would be a significant blow to the country’s finances, undermining its ability to obtain hard currency crucial to importing items ranging from food and medicine to auto parts and consumer electronics. Venezuela is struggling under hyperinflation now approaching 2 million percent annually. A broad economic collapse has fuelled an exodus of some three million people since 2015. On Sunday, Israel joined the countries backing the 35-year-old Guaido, and President Donald Trump’s administration said it had accepted Venezuelan opposition figure Carlos Alfredo Vecchio as the country’s diplomatic representative in the United States. The United States on Saturday called on the world to “pick a side” on Venezuela and urged countries to disconnect financially from Maduro’s government.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - This weekend marks a year since the start of one of most comprehensive global bear markets on record, but just as the developing world’s equity indexes were first to fold last year, now they are leading the charge back up.  Although there are a few subtleties this time, it largely fits with a pattern that stretches back decades. During the global financial crisis, emerging market stocks dropped the 20 percent that defines a ‘bear’ market three weeks sooner than the main global indexes and started to bounce back four months earlier. It was a similar story in 2016 and when the dot-com bubble deflated in 2000. Back then EM also started to fall three weeks earlier, took less than a third of the time to reach bear territory and bottomed out 11 months sooner. “You just have more volatility and a faster moving investor base in emerging markets,” said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer at Pictet Asset Management. “So when fear tends to take over the market that can be a really interesting buying opportunity.” Last year’s rout saw EM and global indexes actually start their slides within hours of each other. But there were still plenty of familiar patterns to observe. China’s heavy falls and even bigger hits for the likes of Turkey meant MSCI’s EM index was a bear market by September, whereas the all world index held out until Christmas. U.S. tech bulls were still pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record highs up until late September and early October. At that point China was down 30 percent, EM overall had lost 23 percent and Turkey and Argentina had already troughed.  But EM has led the rebound too. MSCI EM began to claw up at the end of October, two months earlier than the world index. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch reckon funds have been putting money into EM stocks for the last 15 weeks and this month the index is up 7 percent, which is nearly as much as it surged last January before buckling so badly. “We have seen more interest in EM assets for several months,” said Aberdeen Standard’s head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan. Another remarkable symmetry is that almost a year to the day since the bears first attacked, Turkish stocks have came full circle and achieved ‘bull market’ status - 20 percent up from their lows. It has been Brazil that has really set pace in that respect though. Its main stock market started to rebound from a 20 percent drop in June and was already a bull market by the time far-right but reform-focused Jair Bolsonaro won the first round of presidential elections in early October. Brazilian stocks are now up 40 percent from their lows and at an all-time high. Aviva Investors’ head of multi-asset funds, Sunil Krishnan, started buying up more EM assets back in November. “If we are right that U.S. macro is in reasonable shape and at least in some areas trade dialogue between the U.S. and China will improve and Chinese authorities will be more aggressive with stimulus... then it should be a constructive year for EM.”  Click for interactive graphic of the rolling global bear market tmsnrt.rs/2QCzyvm Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-emerging-markets-stocks/emerging-markets-brought-the-bears-now-they-have-the-bulls-idUKKCN1PJ2A3,2019-02-08,"This weekend marks a year since the start of one of most comprehensive global bear markets on record, but just as the developing world's equity indexes were first to fold last year, now they are leading the charge back up.","Emerging markets brought the bears, now they have the bulls"

2019-02-08," (This Jan 27 story corrects location of Mason, Ohio) By Gabriella Borter CINCINNATI (Reuters) - When Danny Reagan was 13, he began exhibiting signs of what doctors usually associate with drug addiction. He became agitated, secretive and withdrew from friends. He had quit baseball and Boy Scouts, and he stopped doing homework and showering.  But he was not using drugs. He was hooked on YouTube and video games, to the point where he could do nothing else. As doctors would confirm, he was addicted to his electronics.  “After I got my console, I kind of fell in love with it,” Danny, now 16 and a junior in a Cincinnati high school, said. “I liked being able to kind of shut everything out and just relax.” Danny was different from typical plugged-in American teenagers. Psychiatrists say internet addiction, characterized by a loss of control over internet use and disregard for the consequences of it, affects up to 8 percent of Americans and is becoming more common around the world. “We’re all mildly addicted. I think that’s obvious to see in our behavior,” said psychiatrist Kimberly Young, who has led the field of research since founding the Center for Internet Addiction in 1995. “It becomes a public health concern obviously as health is influenced by the behavior.” Psychiatrists such as Young who have studied compulsive internet behavior for decades are now seeing more cases, prompting a wave of new treatment programs to open across the United States. Mental health centers in Florida, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and other states are adding inpatient internet addiction treatment to their line of services. Some skeptics view internet addiction as a false condition, contrived by teenagers who refuse to put away their smartphones, and the Reagans say they have had trouble explaining it to extended family. Anthony Bean, a psychologist and author of a clinician’s guide to video game therapy, said that excessive gaming and internet use might indicate other mental illnesses but should not be labeled independent disorders. “It’s kind of like pathologizing a behavior without actually understanding what’s going on,” he said.  At first, Danny’s parents took him to doctors and made him sign contracts pledging to limit his internet use. Nothing worked, until they discovered a pioneering residential therapy center in Mason, Ohio, about 22 miles (35 km) north of Cincinnati. The “Reboot” program at the Lindner Center for Hope offers inpatient treatment for 11 to 17-year-olds who, like Danny, have addictions including online gaming, gambling, social media, pornography and sexting, often to escape from symptoms of mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Danny was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at age 5 and Anxiety Disorder at 6, and doctors said he developed an internet addiction to cope with those disorders.   “Reboot” patients spend 28 days at a suburban facility equipped with 16 bedrooms, classrooms, a gym and a dining hall. They undergo diagnostic tests, psychotherapy, and learn to moderate their internet use. Chris Tuell, clinical director of addiction services, started the program in December after seeing several cases, including Danny’s, where young people were using the internet to “self-medicate” instead of drugs and alcohol.  The internet, while not officially recognized as an addictive substance, similarly hijacks the brain’s reward system by triggering the release of pleasure-inducing chemicals and is accessible from an early age, Tuell said.  “The brain really doesn’t care what it is, whether I pour it down my throat or put it in my nose or see it with my eyes or do it with my hands,” Tuell said. “A lot of the same neurochemicals in the brain are occurring.” Even so, recovering from internet addiction is different from other addictions because it is not about “getting sober,” Tuell said. The internet has become inevitable and essential in schools, at home and in the workplace.  “It’s always there,” Danny said, pulling out his smartphone. “I feel it in my pocket. But I’m better at ignoring it.” Medical experts have begun taking internet addiction more seriously. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the American Psychiatric Association recognize internet addiction as a disorder. Last year, however, the WHO recognized the more specific Gaming Disorder following years of research in China, South Korea and Taiwan, where doctors have called it a public health crisis. Some online games and console manufacturers have advised gamers against playing to excess. YouTube has created a time monitoring tool to nudge viewers to take breaks from their screens as part of its parent company Google’s “digital wellbeing” initiative.  WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said internet addiction is the subject of “intensive research” and consideration for future classification. The American Psychiatric Association has labeled gaming disorder a “condition for further study.”  “Whether it’s classified or not, people are presenting with these problems,” Tuell said.   Tuell recalled one person whose addiction was so severe that the patient would defecate on himself rather than leave his electronics to use the bathroom.  Research on internet addiction may soon produce empirical results to meet medical classification standards, Tuell said, as psychologists have found evidence of a brain adaptation in teens who compulsively play games and use the internet. “It’s not a choice, it’s an actual disorder and a disease,” said Danny. “People who joke about it not being serious enough to be super official, it hurts me personally.” Reporting by Gabriella Borter; editing by Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-internet-addiction/the-digital-drug-internet-addiction-spawns-u-s-treatment-programmes-idUKKCN1PL0A7,2019-02-08,,The digital drug: Internet addiction spawns U.S. treatment programmes
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters marched through Paris on Sunday to condemn violence in the “yellow vest” movement that has rocked France for weeks with angry protests over President Emmanuel Macron’s rule. Some 10,000 people turned out for Sunday’s counter-demonstration, a day after an 11th consecutive Saturday of “yellow vest” demonstrations across France that brought sporadic clashes with police. Participants, some wearing red scarves after the name of the counter-movement, displayed slogans like “stop the violence” and “hands off my Republic” in a peaceful afternoon procession in eastern Paris that ended in Bastille square. Saturday’s “yellow vest” march in the capital also ended at Bastille, where small groups confronted police and a demonstrator suffered an eye wound that inflamed a debate about whether the authorities are using excessive force.  The “yellow vest” protesters, who wear the fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to have in their cars, took to the streets in November to oppose a fuel tax rise. Their movement then developed into a broader revolt against the government. Around 69,000 people attended the latest Saturday protests, including 4,000 in Paris, a lower turnout than the previous weekend, the interior minister said. However, the injury to well-known activist Jerome Rodrigues attracted more television coverage on Sunday than the “red scarves” march, as it heightened debate over use by police of dispersal grenades and so-called “flashball” pellet guns. To help quell discontent, Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he has promised will lead to changes.

2019-02-08,"DOHUK, Iraq (Reuters) - One protester was killed and at least 10 others wounded when they stormed a Turkish military camp near Dohuk in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region on Saturday, burning two tanks and other vehicles, residents and Kurdish officials said. Najib Saeed, the chief health official in the area, said it was not yet clear what caused the death. He said Turkish soldiers had shot at protesters and that the burning of vehicles and equipment had caused several explosions. Baghdad’s foreign ministry criticised the Turkish troops for opening fire and said it would summon Turkey’s ambassador over the incident. Turkey said the attack was carried out by members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who disguised themselves among civilians to fuel conflict between Turkish forces and local residents. “We are committed to maintaining our close partnership with the people of Dohuk and doing everything in our power to prevent civilian casualties in the area,” Fahrettin Altun, communications director for the Turkish Presidency, told Reuters. Turkey carries out regular air raids near the border against the PKK insurgent group which has bases in northern Iraq and has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. The Kurdish government in Erbil in northern Iraq condemned the storming of the camp, accusing “saboteurs” of instigating the incident, a veiled reference to the PKK, a rival of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) that dominates the Erbil government and has a working relationship with Turkey. Erbil said it had sent its forces to the area to calm the situation. A Kurdish official in the region of Dohuk said the crowd was demonstrating over a recent Turkish air raid that killed four civilians. The official did not want to be named. A second Kurdish official, who also did not give his name, said Turkish troops at the camp in Shiladze, east of Dohuk, had initially shot at the protesters and then left the camp. Kurdish security forces are trying to control the situation, he said. The surprise announcement last month that U.S. forces would withdraw from neighbouring Syria, where they have been directing the fight against Islamic State, raised fears that Turkey would move against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces which it views as terrorists.  Turkey says the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia is an extension of the PKK. Trump has threatened economic ruin for Turkey should it attack the YPG, however.

2019-02-08,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - In an unprecedented move, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday said he had fired his ambassador to China, who prompted a political furor with comments about Huawei’s high-profile extradition case. John McCallum had embarrassed Trudeau’s Liberal government by saying Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States. Opposition legislators and former ambassadors accused McCallum of unacceptable political interference in an affair which has badly damaged relations between Canada and China. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Vancouver last month over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.  China subsequently detained two Canadian citizens on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drugs smuggling and sentenced him to death. “Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum’s resignation as Canada’s ambassador to China,” Trudeau said in a statement that did not explain his reasons. Veteran diplomats and experts told Reuters it was the first time a Canadian ambassador had ever been officially fired. Trudeau said as recently as Thursday that he had no plans to replace McCallum, who apologized the same day for his remarks earlier in the week. But the Toronto Star newspaper on Friday quoted the envoy as saying that if Washington dropped the extradition request “that would be great for Canada”. McCallum, 68, a long-time former Liberal cabinet minister, is not a trained diplomat. Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said McCallum’s comments on Meng possibly avoiding extradition had signaled to Beijing that its hard line tactics were working. “He really made it untenable for the prime minister to sustain him (in his post) for any length of time and he had to go,” Burton said by telephone, suggesting Trudeau should quickly appoint a special envoy to handle the dispute. Spokespeople for Trudeau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declined to comment when asked about the dismissal. Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition Conservative Party, said in a tweet that Trudeau “should have fired his ambassador the moment he interfered in this case” and accused the prime minister of weakness and indecision. Polls show the Liberals have a slender lead over the Conservatives ahead of a federal election this October.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s top military envoy to the United States defected from the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, as the South American nation said the two countries had scaled back their diplomatic missions to skeleton staff. The diplomatic friction and defection was triggered by U.S. recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Washington, Canada and most Latin American nations said Maduro’s second-term election win was fraudulent.  “Today I speak to the people of Venezuela, and especially to my brothers in the armed forces of the nation, to recognise President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president,” Colonel Jose Luis Silva said in a video recorded at the embassy in Washington, seated at a desk alongside the Venezuelan flag. Silva told Reuters in Washington that one consular official in Houston and one in another U.S. city also recognised Guaido, but that he was the only diplomat in Washington he knew had taken the step. Reuters was not able to independently confirm other defectors. “The top brass of the military and the executive branch are holding the armed forces hostage. There are many, many who are unhappy,” Silva said. “My message to the armed forces is, ‘Don’t mistreat your people.’ We were given arms to defend the sovereignty of our nation. They never, never trained us to say, ‘This is for you to attack your people, to defend the current government in power.”  While small rebellions against Maduro have broken out in Venezuela’s armed forces in recent months, there has been no large scale military uprising against him. Guaido welcomed Silva in a message on Twitter and encouraged others to follow his example. U.S. National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis called the defection an example of the principle “that the role of the military is to protect constitutional order, not to sustain dictators and repress its own people. Encourage others to do the same.”  A 72-hour deadline issued by Maduro for U.S. embassy personnel to leave Caracas expired on Saturday, after the embattled socialist leader broke off bilateral relations on Wednesday. Some U.S. embassy staff left Caracas on Friday, and Venezuela was withdrawing staff from Washington on Saturday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement. However, Maduro softened his demand that all U.S. embassy staff withdraw by Saturday. Instead, the two countries will seek an agreement to replace the embassies with “Interest Offices” in their respective capitals within 30 days, the statement said. For decades, diplomacy between Cuba and the United States was represented by an interest section.  If the two sides fail to reach an agreement, the remaining diplomatic staff will have to leave and the missions will close.  (We would) “maintain an Interests Office, with minimum personnel, and office of representation of interests as functioned in Cuba, that is true diplomacy,” Maduro said on a live broadcast with Venezuelan youth. “We don’t want to be a North American colony,” he sang during the broadcast, during which he also pounded conga drums.  For now, the remaining staff can only carry out their activities within the diplomatic missions, the statement said.  The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the embassy in Caracas.

Organisers said the temperature of the Danube, or Donau in German, was 2.5 degrees Celsius (36.5°F). Twenty swimmers suffered hypothermia and had to be pulled out of the water. Volunteers doled out hot soup as the swimmers emerged.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 35-day struggle between President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress to cut a deal to end the partial government shutdown finally ended on Friday. Now the hard part begins. Republican and Democratic lawmakers will have until Feb. 15 to craft a border security agreement satisfactory to both sides. Trump has threatened that if he doesn’t like the outcome, he could throw the government right back into shutdown mode. Or, he also said, he might try declaring a “national emergency” which, he said, would get him the $5.7 billion he wants for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Such a step would also likely trigger a court battle with Democrats. While Trump did not get that money in Friday’s deal, he won a promise that Congress will work on a Department of Homeland Security spending bill that contains border security funding for the rest of the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30.  Here is how the negotiations in Congress are expected to go: A “conference committee” will be appointed by Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led the opposition to Trump’s demand that his border wall money be part of any legislation to fully reopen the government. The committee will include members of the House and Senate appropriations panels. They will meet in public session and in private sessions to work on a “conference report.” Trump will try to pressure fellow Republicans to insist on including $5.7 billion in the report for his wall, although a White House aide said on Friday a compromise for less would be acceptable. Democrats are likely to resist any wall funding. The committee will weigh different compromises, including possibly $1.6 billion in border security spending resembling a request Trump included in his budget proposals to Congress last year. Higher sums are likely to be debated too. A House Democratic aide said the committee also could consider major changes to U.S. immigration law, such as providing protection from deportation for “Dreamers,” those undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States when they were minors. The committee will specify uses for any border money. In the past, Congress has provided money for “physical barriers” along the border and for electronic sensors, drones and other tools. Once a deal is struck, the conference committee members will vote to send it to the House and Senate floor for passage. Under the rules, lawmakers can try to remove provisions in the agreement seen as outside the scope of the conference committee. If the House and the Senate each pass the conference agreement, it will go to the president for signing into law. If at any point in the process there is a breakdown, there is the risk of government agencies being thrown back into partial shutdown after Feb. 15. Alternatively, Congress could pass another stopgap funding bill to give conferees a little more time to work out a deal.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. diplomat Elliott Abrams will lead U.S. efforts on Venezuela, where Washington has recognised an opposition leader as the legitimate president, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday. “Elliott will be a true asset to our mission to help the Venezuelan people fully restore democracy and prosperity to their country,” Pompeo said in announcing Abrams’ appointment. He said Abrams would accompany him to the United Nations on Saturday for a Security Council meeting on Venezuela where the U.S. will press other countries to support opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s interim head of state. Abrams, appearing with Pompeo at a briefing for reporters, described the situation in Venezuela as “deep, difficult and dangerous.” A neoconservative who has long advocated an activist U.S. role in the world, Abrams last served in government in the Bush White House, first as a Middle East expert on the National Security Council and later as a global democracy strategy adviser.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Central banks may be about to face one of their biggest challenges yet: Global economic growth is slowing, but they have struggled to build up their policy arsenals since the last crisis to effectively deal with another one. The U.S.-China trade war, worries about Britain’s imminent departure from the European Union, a potential recession in Italy and unrest in South America all pose risks for the global economy. While the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on its current tightening cycle back in December 2015, the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan still have interest rates at or near rock-bottom. Policymakers want to start raising borrowing costs so they have more room to manoeuvre if there is another downturn. But they risk fanning the slowdown hundreds of economists polled by Reuters this month think is already underway. [ECILT/WRAP] Central banks are also facing increasing pressure from governments to keep policy loose, bringing their independence into question. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a swipe at the Fed, Italy has put pressure on the ECB to extend its asset purchases, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear to the Reserve Bank of India that he wants stimulative monetary policy ahead of national elections in May. “With the global economy likely to slow over the coming quarters, it seems more likely that central banks will continue to come under fire from populist leaders,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. But most central banks target inflation, not growth. Tighter policy usually strengthens currencies while reducing consumer and business spending, which should keep inflation lower - but it also risks curtailing what is pretty scant growth in many countries. The Bank of Japan has been targeting inflation of 2 percent for years without success. It is not expected to start normalizing its extremely loose monetary policy until 2020 or later. [ECILT/JP] ECB President Mario Draghi may also have to wait a long time before policy is tightened. He acknowledged on Thursday that growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than previously expected, although the bank stuck to its guidance that it intends to raise interest rates later this year for the first time in a decade. It is now expected to wait until the fourth quarter to raise its deposit rate, however, later than thought a month ago. Only 36 of 65 economists polled by Reuters this month were confident the ECB would be able to raise rates before the next downturn. [ECILT/EU] “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties,” Draghi told a news conference, citing trade and geopolitical threats, emerging market volatility and Brexit. Britain is due to leave the European Union in a little over two months, but there is still huge uncertainty about what relationship the two sides will have come Brexit day on March 29. Bank Rate in the UK has been at just 0.75 percent since August, and in a Reuters poll this month expectations for a hike next quarter were pushed back to July at the earliest as the potential for a no-deal Brexit remains high. [ECILT/GB] Prime Minister Theresa May is engaged in a last-ditch bid to win support for a tweaked divorce deal after parliament this month crushed the original plan in the biggest defeat in modern British history. Her finance minister, Philip Hammond, said the economy would suffer severe damage if the United Kingdom left the EU without a deal. That would leave little scope for the BoE to be tightening policy anytime soon. Across the ocean, median predictions suggest the Fed will raise rates twice this year, although nearly one-third of 105 economists polled by Reuters predicted the U.S. central bank would either hike rates only once or keep the fed funds rate unchanged at 2.25-2.50 percent in 2019. [ECILT/US] “U.S. monetary policy tightening is pretty much over and the ECB seems set to miss the boat altogether in this cycle,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics. A further escalation in the trade war President Trump is waging on China, the world’s second-biggest economy, would likely lead to an even sharper global slowdown this year, economists said. Under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising U.S. tariffs, China’s economy cooled in the fourth quarter, reducing 2018 growth to a near three-decade low and pressuring Beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal special counsel’s indictment of Roger Stone, a longtime associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, in the Russia probe are unrelated to the president or the White House, Trump’s press secretary said on Friday. “The charges brought against Mr. Stone have nothing to do with the president, has nothing to do with the White House,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told CNN. “The president did nothing wrong.” Stone, who served as a campaign adviser for Trump’s 2016 White House run, was arrested earlier on Friday, charged with seven criminal counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements. He has faced scrutiny for his support for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, when he implied he had access to information obtained by hackers that could embarrass Democrats, including Trump’s rival for the White House, Hillary Clinton. According to a grand jury indictment released by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, a senior Trump campaign official had spoken with Stone about the damaging information.  Asked repeatedly if Trump had directed a senior campaign official to contact Stone about the stolen emails, Sanders did not directly answer, saying she had not read the indictment and referring specific questions to Trump’s outside counsel. Trump’s outside lawyers Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani did not respond to a request for comment on the indictment earlier on Friday.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Roger Stone, a longtime ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, allegedly called an associate “a rat,” threatened his dog and invoked “The Godfather” Mafia movies in a bid to stop him from testifying in an investigation run by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, according to court papers unsealed on Friday. Stone was arrested in Florida on Friday and accused of lying to congressional investigators and tampering with a witness. Prosecutors accuse the political provocateur of threatening an associate who hosted a radio program in an apparent attempt to stop the unnamed person from testifying to investigators probing Russian influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The 24-page indictment is peppered with alleged threats, some with typos or grammatical errors, from Stone to the unnamed associate: * “You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds,” Stone told the person in an April 9 email. He also threatened to “take that dog away from you,” and said, “I am so ready. Let’s get it on. Prepare to die (expletive).” * “If you testify you’re a fool. Because of tromp I could never get away with a certain (sic) my Fifth Amendment rights but you can. I guarantee you are the one who gets indicted for perjury if you’re stupid enough to testify,” Stone told the person in a Dec. 1, 2017, text message. * “You are so full of (expletive). You got nothing. Keep running your mouth and I’ll file a bar complaint against your friend,” Stone wrote in a May 21 email. * Another Dec. 1 2017 message referred to a character in  “The Godfather: Part II” who declines to testify to Congress after mobsters bring his brother from Italy to the hearing in an apparent threat to the man’s safety.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile operator, said it was “pausing” the deployment of Huawei equipment in its core networks until Western governments give the Chinese firm full security clearance. The United States and some allies, including Australia and New Zealand, have banned Huawei from 5G networks because of alleged ties to the Chinese government, while the firm has denied that its technology could be used by Beijing for spying.   Vodafone’s Chief Executive Nick Read said on Friday after reporting third-quarter results that the debate was playing out at a “too simplistic level”, adding that Huawei was an important player in an equipment market which it dominates along with Ericsson Sweden’s Ericsson and Nokia.  “We have decided to pause further Huawei in our core whilst we engage with the various agencies and governments and Huawei just to finalize the situation, of which I feel Huawei is really open and working hard,” Read said. Poland is set to exclude Huawei from 5G after it arrested a Huawei executive earlier this month on spying allegations. Huawei fired the man, who has denied wrongdoing. Europe’s mobile industry would face higher costs and delays to faster networks if authorities imposed a blanket ban on Huawei equipment, particularly the radio technology deployed on mobile towers, Vodafone’s Read said. Operators in Europe such as BT and Orange, have already removed Huawei’s equipment or taken steps to limit its future use. Read said Huawei’s equipment was used in Vodafone’s core - which he described as the intelligent part of the network - in Spain and some other smaller markets. European governments and security agencies had not pressurized Vodafone into taking the step, but the “noise level” had increased, and the debate now needed more facts, Read said, adding that governments in Africa and the Middle East, where Vodafone also uses Huawei, had not raised concerns. A spokesman for Huawei, which become the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker earlier this decade despite being shut out of the U.S. market, said it had been a long-term strategic partner to Vodafone since 2007. “Huawei is focused on supporting Vodafone’s 5G network rollouts, of which the core is a small proportion. We are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us,” he said. However, Read said that Vodafone had already agreed terms with a range of 5G suppliers, so moving away from Huawei in parts of the roll-out would not incur additional costs. Shares in Vodafone fell after it reported a deterioration in its key revenue measure in the third quarter, down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.1 percent, reflecting price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. Analysts had expected growth of 0.3 percent and the stock fell to its lowest level since July 2010 after the update,  trading down 2.9 percent at 140 pence at 1245 GMT.  Vodafone said, however, that competition in the Spanish and Italian markets had moderated through the quarter and it improved its level of churn, or the number of customers leaving, by two percentage points year-on-year. The company’s Chief Financial Officer Margherita Della Valle said the performance improvements would start to show in the top line after the current quarter. “We expect as we enter into the next fiscal year to start seeing the benefits in terms of revenue growth,” she said. Analysts at UBS said Vodafone performed well in net adds and churn across Europe, but they expected fourth quarter service revenue to drop to –0.5 percent, driven by weakness in Spain and tougher comparatives in Britain.  “This is disappointing relative to prior comments that service revenues would be similar to the +0.5 percent seen in Q2,” they said.  Vodafone’s reiterated its guidance for this year of around 3 percent growth in underlying adjusted core earnings, with free cash flow before spectrum costs of about 5.4 billion euros.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Venezuela plunged deeper into political turmoil this week when Juan Guaido, the leader of the opposition-run congress, declared himself interim president, the boldest challenge to socialist leader Nicolas Maduro’s rule in years.  Below is a timeline on how Venezuela’s political crisis has evolved since the death of socialist leader Hugo Chavez, against a backdrop of hyperinflationary economic collapse in the OPEC nation.  MARCH 2013: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who won over the country’s poor with so-called “21st century socialism” during his 14-year rule, dies from cancer at 58. His preferred successor, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, takes office.  APRIL 2013: In presidential elections for a six-year term, Maduro narrowly defeats opposition candidate Henrique Capriles, who had lost to Chavez by a wider margin the year before. Capriles and allies say the vote was marred by fraud and call on supporters to take to the streets. FEBRUARY 2014: Venezuelan security forces arrest well-known opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez on charges of fomenting unrest, after a wave of protests known as ‘The Exit,’ seeking to oust Maduro. DECEMBER 2015: The opposition Democratic Unity coalition wins control of Venezuela’s legislative body, the National Assembly, for the first time in 16 years, riding a wave of popular discontent with a prolonged recession and rising inflation after oil prices collapsed. MARCH 2016: Venezuela’s Supreme Court, which has consistently sided with the ruling Socialist Party, announces it is taking over the functions of the National Assembly. The court quickly walks back the decision amid international outcry. But the event sparks months of anti-government protests that ultimately leave more than 100 dead. JULY 2017: Venezuela calls a referendum, boycotted by the opposition, to approve the creation of an all-powerful legislative body called the Constituent Assembly. It is nominally tasked with rewriting the constitution but quickly takes over crucial legislative functions, leading to accusations that Maduro is undermining democracy.  FEBRUARY 2018: Mediation talks between the government and the opposition collapse amid disagreement over the timing of the next presidential election. The government announces the vote will be held in the first half of the year, and the main opposition parties pledge to boycott. MAY 2018: Maduro cruises to re-electihere over a lesser-known opposition candidate amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, United States and Lima Group of mostly right-leaning Latin American governments say they do not recognise the results. JANUARY 2019: Maduro goes ahead with his inauguration for a second six-year term, ignoring the advice of several Latin American governments. Juan Guaido, a virtually unknown here opposition lawmaker who assumed leadership of the largely toothless National Assembly days earlier, calls Maduro a ""usurper.""  JANUARY 2019: Guaido swears himself in here as interim president at the opposition's largest rally since 2017. He is almost instantly recognised as the country's legitimate president by the United States and many of Venezuela's neighbours.

2019-02-08,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, a figurehead of Scotland’s independence movement, denied committing any crimes on Thursday after he appeared in court charged with multiple sex offences including two counts of attempted rape. Scottish prosecutors said Salmond, 64, had also been charged with nine counts of sexual assault, two counts of indecent assault and one of breach of the peace.  “I am innocent of any criminality whatsoever,” Salmond, widely credited with helping push support for secession to record levels, told reporters outside Edinburgh Sheriff Court following a five-minute hearing which media and public were not allowed to attend.  “I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court,” he added. “I would love to say a great deal more but I’ve got to observe the rules of the court and in court is where I will state my case.” Salmond was released on bail and it was not disclosed when further hearings would take place. The combative politician led the devolved Scottish government for seven years until 2014. As leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he helped drive growing support for Scottish independence but Scotland ultimately voted to stay part of the United Kingdom in a 2014 referendum.  Last year, Salmond took legal action against the Scottish devolved government now led by his successor and protege Nicola Sturgeon over how it handled a complaints process against him in a sexual harassment case. Salmond, who denied any wrongdoing, won a judicial review earlier this month on how that case was handled by the Scottish government when it conceded it had acted unlawfully in probing the harassment claims. The case pitted the two most popular figures in the Scottish independence movement against one another, and some commentators believe it could weaken Sturgeon’s leadership just as she seeks to start a new drive for secession amid the chaos of Britain’s exit from the European Union. A dispute has continued to simmer between two factions in the SNP around what Sturgeon knew about the case and when. An inquiry by the Scottish parliament is under way to discover more. Sturgeon said the news of Salmond’s charges would come as a shock to many, but that tight judicial requirements and the sensitivity of the case meant she could not comment further.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault appointed Michelin boss Jean-Dominique Senard as its new chairman on Thursday, after Carlos Ghosn was forced to resign in the wake of a financial scandal that has rocked the French carmaker and its alliance with Japan’s Nissan. Senard will become chairman immediately, the company said, with deputy chief executive Thierry Bollore taking over Ghosn’s other Renault role as full CEO. The appointments may begin to ease a Renault-Nissan leadership crisis that erupted after Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest in Japan and swift dismissal as Nissan chairman. Senard, 65, now faces the task of soothing relations with Nissan and resuming talks on a new alliance structure to cement the 20-year-old partnership. “It’s important that this alliance remain extremely strong,” Senard told reporters after a board meeting - citing the mounting investment demands of new vehicle technologies. “It is our compulsory duty to go forward together.” Nissan welcomed the leadership change, which CEO Hiroto Saikawa said would open a “new chapter” for the partnership. The announcement also marks a clear end to one of the auto industry’s most feted careers, two decades after Ghosn was despatched by former Renault boss Louis Schweitzer to rescue newly acquired Nissan from near-bankruptcy - a feat he pulled off in two years. After 14 years as Renault CEO and a decade as chairman, Ghosn formally resigned from both roles on the eve of the board meeting. Ghosn’s arrest and indictment for financial misconduct has strained the Renault-Nissan relationship, threatening the future of the industrial partnership he transformed into a global carmaking giant over two decades. For two months, the tensions deepened as Renault and the French government stuck by Ghosn despite the revelation he had arranged to be paid tens of millions of dollars in additional income, unbeknownst to shareholders. Ghosn has been charged with failing to disclose more than $80 million (61 million pounds) in additional compensation for 2010-18 that he had agreed to be paid later. Nissan director Greg Kelly and the Japanese company itself have also been indicted. Both men deny the deferred pay was illegal or required disclosure, while not contesting the agreements’ existence. Ghosn has denied a separate breach of trust charge over personal investment losses he temporarily transferred to Nissan in 2008. Ghosn had agreed in recent days to step down from Renault, Reuters reported on Tuesday - but only after the French government, Renault’s biggest shareholder, called for leadership change and his bail requests were rejected. Senard, who had been due to retire from Michelin in April, now has fences to mend in Japan. Following Ghosn’s arrest, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa had sought to weaken Renault’s control and resisted its attempts to nominate new directors to the Japanese carmaker’s board. In a possible sign of detente on Thursday, Nissan called an April shareholder meeting to appoint a Renault-nominated board member and formally terminate Ghosn and Kelly’s directorships. It remains unclear whether Renault, as Nissan’s parent, will also name its next chairman. Nissan currently owns a 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent and 34 percent in Mitsubishi Motors, a third major partner in their manufacturing alliance. Once its new management is settled, French officials want the alliance to resume work on a new ownership structure to cement the partnership - which Ghosn had been mandated to explore when his Renault contract was renewed last year. Nissan is wary of any such moves. Now is not the time to  discuss structural changes, Saikawa reiterated on Thursday. “Communication between the boards of the two companies has been a bit difficult” since Ghosn’s arrest, the Nissan CEO said. “I’m looking forward to better communication.” As Renault CEO, Bollore will also become chairman of the alliance, a French official told Reuters - as set out in the 2002 shareholder pact underpinning the partnership. His operational alliance role will be overseen by Senard, who will lead discussions on the future “evolution” of its structure, Renault said.  Renault has yet to finalise Ghosn’s severance package, estimated by the CGT union at 25-28 million euros in addition to an annual pension of 800,000 euros (697,074 pounds). Ghosn’s golden parachute could be politically explosive in France, where the government is battling “yellow vest” street protests over low pay and inequality. Fabien Gache, a Renault CGT spokesman, said on Thursday the union would press the government to vote against the package at Renault’s annual shareholder meeting in June. “We should not add indecency to indecency,” Gache said. The government will decide how to vote on Ghosn’s severance pay when details become clear, a finance ministry official said.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia accused the United States on Thursday of trying to usurp power in Venezuela and warned against military intervention, putting it at odds with Washington and the EU which backed protests against one of Moscow’s closest allies. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim leader on Wednesday, winning the support of Washington and parts of Latin America. That prompted socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013, to sever diplomatic ties with the United States. The prospect of Maduro being ousted is a geopolitical and economic headache for Moscow which, alongside China, has become a creditor of last resort for Caracas, lending it billions of dollars as its economy implodes. Moscow has also helped its military and oil industry and provided wheat.    Russia on Thursday accused Washington of stoking street protests and called Maduro the legitimate president.        “We consider the attempt to usurp sovereign authority in Venezuela to contradict and violate the basis and principles of international law,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The Russian Foreign Ministry said an outside military intervention could have “catastrophic consequences.” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan offered support for Maduro too. “My brother Maduro! Stand tall, we stand by you!” presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, writing on Twitter, quoted Erdogan as saying. China also said it supported efforts to protect Venezuela’s independence and stability.  The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Venezuela and boycotted Maduro’s swearing-in for a second term earlier this month, took a more nuanced tack. Although it stopped short of following Washington and recognising Guaido as interim president, it appealed for him to be protected and appeared to support calls for a peaceful transition of power away from Maduro.     “The people of Venezuela have massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny. These voices cannot be ignored,” the 28-nation bloc said. The biggest group in the European Parliament, the centre-right European People’s Party, said it recognised Guaido as interim president and would call on the whole parliament to do so next week as a senior lawmaker urged Maduro to quit.  French President Emmanuel Macron saluted Venezuelans marching for freedom. Germany, Switzerland and Portugal called for free elections, and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told Guaido he supported the Venezuelan parliament. Britain said Maduro’s 2018 election was neither free nor fair and expressed support for Guaido. There was nervousness about how far the EU could go however.   “The problem is that we can’t recognise somebody who was not elected democratically,” said one EU diplomat. “That would create a dangerous precedent for any other person who would want to proclaim themselves the president of something.”   Additional reporting by Tom Balmforth, Maria Kiselyova, Christian Lowe, Polina Devitt and Maxim Rodionov in Moscow; Simon Carraud and Richard Lough in Paris, Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels, Christian Shepherd in Beijing, Ezgi Erkoyun in Istanbul, Belen Carreño and Paul Day in Madrid, Paul Carrel in Berlin, Axel Bugge and Andrei Khalip in Lisbon, William James and Elizabeth Piper in London and Mike Shields in Zurich; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by John Stonestreet and Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics-russia/kremlin-backs-venezuelas-maduro-while-west-turns-up-heat-idUKKCN1PI0PZ,2019-02-08,,"Kremlin backs Venezuela's Maduro, while West turns up heat"
2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has requested a public U.N. Security Council meeting on Venezuela on Saturday and U.N. diplomats said they expected U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to address the body.  Washington on Wednesday recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president and has called on other countries to do the same. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has responded by cutting diplomatic ties with the United States and ordering the country’s diplomats to leave. The United States asked for a meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council “given the increasingly volatile situation in Venezuela and the growing humanitarian crisis in the country which could lead to further regional conflict and instability,” according to the U.S. request seen by Reuters.  The request faces opposition from Russia. When asked on Thursday if the council should meet on Venezuela, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: “I don’t think so, that’s their internal business.” Any Security Council member could call for a procedural vote to block the meeting. A minimum of nine votes are needed to win such a vote and China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France cannot wield their vetoes. However, U.N. diplomats said any attempt to stop the Venezuela meeting would be defeated. The Security Council is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security.  “As to whether Venezuela threatens peace and security, we’ll listen to what Mike Pompeo might have to say,” said South Africa’s U.N. Ambassador Jerry Matjila. South Africa is currently on the Security Council. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who stepped down in December, was strongly critical of Venezuela at the world body.   The Security Council met behind closed doors on Venezuela, at Haley’s request, in May 2017 and she then held an informal public council briefing on Venezuela in November 2017, which was boycotted by Russia, China, Egypt and Bolivia.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi acknowledged on Thursday that economic growth in the euro zone was likely to be weaker than earlier expected due to the fall-out from factors ranging from China’s slowdown to Brexit The region’s economy is already suffering its biggest slowdown in half a decade, raising questions over whether the ECB will be able to increase interest rates for the first time in a decade later this year as its current guidance indicates. The ECB left that guidance and interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Thursday. But Draghi’s downbeat comments, including a reference to “downside” risks, will fuel market speculation that the bank will delay any rate hike, mirroring a more cautious approach by the U.S. Federal Reserve, and may offer new cheap loans to banks. “The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties,” Draghi told a news conference, citing trade and geopolitical threats and emerging market volatility. “The near-term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than previously expected.” His comments pushed the dollar to a more than five-week high against the euro. The single currency was 0.45 percent lower against the dollar at $1.1329, after falling as low as $1.1308, its weakest since Dec. 17. Despite citing the rising risks, Draghi nonetheless reeled off reasons for not changing policy now, notably the strength of the region’s labor market and rising wage growth, which he said would help push underlying inflation up over the medium term. “The key factor to assess is the persistence of the uncertainty,” he said, adding he was confident that those uncertainties — ranging from the outcome of Brexit to China’s slowdown and trade protectionism — were being addressed. “The Governing Council will give itself more time to assess whether all these risk factors have affected confidence and we are going to have another discussion in March when we will also have the new (growth) projections.”     Draghi said the Governing Council was unanimous both in acknowledging the growth slowdown and the factors causing it but some policymakers were less optimistic than others about the economic outlook. With the ECB already owning a quarter of the euro zone’s outstanding governing debt, analysts were expecting it to turn to other instruments to keep credit flowing. A new round of cheap multi-year loans to banks, known as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO), was widely seen as the first port of call. “We do expect an announcement in March that (T)LTROs will be extended, most likely via two-year, variable rate operations,” Frederik Ducrozet, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management, said. Draghi said on Thursday TLTROs had been raised by several policymakers but no decision had been taken.  Having ended a landmark 2.6 trillion euro ($3 trillion) bond purchase scheme just weeks ago, the ECB said on Thursday it still expected to keep interest rates at record lows “through” the summer, sticking with its long-standing guidance even though markets now see a much later move. Investors see a rate hike only in mid-2020 while a Reuters poll of economists predicted the first rise in nearly a decade in the fourth quarter.  “When markets place the first rate hike in 2020, they are using the state contingent part of our forward guidance...and it shows that they have understood our reaction function,” Draghi said.   With Thursday’s decision, the ECB’s deposit rate, now its main benchmark, remains at -0.40 percent while the main refinancing rate, its key rate during normal times, stands at 0.00 percent. Germany, France and Italy, the euro zone’s biggest economies, barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2018 and survey data showed on Thursday business activity across the euro zone expanded at the slowest pace since 2013 at the start of this year. Draghi said on Thursday that the ECB did not see recessions as likely in Germany or Italy but the reference to downside risks meant the central bank had now given up its facade of optimism and joined the Federal Reserve in signaling a more cautious stance. Some policymakers have in the past objected to changing the risk assessment since such a move would raise expectations of policy action and the ECB is not yet prepared for such a move just weeks after ending its biggest stimulus scheme. “With today’s meeting, the ECB has joined the crowd of concern,” Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, said. “The return of a downside risks to the growth assessment does not, yet, signal any policy changes but only a slight easing bias.” ($1 = 0.8798 euros) Reporting by Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa; Writing by Mark John; Editing by Catherine Evans and Toby Chopra",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy/ecbs-draghi-warns-of-weaker-growth-ahead-idUKKCN1PH2XL,2019-02-08,,ECB's Draghi warns of weaker growth ahead

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Kang Sung-il buys Sancho, his Pomeranian, a toy every business trip and this Lunar New Year holiday will dress him up in a new $50 suit to visit ‘grandma’, Kang’s mother. Kang and his wife say children are too expensive and bring too much pressure. Instead they have opted to shower Sancho with love and gifts. They are not alone. South Korea’s pet industry is booming, fueled by the same factors that have made the country’s birth rate, at 1.05 births per woman, the lowest in the world: the high cost of education and housing as well as extremely long working days. “Social pressures in South Korea are such that parents are required to provide resources for decades from private schooling to tutoring to art classes,” said Kang, a 39-year old manager of a pet funeral home. He says he found it hard to imagine being able to afford all that but is happy to spend about 100,000 won ($90) a month on Sancho. On top of education expenses, an average South Korean household must budget roughly 12.8 years of income to buy a mid-range home, compared to 8.8 years in 2014, data from KB Kookmin Bank shows. Adding to their stress, South Koreans work the third most hours per year among OECD nations, lagging just Mexico and Costa Rica. “The pet population is growing as more people choose not to have babies or even not to marry,” said Kim Soo-kyung, manager at Samjong KPMG Economic Research Institute. Pet-owning households have surged to 28 percent of all  South Korean households in 2018, compared with 18 percent in 2012, government data shows. That in turn has spurred a flourishing pet care industry whose offerings include tailored pet diets and high-priced photo shoots. Pet-related startups are also in vogue with venture capitalists. The South Korean pet-related industry was worth 2.7 trillion won ($2.4 billion) last year, and that could more than double in size by 2027, according to the Korea Rural Economic Institute. Firms seeking to profit from the boom include Pet Pick, which produces tailored food for over 10,000 animals. It is one of four pet startups to receive investments from GS Home Shopping, an online retailer that is part of the GS Holdings Corp conglomerate. “We only use high quality ingredients, such as salmon and cranberry so our products are more than twice as expensive as regular dry pet food,” Pet Pick co-founder Park Eun-byul said at the firm’s Seoul factory. “Many of our customers are millennials, who treat pets as their babies and are willing to pay more,” Park said. Leading venture capital fund, Korea Investment Partners, invested in two pet startups in 2018 - Bacon, which makes toys themed for holidays such as Christmas or Halloween, and Pet Friends, which promises to deliver pet products within one hour. The fund plans to invest in Picnic, which sells hand-made pet food, later this year. Established firms are also cashing in. Meritz Fire & Marine Insurance saw more than 6,000 customers sign up in three months with a revamped pet insurance product launched in October, compared with roughly 100 per year for its earlier insurance program. Sales of pet products at CJ ENM’s TV and online shopping division rose three times last year, with a cactus-shaped water purifier for cats priced at over $100 doing particularly well. “It’s twice as expensive as an ordinary purifier but we sell dozens every day,” said Lee Da-woon, who procures pet products for the online mall. Pet funeral services are also increasingly popular and the home where Sancho’s owner Kang works, now holds more than 10 services a day, compared with 3-5 when it opened two years ago. In Namyangju, just outside Seoul, Lee Jae-hwan goes for a walk every day carrying an urn with the ashes of his dog Kkotgae, continuing the routine they used to share. “I’ve always introduced Kkotgae as my only son, the most loved one in the world,” 51-year-old Lee said in a tearful interview at home, next to a ceremonial table with photos, some food and burning incense.  “He never saw the ocean.

2019-02-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - In less than a month, Juan Guaido has gone from a virtual unknown in Venezuelan politics to the country’s most-watched figure, assuming the presidency of the opposition-controlled congress and briefly being detained by the secret police. On Wednesday, the skinny 35-year-old from the South American country’s hardscrabble Caribbean coast thrust himself onto the international stage with the boldest challenge to socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s rule in years: he declared himself interim president, a move swiftly recognised by the United States, Canada and many Latin American countries. His rapid ascent has raised hopes that he could fill a leadership vacuum in Venezuela’s notoriously divided opposition, which has failed in several attempts to oust Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez. Many of its most prominent figures have been jailed, exiled or barred from seeking public office. The salsa-loving baseball fan has animated the opposition’s upper-class base and won over many working-class Venezuelans fed up with the country’s hyperinflationary economic collapse, who have taken to the streets demanding Maduro step down. Yet Guaido still needs the backing of the armed forces to achieve his goal of forcing new elections. “Today in Venezuela we are living under a dictatorship, and we need to put on enough pressure to take control,” Guaido, the grandson of National Guard and Navy officers, said in an interview with Reuters this week.  He has proposed an amnesty for members of the military, but said members of the Maduro government who committed human rights violations should be punished. “I do not intend to heal the wounds of 20 years, but nor do I intend to hide them.” Guaido took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5 with a call for the armed forces to recognise Maduro as a “usurper” after his May 2018 re-election vote, widely viewed as fraudulent. The eldest of six children from a working-class family in the coastal state of Vargas, Guaido survived a devastating 1999 mudslide that posed one of the earliest tests to Chavez’s 14-year rule.  He went on to study engineering, but became involved in politics while at university and received a master’s in public administration from George Washington University in the United States. He is married with a 1-year-old daughter. For some years, the focus of the opposition - both of Guaido and his mentor, Leopoldo Lopez, the well-known head of the Popular Will party, currently under house arrest - has been ousting Maduro from power. Representing Vargas for Popular Will, Guaido assumed the parliament’s leadership as part of a power-sharing agreement between Venezuela’s main opposition parties. He has said little about what policies he would pursue as president, but Popular Will describe themselves as centre-left social democrats. Guaido was dragged out of his car on the highway and detained by intelligence agents last week, but was swiftly released. Government officials said the officers responsible would be punished. His whereabouts on Wednesday evening were unknown. Guaido has said he is not afraid of being arrested, boosting his popularity among Venezuelans tired with Maduro. “I am giving Guaido my vote of confidence,” said Jose Luis Galindo, a Caracas firefighter wearing a gas mask around his neck at a protest against Maduro on Wednesday.  “It is time to escape from this anarchy we have lived through for more than 20 years. I am here for my children’s future, and I will stay for as long as it takes.” Reporting by Corina Pons; Additional reporting by Mayela Armas and Angus Berwick; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-venezuela-politics-guaido-newsmaker/in-a-month-venezuelas-guaido-emerged-from-obscurity-to-challenge-maduro-idUKKCN1PI05I,2019-02-08,,"In a month, Venezuela's Guaido emerged from obscurity to challenge Maduro"
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Opposition leader Juan Guaido on Wednesday swore himself in as Venezuela’s rightful commander-in-chief in direct challenge to President Nicolas Maduro, who faces growing international criticism for undermining democracy. Like many in the opposition and international community, Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term was fraudulent and he has called for new elections.  Guaido, who a decade ago participated in protests against late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, is promising a transition to a new government through free and fair elections and an amnesty for military officers who disavow Maduro.  Below is a summary of the support enjoyed by each leader.  * The top brass of Venezuela’s military has shown no sign of leaving Maduro’s side. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino reaffirmed support for Maduro in a tweet on Wednesday, saying Venezuela’s armed forces disavowed any self-proclaimed president. * The Supreme Court, stacked with Maduro loyalists, has remained solidly behind the socialist leader, ruling earlier this week that all actions taken by the congress - led by Guaido - are null and void. * State oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], which accounts for most of Venezuela’s export earnings, stood by Maduro. “We have no other president” besides Maduro, PDVSA President and Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, a career military officer, said in a Wednesday statement.  * A few left-leaning governments in the region, including Cuba and Bolivia, continue to back Maduro. Mexico, where leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office last year, has dropped the previous government’s opposition to Maduro and said it will follow a policy of non-intervention.  * The United States recognised Guaido shortly after he proclaimed himself president on Wednesday, saying it would use its “economic and diplomatic power” to restore democracy in Venezuela. * Numerous right-leaning Latin American governments, including Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, also recognised Guaido. * There are some signs that support for the opposition is expanding beyond its traditional middle- and upper-class areas. Several protests against Maduro have broken out in working-class neighbourhoods and slums this week.  * Some low-ranking military officers have expressed discontent with the government. The government on Monday said it suppressed a military revolt after a group of officers stole weapons, kidnapped officers, and demanded Maduro’s removal.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - An attempt by British lawmakers to prevent a no-deal Brexit was gaining momentum on Wednesday after the opposition Labour Party said it was likely to throw its parliamentary weight behind that. The United Kingdom, facing the deepest political crisis since World War Two, is due to leave the European Union at 2300 GMT on March 29 but has no approved deal on how the divorce will take place. Prime Minister Theresa May is battling to break the deadlock after last week’s crushing defeat of her two-year attempt to forge an orderly divorce raised the prospect of an exit without a deal. In a step that could overturn centuries of constitutional convention, some MPs are trying to grab control of Brexit from the government in an attempt to prevent what they say would be an economically disastrous no-deal departure. Labour will probably back one such attempt, an amendment proposed by Labour lawmaker Yvette Cooper that could result in May being given until Feb. 26 to get a deal approved by parliament or face MPs voting on delaying Brexit.  John McDonnell, the second most powerful figure in the party, told the BBC the amendment was sensible and Labour was “highly likely” to back it. At least nine Conservative MPs have also publicly said they will support it, suggesting it has a good chance of passing. Sterling GBP=D3 jumped to a 10-week high against the dollar, rising to $1.3079, on bets that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided if parliament exerts greater control over the process. As the United Kingdom’s tortuous crisis over EU membership approaches its finale, the possible outcomes for the world’s fifth largest economy still include a no-deal Brexit, a last-minute deal, a delay or a snap election. But the EU, whose members are also worried by the prospect of a disorderly Brexit that would cost jobs in major economies such as Germany, cautioned that no-deal was still the default scenario until London proposed something else. “Preparing for a no-deal scenario is more important now than ever, even though I still hope that we can avoid this scenario,”  EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in Brussels. “Opposing no-deal will not stop no-deal from happening,” he said, adding it would be necessary for the British to find a majority in favour of another solution to a disorderly exit. Europe’s most powerful leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said she wanted an orderly Brexit but that it was in London’s hands. May has said thwarting Brexit would threaten social cohesion by undermining faith in democracy, while police have said the “febrile” atmosphere could be exploited by far-right extremists. Another alternative is that May gets enough concessions from the EU to win over rebels in her Conservative Party as well as the Northern Irish party that props up her minority government.  Some said they could be won over if May secures concessions on the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to keep the border open between the British province and Ireland if a future trade deal falls short. “I think there is good news for us to hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable,” lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said. “But ... it is not there yet and until it is, people like me will vote against.” Parliament will vote on Jan. 29 on different options put forward by MPs, potentially opening a way out of the stalemate. A Labour spokesman said the party would “look at all mechanisms to take no deal off the table and to give parliament more of a say in this process” and that leader Jeremy Corbyn was meeting Cooper on Wednesday to discuss the amendment. If her amendment is passed, it would effectively give parliament the power to set May a deadline of Feb. 26 to get a deal through parliament. If May fails, parliament would be given a vote on asking the EU for a postponement of the Article 50 deadline to prevent Britain leaving without a deal on March 29. It proposes a nine-month extension, to Dec. 31. If Britain asked to delay its departure under Article 50, the other 27 EU members would need to unanimously approve such a move, something EU officials say would be likely to be granted. “If this question is presented, they will have questions for the British government: What is it for, what is the purpose? For how long?” Barnier said. May told parliament the move would not solve the issue of the impasse in parliament. “What we have seen is amendments seeking to engineer a situation where Article 50 is extended - that does not solve the issue, there will always be a point of decision. The decision remains the same: no deal, a deal or no Brexit,” she said.

2019-02-08,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Prince William revealed on Wednesday that “not one celebrity” had originally wanted to join a mental health campaign he started in 2016 with his wife Kate and brother Harry. “We went out to a lot of people and nobody, before we started, was interested in being a part of ‘Heads Together’ – because it was mental health,” he said, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos.  William, who is second in line to the British throne, also opened up about his experiences of dealing with trauma during his daily work in the air ambulance, which he retired from two years ago. Remembering a particularly affecting incident, he said: “I know if I hadn’t taken the action I did then, I would have definitely gone down a slippery slope and I would have been dealing with mental illness on a different level.” His fellow panelist, New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, praised the prince for speaking out about mental health issues. Ardern, at 38 the world’s youngest female head of government, has said she will introduce New Zealand’s first ‘well-being budget’ to gauge how policy impacts the quality of people’s lives. “I think unfortunately one of the sad facts for New Zealand is that everyone knows someone who has taken their own life. We’re a small country, less than 5 million people, but last year more than 600 people committed suicide,” she said.  “I’ve lost friends and I wouldn’t have to look far in my cabinet to find others who have as well,” Ardern added. William, who has previously warned British men of the dangers of keeping a traditional “stiff upper lip” at times of stress, said he thought his country’s difficulties with expressing emotions came from a wartime generation who passed on a tendency not to talk about problems.  Asked what he thought leaders should do to tackle mental health issues, William told the Davos crowd: “I think more leaders need to talk about it.” Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-davos-meeting-mental-health/prince-william-tackles-mental-health-taboo-at-davos-gathering-idUKKCN1PH2GQ,2019-02-08,,Prince William tackles mental health taboo at Davos gathering

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s executive said on Wednesday the bloc would do its utmost to avoid extensive border controls between EU member state Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland regardless of how Brexit goes, a spokesman said. The Irish border issue remains the biggest obstacle to a divorce deal being agreed between Britain and the EU in the countdown to Brexit, which is scheduled for March 29. “The EU is determined to do all it can - deal or no deal- to avoid a hard border in Ireland,” the Commission’s chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, told a news conference.  On Tuesday Schinas said a no-deal Brexit would automatically erect a border on the island of Ireland, putting Dublin on the spot as to what preparations it was making for a scenario all sides say they want to avoid. An Irish government spokesman reacted on Tuesday by saying Dublin would not accept a hard border - which is seen as possibly endangering peace on the island - and was not planning for one. On Wednesday, Schinas reaffirmed EU solidarity with Dublin but also noted that the Irish-Northern Irish border would  become an external border of the EU after Brexit. That meant policing the frontier properly if there is no alternative arrangements with Britain in the case of a no-deal Brexit. “Ireland and the EU have responsibilities as regards the protection of the single market and the customs union,” Schinas said.  Speaking in the Polish city of Krakow on Wednesday, the Commission’s First Vice-President Frans Timmermans reiterated that the EU could not renegotiate the so-called ‘backstop’ agreement in the withdrawal deal negotiated by Brussels and London. The ‘backstop’ is an insurance policy designed to ensure there is no return to customs and other extensive border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit. The British parliament resoundingly rejected the withdrawal deal last week mainly due to concerns over the ‘backstop’, fearing it would commit the UK to EU customs rules after Brexit. May is now trying to secure further EU concessions on the backstop to overcome opposition in the UK parliament.

2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s president said on Tuesday a radical Muslim cleric linked to the 2002 Bali bombings would only be released from jail if he pledged loyalty to the state and its ideology, after news he would be freed unconditionally sparked criticism. President Joko Widodo had declared last week that Abu Bakar Bashir, 81, would be freed on humanitarian grounds, citing his age and poor health.  A legal adviser to the president had said the cleric would be granted unconditional release. But Widodo said in a statement on Tuesday it would be “conditional release”, a day after the chief security minister said the decision was being reviewed.   “Conditions have to be fulfilled like loyalty to the unitary state of Indonesia, to the Pancasila. That is one of the very basic conditions,” said Widodo  Convicts eligible for early release are required to pledge loyalty to the state and its secular ideology, known as Pancasila, and not to repeat their crimes.  But Bashir’s lawyers say he has refused to do that. Bashir was the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), an Islamist group linked to al Qaeda blamed for the 2002 bombing of nightclubs on Bali island that killed more than 200 people, most of them tourists, including 88 Australians.  He was convicted in 2010 under anti-terrorism laws for links to militant training camps in Aceh province and jailed for 15 years.  Although linked to the Bali attacks and a bombing at Jakarta’s Marriott Hotel in 2003, Bashir was never convicted for them and denied those ties. [reut.rs/1qNBwvC]  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, speaking before Widodo set out conditions for Bashir’s release, urged Indonesia not to show him leniency. “We have been very clear about the need to ensure that as part of our joint counter-terrorism efforts … that Abu Bakar Bashir would not be in any position or in any way able to influence or incite anything,” Morrison told reporters on Monday. Widodo has also come under fire at home over the possible release. Critics have accused him of trying to win over religious conservatives ahead of a presidential election set for April 17 in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country. Some members of the ruling coalition, including officials in Widodo’s party, fear Bashir’s release could alienate moderate Muslim and non-Muslim voters.  “Everyone is asking: ‘How can we possibly allow this?’,” said an official from Widodo’s Democratic Party of Struggle. “Now it’s about how many votes we will lose, not gain.”  Most opinion polls have given Widodo a double-digit lead over rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general who had also contested the presidency in 2014. Opponents and hardline Islamists have repeatedly attacked Widodo’s Islamic credentials. During the 2014 campaign for the presidency, he had to battle false rumours he was a communist. In a move to shore up Muslim support this time, Widodo picked for his running mate an Islamic cleric. Still, some analysts doubted whether releasing Bashir early would win Widodo many conservative voters. Security and government officials, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue, said they backed the plan to release Bashir to avoid the risk of him dying as a martyr in jail, but felt doing so without conditions was risky. Another official said the government was considering letting Bashir out of jail but placing him under house arrest. Indonesia-based terrorism expert Sidney Jones told Reuters     that waiving the requirement for Bashir to pledge loyalty to the state and secular state ideology would have set a dangerous precedent. “It risks turning him into even more of a hero because it’s like he has succeeded in defying the state,” she said, speaking before Widodo set conditions on the release. “The end result is that Widodo ends up looking weak, out-manoeuvred and poorly advised.” Bill McNeil, an  survivor of the 2002 bombings, told The Australian newspaper that he found the prospect of Bashir’s release hard to understand. “It seems sort of crazy they will execute people for drug offences but allow this guy to go free,” McNeil, 43, said.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Serena Williams squandered four match points and blew a 5-1 lead in the deciding set as seventh seed Karolina Pliskova produced a fightback for the ages to claim a 6-4 4-6 7-5 quarter-final win over the American great at the Australian Open on Wednesday. Williams, chasing a milestone 24th Grand Slam triumph, also saved two match points in the last game but netted on the third as the big-serving Czech shocked a packed Rod Laver Arena with her remarkable rally from the brink of defeat. The American’s hopes of matching Margaret Court’s all-time record of Grand Slam singles titles, and claiming a first since becoming a mother in 2017, were denied once more, after she also lost in finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year. While disappointed, the 37-year-old was philosophical in defeat and pledged to regroup for another tilt at the French Open. “It’s definitely not easy for me. From day one, I expect to go out and, quite frankly, to win,” the seven-times champion in Melbourne told reporters. “That hasn’t happened. But I do like my attitude... I’ve only been playing 10 months, but I expect to win, and if I don’t, it’s disappointing. “I rather think of it that way and know that it’s going to happen sooner or later than making an excuse for myself. I don’t like making excuses.” The brave Pliskova advanced to meet Naomi Osaka in the last four, denying Williams a chance to avenge her controversial U.S. Open final defeat to the Japanese fourth seed. “Normally I’m having a lot of comebacks, but maybe from a set down or a break down, so nothing like this. I think it’s the best comeback ever so far in my life,” an elated Pliskova told reporters after qualifying for her first Melbourne semi-final. “This time I really believed, like, (she’s) still a player, I know she’s the greatest ever, but I don’t want to put her somewhere where I would not have a chance to beat her.” Pliskova avenged her quarter-final loss to Williams at last year’s U.S. Open and now holds an enviable 2-1 Grand Slam record against the American, having beaten her in the 2016 semi-finals at Flushing Meadows. The 26-year-old former world number one, chasing her maiden Grand Slam title, is the second Czech into the semi-finals after double Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova thrashed home favourite Ashleigh Barty on Tuesday to book a match with Danielle Collins. Locked in a three-way battle with Osaka and Kvitova to take the world number one spot from Simona Halep, Pliskova will emerge as the top-ranked woman if she claims the title.    Williams, seeded 16th as she continues her return from maternity leave, rolled her ankle when serving for the match at 5-1. She promptly double-faulted after missing a passing shot on  her first match point and was broken after dumping a backhand into the net. Pliskova held on grimly, saving three more match points when serving to stay alive at 5-4, before breaking Williams to love and charging to 40-0 in the final game. Williams saved two of the match points, the second with a courageous backhand winner, but Pliskova held firm to add another highlight to a tournament laden with upsets.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Karolina Pliskova said saving four match points against Serena Williams had got into the American’s “head” as the Czech completed an epic comeback win to reach her first Australian Open semi-finals on Wednesday. Seventh seed Pliskova saved a match point at 5-1 down in the deciding set and another three at 5-4 before Williams crumbled 4-6 6-4 7-5 in front of a stunned crowd at Rod Laver Arena. The nerve-jangling win booked the tall Czech her first Melbourne semi-finals and she will meet U.S. Open champion Naomi Osaka for a place in the title-decider. Pliskova described the victory as the comeback of her life but one that wouldn’t have happened without some assistance from her 23-times Grand Slam champion opponent. “She was already match point up in that 5-1 game. Lots of things happened ... in those games. I just felt a chance,” she told reporters. “I think she maybe got little bit, I don’t know, for sure it was in her head. Lots of things happen. “I saw a chance and I just took it.” The big-serving Czech was brilliant in the face of defeat,  capturing the decisive break in the 11th game before sealing the win on a third match point when Williams slapped a forehand into the net, her 37th unforced error. Having avenged her loss to Williams at the U.S. Open quarter-finals, Pliskova now has an enviable Grand Slam record against the American great, having beaten her in two of their three matches at the majors. Pliskova toppled Williams at the 2016 U.S. Open semi-finals when the American was top seed but felt the 37-year-old Williams she faced at Melbourne Park had played better. “I think honestly she played much better than when she was playing when I beat her in New York. The match was so much better. “There were more mistakes (in New York). Maybe she was nervous, it was in States.” Pliskova, who reached world number one in 2017 but has yet to claim a Grand Slam title, has a chance to regain the top ranking if she wins the tournament. Her next opponent Osaka and compatriot Petra Kvitova, who faces Danielle Collins in the next match, are also in the running to be crowned number one. “I don’t want to say it means zero, but it doesn’t mean the same. Right now in this situation (it) would not mean the same as winning the Grand Slam,” she said. “I’m not going to chase this, so for me nothing is changing.” Pliskova has won two out of three of her matches against Osaka. She fell to the hard-hitting 21-year-old in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells last year before beating her in front of home fans in their last meeting at the Japan Open title-decider. “Yeah, I’ve played a few hitters here in the last matches, obviously Camila Giorgi, now Serena. I think I’m well prepared for Naomi,” said 26-year-old Pliskova. “If I play well, I think for sure there is a chance.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-ausopen-pliskova/pliskova-wins-the-head-game-against-serena-to-make-semis-idUKKCN1PH0RQ,2019-02-08,,Pliskova wins the 'head' game against Serena to make semis
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond called on banks to strengthen a proposed redress scheme for small businesses, which lawmakers and victims argue is too soft on lenders. A dispute service proposed by UK Finance, which represents banks, must include a broad range of interests and not impose a compensation cap, Hammond said in a letter released on Tuesday.     The voluntary scheme was proposed in response to a decade of campaigning by small firms who say they were mistreated by their banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It is aimed at companies with a turnover of between 6.5 million and 10 million pounds which is above the eligibility threshold for taking complaints to Britain’s free Financial Services Ombudsman, leaving them facing a costly court case if they want to pursue a lender. It includes a binding commitment on banks to pay compensation up to 350,000 pounds for “historic” complaints that date back to the financial crisis a decade ago, although the scheme could recommend a higher amount. UK Finance, which declined to comment, is setting up a steering group to thrash out details of the new scheme, but lawmakers told Reuters this month it was too easy on banks. Kevin Hollinrake, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for fair business banking (APPG), has said he would refuse a seat on the steering group unless concerns over eligibility, governance and claims limits were addressed.  Hammond, in a letter to UK Finance Chief Executive Stephen Jones, emphasised the need for the steering group to have “balanced representation” from banks, business representatives and other parties.  “It is vital that different perspectives are heard during this implementation stage, to ensure that the schemes are regarded as truly robust and independent,” Hammond said in the letter, which was dated Jan. 19. Banks’ “default position” should be to pay whatever sum the new scheme awarded in compensation, Hammond said. The APPG welcomed Hammond’s comments, saying: “We are particularly pleased that the Chancellor has set an expectation that the bank’s default position should be that there is no cap on the amount of compensation awarded.”  Reporting by Huw Jones and Iain Withers; Editing by Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-banks/hammond-backs-calls-for-tougher-bank-disputes-scheme-idUKKCN1PG28L,2019-02-08,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond called on banks to strengthen a proposed redress scheme for small businesses, which lawmakers and victims argue is too soft on lenders.",Hammond backs calls for tougher bank disputes scheme

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Britain’s FTSE 100 posted its worst day in nearly a month on Tuesday as renewed global economic slowdown worries sparked a sell-off across the U.S., Asian and European markets and a stronger pound weighed, while easyJet surged following its results. The blue-chip bourse .FTSE fell 1 percent and the FTSE 250 .FTMC closed down 0.4 percent. The session’s downbeat tone was set after China warned that falling factory orders pointed to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job-shedding in the country, a day after reporting its lowest annual economic growth since 1990. Adding to the gloom, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs as trade tensions loomed. The exporter-heavy index, which makes the lion’s share of its income overseas, was also hit by a stronger sterling after better-than-expected UK employment data. The jobs data provided a glimmer of hope for the UK economy even as uncertainty over the nation’s divorce from the European Union grows. “The morning’s 10-year high wage growth reading was the main catalyst for the (sterling) growth, though the ongoing hopes that the UK will avoid a ‘no-deal’ Brexit are presumably playing their part as well,” said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. Britain’s opposition Labour Party put forward an amendment to force the government to give parliament time to consider and vote on options to prevent a ‘no deal’ Brexit after Prime Minister Theresa May had set out her plans on Monday. The generally sour mood weighed on crude and metal prices with oil .FTNMX0530 and miners .FTNMX1770 the worst FTSE 100 performers, down 2.6 and 1.9 percent respectively. BHP’s (BHPB.L) (BHP.AX) weak outlook for iron ore output pushed its shares down 2 percent. Shell (RDSa.L) slipped 2.5 percent and was the main drag on the FTSE 100, after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to “underweight” and highlighted worries about the oil major’s pledge for share buybacks, dividends and debt reduction. Banks .FTNMX8350 fell 1 percent as weak results from Switzerland’s UBS (UBSG.S) deepened concerns about the pain across the sector from low interest rates and rising political uncertainty. However, easyJet (EZJ.L) climbed 6.3 percent, its best day in more than four years, as investors cheered the budget airline maintaining its full-year outlook even after counting the cost of the drone disruption at Gatwick airport in December.     “The drone disruption at Gatwick in December means these results aren’t quite what easyJet was hoping for at the start of the year, but it hasn’t blown things too far off course,” said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Nicholas Hyett. Ocado (OCDO.L) rose 3.3 percent while Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), which is looking to buy Walmart’s (WMT.N) Asda in a 7.3 billion pound deal, added 1.4 percent after Jefferies said Walmart’s exit from the UK would have positive implications for grocers. Among mid-caps, online trading platform IG Group (IGG.L) slumped 9.5 percent as a regulatory clampdown led to a 17 percent fall in its first-half profit. Fertiliser maker Sirius Minerals (SXX.L) slipped 7.1 percent after modifying its debt plans, while temporary power provider Aggreko (AGGK.L) shed 5 percent after a Barclays downgrade. Dixons Carphone (DC.L), which hit near decade lows earlier this month amid worries about the poor state of the UK high street, jumped 3.9 percent on signs that its turnaround plan was progressing. Pets at Home (PETSP.L) surged 17 percent, its best day on record, on higher quarterly revenue due to a greater demand for its pet products and grooming services.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has held talks with China’s Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for its new Shanghai factory, and two people with direct knowledge of the matter said the pair signed a preliminary agreement. The companies have yet to decide how large an order Tesla would place, and Lishen is still working out what battery cell size Tesla would require, one of the people said. Details of the agreement were unclear. In Chinese, a preliminary agreement could refer to mere acknowledgment through to a statement of intent. The talks come as Tesla looks to localise battery cell production in the face of mounting competition from a swathe of domestic EV makers in the world’s largest car market, where a Sino-U.S. trade war is increasing the cost of U.S. imports. Tesla said it received quotes from Tianjin Lishen to supply batteries for the Shanghai plant but did not proceed further. “We have not signed any agreement of any kind with them,” a Tesla spokeswoman told Reuters. Lishen told Reuters that it had not signed any agreement with Tesla to supply batteries to the factory. The first source reiterated that a preliminary agreement was signed. The second source said Tesla’s supplier certification process usually took a long time to be finalised. The people declined to be identified because the discussions were private. Japan’s Panasonic Corp (6752.T) is currently Tesla’s exclusive battery cell supplier. Its shares closed down 2.7 percent after the Reuters report. It also announced a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) on Tuesday to make electric vehicle (EV) batteries.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in November the U.S. company would manufacture all its battery modules and packs at the Shanghai factory and planned to diversify its sources.  “Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner,” Musk said in a tweet in November.  Panasonic said in a statement it was studying various possibilities with regards to Tesla’s Shanghai plant, but nothing had been decided. It declined to comment on the possibility of losing exclusive-supplier status with Tesla.     Other battery makers in the running for contracts could include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd 300750.SZ and LG Chem Ltd (051910.KS).  Tesla broke ground on the $2 billion so-called Gigafactory, its first in China, earlier this month and plans to begin making Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) there by the end of the year.  Musk has said the factory will produce “more affordable” vehicles for the Chinese auto market. Lishen, which says its clients range from Apple (AAPL.O) and  Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) to Geely (0175.HK) and Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), has joined other battery makers in aggressively pursuing contracts with the rapidly growing EV industry. The Chinese company started mass production of the same type of cylindrical battery made by Panasonic for Tesla’s Model 3 in 2017, in the city of Suzhou about 100 km (60 miles) away from Shanghai.  Panasonic and Toyota on Tuesday announced a joint venture that leverages the heft of one of the world’s largest automakers and one of the world’s biggest battery makers to expand their EV push. The joint venture builds on the agreement that the pair announced in late 2017 on joint development of batteries with higher energy density in a prismatic cell arrangement. It would also help Panasonic cut its heavy reliance on Tesla, whose production delays have weighed on the Japanese company’s earnings. Panasonic planned to shift most of its prismatic battery-related equipment and facilities in Japan and China to the joint venture, while those producing batteries for Tesla would remain under the company, a source said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet (EZJ.L) lost 15 million pounds ($19 million) during 36 hours of travel chaos sparked by drones flying into London’s Gatwick Airport in December, the budget airline said on Tuesday, adding it should serve as a “wake-up call” to airports.  The British carrier, the largest operator at Britain’s second-biggest airport, said the disruption affected 82,000 customers and forced the cancellation of more than 400 of its flights in the run up to Christmas. That knocked around 5 million pounds off its revenue and cost the airline 10 million pounds to help its customers.  “We were disappointed that it took a long time to resolve,” Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told reporters. “Airports have gotten this as a wake-up call, and will be better prepared going forward.”     The group gave an otherwise upbeat trading update and said 2019 bookings were encouraging despite uncertainty around Brexit, striking a more positive tone than rival Ryanair (RYA.I), which issued a profit warning last week. EasyJet also said it had increased its share ownership by non-UK nationals of the European Economic Area to 49 percent, up from November and close to the 50 percent threshold needed to guarantee its right to operate intra-EU flights after Britain leaves the EU on March 29. Gatwick was forced to close its runway in December when drones flew near the site south of London in the most disruptive incursion by unmanned aerial vehicles at any major airport. It forced the cancellation or diversion of around 1,000 flights, affecting 140,000 passengers over three days in total. Analysts at RBC said they had trimmed their profit-before-tax forecast for easyJet by 3 percent as a result of the Gatwick  disruption, but retained their “outperform” rating as “far worse” earnings cuts were already priced-in. EasyJet shares were 2.2 percent higher at 0856 GMT after the trading update. Drone disruption aside, easyJet said its operating performance had been good, striking a contrast to Ryanair, which warned lower than expected winter air fares would hit its full-year profit. EasyJet said total revenue rose by 13.7 percent to 1.3 billion pounds in its fiscal first quarter to Dec. 31, and that it expected full-year headline profit before tax broadly in line with current market expectations.   “We feel that this environment is robust and solid, and we do well in it,” Lundgren said, adding that bookings for the summer were ahead of last year despite uncertainty over Brexit.

2019-02-08,"KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban attack in central Afghanistan on Monday killed scores of security personnel, officials said, with some estimates putting the death toll at more than 100, amid government silence about one of the most deadly insurgent attacks in months. Attackers rammed a captured military Humvee packed with explosives into a training centre of the National Directorate for Security in Maidan Wardak province, west of the capital Kabul. At least two gunmen followed up, spraying the compound with gunfire before they were shot down. “We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training centre, eight special commandoes are among the dead,” said a senior official in the defence ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Local officials also said that scores of troops and NDS personnel were killed in the attack but there was no official confirmation of the casualty toll, with officials ordered not to talk to media for fear of damaging morale. “I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,” said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul. The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun. Taliban insurgents, fighting to drive out international forces from Afghanistan and reintroduce their version of strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said killed 190 people. The attack, the most serious against Afghan forces in months, occurred on the same day that Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, in Qatar. Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 in the capital, Kabul but casualties from Monday’s attack appear to have been far higher. Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said he saw the bodies of 35 members of the Afghan forces in the hospital. “Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,” said Hotak, adding that “the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces.”  Monday’s attack caused the biggest casualty total suffered by Afghan forces since August 2018, when the Taliban overran central Ghazni province. That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians dead, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, said officials then.  President Ashraf Ghani’s office said in a statement the “enemies of the country” had carried out the attack and had killed and wounded “a number of our beloved and honest sons”. In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures but U.S. commanders have said repeatedly that the losses being suffered by Afghan forces are “unsustainable”. Last year Ghani said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015. The British embassy in Afghanistan said Monday’s casualties were “a stark reminder of the sacrifice the Afghan security and defence forces make for their country”.

2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s government exceeded its mandate in ordering an internet blackout during civilian protests last week, a court ruled on Monday, as authorities pressed on with rounding up opposition figures blamed for the unrest. In his interim ruling, High Court Judge Owen Tagu told mobile operators to immediately and unconditionally resume full services. The biggest, Econet Wireless, compiled with the order late on Monday, it said in a message to subscribers. The sporadic blackout began on Tuesday following the start of protests against a rise in fuel prices that turned violent. With evidence growing that the country is slipping back into authoritarian rule, critics of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government had accused it of shutting off the internet to prevent a security clampdown being broadcast to the world. Mnangagwa was due back in Zimbabwe late on Monday after cutting short a foreign trip. There was no immediate comment from the government’s lawyer on whether it would appeal the court judgement. On Monday police arrested Japhet Moyo, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which called for a stay-at-home strike last week in conjunction with the fuel protest.  He faced subversion charges, his lawyer said, while the organisation’s president was in hiding.  Police say three people died during the unrest, but lawyers and human rights groups point to evidence suggesting at least a dozen were killed, while scores were treated for gunshot wounds and hundreds have been held on public order charges. They include six opposition lawmakers, of one whom was detained on Monday, as well as pastor Evan Mawarire, a rights activist and critic of former leader Robert Mugabe held on subversion charges for urging support for the union strike.  His application for bail will be heard on Wednesday, his lawyer said. The spokesman for the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said several of its leaders were also in hiding, and accused the president - - nicknamed “Crocodile” during his time as a high-ranking official in Mugabe’s strong-arm administration - of seeking to “dismantle” the party. A spokesman for Mnangagwa, who became leader after Mugabe was forced out in November 2017, said on Sunday that the crackdown was a foretaste of how authorities would respond to future unrest. With high inflation and a shortage of cash in circulation eating into ordinary Zimbabweans’ spending power, the fragile state of Zimbabwe’s economy was also in focus on Monday. The main teachers union said after a weekend meeting that its members remained “incapacitated” until the government made a meaningful adjustment to their salaries. The president broke off a foreign trip during which he had been expected to pitch for investments at the World Economic Forum in Davos. A foreign ministry source said he was now due back in Harare on Monday night. Earlier in the day, South Africa said it had last month turned down a request from its northern neighbour for a $1.2 billion loan. As many businesses, including banks, shops and government offices re-opened in Harare on Monday, the government introduced subsidies for bus travel after public taxis increased prices in response to the fuel price hike.

2019-02-08,"BEIRUT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel struck in Syria early on Monday, the latest salvo in its increasingly open assault on Iran’s presence there, shaking the night sky over Damascus with an hour of loud explosions in a second consecutive night of military action. Damascus did not say what damage or casualties resulted from the strikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said 11 people were killed. Syria’s ally Russia said four Syrian soldiers had died and six were wounded.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the air raid had mostly targeted Iranian forces, but also hit Syrians helping them. “We will strike at anyone who tries to harm us,” he said. The threat of direct confrontation between arch-enemies Israel and Iran has long simmered in Syria, where the Iranian military built a presence early in the nearly eight year civil war to help President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Israel, regarding Iran as its biggest threat, has repeatedly attacked Iranian targets in Syria and those of allied militia, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah. With an election approaching, Israel’s government has begun discussing its strikes more openly, and has also taken a tougher stance towards Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon. It said a rocket attack on Sunday was Iran’s work. The Israeli shift comes a month after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced a sudden plan to pull the 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, a move long sought by Assad and his Russian and Iranian allies. Trump’s decision shocked American allies in the region and was opposed by top U.S. officials including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who quit in response. The Israeli military said its fighter jets had attacked Iranian “Quds Force” targets early on Monday, including munition stores, a position in the Damascus International Airport, an intelligence site and a military training camp. Its jets then targeted Syrian defence batteries after coming under fire. It followed a previous night of cross-border fire, which Israel said began when Iranian troops fired an Iranian-made surface-to-surface missile from an area near Damascus at a ski resort in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.  Syria said it was Israel that had attacked and its air defences had repelled the assault. Syria had endured “intense attack through consecutive waves of guided missiles”, but had destroyed most “hostile targets”, state media quoted a military source as saying. The Russian defence ministry said Syrian air defences, supplied by Russia, had destroyed more than 30 cruise missiles and guided bombs, according to RIA news agency. In Tehran, airforce chief Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh said Iran was “fully ready and impatient to confront the Zionist regime and eliminate it from the earth”, according to the Young Journalist Club, a website supervised by state television.  Assad has said Iranian forces are welcome to stay in Syria after years of military victories that have brought most of the country back under his control. Just two big enclaves are still outside Assad’s grip, including the area Trump plans to exit.  Netanyahu, who is hoping to win a fifth term in the April 9 election, last week told his cabinet Israel has carried out “hundreds” of attacks over recent years.  “We have a permanent policy, to strike at the Iranian entrenchment in Syria and hurt whoever tries to hurt us,” he said on Sunday.     The Israeli military distributed footage of what it said were missiles hitting the Syrian defence batteries, as well as satellite images showing the location of the alleged Iranian targets. Syrian state media showed footage of explosions.  In a highly publicised operation last month, the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed cross-border tunnels from Lebanon it said were dug by Hezbollah to launch future attacks. Israel last fought a war with Hezbollah, on Lebanese soil, in 2006. It fears Hezbollah has used its own role fighting alongside Iran and Assad in Syria to bolster its military capabilities, including an arsenal of rockets aimed at Israel.  Tensions have also risen with Israel’s construction of a frontier barrier that Lebanon says passes through its territory. Washington has sought to reassure allies it still aims to eject Iran from Syria despite pulling its own troops out. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who visited the region this month, has vowed to expel “every last Iranian boot” from Syria. Israel has sought reassurances from Moscow that Iranian forces in Syria would not be a threat. Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said the missile fired at the ski resort was launched from “an area we were promised the Iranians would not be present in”.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT/LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Ever wanted to run your electric car for free? If you’re open to a bit of give and take, then stay plugged in and your wishes might come true. At least that’s what some European power companies and Japanese carmakers believe. E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF (EDF.PA) are already working with Nissan (7201.T) to develop services that allow power stored in electric vehicle batteries to be sold back to the grid - and now they’re trying to persuade European carmakers to follow suit. With millions of electric cars expected on European roads over the next decade, utility firms see both an opportunity to sell drivers more electricity and a risk that surges in charging at peak times could destabilise stressed power grids. That’s why E.ON is working with Nissan to develop so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, including software for aggregating and marketing charging data so the German power company can predict peaks and troughs in electricity demand. Nissan’s idea is that if you charge your electric vehicle (EV) at off-peak times and are prepared to sell power back to the grid when it’s under strain, you could effectively charge for free. French utility EDF has teamed up with San Diego-based V2G technology specialist Nuvve nuvve.com to build the first commercial-scale V2G charging network in Europe for vehicles made by Japan's Nissan and Mitsubishi (7211.T). Europe’s biggest utility by market value, Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI), has also worked with Nissan and Nuvve on V2G pilots in Denmark and the Netherlands, as well as in Rome and Genoa. The problem for the utilities is that unlike Nissan, the French and German firms that will make most of the electric cars expected on Europe’s road in coming years are not playing ball - at least for now.  E.ON and EDF are talking to European carmakers about taking V2G seriously, according to two industry sources, but they are more focused on EV charging technology that the sources say is less suited to two-way flows than Japanese standards. IONITY ionity.eu, a joint venture of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Ford (F.N), said it did not see an initial case for V2G in its drive to install high-speed charging stations across Europe to facilitate long-distance journeys. “Our clients want to charge fast and not feed back in,” a spokesman for IONITY said. “Only in combination with an external storage system would a use case possibly be interesting.” The other big V2G holdout is EV pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O), which also sells large stationary batteries for home power storage. Tesla declined to comment on V2G. The idea of using millions of EV batteries as large virtual power plants to put power back into the grid has been around for years though the concept is still mostly at the pilot phase, mainly because there are very few EVs on the roads now. But its appeal to the power industry is obvious. With a typical car driving less than 10 percent of the day, the rest of the time car batteries could be used to balance out demand and supply swings in energy networks that increasingly need to juggle intermittent solar and wind power. That’s the case in Germany in particular as it is phasing out baseload nuclear and coal-fired plants, unlike France and Japan which are sticking with nuclear to ensure a secure supply. (Analysis of planned spending on electric vehicles: tmsnrt.rs/2Hcr3H4) Jonathan Tudor, director of technology strategy at the innovation division of Britain’s biggest utility, Centrica (CNA.L), said V2G will be part of the mix of technologies stabilising networks - once more EVs hit the road. “Winding the clock forward 10-12 years, if consumer behaviour stays the same we will see thousands of people arriving home and wanting to charge up their cars at the time that is already peak demand for most countries,” he said. Alberto Piglia, global head of e-mobility at Enel, said as the EV market grows exponentially, there will be a tipping point at which there will be an explosion of related energy services. “We are preparing the world for this.” One major hurdle for the roll-out of V2G in Europe is that for now it only works well with the EV charging standard developed in Japan known as CHAdeMO. The IONITY e-mobility joint venture, meanwhile, is focused on establishing the Combined Charging System (CCS) plug as the industry standard. But experts say the communication protocol between CCS chargers and EV batteries is not being set up currently in way that allows rapid changes in two-way information flows to charge and discharge electricity. Rather, CCS is being developed so EV owners can charge vehicles as fast as possible, to encourage the acceptance of electric cars by drivers reluctant to give up the convenience of quickly filling up vehicles with gas. “We are missing a V2G charging standard,” said Gregory Poilasne, chief executive of Nuvve. The network of 4,000 V2G charging stations it is developing with EDF in Britain and France will only be used for now with corporate fleets of Nissan Leaf E-NV200 utility vans and Mitsubishi Outlanders running on the CHAdeMO standard. That’s why Nuvve is also in talks with French and other carmakers about making CCS compatible with V2G. China, the world’s biggest market for EVs, also has V2G in mind. China’s own GB/T standard is not well suited to V2G but the China Electricity Council struck an agreement with the Japan’s CHAdeMo Association last year to develop a common fast-charging plug that should handle rapid two-way flows. But at a time when global infrastructure standards for EVs have yet to be established, German carmakers are reluctant to give up on the technology they have invested in, nor cede too much control over their vehicle components to utility firms - something V2G effectively requires them to do. (Related article: Plug wars: the battle for electric car supremacy) Still, despite making little headway so far, E.ON hopes that the CCS standard will become part of the V2G mix. “The technology for aggregation and marketing that we’re developing at E.ON based on the CHAdeMO standard will also be applicable to the CCS standard,” said Johannes Werhahn, E.ON’s head of flexibility, renewables marketing and storage solutions. OVO Energy www.ovoenergy.com, a challenger to Britain's ""Big Six"" power retailers, is also eyeing CCS as a market for the V2G charger it launched last year in a deal with Nissan. “We are very close partners with Nissan but we do expect to work with other car manufacturers in future, including those that use CCS,” said Tom Pakenham, OVO’s head of EVs. Centrica invested in Israeli EV software charging firm Driivz driivz.com last year and said part of the deal would involve developing V2G technology. “Once the software is integrated and we understand what needs to be done we will look to start trials, likely sometime in the next 18 months,” Tudor said. One catch for V2G proponents is that constantly charging and discharging is widely perceived to be the fastest way to shorten the life span of a battery - the most expensive component in an EV usually accounting for about a third of its cost. Analysts say persuading consumers that V2G makes economic sense and doesn’t disrupt their daily lives will be crucial. Nissan, though, is convinced V2G will “change the rules of the game” once consumers can be offered a service that will effectively mean they can charge vehicles for free. Japan’s Honda (7267.T) also plans to incorporate V2G capability when it launches its first EV in Europe this year. Nuvve’s Poilasne said V2G could reduce the total cost of EV ownership by about 25 percent without ruining the battery, though earnings from grid-balancing services would be greater in countries with a larger share of intermittent renewable energy.

2019-02-08," (This Jan 18 story was refiled to delete extraneous wording in paragraph 15) By Michael Martina and Chris Prentice BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is pushing for regular reviews of China’s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal - and could again resort to tariffs if it deems Beijing has violated the agreement, according to sources briefed on negotiations to end the trade war between the two nations. A continuing threat of tariffs hanging over commerce between the world’s two largest economies would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been impacted by the trade war. “The threat of tariffs is not going away, even if there is a deal,” said one of three sources briefed on the talks who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. Chinese negotiators were not keen on the idea of regular compliance checks, the source said, but the U.S. proposal “didn’t derail negotiations.” A Chinese source said the United States wants “periodic assessments” but it’s not yet clear how often. “It looks like humiliation,” the source said. “But perhaps the two sides could find a way to save face for the Chinese government.” The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed import tariffs on Chinese goods to put pressure on Beijing to meet a long list of demands that would rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries.  The demands include changes to China’s policies on intellectual property protection, technology transfers, industrial subsidies and other trade barriers. An enforcement and verification process is unusual for trade deals and is akin to the process around punitive economic sanctions such as those imposed on North Korea and Iran. Disputes over trade are more typically dealt with through courts, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or through arbitration panels and other dispute settlement mechanisms built into trade agreements. Trump’s team has criticized the WTO for failing to hold China accountable for not executing on promised market reforms. The U.S. has also criticized the WTO’s dispute settlement process and is seeking reforms at the organization. (For an explainer on how the U.S.-China talks differ from any other trade negotiation, see: ) Regular reviews would be one potential solution to address a demand from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for ongoing verification of any trade pact between the two countries, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. The threat of tariffs would be used to keep reform on track, the sources said. Lighthizer is leading negotiations with China. A USTR spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of regular assessments. The idea of quarterly reviews was part of a U.S. negotiating document leaked after talks in May 2018, before the United States had slapped its first round of duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The renewed focus on regular reviews in current negotiations - this time carrying the threat of tariffs - underscores the growing distrust between the two countries. The extra scrutiny is needed and should be based on clear benchmarks - with consequence for failing to meet them, said Erin Ennis, Senior Vice President of the U.S.-China Business Council, a trade group representing American companies doing business in China. “It needs to be tied to removing or reducing the tariffs,” Ennis said. “If China can show compliance through a process like this, it would also be a trust-building measure for both sides.”  Trump’s administration has accused China of repeatedly failing to follow through on previous pledges to implement reforms sought by the United States. Washington often cites as an example the difficulties still faced by foreign payment card operators in entering China’s market despite a 2012 WTO ruling that Beijing was discriminating against them. A separate industry source said it is likely that different agreement on separate issues - forced technology transfer, intellectual property, changes to China’s legal system - would require separate verification processes, all of which will need to be hammered out by negotiators. “The challenge of verification and enforcement stems from the fact that China has made promises it hasn’t kept,” the source said. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce in the trade war in December to give their teams time to negotiate a deal. Nearly 50 days later, there is little sign that China will make the concessions the U.S. is seeking. Lighthizer saw no progress on structural issues at three days of mid-level talks in Beijing last week, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday. China’s Vice Premier and lead negotiator Liu He is due to visit Washington for the next round of talks with Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at the end of the month.

2019-02-08,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Tax systems that put a high burden on the poor mean public services are underfunded, stretching the gap between rich and poor and fueling global public anger, Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, said on Monday. The Nairobi-headquarted charity said in a report that a new billionaire was created every two days last year, just as the poorest half of the world’s population saw their wealth decline by 11 percent. The report, released on Monday as political and business leaders gather for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said governments are increasingly underfunding public services and failing to clamp down on tax dodging. “Poor people suffer twice from being deprived of basic services and also paying a higher burden of taxation,” Byanyima said in an interview. Billionaire fortunes increased by 12 percent last year, or $2.5 billion a day, while the 3.8 billion poorest people saw their wealth drop $500 million every day, Byanyima added. The charity said tax rates for the rich and corporations had been cut in recent decades. And when governments fail to tax the wealthy, they pass the tax burden on to poor people through consumer levies like value added tax, Byanyima said. “An indirect tax like that, that taxes salt, sugar or soap, the basics that people need ... then poor people pay relatively more out of their income than rich people,” she said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, will reiterate on Monday his willingness to talk to Prime Minister Theresa May on ways to break the deadlock over Brexit but not while the government wastes money on “no-deal brinkmanship”. After seeing her deal to leave the European Union resoundingly defeated in parliament last week, May has opened talks with lawmakers from all parties to try to find a way to move forward with Brexit. She is due to return to parliament on Monday to outline her plans, but with just weeks before Britain is due to leave in March and little concrete yet to have come out of those talks, some lawmakers are trying to wrest more control over Brexit. The future of Brexit, Britain’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy since World War Two, has never been so uncertain. Corbyn has said he will enter into talks with May only if the prime minister rules out a so-called no-deal Brexit, a scenario in which Britain leaves without an agreement and one that some businesses say would be disastrous for the economy. “We’re ready to talk to the government and others in parliament about a sensible alternative plan, but not while Theresa May is wasting 171,000 pounds an hour of taxpayers’ money on dangerous and unnecessary no-deal brinkmanship,” he said in a statement. “If the prime minister is serious about finding a solution that can command support in parliament and bring our country together, she must listen to the majority of MPs (lawmakers), as well as members of her own cabinet, and take ‘no deal’ off the table.” Labour said some of its top team would visit businesses around the country on Monday to discuss the dangers of a “no deal” Brexit. On Sunday, trade minister Liam Fox said May’s plan was still the best basis for a divorce deal. He suggested it could win support from parliament with a few tweaks to the so-called Northern Irish backstop, an insurance policy to ensure no return to a hard border between the British province and Ireland.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Greeks rallied in Athens on Sunday to protest against a deal with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that settles a row between the two countries and is set for a vote in Greece’s parliament next week. Soon after the rally started at 1200 GMT, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters outside parliament as demonstrators chanted Macedonia is Greek and waved Greek flags. The rally was one of the biggest demonstrations in Athens, over the Macedonia name agreement. Many Greeks believe the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over their country’s own northern region of that name. The issue evokes strong emotions among Greeks who consider Macedonia, the ancient kingdom ruled by Alexander the Great, to be an integral part of their homeland and heritage. The accord clinched between Athens and Skopje was ratified by Macedonia’s parliament this month.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German weapons maker Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) plans to sue the government over its decision to stop all arms exports to Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Spiegel Online reported on Sunday. Citing a letter to the Economy Ministry, Spiegel said Rheinmetall intends to sue the German government for loss of revenue if the export suspension continues. Berlin suspended approval of future export licences to Saudi Arabia in October and in November said it had worked with industry to halt shipments of arms sales that were already approved. No specific timetable was given at the time, but industry sources told Reuters an agreement had been struck to revisit the matter by mid-January. Last week the economy ministry said the government still had no intention of approving arms exports to Saudi Arabia. Without citing sources, Spiegel said Rheinmetall believes it can claim for compensation because the government’s decision affected exports that had already been approved. The company’s management fears shareholders could sue Rheinmetall if the company does not demand compensation for the losses, Spiegel added. “We cannot comment on individual decisions, possible revocations or individual measures,” the Economy Ministry said in an emailed statement. A spokesman for Rheinmetall declined to comment on the report. Spiegel said goods worth up to 2 billion euros (£1.8 billion) are affected by the export suspension, including four Cobra radar systems built by a consortium that includes France’s Thales (TCFP.PA), Airbus (AIR.PA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) of the United States.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office on Friday disputed key elements of a media report that President Donald Trump directed his former lawyer to lie to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal, raising questions about a story that has dominated U.S. news coverage for the past 24 hours.    BuzzFeed News reported late on Thursday that Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer who is slated to go to prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, told investigators working for Mueller that Trump had instructed him to lie about efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow while he was running for president. “BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel’s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s Congressional testimony are not accurate,” Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, said in the special counsel’s first comment on a media report since its probe started 20 months ago. While Carr did not directly address whether there was evidence that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress, he disputed portions of the story about how BuzzFeed corroborated the explosive allegations against Trump. Citing information from two federal law enforcement officials, BuzzFeed said Cohen told the special counsel that after the 2016 presidential election Trump instructed him to tell Congress that negotiations over the Moscow project had ended earlier than they had in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.  Carr’s statement also appeared to dispute BuzzFeed’s assertion that the special counsel learned about Trump’s directive from interviews with employees of the Trump Organization, emails, text messages and other documents. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith said in a statement: “We stand by the reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he’s disputing.” After the BuzzFeed report was published on Thursday night, investigators in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives said they planned to investigate the allegations, while some Democrats described the report as a game-changer that, if true, could be grounds for impeaching the president.  Earlier on Friday, the White House said the story was false. “Look, that’s absolutely ridiculous,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said Mueller’s decision to comment highlighted the significance of the allegations made in the BuzzFeed article and the attention it was getting in the media and among lawmakers. “They are making a public comment to tell everyone to calm down,” Weinstein said. “He doesn’t want people to think his silence is confirming the truthfulness of the report.” Trump said on Twitter that Cohen was lying to get less prison time. Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said in a statement that any suggestion that Trump told Cohen to lie is “categorically false.” Representatives for the Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on the BuzzFeed report. Cohen, who once said he was so loyal to Trump that he would “take a bullet” for him, is scheduled to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to charges including campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress. If Trump did tell Cohen to lie, that would constitute criminal activity, said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat. He added that he would look into the matter. “Directing a subordinate to lie to Congress is a federal crime,” Nadler said on Twitter. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the allegation that Trump may have directed Cohen to lie under oath “is among the most serious to date.” “We will do what’s necessary to find out if it’s true,” Schiff, also a Democrat, said on Twitter. Some Senate Intelligence Committee investigators hope to ask Cohen about the BuzzFeed report when he testifies behind closed doors in February, a committee source told Reuters. He also will face questions about it in testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 7. Yet Mueller’s move to push back on the BuzzFeed report could give some lawmakers pause, while also giving ammunition to allies of Trump in their efforts to criticize the media and in their calls for Mueller to complete his probe. “Today’s development only underscores the need for the special counsel to wrap this investigation up immediately,” Republican Representative Mark Meadows said on Twittter. “The constant secrecy and breathless speculation helps no one.”  Legal experts said the allegation, if true, exposed Trump to a new level of risk in an investigation that has already resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from four former campaign aides, including ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. If true, “it’s a seismic event,” Andy Wright, an associate White House counsel under former Democratic President Barack Obama, told Reuters.  Cohen, his left arm in a sling, did not comment as he entered his apartment building in New York on Friday. His adviser, Lanny Davis, also declined to comment to Reuters, and his lawyer, Guy Petrillo, did not respond to a request for comment. Trump denounced Cohen as a “rat” after he began cooperating with investigators while Cohen, whose duties included making payoffs to two women who said they had affairs with Trump, said on Thursday he regretted giving “my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it.” Directing or encouraging someone to lie under oath is a crime known as subornation of perjury. The report also raises questions about obstruction of justice and conspiracy.  William Barr, Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, said at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that a president would be committing obstruction if he directed a subordinate to lie under oath. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. While the Justice Department has previously concluded that a sitting president cannot be charged while in office, such an allegation, if found true, could fuel impeachment proceedings in Congress. Trump repeatedly has denied collusion with Russia and slammed Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt.” Russia also has rejected U.S. intelligence findings that Moscow interfered in U.S. politics in the 2016 election in an effort to boost Trump. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he had no ties or business dealings with Russia. Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month, have generally been cautious regarding any talk of impeachment to remove Trump from office although some rank-and-file members have pushed for such a resolution.  Impeachment proceedings would face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Trump’s fellow Republicans have a majority. BuzzFeed also reported that Cohen regularly updated Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is now a top White House adviser, about the Moscow project. A spokesman for Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Ivanka Trump, said she was minimally involved in the development. Trump Jr., who has also testified previously before Congress, in a Twitter post called the BuzzFeed report “fake news.” After Mueller’s statement disputing the report, Trump Jr. called out the media and Schiff in a series of Twitter posts. “Hey Adam, turns out it was Full of Schiff!” he wrote.

2019-02-08,"DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Del (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump travelled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Saturday to receive the remains of four Americans killed in a suicide bombing in northern Syria. Trump, locked in a battle with congressional Democrats that has led to a nearly month-long partial government shutdown, announced his trip via a predawn tweet, saying he was going “to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House prior to departure that he planned to meet the families, a duty which he said “might be the toughest thing I have to do as president.” He was greeted by military staff at Dover Air Force Base after a short flight from Joint Base Andrews, but did not speak to reporters before entering his motorcade. Flanked by military officials, Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan filed up a ramp leading onto a military transport aircraft, where a prayer was given to honour the memory of Scott Wirtz, a civilian Department of Defense employee from St. Louis.  Trump filed down the plank and saluted while six service members clad in fatigues and white gloves carried an American flag-draped casket carrying Wirtz to a waiting gray van.  The Dover base is a traditional hub for returning the remains of American troops abroad. The United States believes the attack that killed the Americans was the work of Islamic State militants. Trump announced last month that he planned to speedily withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, but has since said it does not need to go quickly as he tries to ensure safety of Kurdish allies in northern Syria who are at risk of attack from neighbouring Turkey.  Trump told reporters on Saturday that his Syria policy has made progress but that some work remained in destroying Islamic State targets. He defended his plans for a withdrawal. “It’s moving along very well, but when I took over it was a total mess. But you do have to ask yourself, we’re killing ISIS for Russia, for Iran, for Syria, for Iraq, for a lot of other places. At some point you want to bring our people back home,” he said. In addition to Wirtz, those who died during the Wednesday attack in Manbij, Syria, were Army Chief Warrant Officer Jonathan Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Florida, and Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon Kent, 35, identified as being from upstate New York, the Department of Defense said in a statement. The Pentagon did not identify the fourth person killed, a contractor working for a private company.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiators are “watching the BBC and eating popcorn”, in the words of one of them, as Britain’s domestic rows over leaving make for compelling TV but frustrate Europe’s hopes for a clean break. Unsure whether Britain will crash out of the European Union 10 weeks from now, prolong the agony in the hope of salvaging an orderly divorce or even change its mind and stay, its neighbours are torn between “Brexit boredom” and a worry it is distracting from their own pressing problems as campaigning gets under way for EU parliament elections in May. Hours after a packed and rowdy House of Commons tore up the deal Prime Minister Theresa May spent two tortuous years arguing over, only a few dozen of their 751 counterparts in Strasbourg showed up on Wednesday to hear EU negotiator Michel Barnier tell them all he could do is wait for Britons to make up their minds. Several in the debate praised Britain’s democratic history and were bemused by its poisonous meltdown over Brexit. Among them was Dutch conservative Esther de Lange: “Collectively, they don’t know what they want,” she said of watching the Commons in action. “But, boy, do they hold great speeches about it.” Compared to a full house to mark the 20th anniversary of the euro, the EU currency Britain snubbed, the hundreds of empty seats around her were a mark of Europe’s weariness with Brexit.  But it also belied anxiety that paralysis in London will distract and divide leaders on other EU problems, from a slowing economy amid global trade disputes to deep divisions over money, migrants and Brexit-inspired Brussels-bashing by many members. French President Emmanuel Macron says he does not want to “waste time” on Brexit as he presses to reshape the euro zone and the broader Union after the European elections in four months’ time. His EU affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said Brexit took up a third of her time: “It’s too much,” she said, “Because we have many other things to do in Europe than dealing with a divorce.” Manfred Weber, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel who is leading the centre-right campaign, said that “Europe’s door is still open” should Britain decide to stay. But he told Reuters: “It is now time to move on and get Brexit over with.” Weber complained that a “never-ending Brexit process” had taken “huge amounts of time, money and expertise” from the EU. “It has consumed valuable political energy, especially in this election year,” he said, “And has held us back from shaping a real positive European agenda for the future.” Nearly three years after Britain’s shock referendum vote to leave put supporters of European integration on the back foot, a push to regain momentum lies behind a summit of the remaining 27 leaders to be held in the Romanian town of Sibiu on May 9. It was intended by EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker to focus minds on a future without one of Europe’s three biggest economies and two nuclear military powers, and be the culmination of efforts to end divisions threatening EU cohesion. During last month’s EU summit, which they hoped would be the last on Brexit, leaders were visibly weary of it: “The fatigue was palpable,” said one diplomat in the room. “They don’t want to be bothered with it. They want to get it over with.” If there has been a positive from Brexit, leaders say, it has been the exceptional unity the 27 have shown in negotiation — though a scary end-game could yet test that togetherness. Many also believe turmoil in Britain has dampened appetites to follow suit, with European voters warming to the Union and eurosceptic governments, such as in Italy, Hungary and Poland, stressing their criticisms of the EU do not presage an exit. Yet Sibiu and the EU elections on May 26 are set to expose continuing schisms on how to move the Union forward. Founders France and Germany disagree over tightening monetary union, as do Italy and its northern neighbours over sharing out migrants arriving by sea. Rich contributor states and the ex-communist east are split over filling a Britain-sized hole in the EU budget and over some eastern governments’ manoeuvring to stifle their opponents. “On Brexit, the EU has shown exceptional unity — if only we could show the same kind of unity on everything else,” lamented one diplomat involved in preparing the summit. One result of May’s troubles could be that Britain is still a member come Sibiu and the EU elections — a new headache that makes some wary of extending the Brexit deadline. Few, however, seem willing to force Britain out against its will — yet. Prolonging the process, though, is bad news, said an envoy to Brussels from a non-EU country. Leaders have tried to drive it down their list of priorities and ring-fence the negotiations in Barnier’s task force: “But Brexit sits around like a bad penny,” he said. “You can’t ignore it. It’s in your face and will continue to be in your face until it’s resolved.” Additional reporting by Paul Carrel in Berlin, Padraic Halpin in Dublin, Gabriela Bazcynska in Brussels and Peter Maushagen in Strasbourg; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-popcorn/popcorn-to-hand-eu-watches-brexit-show-but-frets-for-own-future-idUKKCN1PC1T7,2019-02-08,"EU Brexit negotiators are ""watching the BBC and eating popcorn"", in the words of one of them, as Britain's domestic rows over leaving make for compelling TV but frustrate Europe's hopes for a clean break.","Popcorn to hand, EU watches Brexit show but frets for own future"
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have met to discuss imposing a fine against Facebook Inc (FB.O) for violating a legally binding agreement with the government to protect the privacy of personal data, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing three people familiar with the discussions. The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating Facebook since last year. It has not finalised its findings in the probe or the total amount of the penalty, according to the newspaper wapo.st/2FGGRj0. Facebook has talked with FTC staff about the investigation, one of the people familiar with the matter told the Post. However, it is unclear if the company would settle with the FTC by accepting a significant financial penalty, which is expected to be much larger than the $22.5 million (17.5 million pounds) fine the agency imposed on Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google in 2012, the report said. Facebook declined to comment.  The FTC, which is affected by the U.S. government shutdown, did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Generally secretive, it took the unusual step last March of announcing the opening of an investigation into Facebook’s privacy practices.  The announcement followed news reports that revealed lax oversight by the social media company had enabled a quiz app on Facebook to gather details on 87 million users and share it with now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Facebook has since acknowledged several other lapses in protecting user data, drawing additional scrutiny from regulators around the world.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch’s London-based newspapers The Times and Sunday Times have asked the British government for permission to share resources across both titles, a move that is barred under rules imposed when the media mogul bought both newspapers in 1981. John Witherow, editor of The Times, said the cost pressures facing the newspaper industry meant the titles needed to manage their newsrooms as carefully as possible.  “We need to stay competitive in an increasingly difficult market so that we can continue to build a sustainable future for Times journalism,” he said in a statement on Friday. Murdoch, who already owned the Sun and News of the World British tabloids, provided a legally binding guarantee to preserve the two broadsheets’ editorial independence when he was allowed to buy them without undergoing a competition inquiry.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission indicated on Friday that Britons would need to choose their representatives to the next European Parliament if the country were to stay in the European Union beyond the first sitting of the new assembly on July 2. Britain is due to leave the EU at midnight of March 29th, but the British parliament has rejected a withdrawal agreement   Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with the EU. Expectations are rising that London will need to ask for more time to agree its own position on the terms of its exit. The prospect of an extension sparked a debate over whether Britain would need to take part in European parliamentary elections to avoid legal challenges to the institution’s work if Britain were not represented, even though still formally a member of the EU at the time when it starts operating. Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a regular news briefing that the EU executive arm had not received any request from London for an extension of the March 29 deadline to leave the EU and therefore such a discussion was theoretical. “We ... as the guardian of EU treaties, suggest caution with any suggestion that the right of EU citizens to vote in the European Parliament elections, according to the rules that are applicable, could be called into question,” Schinas said. “We have a legally composed European Parliament which requires directly elected MEPs from all member states at the latest on the first day of the new term of the new parliament,  which this time is the second of July,” he said.  “This is the legal situation. As guardians of the treaty we would prefer to stay within the applicable legal order,” he said. But the legal services of the European Parliament itself have a different view. In a legal opinion from 2017, seen by Reuters, European Parliament lawyers said Britain would not have to elect its representatives, even if it were still a member of the EU. “The Legal Service... takes the view that... the European Council could validly adopt a decision containing a scenario for the composition of Parliament without seats envisaged for the UK, if the latter had not formally withdrawn from the Union at the time of adoption of this decision,” the legal said. Britain had a treaty obligation to organise elections to the European Parliament if it were still a member in May, the lawyers. But if it decided not to do that, the legality of the next European Parliament could not be questioned, they said.  “The Legal Service takes the view that, the possibility for the European Parliament to be validly constituted following the 2019 elections would not be affected by a potential failure of by the UK to organise elections,” the opinion said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Thursday it had removed hundreds of Russia-initiated accounts, which it judged to be involved in coordinated inauthentic behaviour on its platforms, including some linked to state-owned news agency Sputnik. In a separate statement, Sputnik attacked the social network for a decision it said was political and amounted to censorship of seven Facebook pages belonging to its news hubs in neighbouring countries. Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said in a blog post bit.ly/2W1h9LR it had unearthed two separate operations which originated in Russia, with one active in multiple countries across eastern Europe and the other specific to Ukraine.  The social media company said it had taken down about 364 Facebook pages and accounts operating in Baltic Sea states, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and parts of Europe, and that the pages were linked to employees of Sputnik. “Despite their misrepresentations of their identities, we found that these pages and accounts were linked to employees of Sputnik,” Gleicher wrote.  “Some of the pages frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements and anti-corruption.” Facebook has been under fire for the last two years for its self-admitted sluggishness in developing tools to combat extremist content and propaganda operations.   It and other social media companies have targeted foreign interference on their platforms after criticism that they did not do enough to detect, halt and disclose Russian efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential race.  Iran and Russia have both denied allegations that they used social media platforms to launch disinformation campaigns, but Facebook and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) took down millions of posts and shuttered accounts linked to influence operations in the run-up to mid-term elections last November. Facebook also said that based on a tip from U.S. law enforcement, it had separately removed 107 pages, groups and accounts and 41 Instagram accounts that originated in Russia and operated in Ukraine. “We didn’t find any links between these operations, but they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,” the company said. With the Ukraine-specific accounts, Facebook said it identified some technical overlap with Russia-based activity it saw prior to the U.S. midterms, including behaviour that shared characteristics with previous Internet Research Agency (IRA) activity. IRA was indicted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in 2018 for flooding social media with false information in a bid to sow discord in the run-up to the 2016 election. A New York Times report in November contended that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and other executives had tried to deflect criticism internally and in Congress about Russian propaganda spreading through Facebook over the last three years. Zuckerberg defended his response to Russian election meddling on Facebook and issued a new plan aimed at stifling misbehaviour while maintaining a vibrant hub for online speech.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer, said on Thursday he paid a firm to manipulate online polling data “at the direction of and for the sole benefit of” Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen had paid the data firm RedFinch Solutions to manipulate two public opinion polls in favour of Trump before the 2016 presidential campaign. “As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging,” Cohen wrote on Twitter on Thursday, “what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it.” The attempts to influence the polls ultimately proved largely unsuccessful but shed a light on the tactics of the Trump campaign and Cohen’s role within it. On the campaign trail, Trump frequently referred to his polling numbers to help fuel his candidacy. Cohen was sentenced last month to three years in prison for his role in making illegal hush-money payments to women to help Trump’s campaign and for lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower project in Russia. Cohen has said Trump had directed him to commit the campaign-finance violations, which Trump has denied. The Journal said Cohen commissioned John Gauger, who runs RedFinch Solutions, to write a computer script to repeatedly vote for Trump in a February 2015 Drudge Report poll on potential Republican candidates. The move came as Trump was preparing to enter the 2016 presidential election race, the newspaper reported. Trump ranked fifth in the Drudge Report poll, with about 24,000 votes, or 5 percent of the total, according to the Journal. Cohen also commissioned Gauger to do the same for a 2014 CNBC online poll identifying the country’s top business leaders, although Trump was unable to break into the top 100 candidates, the Journal reported. “The president has no knowledge of the polls being rigged,” Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in an interview with Reuters. Trump tweeted about a CNBC poll on business leaders in 2014, calling it “a joke” and suggested he was removed from the list because of “politics.”  Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the details of the newspaper report. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did representatives for RedFinch Solutions and the Trump Organization. Charles James, a lawyer for Gauger, declined to comment. Gauger said Cohen paid him in cash out of a blue Walmart bag, although not for the total amount he was owed. Cohen also promised Gauger work on the Trump campaign that never materialized, according to the Journal. Cohen worked for Trump for many years as his self-proclaimed fixer, and once said he would take a bullet for Trump. But the relationship has since publicly soured. Trump has called Cohen a “rat,” while Cohen has cooperated with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia during the campaign. Both Trump and Moscow have denied any wrongdoing. Cohen has also agreed to testify publicly in front of the House of Representatives’ Oversight Committee in a hearing scheduled to take place next month.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Hitachi’s decision to freeze its $28 billion nuclear power project in Britain strengthens the hand of France’s EDF and its Chinese partner in talks with the government on how to finance new reactors. Funding new nuclear plants has become critical as Hitachi became the second Japanese firm to say its British nuclear power project had hit the buffers over financing. The two projects would have covered about 13 percent of Britain’s power needs. EDF and its partner China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) want to use a financing model under which investors in their nuclear projects receive payment from the moment they start construction, reducing their risk. But to proceed with this approach, the government must first win over lawmakers and consumers, already frustrated by hefty energy bills and costly nuclear projects that often face delays. “The question is whether it is sellable to parliament that all the risks go to the public. But if that is not the case, they will get no investors,” said Stephen Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University.  EDF is negotiating with the government on funding the Sizewell C project using the so-called regulated asset base model in which investors earn a government-set fixed return from the start, instead of waiting years until construction is completed before receiving a return. China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 20 percent stake in Sizewell C, while EDF has a 33.5 percent stake in CGN’s project to build a reactor at Bradwell, Essex. “If new nuclear is to be successful in a more competitive energy market – which I very much believe it can be – we need to consider a new approach to financing future projects,” Energy Secretary Greg Clark told parliament, saying this included Sizewell and Bradwell. He addressed lawmakers after Hitachi said it had failed to find private equity investors, even though the government had considered partly funding it with taxpayer’s money. That announcement followed Toshiba’s decision in November to scrap its NuGen project in Britain after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer for the plan. Specialists say both projects were doomed from the start. Only utilities have the steady cash flows to fund such long-term projects, but most European utilities pulled out of Britain’s nuclear plans after the 2011 Fukushima disaster led to rising safety costs and as renewable energy became a more competitive investment prospect. The regulated asset base model may now be one of the few remaining options to fund new nuclear plants in Europe. It is commonly used to fund construction of electricity transmission lines and, in Britain, has been used to fund the Thames Tideway Tunnel, a “super sewer” for London. “Dialogue about a regulated asset base financing model for Sizewell C is progressing,” an EDF official said.  But the model has not be used in the nuclear industry, so talks are likely to be tough as the government seeks a clear outline of how much it would have to spend over a specified period and works to avoid writing a blank cheque to cover cost overruns. The government intends to publish its assessment by the summer at the latest. For now, the only nuclear plant under construction in Britain is EDF’s Hinkley Point C project, in which CGN also has a 33.5 percent stake. The deal to fund that plant involved EDF taking on the financing and bearing the full risk for construction delays or cost overruns. In return, it was guaranteed a power price of up to 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour for 35 years, more than twice the market rate when signed. That drew fierce criticism from lawmakers and the public for being too generous and there are no plans to repeat it. After the Hitachi and Toshiba announcements, the government is now depending on just EDF and CGN to deliver on its plans for a fleet of new reactors to meet energy demand as it phases out old nuclear facilities and coal-fired plants. “Britain’s energy security and decarbonisation strategy are hanging by a thread,” said French consultant Thibault Laconde.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Vodafone (VOD.L) is teaming up with IBM (IBM.N) to offer businesses a way to link different cloud computing systems to support the next wave of digital advances, such as machine learning, on super-fast fifth-generation telecoms networks.  As part of the deal, the UK-based telecoms operator will pay $550 million (£426 million) to IBM under an eight-year managed-services agreement that will offer tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to networked businesses. The two companies are pitching the venture as a combination of cloud computing and connectivity that would, for example, enable super-fast communication between robots on a factory floor without the need for a big ‘pipe’ back to a data centre. And, with an estimated 70 percent of organisations using up to 15 different cloud systems, the ability to link them should make it easier for firms to adapt and innovate without having to redesign their networks from the ground up. “Businesses are beginning to embrace digital ... as they do that they get a lot of complexity,” Greg Hyttenrauch of Vodafone, one of the co-leaders of the project, told Reuters in an interview. “We predicated this venture on the ability to simplify that complexity.” Vodafone has built a strong position in mobile services for business - it is the No. 1 or No. 2 provider in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain - and is stepping up its battle against BT (BT.L), Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Telefonica (TEF.MC) in the fixed-line business market. It aims to grow business service revenue, which currently accounts for 30 percent of its total, by combining fixed-line and mobile services with new technology in areas like AI and the Internet of Things. The venture will focus on Vodafone’s British, German and Irish markets, targeting multinationals and national enterprises operating in industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities, agriculture or transportation. It is expected to be operational in the first half of 2019. The partnership seeks to bring IBM’s prowess in handling multiple cloud-based systems to bear, and reflects the priorities behind its $34 billion takeover of Red Hat (RHT.N), a software firm that specialises in Linux operating systems, said IBM’s Michael Valocchi, the other co-lead. Analyst Dave Bartoletti at Forrester Research said the deal recognised Vodafone’s need for a partner to build out its cloud computing services. At the same time, IBM is moving away from competing head on with “hyperscale” cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AMZN.O), Microsoft Azure (MSFT.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) that offer hosted memory, network and storage services that can grow with the needs of big, data-intensive businesses. Instead, it is aiming to be “the go-to company for enterprises who need to stitch together multiple cloud platforms”, said Bartoletti. Analyst Carla Arend at IDC estimates the global cloud market at $420 billion this year, with the market for global cloud connectivity worth another $2 billion.  “The combined global market opportunity is huge,” she said. Ireland and Britain have already allocated 5G spectrum and Germany is about to auction frequencies for a mobile technology that will offer downloads far faster than on existing networks, as well as ultra-low ‘latency’ - or reaction times. Combining these characteristics with significant computing power will make it possible to deploy applications such as AI, or computerised problem solving, in the field. Telecoms operators say they expect to start offering 5G services from next year in European markets that have moved to allocate spectrum and build out networks.

2019-02-08,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Like many Argentine businessmen, Marco Meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales, more than 70 percent interest rates and soaring utility bills. The reason? He doesn’t have the money to fire anyone. A little-reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping Latin America’s third-largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs. Small businesses, the biggest employer in Argentina, have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 percent, a tumbling peso, and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies’ operating costs. But the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 percent. Reuters interviews with business owners in textile, plastic, clothing and paint industries, government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover, which the International Monetary Fund expects to begin in the second quarter. Firms are reducing working hours, halting production on some days, cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts.  The workforce contracted by just 120,000 registered workers between October 2017 and October 2018, the latest government data reviewed by Reuters shows. That represents about 1 percent of the 12 million-strong labor force. In contrast, the United States lost about 6 percent, or some 8.7 million people, of its workforce during the two years of the 2007/08 Great Recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat. Argentina has some of the world’s most generous labor laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners like Meloni to adapt to an economy now in recession. Typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its workforce to cut costs. But in Argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy. Introduced by successive populist Peronist governments since the 1940s, the labor laws make the country one of the most expensive in Latin America to employ, or fire, a worker. Argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired. And crucially, there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay.  In contrast, neighboring Chile has a cap on severance pay. Layoff costs in Argentina are among the highest in the world, according to the World Bank’s Doing Business project, which measures business regulations in 190 economies. The Argentine labor laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate. In addition, President Mauricio Macri, a free marketer who wants to reform the country’s rigid labor system to encourage foreign investment, is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers. He announced on Nov. 13 that companies must give 10 days’ notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed. Macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidize salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits. The government has not yet issued any regulations to enforce its announcement, so it is not clear whether companies are informing them of pending dismissals.    Like many small businessmen, Meloni has found himself caught in a vice. Sales from his plant in the town of Quilmes, 30 km (19 miles) outside the capital Buenos Aires, shrank by just over one third last year as Argentina’s economy sank deep into recession. “It was not a storm,” said Meloni, a reference to how the country’s president has described the economic crisis. “It was a tsunami. The tsunami kills.”  Meloni said the plant, which makes fabrics, used to operate 24 hours a day from Monday to Saturday but now just operates 16 hours a day, five days a week. Like many other businesses, Meloni advanced the holidays to his roughly 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in March, demand will pick up. Daniel Funes de Rioja, the head of one of Argentina’s biggest labor law firms, said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers. Many, especially in low-skilled industries, stay in the same job for years, so paying them severance becomes very expensive. “There’s a cultural custom for Argentines to remain in their jobs but also, as it has been always very expensive to fire people, that has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies,” explained economist Camilo Tiscornia, from Buenos Aires-based C&T consultancy.  Production Minister Dante Sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner.  “They prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs, plus the cost of hiring is costly,” Sica said in an interview. The unemployment rate in Argentina fell to 9 percent in the third quarter from 9.6 percent in the second quarter. Year on year, it increased only 0.7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017, when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3.8 percent. While workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts. Some have resorted to taking second jobs, working for Uber, the ride hailing app, for example, according to anecdotal reports. “We are not happy with these measures at all (fewer shifts, shorter hours), but the last thing we want is layoffs,” said Jose Minaberrigaray, head of Setia, a textile workers union that represents 25,000 workers. “But we have to choose what is bad and what is worse,” he told Reuters. Macri has pushed for labor reforms to make it easier for companies to hire and fire, but his government has delayed implementing them after protests in December 2017. Sica, the production minister, has said they will try again in 2019 but it will be difficult to get political support for the reforms in an election year. Tiscornia, the economist, said the difficulty in firing workers ultimately hurt the competitiveness of Argentine companies. “Making it easier to fire people or to reduce salaries improves the economy efficiency and the companies’ capacity to adjust to different situations,” he said. “In the U.S. it’s tremendously easy to fire but at the same time they are at the lowest historic jobless rate because that market has very strong flexibility. That favors the creation of new companies. Here if you start a business and it doesn’t work, you are stuck with the employees, so you don’t even try.”  At the metallurgical company where Pablo Mansur, 31, works, production has fallen 30 percent over the last 12 months. To keep busy, workers are painting, cleaning and doing repairs, Mansur said. Workers were also told to take their vacations in December, a period when production would be low any way because of public holidays. He said workers agreed to this because “we are aware of the reality. It is not a whim,” he said. Jorge Göttert, president of Göttert, a 75-year-old company that makes production line systems for the wood and auto sectors, says he has tried not to lay off workers because of his memories of what happened during the country’s worst financial crisis in 2001. Then, the company laid off half of its staff to try to survive.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Taiwan objects to Britain’s proposed rules for managing its trade in services after it leaves the European Union and has requested negotiations at the World Trade Organization, according to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday. Britain voted in a referendum in 2016 to leave the EU, which has spoken for Britain on trade matters ever since the WTO was founded in 1995. As part of the Brexit divorce, Britain needs its own WTO membership texts, known as schedules, to set out how it will treat its trading partners in goods and services. Last month, Britain formally submitted its proposed new services schedule to the WTO. Trade Minister Liam Fox said the process would replicate existing arrangements as far as possible and was “only a technical exercise”. In a document circulated to other WTO members on Wednesday, Taiwan raised objections, saying the new text made more than purely technical changes. Taipei looked forward to “entering into consultations expeditiously with the United Kingdom in order to reach a satisfactory resolution to this matter”. It cited eight sections where it had objections, mainly clauses that were no longer relevant or necessary.  But in financial services and aircraft leasing and rental, Taiwan said the new schedule would leave it with less market access than it had previously. “Current European Union commitments require European Union Member States to allow airlines to lease aircraft registered anywhere in the European Union. However, the United Kingdom has changed this obligation to require United Kingdom airlines to lease aircraft registered in the United Kingdom,” it said. “This appears to reduce market access, as the scope of where aircraft may be registered has been reduced. The United Kingdom should delete this limitation.” Similarly, in financial services, there were several areas where the EU schedule included a requirement for establishment in the EU, Taiwan said. “The United Kingdom changed ‘EU’ to ‘UK’ for these entries in its draft schedule. This would appear to reduce market access, as it reduces the geographical scope of establishment.” If Taiwan and potentially other WTO members press Britain for improvements to the text, Fox may need to offer them compensation by opening up trade in other areas, although any such liberalisation would apply across the WTO. Britain is facing similar objections to its goods schedule, with widespread dissatisfaction among agricultural suppliers.  Failing to reach rapid agreement may be a bureaucratic headache and add to criticism of the Brexit process, but it will not affect the Brexit timetable; many WTO members trade without finalised schedules, on the understanding that they are trying in good faith to reach an agreement in the meantime.

In a report published after parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the Committee on Exiting the European Union also said that if parliament could not agree on a way forward by the March 29 exit day, MPs should be able to vote on whether to extend the Article 50 negotiation period. “The House of Commons needs to see if there is a consensus for a different approach and holding a series of indicative votes as soon as possible will help us to do that,” the committee’s chair, Labour lawmaker Hilary Benn, said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - With just 10 weeks until the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union, it is unclear how or even whether the divorce will take place.  The crushing defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal means she must now work with other parties in parliament on a new variant if she is to avoid a no-deal Brexit or the other option, a referendum on membership. As the clock ticks down to 2300 GMT on March 29, the time and date set in law for Brexit, May has three main options: a compromise deal, a no-deal Brexit or  halting Brexit altogether. After her defeat, May pledged to speak to senior to parliamentarians to find a compromise, and financial markets are betting that lawmakers will cobble together a last-minute deal. The opposition Labour Party’s finance policy spokesman, John McDonnell, said Labour would support May if she agreed to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU, a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers. With May’s Conservatives deeply split, the opposition party holds great influence over the eventual outcome of Brexit. It is difficult to see how any Brexit plan can pass the House of Commons without the support of some of Labour’s 256 lawmakers. But if May moves closer to Labour’s position, she risks losing the support of dozens of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers as well as the small Northern Irish party which props up her minority government. If May is unable to forge a compromise deal, she will have to chose between calling a national election, delaying Brexit or going for a no-deal exit. Many Conservative lawmakers would oppose fighting a national election at such a crucial juncture, especially after she lost the party its majority in a snap poll in 2017. May herself said on Wednesday an election would be “the worst thing we could do”. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that one way forward would be for Britain to accept closer alignment with EU regulations. EU officials say London could, for example, abandon its plan to leave the EU customs union and single market, but that is unlikely to win backing among many Conservatives. NO-DEAL BREXIT Despite strong opposition among a majority of British lawmakers and many businesses to leaving the EU without a deal, this remains the default option unless parliament can agree on a  Brexit plan. “It is not enough to just not like May’s deal - to not have a no-deal there has to be something to replace it with, otherwise we leave without a deal,” said one senior British lawmaker. No-deal means there would be no transition so the exit would be abrupt, the nightmare scenario for international businesses and the dream of hard Brexiteers who want a decisive split. Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules. Business leaders are triggering contingency plans to cope with additional checks on the post-Brexit UK-EU border they fear will clog ports, silt up the arteries of trade and dislocate supply chains in Europe and beyond. Brexit supporters say there would be short-term disruption but in the long-term the UK would thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity that is falling behind China and the United States. Since the 2016 referendum, opponents of Brexit have sought another vote they hope would overturn the result, but May has repeatedly ruled this out, saying it would undermine faith in democracy among the 17.4 million who voted in 2016 to leave. A new referendum can only be called if it is approved by parliament and there is currently no majority in favour of one. The opposition Labour Party wants to push for an election and only if that is rejected will it consider another referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is a veteran eurosceptic who has also spoken out in the past against a second referendum. However, a prominent pro-EU Conservative lawmaker, Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday submitted legislation making provisions for a second Brexit referendum. If parliament agreed to a second referendum, Britain would have to ask for an extension to its timetable for leaving the EU to allow enough time for a campaign, probably by withdrawing its Article 50 formal departure notification. The Electoral Commission would have to agree what question, or questions, would be asked of the public. At the highest levels of government, there are worries that a second referendum would exacerbate the deep divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum, alienate millions of pro-Brexit voters and stoke support for the far-right. If Britons voted to remain, Brexit supporters might then demand a third and decisive vote. “I became prime minister immediately after that (2016) referendum,” May said minutes after her Brexit deal was rejected on Tuesday. “I believe it is my duty to deliver on their instruction and I intend to do so.” Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-scenarios/brexit-where-will-the-uk-end-up-fudge-no-deal-exit-or-halting-brexit-idUKKCN1PA21J,2019-02-08,,"Brexit - Where will the UK end up: fudge, no-deal exit or halting Brexit?"

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation hit its lowest in nearly two years in December as fuel prices fell, leaving the Bank of England under no pressure to carry on raising interest rates as uncertainty over Brexit dominates the economic outlook. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in December, slowing from 2.3 percent in November, the Office for National Statistics said, as a Reuters poll of economists had predicted. The rise was the smallest since January 2017. Although inflation remained just above the Bank’s 2 percent target, it was likely to fall below that level soon and there was little immediate urgency for the BoE to move, economists said. The central bank has sketched out a range of Brexit scenarios including a worst-case no-deal outcome in which sterling would plunge to parity against the dollar, inflation would exceed 6 percent and the economy contract by 8 percent. On Tuesday, MPs voted against Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plans by a crushing margin. BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that sterling’s rise after the vote suggested investors felt the risk of a no-deal Brexit had diminished, or that the departure process would be extended. May faces a vote of no confidence in her government moved by the opposition Labour Party on Wednesday that she is expected to win. “Although we think that Brexit uncertainty will keep the Monetary Policy Committee on hold for the time being, we doubt the Bank will miss out on the global tightening cycle altogether,” Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said. The central bank has raised interest rates twice since late 2017 and has said it plans to carry on increasing borrowing costs gradually.  Wednesday’s inflation figures could be a relief for British consumers who have been pressured by inflation since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 which triggered a slump in sterling of more than 10 percent against the dollar and euro. Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1 percent in November 2017. It has fallen since then and wages have grown at their fastest in a decade.  But businesses have reported a downturn in consumer spending in recent months, and surveys show households are worried about the outlook for 2019. Sterling and UK government bonds were little moved by Wednesday’s data which suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices, with factory input costs rising at the weakest rate since June 2016. The ONS also said house prices in November rose by an annual 2.8 percent nationwide compared with 2.7 percent in October. Prices in London alone fell 0.7 percent, the fifth month of decline — a run last seen during the financial crisis.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May could eventually get a Brexit deal through parliament if she negotiated a compromise with the opposition Labour Party, the second most powerful man in the party told Reuters on Wednesday. May’s Brexit deal suffered a crushing defeat in parliament on Tuesday, triggering political chaos that could lead to a disorderly exit from the EU, a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave or a compromise deal of some sort. The Labour Party’s finance policy chief, John McDonnell, said Labour would support May if she agreed to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU, a close relationship with its single market and greater protections for workers and consumers. “We will support a deal that brings the country back together, protects jobs and supports the economy,” McDonnell said. “We have had that open door policy all the way through. For two years she has not contacted, not approached us, not reached out.” With the ruling Conservative party divided, the opposition party holds great influence over the eventual outcome of Brexit. It is difficult to see how any Brexit plan can pass the House of Commons without the support of some of Labour’s 256 lawmakers. In an indication of the scale of the political crisis gripping Britain, May has indicated she is ready to reach out to opposition lawmakers in cross-party talks to find an amicable divorce deal to leave the EU.  But Labour like much of Britain is deeply split over Brexit, with many younger supporters in urban areas enthusiastic supporters of the EU, while many supporters in the party’s traditional heartlands back leaving the bloc. The party is formally committed to carrying out Brexit but says all options including a new referendum would be on the table if May fails to secure parliamentary support for a deal and cannot be removed from power. A group of 71 Labour lawmakers on Wednesday urged their leader Jeremy Corbyn to swing behind a second referendum on remaining part of the European Union. Corbyn, a veteran eurosceptic who in 1975 voted “No” to Britain’s membership of the then-European Community, is far more wary of a calling a second referendum than many of his centrist Labour colleagues. McDonnell, who describes Karl Marx as one of his main influences, said there was no majority in parliament for leaving the EU without a deal so the two most likely options are a compromise deal or a national election. “It is a bizarre situation but here I am, the shadow chancellor, going on the news to steady the markets because the Tories and the existing chancellor can’t do it,” he said. “The reason that I am trying to do that is because there are an overwhelming majority in parliament against a no deal. We will use every parliamentary mechanism to prevent a no deal.” McDonnell, 67, said he still prefers a snap election to win for Labour its own mandate for an EU exit based around a permanent customs union with the EU, rather than holding a new Brexit referendum. “Our view is that we have should have a general election while having a debate on Brexit amongst all the other issues as well, a much wider debate but you can also choose the team that will then do the negotiation,” he said.               McDonnell said it is increasingly likely that the government will have to ask for a extension to the formal process of leaving the EU, which is known as Article 50.   “The next fortnight will be critical,” he said. “The more time it takes up over the next couple of weeks, the more likely the government is to have to ask for an extension.” Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-mcdonnell-labour/labour-calls-on-may-to-try-a-brexit-compromise-to-get-deal-passed-idUKKCN1PA15V,2019-02-08,,Labour calls on May to try a Brexit compromise to get deal passed
2019-02-08,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria would support granting Britain more time for negotiations to avoid it crashing out of the European Union with no exit deal, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday, though he stressed the current deal could not be renegotiated. The UK parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday, prompting expressions of concern among EU leaders who say they are stepping up emergency planning for a possible ‘hard Brexit’. Kurz said the EU could help to further clarify aspects of the withdrawal deal but that Britain needed to take the initiative and state clearly what it wants.  “Regarding the future relations ... there is of course the possibility of further defining certain points if this helps to avoid a hard Brexit scenario”, Kurz told a news conference in Vienna.  “The main target is to avoid a hard Brexit. If we need more time to reach that, then we should consider that option,” Kurz said, echoing a proposal by German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier.

2019-02-08,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned on Wednesday that time is running out to reach a deal before Britain leaves the European Union and urged the British to make up their minds. “It is now up to the British to indicate what they want,” he told reporters in The Hague in reaction to Tuesday’s vote against Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal. “We have a little bit more time, but it is really going down to the wire.” “We still hope to reach an agreement before they leave at the end of March,” Rutte said.

What the Netherlands is doing is trying to ensure that the damage is minimised,” Rutte said.  He added that Britain’s firm demands about how it leaves the 28-member EU meant that “this is the only deal possible at the moment”. “If they were to move on those demands we could try to reach another agreement, but unless that happens this is the only option,” the Dutch premier said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is taking a larger-than-expected hit from the partial government shutdown, White House estimates showed on Tuesday, as contractors and even the Coast Guard go without pay and talks to end the impasse seemed stalled. The longest such shutdown in U.S. history dragged into its 25th day with neither President Donald Trump nor Democratic congressional leaders showing signs of bending on the topic that triggered it - funding for a wall Trump promised to build along the border with Mexico. Trump insists Congress shell out $5.7 billion for wall funding this year, as about 800,000 federal workers go unpaid during the partial shutdown. He has refused to support legislation providing money for a range of agencies to operate until he gets the wall funds.  With the shutdown dragging on, federal courts will run out of operating funds on Jan. 25 and face “serious disruptions” if the shutdown continues, according to a court statement. To try to take some of the sting out of the shutdown, Trump planned to sign on Wednesday the “Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,” which is legislation that would ensure that those federal workers furloughed will receive backpay once the shutdown is over. The Internal Revenue Service said it planned to bring more than 46,000 furloughed workers back to their jobs as the agency enters its peak season of processing tax returns and refunds. Trump invited a bipartisan group of lawmakers for lunch to discuss the standoff, but the White House said Democrats turned down the invitation. Nine House of Representatives Republicans, none of whom are involved in party leadership, attended. One attendee, John Katko, told CNN that Trump “wanted to continue to engage in negotiations.” He did not mention any new proposals Trump might pursue. House Democratic leaders said they did not tell members to boycott Trump’s lunch but had pressed those invited to consider whether the talks would be merely a photo-op for Trump. Separately, a bipartisan group of senators explored solutions. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican participant, told reporters in a Capitol hallway that the group had “momentum,” but gave no details. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democratic participant, said: “Anything can be part of the negotiations.” Lawmakers were supposed to be in their districts and states next week after Monday’s Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, but the House and Senate planned to cancel the recess if the shutdown persists. While the shutdown hit about one-quarter of federal operations, a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that nearly four in 10 U.S. adults said they were either affected by the impasse or know someone who is. Fifty-one percent of those polled blamed Trump for the shutdown.   Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she was working with the White House and Congress to pass legislation to fund the Coast Guard. While the Pentagon is not affected by the shutdown, the Coast Guard budget is part of Nielsen’s department. “Like the other branches of the U.S. military, active duty @USCG should be paid for their service and sacrifice to this nation,” Nielsen wrote on Twitter. The Trump administration had initially estimated the shutdown would cost the economy 0.1 percentage point in growth every two weeks that employees were without pay. But on Tuesday, there was an updated figure: 0.13 percentage point every week because of the impact of work left undone by 380,000 furloughed employees as well as work left aside by federal contractors, a White House official said. The economic risk prompted hawkish Federal Reserve officials to call for the central bank to pause interest rate hikes. The shutdown’s effects have begun to reverberate across the country. Longer lines have formed at some airports as more security screeners fail to show up for work. Speaking on CNBC, Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said the partial shutdown would cost the airline $25 million in lost revenue in January because fewer government contractors are traveling. Food and drug inspections have been curtailed but about 400 U.S. Food and Drug Administration staffers returned to work, Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. They focus on high-risk medical devices, drugs and food. Democrats, who took over the House this month, have rejected the border wall but back $1.3 billion in other border security measures this year. They have insisted the government be fully open before negotiations occur.

2019-02-08,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand man accused of murdering a British backpacker pleaded not guilty on Wednesday at a court in Auckland. The killing of 22-year-old Grace Millane shocked New Zealand, where serious crime is relatively rare and its cities and countryside are considered safe. The accused, whose name has been suppressed by the court, pleaded not guilty when he appeared in court for a second time, the New Zealand Herald reported.  Justice Simon Moore said the trial would begin on Nov. 4. It is expected to last for three weeks. Millane, who was travelling after finishing university, went missing in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, on Dec. 1.  Police found her body in a bush area just a few metres from a scenic drive in Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges. Police have declined to say whether Millane knew the 27-year-old man charged with her murder, but he had been seen with her before she went missing. A judge earlier refused the accused man’s request to suppress his name in media coverage. But he cannot be identified while his lawyer appeals that decision. Thousands of people held candlelight vigils following Millane’s death, in a national outpouring of grief that focused attention on violence against women. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, holding back tears, publicly apologised to Millane’s family, describing the country’s “sense of collective shame”. A memorial was held in her home town in the British county of Essex last week.

2019-02-08,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Theresa May to act swiftly to avert a ‘no-deal’ Brexit after British lawmakers rejected a withdrawal deal she had agreed with Brussels, adding that the deal would not be renegotiated. Britain’s lower house of parliament voted 432-202 against May’s deal, the worst parliamentary defeat for a government in recent British history. Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29, a date it has set in law. “Result of today’s vote in the Commons means prolongation of uncertainty, which is bad for all of us,” Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl tweeted. “Orderly Brexit remains possible but UK gov. must act quickly. Austria is prepared for all scenarios. Keep calm and carry on.” Austria held the rotating presidency of the European Union for the second half of 2018, during which the deal between London and Brussels was finalised. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said there would be no changing that accord, despite parliament’s rejection. “I regret the outcome of the Brexit vote in the British lower house in London,” he tweeted. “In any case there will be no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.” Reporting by Francois Murphy; Editing by Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-vote-austria/keep-calm-and-carry-on-austria-urges-after-uk-brexit-vote-idUKKCN1P92L5,2019-02-08,,"'Keep calm and carry on', Austria urges after UK Brexit vote"

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets climbed on Tuesday on hopes of more stimulus for China’s economy, while sterling rebounded from the day’s lows after British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal on withdrawing from the European Union. Sterling rallied more than a cent to stand above $1.28 after the vote. It GBP= was last trading at $1.2875, up 0.09 percent on the day. May’s crushing loss, the first British parliamentary defeat of a treaty since 1864, marks the collapse of her two-year strategy of forging an amicable divorce maintaining close ties to the EU after the March 29 exit. “After the big defeat, which was even larger than what the market had expected, we might getting closer to a no-Brexit scenario. The pound has retraced some of its losses after that vote, which was not unexpected. It may also simply be short-covering,” said Eric Stein, co-director of global income group at Eaton Vance in Boston. “There is still a massive amount of uncertainty for U.K. assets,” he said. U.S. Treasury yields edged higher in choppy trading on expectations for some kind of resolution on Brexit despite the  parliament’s rejection of May’s deal. Helping sentiment on Wall Street, U.S. President Trump talked up chances of a China trade deal and Chinese officials hinted at more stimulus for their slowing economy. Data on Monday showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply. “Any move to stabilise the global economy by the Chinese should be viewed positively by the U.S. as well,” said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. A 6.5 percent gain in shares of Netflix (NFLX.O) after it said it was raising rates for its U.S. subscribers also lifted stocks.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland will begin pushing through a “mega” package of legislation next month to deal with the fallout from a no-deal Brexit if there is still a prospect of Britain leaving the European Union without a divorce deal in March. Ireland’s cabinet on Tuesday began to build upon the no-deal contingency plans it issued last month by seeking to reassure business of the availability of additional transport capacity and patients of the security of medicine supplies. Its preparations will be underpinned by one single emergency Brexit bill incorporating 17 new laws that Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney will, if required, begin moving through parliament in the final week of February. “We don’t want to have to do this of course, nobody wants a no-deal Brexit and everybody will work towards avoiding that but we also have to ensure that Ireland has done everything it can to protect itself and its citizens,” Coveney told a news conference. To allow officials to make preparations, the government will prioritise just six new proposed laws in other areas in the first half of the year compared to the 49 pieces of legislation given priority during the same period last year. As part of Tuesday’s plans, the Transport Ministry said sufficient capacity will be available for direct sailings from Ireland to continental EU ports as a potential alternative for the large amount of goods transited through the UK. Should demand for further capacity arise, the shipping sector can respond quickly to meet it, it added.  However the department also said the scale of checks required in a no-deal Brexit would likely result in delays for goods moving through Irish ports, requiring measures to prevent congestion. The plans again did not touch on the central issue for Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit: How it can defend the single market without imposing physical infrastructure on its border with the British province of Northern Ireland. Transport Minister Shane Ross told the news conference he anticipated that there would be checks, but was interrupted by Coveney who said the best way to deal with the border issue was through the draft agreement struck by Brexit negotiators. “There are a number of areas where we haven’t published contingency plans, not least because people are voting this evening on how to deal with this issue,” Coveney said, speaking before British lawmakers resoundingly defeated the deal. “If Britain leaves without a deal, well then we obviously have to have difficult discussions with the European Commission and the UK in terms of how we protect the EU single market but we have deliberately not got into that detail because we have a way of dealing with this.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland/ireland-readies-mega-no-deal-brexit-legislation-package-idUKKCN1P92Q4,2019-02-08,,Ireland readies 'mega' no-deal Brexit legislation package

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays (BARC.L) bankers cheated the global financial system to gain an unfair edge over counterparties in a five-year plot to rig Euribor interest rates, a London prosecutor alleged on Tuesday. James Waddington, a lawyer for the UK Serious Fraud Office,  said the defendants were part of an elite, well-paid group that fixed the odds in a zero-sum game as he opened the prosecution’s case in a criminal trial expected to last at least two months. Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old Briton, Carlo Palombo, a 39-year-old Anglo-Italian, and 41-year-old Sisse Bohart, a Dane, deny wrongdoing. In London’s sixth rate-rigging trial, the three defendants are accused of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion (£118 trillion) of global financial contracts and loans, between 2005 and 2009. Waddington said that two other bankers, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef and Christian Bittar, a one-time Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) trader, already stood convicted. “The issue is whether one or more of these defendants ... was also a party to that conspiracy,” he told the 12-person jury at London’s Southwark Crown Court. Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over differing periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. Waddington alleged that the three defendants tilted the odds in their favour for profit, tweaked rates to gain a dishonest trading advantage and thought they would not be caught out. Some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions have paid around $9 billion to settle allegations that bankers submitted rates that flattered their own trading books. Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 following allegations of rate-rigging.  The British bank paid a $453 million penalty, sparking a backlash that forced out former chief executive Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Tuesday pushed back plans to end individual member states’ veto power on the introduction of a proposed tax on digital revenues by five years to 2025. In a non-binding proposal on wider tax reform, the commission recommended EU states end the practice that requires the backing of all 28 members to approve EU tax rules, contrary to other fields where decisions are made by a majority. The EU executive proposed that in some sectors, such as environment levies, EU states should agree quickly on whether to end the veto. However, for the digital tax, whose progress is blocked by some EU states, the decision to end the veto could be taken by the end of 2025, it said, pushing back the deadline from 2020, as indicated in an initial draft seen by Reuters.  In another crucial step back from initial plans, on Tuesday the EU Executive led by former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, decided to dismiss a legal procedure that could make tax reforms easier to agree, prompting lawmakers to dub the move as a “smokescreen”. The digital tax was proposed last March by the European Union’s executive arm. It would impose a 3 percent tax on online revenues of big digital companies, which are accused of paying too little by routing their EU profits to states with lower taxes, like Luxembourg and Ireland. However, the plan is deadlocked after EU finance ministers failed to agree on the tax in December, despite a last-minute Franco-German plan to salvage the proposal by narrowing its focus to companies like Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).  The veto power has blocked many key tax reforms, including on energy issues, where the EU still allows subsidies to diesel despite its environmental policy deterring its use, an EU official said. The fight against tax evasion has also been hampered by the vetoes, the commission said, citing the 25-year resistance by a group of small states, spearheaded by Luxembourg, to introduce common savings tax rules in the EU. The cost of the vetoes on tax reforms overall are in the hundreds of billions of euros a year, the EU document said. Ironically, the decision to end veto powers will have to be agreed unanimously by all EU states, as the commission refused on Tuesday to recommend the use of a long-neglected treaty article that would drop the unanimity rule when competition in the EU market is distorted, as in the case of digital taxation. Invoking this rule would allow decisions on tax reforms to be made by a majority of states. A commission official said article 116 was not recommended because it could be used only for targeted measures and could face legal challenges.  “The European Commission is putting up a smokescreen,” said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold who sits in the EU parliament’s committee on tax evasion. “The plan to overcome unanimity blockades with a unanimous decision is absurd and obviously ineffective,” he added. His fellow Green party member, Bas Eickhout, called the move an “empty gesture.”  The commission in its document estimated that failure to agree a reform of the corporate tax base, which was first proposed in 2011, has hampered EU growth, with losses worth 180 billion euros ($207 billion) in 2017 alone.  The lack of agreement on an EU financial transactions tax, first rolled out in 2011, has also cut the bloc’s tax revenues by 57 billion euros a year, the document said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2018, the weakest rate in five years and markedly slower than the previous year, preliminary data showed on Tuesday, in a sign that exporters in Europe’s largest economy are being hit by trade tensions. German companies are struggling with a cooling of the global economy and tariff disputes triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policies. The risk that Britain will leave the European Union without a deal in March is another uncertainty. The preliminary GDP estimate published by the Federal Statistics Office was in line with market expectations and compared with a growth rate of 2.2 percent in 2017. “The German economy thus grew the ninth year in a row, although growth has lost momentum,” the statistics office said, adding that growth was mainly driven by domestic demand with household consumption and state spending up on the year. Company investments in machinery and equipment were particularly strong, rising by 4.5 percent on the year. This helped to offset a slowdown in export growth which nearly halved to 2.4 percent, from 4.6 percent in 2017. As imports grew at a faster pace than exports, net trade had a slightly negative effect on overall growth, the office said. “Measured with the high expectations from one year ago, German economic growth was clearly disappointing,” KfW chief economist Joerg Zeuner said.  The head of the DIW economic institute, Marcel Fratzscher, pointed to strong domestic activity and the record state budget surplus of nearly 60 billion euros ($68.61 billion), which are both seen driving growth this year as well. “The strong labor market with rising employment and healthy wage hikes will help to maintain private consumption as the main pillar of economic growth,” Fratzscher said. “The trade disputes and the uncertainty surrounding a recession in the U.S. in the coming two years are probably the biggest risks for the economy.” German exports to China grew nearly 10 percent year-on-year from January to November, while exports to Britain fell by 3.6 percent in the same period, the office said. “The overall impact of Brexit on German economic growth is impossible to quantify,” an official of the statistics office told a news conference in Berlin. British lawmakers look set to reject the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU by Prime Minister Theresa May in a vote later on Tuesday, leaving unclear what form Brexit on March 29 will take or even if it will happen at all. The Statistics Office said the economy probably grew slightly in the fourth quarter of 2018, which would mean it escaped recession — defined as two or more consecutive quarters of negative growth. There was also a slightly positive statistical overhang at the end of 2018, suggesting the economy is carrying modest growth momentum into 2019, the office said. Policymakers and economists are racking their brains over how much the slowdown is caused by one-off factors or if there are more fundamental, structural problems at play. The statistics office pointed to domestic bottlenecks in new car registrations due to the introduction of stricter pollution standards, and a summer drought that caused disruptions to deliveries by river ferry of fuel and other raw materials. But the economy’s weak performance in the fourth quarter suggests that the contraction from July to September was more than just a blip and that Germany has reached peak growth. A string of unexpectedly weak data also from other European countries has pointed to a cooling in the euro zone economy as a whole, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to raise interest rates anytime soon.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday rejected a Republican call for temporarily reopening shuttered U.S. government agencies in order to encourage negotiations with Democrats on border security issues, as a partial government shutdown limped through its 24th day. About one-quarter of federal operations have been partially closed by a lack of funding since Dec. 22 after Trump demanded $5.7 billion this year from Congress for building a security wall on the southwest U.S. border. At a speech to an American Farm Bureau convention in New Orleans, Trump again urged Congress to grant him the money, saying drones, sensors and other technology cannot do what a wall can do to stop illegal border crossings. Farmers, a key bloc of Trump supporters, have been hit by the shutdown as federal loan and farm aid applications have stalled and key farming and crop data has been delayed. “If you want to help farmers, re-open the government,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Twitter posting. The number of airport security screeners not showing up for work continued to rise since the start of the disruption. Most Transportation Security Administration workers were required to report to work but they are not being paid due to a lack of funds. TSA spokesman Michael Bilello on Monday said TSA had a 7.6 percent unscheduled absence rate nationally, compared to a 3.2 percent rate a year ago. Many security officers “are understandably looking for other work to make ends meet, House of Representatives Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, said in a statement. Democrats, who control the House, have rejected Trump’s $5.7 billion (4.4 billion pounds) demand, as have Senate Democrats who are needed to pass most legislation in the chamber even though Republicans hold a majority. On Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged Trump to reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks. It is an idea that Democrats have been promoting for weeks. “That was a suggestion that Lindsey made but I did reject it,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House for Louisiana. “I want to get it solved, I don’t want to just delay it.” The partial shutdown is the longest in U.S. history and has seen Trump lurch from one idea to another in an attempt to secure money for building a wall that he argues is needed to secure the United States against illegal immigrants and drugs. Democrats say there are cheaper, more effective ways of enhancing border security than constructing a wall that could cost well beyond $25 billion. They have offered $1.3 billion in new border security funds this year to help pay for a range of high-tech and other tools at the border. When he ran for president, Trump said Mexico would pay for the wall but its government has refused. More recently, he has suggested that a renegotiated trade deal with Mexico could bring in the revenues needed to build the wall or that military funds and U.S. soldiers could be utilized. Last week, the administration was looking into Trump declaring a “national emergency” and redirecting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers funds to the wall but he has said would not immediately take such action. In December Trump said he would take responsibility for the shutdown but has since shifted the blame to Democrats. A growing proportion of Americans blame Trump for the closures, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British-Iranian aid worker who has been jailed in Tehran is going on hunger strike in protest at her treatment, her employer and her husband said.     Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit. She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organisation that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News. “Nazanin called me this morning to confirm from Evin prison that she has started this hunger strike this morning. It is initially a three-day hunger strike,” her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said. He said Nazanin was taking the action to press demands for access to specialist doctors to address health concerns and to be allowed such treatment as they prescribed.  A spokesman for Iran’s judiciary declined to comment. Britain has said it will not let Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case rest and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had summoned Iran’s ambassador on Monday to demand she had immediate access to the healthcare she needed.  “Her ongoing detention is TOTALLY unacceptable and her treatment at the hands of Iranian authorities is a fundamental breach of human rights,” Hunt wrote on Twitter. Iran said Britain’s intervention was an interference in its affairs and was unacceptable, state news agency IRNA reported. “Mrs. Zaghari, as an Iranian national, has received necessary medical care in prison and she will continue to enjoy her right to access the medical care while in jail,” IRNA quoted Iran’s ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, as saying. Iran has said that the trial and the verdict are in the hands of the judiciary. Monique Villa, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said it was “extremely shocking to see our colleague...going on hunger strike to protest at her inhumane treatment.” Britain has advised British-Iranian dual nationals against all but essential travel to Iran, tightening its existing travel advice and warning it has only limited powers to support them if detained.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Revisions to global rules for bank trading books will result in a halving of the extra capital needed from January 2022 to cover risks from market price swings, the Basel Committee said on Monday. It marks a completion of a welter of changes introduced by Basel since taxpayers had to bail out undercapitalised lenders during the financial crisis a decade ago. Banks had lobbied heavily to persuade the Swiss-based group of banking supervisors from the world’s main financial centres to water down the original plans for new capital requirements for trading books. Basel said in a statement that its oversight body, the Governors and Head of Supervision, chaired by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, endorsed the revisions on Monday. The new rules will mean an average increase of about 22 percent in total market risk capital requirements for banks compared with existing rules. A framework published in 2016 would have resulted in a 40 percent hike. The change in overall capital held by most banks will be relatively modest, however, though some of the giant trading banks will suffer a bigger hit. The bulk of a bank’s capital requirements cover the threat of souring loans, while market risk capital is far lower, at about 5 percent of the total. Basel revised its market risk capital rules after getting better data from banks so that regulators could ease the initially conservative approach they took in the draft rules. Basel Committee Secretary General William Coen said last April that regulators were being left with only a small sample of observations to make revisions.  For a graphic on Basel market risk, see - tmsnrt.rs/2Hcls3M A key change has been to ease a test which decides if a bank can use its own computer model to add up market risks for determining capital requirements, or must use a model set out by regulators. In house models tend to be more refined and result in lower capital requirements than the standard regulatory “approach”. The final rules, also known as the fundamental review of the trading book or FRTB, ease what was seen as a harsh pass or fail test by including a much broader “amber zone” than originally proposed, giving more wriggle room for banks to correct deficiencies. Regulators want banks to better capture risks from assets like stocks, bonds and derivatives held on their trading books, such as illiquidity, or assets becoming harder to offload to replenish safety buffers in turbulent markets.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing likely defeat in parliament on Tuesday when she asks members of Parliament (MPs) to approve her Brexit deal - a decision that would trigger huge uncertainty about the future of Britain’s exit from the European Union.  May has warned that rejecting her deal opens up the possibility of Brexit being stopped, or that Britain leaves disruptively without a deal. She has promised to respond quickly to any defeat. So what could happen next if she loses? May must submit a new plan for Britain’s next steps by the end of Jan. 21. It is not clear what May’s ‘Plan B’ is, but some local media have reported she would ask parliament to vote again on the deal, perhaps after seeking another set of reassurances from the EU. Some MPs have floated the idea that parliament could, in a temporary break from convention in Britain, take control of the process away from the government and hand it to a committee of senior MPs from across the political spectrum. It is not clear that this plan is technically possible, or whether it has enough support to succeed. The government said any attempt to prevent it from meeting its legal obligation to deliver an orderly EU exit would be extremely concerning. May could resign as leader of the Conservative Party, triggering an internal contest to replace her without a general election.  May defeated an attempt to oust her as leader of the Conservative Party in December, winning a confidence vote by 200 votes to 117. The result means her position as leader of the party cannot be challenged for 12 months.   The opposition Labour Party has said it will call a vote of no confidence in the government if May’s deal is rejected, but has not specified exactly when.   If a majority of MPs vote against May’s government, Labour would have 14 days to prove, by a vote, that it could command a majority and form its own government. That would allow Labour to take control of the country without an election.. If May’s government loses a confidence vote and Labour is unable to form a new government, an election is called. May could also call a general election herself if two-thirds of MPs in parliament agree to it. May has said that a general election is not in the national interest. LONGER-TERM OPTIONS:   The route to a second referendum on Brexit - or a People’s Vote - is unclear. But, unless the plan to give control of the process to parliament is successful, it would require the backing of the government of the day. A new referendum can be called only if it is approved by parliament. With May dead-set against a second referendum, and the opposition Labour Party not committed to one (but not ruling one out), a second referendum would need either a change in prime minister, a change in government, or an abrupt change in policy.  An increasingly vocal contingent of MPs from across the political spectrum supports a fresh vote to break the impasse in parliament. But, so far they have not been able to prove there is a majority in parliament for this view.    Even if parliament did agree in principle to a second referendum, Britain would then have to ask for an extension to its timetable for leaving the EU. The government could seek to extend the negotiating period with the EU to give it time to try to reach a better deal, hold a general election, or conduct a second referendum. The government could also withdraw its notice of intention to leave the EU, which the European Court of Justice has ruled it can do without consent of other EU countries. May has said she does not want to delay Britain’s exit from the EU, and will not revoke the notice of intention to leave.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Former champion Rafa Nadal showed no signs of discomfort from his thigh strain as he sailed through to the second round of the Australian Open with a 6-4 6-3 7-5 win over local hope James Duckworth on Monday. The second-seeded Spaniard had pulled out of the Brisbane warmup with a thigh strain to raise doubts about his campaign but he allayed those fears on Rod Laver Arena against an error-prone opponent. “It’s normal that beginnings are tough, but every day helps and every day makes me feel better, makes me feel more confident,” Nadal, whose 2018 season ended early with ankle surgery and an abdominal injury, told reporters. “So that’s an important victory because (it) is the first victory since a while and at the same time... gives me the chance to be on court again. And that’s what I need.” The first meeting between the 17-times Grand Slam champion, a winner at Melbourne Park in 2009, and Australian wildcard Duckworth, who is ranked 238 in the world, always had the potential to be an uneven contest. But the 26-year-old Duckworth, who reached a career-high ranking of 82 in April, 2015, did not help his cause by looking to attack Nadal from the start and committing 40 unforced errors in the process, compared to just 11 from his opponent. Nadal, who is bidding to become the first man in the Open Era, and only the third man ever, to win each of the four Grand Slams twice, ran his opponent down with his superior court coverage and ability to hit winners under pressure. “I played against a super-aggressive player. Today he went on court with the determination to not play tennis the way I understand tennis,” Nadal told reporters.  “(It) is not a negative point. Not at all. Believe me. He went on court probably doing a thing that works well for him, and he gives himself some chances. And he played smart and he played well.” Sporting a yellow sleeveless t-shirt and white shorts, Nadal hit his gear early by breaking Duckworth’s serve in the first game which was enough for him to take out the first set. After an early trade of breaks in the second, Duckworth served his sixth double fault to go down a break and then lost the second set with his eighth. Two brilliant winners in the sixth game, which brought about an animated celebration from the Spaniard, gave him a break and a 4-2 lead but Duckworth got the break back in the ninth game. The Spaniard, who will next meet the winner of Australian Matthew Ebden’s contest with Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany, broke Duckworth for the sixth time and brought an end to the match with a brilliant backhand pass. In his pre-match news conference Nadal said he has brought a remodelled serve to Melbourne aimed at generating more pace. After losing two service games in the match, Nadal was pleased with it. “My serve worked well. I don’t know my percentage, but was a lot of good positions after the first serve,” he said. “I felt solid with the second.” Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly; editing by Nick Mulvenney/Amlan Chakraborty",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-ausopen-nadal/seamless-nadal-drubs-australian-duckworth-in-melbourne-opener-idUKKCN1P807Y,2019-02-08,,Seamless Nadal drubs Australian Duckworth in Melbourne opener

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House’s national security team last fall asked the Pentagon to provide it with options for striking Iran after a group of militants aligned with Tehran fired mortars into an area in Baghdad that is home to the U.S. Embassy, a source  familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

Two days later, unidentified militants fired three rockets that hit close to the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Basra but caused no serious damage.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s antitrust watchdog plans to order Facebook (FB.O) to stop gathering some user data, a newspaper reported on Sunday. The Federal Cartel Office, which has been investigating Facebook since 2015, has already found that the social media giant abused its market dominance to gather data on people without their knowledge or consent. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said the watchdog will present the U.S. company with its ruling on what action it needs to take in the next few weeks.  A Facebook spokeswoman said the company disputes the watchdog’s findings and will continue to defend this position. The investigation is being closely watched amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the use of social media by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.  The German watchdog objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services as well as games and websites - and its tracking of people who are not members. The paper said it is still not clear how strictly Facebook will have to comply with the German order, noting that the watchdog looks likely to set a deadline for compliance rather than insisting on immediate action.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French media and reporters’ organisations on Sunday denounced attacks on journalists by “yellow vest” anti-government protesters and called for better protection after a series of incidents this weekend.  Paris police fired water cannon and tear gas to push back demonstrators from around the Arc de Triomphe monument on Saturday, in the ninth straight weekend of protests against French President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms. Journalists covering the protests are increasingly becoming a target for the demonstrators. In the western city of Rouen, LCI television reporters were attacked by a group of protesters. One of the security agents working with the TV crew was beaten while he was on the ground and had his nose broken, with footage of the incident widely shared on social media.  In Paris, an LCI reporter was pushed to the ground as demonstrators tried to take away her camera, the station said, adding that it will take legal action against the attackers. Several other stations, including BFM TV and franceinfo, on Sunday showed images of reporters being hassled or pushed around during Saturday’s “yellow vest” marches.  Reporters without Borders Secretary-General Christophe Deloire called on authorities to take action. “This is anti-democratic blackmail from people who consider they can beat up journalists if they disagree with the way events are covered,” he said on France Info radio.  Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on his Twitter feed that anyone attacking reporters will be brought to justice.  “In our democracy, the press is free ... attacking journalists is attacking the right to inform,” he said.  France has been rocked by yellow vest protests against Macron’s reforms since the middle of November in a movement that has no designated leaders and is not linked to political parties or unions. Started as a protest against high fuel prices, the movement has morphed into a fight for social justice and more direct democracy. Several demonstrations have degenerated into violent clashes with police.  Over the coming week, Macron will launch three months of national debate to air yellow-vest grievances in the hope of appeasing the movement, which has undermined his authority and upended his reform drive. reut.rs/2SQ3KUX Writing by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Keith Weir",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-protests-press/french-media-denounce-violent-yellow-vest-attacks-on-press-idUKKCN1P70J5,2019-02-08,,French media denounce violent 'yellow vest' attacks on press
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives committee will look into a newspaper report that the FBI investigated whether President Donald Trump has been working on behalf of Russia, against U.S. interests, the panel’s Democratic chairman said on Saturday. The New York Times reported that the probe began in the days after Trump fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in May 2017 and said the agency’s counterintelligence investigators had to consider whether Trump’s actions constituted a possible threat to national security. Trump rejected the Times piece in a late Saturday night interview on Fox News as “the most insulting article I’ve ever had written” and lashed out at Comey and the FBI in half a dozen tweets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said his panel “will take steps to better understand both the president’s actions and the FBI’s response to that behaviour” in coming weeks. He also said lawmakers would seek to protect investigators from the president’s “increasingly unhinged attacks.” “There is no reason to doubt the seriousness or professionalism of the FBI, as the president did in reaction to this story,” Nadler, a New York Democrat, said in a statement. “We have learned from this reporting that, even in the earliest days of the Trump administration, the president’s behaviour was so erratic and so concerning that the FBI felt compelled to do the unprecedented - open a counterintelligence investigation into a sitting president,” Nadler said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said he could not comment on the specifics of the report, but said his committee would press ahead with its probe of Trump’s contacts with Russia. “Counterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the president himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning,” said Schiff, a California Democrat. Schiff said meetings, contacts and communications between Trump associates and Russians, as well as “the web of lies about those interactions, and the president’s own statements and actions,” have heightened the need to follow the evidence where it leads. Trump took notes from his interpreter made during a 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg and took other steps to conceal details of their conversations, a report in the Washington Post said on Saturday.  Trump denied on Fox News that he was keeping anything under wraps on his face-to-face meetings with Putin. The New York Times said FBI officials became suspicious of Trump’s ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, but held off on opening an investigation until Trump tied his dismissal of Comey to a probe into allegations of election meddling by Russia. The FBI also considered whether the Republican president’s firing of Comey amounted to obstruction of justice. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller took over the investigation into Trump days after the FBI opened it, as he examined allegations of Russian election interference, the Times reported. Russia denies it sought to influence the election. Trump lashed out at the Times and former FBI leaders, and criticized the agency’s earlier probe of Democrat Hillary Clinton, his rival in the 2016 election. “Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze!,” Trump tweeted. Comey took to Twitter later on Saturday, offering a quote he attributed to former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.” Reporting by David Morgan and Timothy Gardner; editing by Jonathan Oatis and G Crosse",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia/u-s-house-democrats-eye-reported-fbi-probe-of-trump-idUKKCN1P60Q9,2019-02-08,,U.S. House Democrats eye reported FBI probe of Trump
2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s plans for tax cuts targeting smaller companies will help to support employment and economic stability, and will expand the country’s tax base over the long term, Premier Li Keqiang was quoted as saying on Saturday. “Implementing tax cuts for small and micro enterprises is mainly to support employment,” Li said in comments posted on the Chinese government’s website. Developing and strengthening small companies is linked to economic stability and stable employment, he said. “Looking at the long term, this will continue to expand the tax base, conserve tax resources and ultimately achieve wins for mass employment, corporate profits and fiscal revenues,” he was quoted as saying, referring to the corporate tax cuts. Li’s comments come amid growing official concern over China’s slowing economic growth and its impact on the labour market.     Chinese authorities plan to set a lower economic growth target of 6 to 6.5 percent in 2019, compared with “around” 6.5 percent in 2018, sources told Reuters, as weakening domestic demand and a damaging trade war with the United States drag on  business activity and consumer confidence. Analysts expect that China’s economy grew around 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace since 1990, and it is expected to cool further in coming months before a slew of support measures start to kick in. “The bottom line for the policymakers is social stability, which is crucially tied to the unemployment rate and job creation,” analysts at BoAML said in a recent note. “With U.S.-China trade risks still looming large, we believe policymakers would not hesitate to take pre-emptive measures to stabilise expectations on job stability.” More growth boosting steps are expected this year as policymakers seek to avert the risk of a sharper slowdown. China’s State Council, or cabinet, said on Jan. 9 that it would further reduce taxes for smaller companies. On Friday, Finance Minister Liu Kun said authorities would step up tax and fee cuts to lower corporate burdens.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) has broadened its investigation into ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn to include dealings that took place in the United States, India and Latin America, three people with knowledge of the inquiry said. In one aspect of their internal probe, company investigators are looking into decisions made in the United States by Jose Munoz who led Nissan’s North American operations from 2014 to 2018, the people said. Munoz was recently placed on a leave of absence due to the probe, they added. Nissan said this month that Munoz, its chief performance officer and widely seen within the industry as close to Ghosn, was on leave “to allow him to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.” Munoz is not cooperating with investigators, two of the people with knowledge of the probe said, both describing his actions as “stonewalling”. One of the sources described Munoz, who currently heads Nissan’s China operations, as a “person of interest” in the probe, adding that it was not clear whether he would be accused of any wrongdoing. Munoz, 53, did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The people with knowledge of the probe spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. A lawyer for Ghosn, Motonari Otsuru, said in an emailed comment: “I am unaware of this.”  Some of the questions put to Munoz relate to dealer franchise rights, one of the sources said. Other questions relate to contracts with parts suppliers and service providers that Munoz approved when he was at the helm of Nissan’s U.S. operations, another source said. The sources said the findings made as part of the probe into Ghosn’s affairs in the U.S. market are being shared with prosecutors. Tokyo prosecutors declined to comment. Nissan has said its internal investigation had uncovered “substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct” by Ghosn and that its scope is expanding.  Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan’s alliance with France’s Renault SA (RENA.PA), has been charged with under-reporting his income. On Friday, he was also charged with aggravated breach of trust, accused of shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan.  In his first public appearance since his Nov. 19 arrest, Ghosn declared his innocence in court on Tuesday, saying he had never received compensation that was not disclosed and that Nissan had not suffered any losses due to a temporary transfer of a personal foreign exchange contract.  The transfer had been a temporary measure to prevent him from having to resign and use his retirement funds as collateral, Ghosn said. Sources familiar with the matter have also said Nissan investigators are examining other dealer franchise decisions in several countries where Ghosn played a part in the decision-making to see if there had been any misconduct.  In particular, the automaker’s investigators are looking into Ghosn’s role in what Nissan insiders have described to Reuters as a surprise decision in 2008 to pick a company called Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd (HAI) as Nissan’s partner for marketing, sales, after-sales service and dealer development in India. A different firm, TVS, had been lined up for the role after much research by Nissan management in India when Ghosn personally intervened at the last minute to push for HAI, four Nissan insiders said. They add that in 2012, HAI became the Nissan’s exclusive national sales firm in India, despite being relatively inexperienced in distributing vehicles to dealers. Reuters was unable to find a representative for HAI, which according to India’s Registrar of Companies was dissolved as of Sept. 11, 2018. TVS did not respond to a request for comment. The probe is also looking at what appear to be outsized payments for Ghosn’s bodyguard services in Brazil, one of the sources said.  Ghosn’s lawyer Otsuru did not respond to requests for comment on the expansion of Nissan’s probe into dealings in India and Brazil. A U.S. representative for Ghosn declined to comment. One source also said Nissan is conducting audits of some distribution partners in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia’s Al-Dahana which owns half of a joint venture called Nissan Gulf with the other half held by a wholly owned unit of Nissan Motor.  Al-Dahana, a marketing and dealer development firm, is majority owned by Khaled Al-Juffali, vice chairman of one of Saudi Arabia’s largest conglomerates. Reuters has reported that Al-Juffali is the person prosecutors believe arranged a letter of credit for Ghosn over his foreign exchange contract after which a company that Al-Juffali owned received four payments totaling $14.7 million.       Both Ghosn and the Khaled Juffali Company have asserted that the payments were for legitimate business purposes. Asked about the audit, a representative for the Khaled Juffali Company said the firm stood by its previous statement. Another Nissan executive, Arun Bajaj, senior vice president for human resources and who heads talent development for Nissan’s alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), has also been put on a leave of absence “to assist the company by concentrating on special tasks arising from recent events.” Bajaj is being questioned and is cooperating with both Nissan’s internal investigators as well as prosecutors, the sources said, adding that they expect him to return to work soon. It was not immediately clear what the questions were about. Bajaj did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Ghosn is unlikely to be granted bail and is expected to remain in detention throughout his trial as is often the case under Japan’s criminal system, Otsuru told reporters this week. Ghosn’s trial may not begin for another six months, he added.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - One of Nissan Motor Co’s (7201.T) top executives has resigned, further rattling the Japanese automaker’s management team as it broadens an investigation into ousted Chairman Carlos Ghosn’s alleged financial misconduct.  Jose Munoz, widely considered as a close ally to Ghosn and a possible successor to lead the automaking partnership between Nissan and France’s Renault SA, had been a “person of interest” in Nissan’s widening internal investigation. The 53-year-old, who was Nissan’s chief performance officer and head of its China operations, made the announcement in a LinkedIn post on Friday. In a statement, Nissan said that Munoz had “elected to resign” from the company, effective immediately. It declined to offer details.  He becomes the latest executive casualty since Nissan in November removed Ghosn as chairman and fired representative director Greg Kelly. The resignation deals another blow to the Japanese automaker which is grappling with the scandal at a time when it is struggling to shore up profitability in the United States and expand aggressively in China. Reuters had reported earlier on Friday that the Japanese automaker was looking into decisions made in the United States by Munoz who led Nissan’s North American operations from 2016 to 2018. “Unfortunately, Nissan is currently involved in matters that have and will continue to divert its focus,” Munoz said in his post. “As I have repeatedly and recently made clear to the company, I look forward to continuing to assist Nissan in its investigations.” People with knowledge of the issue have said that Munoz, who had been placed on a leave of absence earlier in the month, had not been co-operating with the internal investigation. Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan’s alliance with Renault, remains in custody in a Tokyo detention center since his initial arrest in late November. Ghosn has been indicted on two counts of under-reporting his income, and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan.         The scandal has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and has escalated tensions between Nissan and Renault, where Ghosn remains CEO and chairman.  Munoz joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe and led its significant expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States and posted record sales.  Earlier this year, Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years.  Since then, the world’s largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.

As a result, Odey, who runs hedge fund Odey Asset Management, said he is now positioning for the pound to strengthen after his flagship fund previously reaped the benefit of betting against UK assets amid wider market fears about the impact of Brexit. The donors’ pessimism comes amid deadlock in Britain’s parliament over the exit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has struck with the EU, which has cast significant uncertainty over how, or even if, Brexit will happen. Hargreaves, who amassed his fortune from co-founding fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown (HRGV.L), said the political establishment were determined to scuttle Brexit and this would lead to a generation of distrust of Britain’s political classes. The government, he said, is likely to first ask for an extension to the formal exit process from the EU and then call for a second referendum. “I have totally given up. I am totally in despair, I don’t think Brexit will happen at all,” said Hargreaves, 72, who is one of Britain’s wealthiest men and donated 3.2 million pounds ($4 million) to the leave campaign.     “They (pro-Europeans) are banking on the fact that people are so fed up with it that they will just say ‘sod it we will stay’. I do see that attitude. The problem is when something doesn’t happen for so long you feel less angry about it.” Turning Brexit upside down would mark one of the most extraordinary reversals in modern British history and the hurdles to another referendum remain high. Both major political parties are committed to leaving the EU in accordance with the 2016 referendum.  But Odey, who donated more than 870,000 pounds to pro-leave groups, said while he did not believe a second referendum would take place, he did not think Brexit would happen either. “My view is that it ain’t going to happen,” Odey said. “I just can’t see how it happens with that configuration of parliament.” Britain’s parliament is viewed as largely pro-European because about three-quarters of members of parliament voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum.   Odey said he had changed his position on sterling over the last month and that the pound “looks like it could be quite strong” and rise to $1.32 or $1.35 against the dollar, from around $1.27 currently. Both Odey and Hargreaves said one reason for their pessimism was a lack of direction from Brexiteers.  “The unfortunate thing is that almost nobody is leading the Brexit charge, so it’s leaderless, which is the problem,” Odey said.  He said he would be willing to donate to the leave cause in the event of another referendum, while Hargreaves said he was undecided.  Other prominent Brexit supporters who bankrolled the campaign were more optimistic about the project’s fate. Paul Marshall, chairman of the hedge fund firm Marshall Wace, which runs $39 billion in assets, told Reuters that abandoning Brexit would be wrong and highly damaging. “Despite the antics in parliament, the prospect of the 2016 referendum being overturned is in my view very small,” said Marshall, who gave 100,000 pounds to the leave campaign prior to the vote. Marshall predicted the most likely outcome is that Britain will leave the EU without a deal in March, or the government will secure a revised Brexit deal, solving the thorny issue of the Northern Irish backstop, which may involve Brexit being briefly delayed.   Another vocal Brexiteer Tim Martin, the chairman of British pub chain JD Wetherspoon, who donated 212,000 pounds to the 2016 campaign, said he was refusing to contemplate a second vote.  He is touring his pubs giving talks to customers about the merits of leaving the EU without a deal and aims to have visited 100 of his sites by the end of January. A second referendum would be “a nightmare,” Martin said. “It’s like saying: ‘Do you think we should have another world war?’ or ‘What do you think about being struck by lightning?’” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s parliament is debating whether to support Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, a decision which will define Britain’s departure from the European Union and set the course for the country’s economy. The odds look stacked against May winning parliamentary approval for her deal, which has come under fire from all sides, including eurosceptics, supporters of the EU and the Northern Irish party propping up her minority Conservative government. Below is a running tally of the number of members of parliament who have indicated during the first of five days of debate whether they will support the Brexit deal on Jan. 15.  MPs are entitled to change their mind before the vote, and some who speak are yet to make a final decision on the deal. There are a total of 650 MPs in parliament. Of those, around 100 are government ministers and Conservative Party enforcers, or whips, who are required to support the deal and so are not included in the tally.  May’s Conservative Party has 317 MPs. It governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10 MPs of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party. MPs who have indicated they will support the deal: 29 MPs who have indicated they will oppose the deal: 69 (including 16 of May’s Conservative MPs) Reporting by William James, Elizabeth Piper and Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-vote-lawmakers/factbox-britains-brexit-vote-how-many-mps-are-backing-pm-may-idUKKCN1P51P6,2019-02-08,,Factbox: Britain's Brexit vote - How many MPs are backing PM May?
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Debenhams (DEB.L), the British department store chain that is fighting for survival, plunged as much as 22 percent on Friday as its new interim chairman began the task of trying to find a consensus among investors on the way forward. On Thursday, two major Debenhams shareholders - Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct (SPD.L) and Middle Eastern investor Landmark Group - forced Chief Executive Sergio Bucher off the board and Chairman Ian Cheshire out of the company following a drop in Christmas sales. Terry Duddy, Debenhams’ senior independent director, was appointed interim chairman, and said he would meet with shareholders to understand their concerns. Duddy, a former CEO of Home Retail Group, wasted no time, meeting Ashley informally in London on Thursday evening, a spokesman for Debenhams said. Sports Direct is Debenhams’ biggest investor with a 29.7 percent stake but its plan for the department store chain is unclear. It did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. In September, Sports Direct ruled out a takeover bid, shortly after an outgoing director said the board had discussed combining Debenhams with the House of Fraser chain that Sports Direct bought out of administration in August for 90 million pounds ($115 million). Debenhams has a program to close 50 of its underperforming UK stores over three to five years. However, Ashley wants Debenhams to move faster. He told Sky News last month he believed Debenhams should carry out a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) restructuring to close stores. CVAs require the approval of landlords and creditors. Also in December, Debenhams declined the offer of a 40 million pound interest-free loan from Ashley, saying conditions attached to it could affect the interests of other stakeholders. Debenhams has net debt of 286 million pounds and debt facilities of 520 million pounds. Its equity market value as of Thursday’s close was just 59.3 million pounds. A key focus for Duddy will be refinancing Debenhams’ existing banking facilities. The firm needs to pass a banking covenant test next month. “We believe all options are being considered - maybe different types of lenders and/or an equity rights issue,” said analysts at Jefferies. The highly unusual situation of Bucher remaining as CEO but not being on the company board will also be problematic for Debenhams. “It is not tenable for the CEO not to be on the board. The danger now is that Mike (Ashley) is allowed, in all the confusion, to buy the company on the cheap,” said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is laying the groundwork for declaring a national emergency that would let President Donald Trump build sections of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, possibly using funds from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing two unnamed sources. NBC News, in a similar report, said the plan called for building 315 miles (500 km) of border barrier by declaring an emergency and tapping a $13.9 billion (10.9 billion pounds) Army Corps fund that was set aside for U.S. disaster relief and prevention projects. Such a strategy, which Reuters could not immediately confirm independently, would escalate a wall-funding standoff between Trump and Democrats in Congress from a policy dispute to a test of presidential power and likely trigger a legal challenge. Pushing the impasse into the courts could give Trump an escape path from the political box he has put himself in by demanding that any legislation to end a 20-day-old partial government shutdown include $5.7 billion in funding for his wall, a demand that congressional Democrats oppose.  The federal government partially shut down on Dec. 22 when Trump and lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to fund several agencies whose funding had expired for reasons unrelated to Trump’s wall.  NBC News, citing unnamed U.S. officials, said Trump had been briefed on the plan involving the Army Corps while flying to the U.S. southern border on Thursday. A White House official denied Trump had been briefed on the plan. The Pentagon declined to comment on the news reports. “The NBC story is totally false, fake news, but doesn’t mean the president won’t talk to them at some point,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. The Post, citing a congressional aide, said the administration was specifically looking at using some of the $13.9 billion included in a disaster spending bill passed by Congress last year that has been allocated but not yet spent.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of furloughed federal employees chanting “We want our pay!” marched on the White House on Thursday, the 20th day of a partial government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for border wall funding.  “Stop the shutdown!” protesters shouted in the bitter cold at the union-organised demonstration that started at the AFL-CIO headquarters and ended in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where they hoisted signs reading “Trump: End the Shutdown” and “Not a strike - we want to work.”  Some 800,000 federal government employees have been ordered to stay home or work without pay during the shutdown brought on by a standoff between Trump and Democrats in Congress over Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) to build a wall on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, in a 2016 presidential campaign promise, repeatedly vowed that Mexico would pay for the wall. But he has said he will not sign any bill to reopen the government that does not provide wall funding. Elaine Suriano, 62, a furloughed scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency, said she would have to dip into her retirement savings if the shutdown continued and robbed her of yet another paycheck. “It’s just clear that this administration doesn’t understand normal people and real life or they wouldn’t do this,” Suriano said. In its third week, the shutdown of about a quarter of the federal government is the second longest since the mid-1970s. Trump has said it could continue for months or even years. Many furloughed federal workers have turned to online fundraising outlets such as GoFundMe.com to help cover expenses from food to utility bills. Mathew Crichton, 32, a furloughed Peace Corps employee, said uncertainty over how long the shutdown will last made it impossible to budget for food, lodging and other needs. “It could go on another day, and it could go on more weeks. It could go on for months,” Crichton said. “It’s really a shame that I’m ready to go to work. I’m able to go to work and I can’t.” Protesters, many wearing neon green vests reading, “I am a worker. I demand a voice,” on Thursday demanded the government be reopened, separate from any debate over wall funding. Smaller protests across the country – from Palm Beach, Florida, to New York City - had similar demands. In Ogden, Utah, dozens of out-of-work federal employees gathered to urge an end to the shutdown, some holding signs reading “I am TSA. I am furloughed. I am not a pawn. I’m a voter” and “800,000 unemployed. Hurts our family and our economy.”  Trump was not at the White House when the protesters arrived, having travelled to the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas. The president has said he has the right to declare a national emergency if no deal with Congress can be reached on funding the border wall project.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday cancelled a planned visit later this month to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, signalling he was prepared for the political showdown over the partial federal government shutdown to stretch into late January.    It was unclear whether the shutdown, now in its 20th day, would end before the start of the global economic meeting, which is scheduled for Jan. 22 to 25. Trump and congressional Democrats are in a battle over funding for the government and Trump’s long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum,” Trump wrote on Twitter. The president had told reporters at the White House earlier on Thursday that he intended to speak at the forum but would not attend if the shutdown continued.   The cancellation quashes any opportunity for Trump to meet with other world leaders about economic issues, including trade.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters after a briefing with lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he was talking with the White House about whether he would still make the trip to Switzerland. “My guess is if we do continue it, it will be in a scaled-back version,” Mnuchin said. The Trump administration is engaged in trade talks with the European Union and China, among others.    China and the United States have agreed to a 90-day pause in implementing tariffs in order to hammer out a trade deal.  China’s vice president, Wang Qishan, was expected to attend the Swiss meeting, but it was unclear whether any talks had been planned between him and Trump.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of mortgage “prisoners” in Britain could be freed after the financial regulator said on Thursday it would ease affordability checks required by home loan providers when remortgaging to a cheaper deal.  The “prisoners” took out loans before tougher rules introduced since the financial crisis left them unable to meet stricter mortgage affordability tests, even if they have an unblemished record of repayments. Interest rates in Britain have begun to rise, making it more pressing to help those customers locked into variable-rate mortgages with a high rate of interest unable to shop around for cheaper deals.   They include 10,000 customers at authorised lenders, 20,000 with firms that are no longer actively offering loans, and 120,000 with loans from firms not regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Banks at UK Finance, a trade body, came to a voluntary arrangement earlier this year to allow some customers of authorised lenders to remortgage if they met basic conditions. But lenders have said that changes were needed to help people who want to move home loans from an unregulated firm to avoid being in breach of current regulations. FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said the watchdog will publish a consultation paper in the spring. “To help these customers, we will consult on changes to our responsible lending rules, with the aim to deliver a more proportionate affordability assessment,” Bailey said in a letter to parliament’s Treasury Select Committee that was published on Thursday. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance said they would continue to work with their members and the FCA to help customers who want a like-for-like mortgage to switch lenders more easily. Bailey said the new test would be whether the new mortgage costs are more affordable than the current costs, and would focus on people who want a cheaper deal and are not increasing the amount borrowed. “There also needs to be a willingness from industry to offer re-mortgaging opportunities to these customers once the regulatory barriers are removed,” he added. “Over the coming months, we will work with firms and trade bodies on the practicalities of re-mortgage options.” Martin Lewis of consumer campaigner MoneySavingExpert.com welcomed the “sensible” move.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will cut 10 percent of its workforce, mostly in its home market, as Britain’s biggest carmaker faces lower Chinese demand and a slump in European diesel sales. JLR, based in central England, will cut some 4,500 out of 42,500 jobs, targeting managerial roles rather than production-line workers as it battles to return to profitability.  Owned by India’s Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), JLR also said it will build electric drive units at its Wolverhampton engine plant and create a new battery assembly centre in Hams Hall, near Birmingham, as it develops a greener vehicle range.  JLR builds a higher proportion of its cars in Britain than any other major or medium-sized carmaker and has spent millions preparing for Brexit, in case of tariffs or customs checks. But it lost 354 million pounds between April and September 2018 and had already cut around 1,000 roles in Britain, shut its Solihull plant for two weeks and announced a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich site. JLR’s chief executive Ralf Speth said on Thursday he needed to go further as part of the company’s turnaround plan.  “We are taking decisive action to help deliver long-term growth, in the face of multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions as well as technology challenges facing the automotive industry,” Speth said.  JLR, which became Britain’s biggest carmaker in 2016, had been on course to build around 1 million vehicles by the turn of the decade, reported a 4.6 percent drop in full-year sales to just under 600,000 vehicles. It has hired staff in China and Slovakia in recent years as it opens new plants and last year unveiled plans to cut costs and improve cash flows by 2.5 billion pounds. Speth warned in September that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of car jobs and posed a production threat.  Ford (F.N) also said on Thursday it will cut thousands of jobs in Europe, exit unprofitable markets and discontinue loss-making vehicle lines as part of a turnaround effort aimed at improving profit margins in the region. Several companies have warned of a slowdown in China and the effect of trade wars just as automakers pump billions into greener technologies to meet stricter emissions rules and  customers shun combustion engines in the face of higher levies.  Demand in China, which had once been one of its strongest countries but has since been hit by a slowdown, fell by 21.6 percent, the biggest drop of any of its markets.  “The economic slowdown in China along with ongoing trade tensions is continuing to influence consumer confidence,” said JLR Chief Commercial Officer Felix Brautigam.  Diesel accounts for 90 percent of the firm’s British sales and 45 percent of global demand, the company said last year, as demand in the segment tumbles following new levies in the wake of the 2015 Volkswagen emissions cheating scandal.   The firm’s chief financial officer said in October that the firm’s Changshu plant in China “has basically been closed for most of October in order to allow the inventory of both our vehicles and dealer inventory to start to reduce.”  Like fellow automakers, the company could see its three British car factories grind to a halt in fewer than 80 days if MPs next week reject a deal by Prime Minister Theresa May, leading to tariffs and customs checks after a no-deal outcome. “Given the difficulties that they’re going through... to add further costs and further disruption from a no-deal Brexit, it’s clear why they’ve been so clear that this would be against their interests,” said business minister Greg Clark. BMW-owned car brand Rolls-Royce is also taking steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit but called on the government to prevent that outcome. “We urge the government to avoid any hard Brexit,” Chief Executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes said.

2019-02-08,"MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish Civil Guard has made widespread arrests following an investigation into tennis match-fixing by an organised Armenian criminal gang, the European Union’s Europol agency said on Thursday. Eleven house searches were carried out in Spain and 167,000 euros (£150,867) in cash were seized, along with a shotgun, more than 50 electronic devices, credit cards, five luxury vehicles and documentation related to the case. Forty-two bank accounts have been frozen. The Civil Guard said in a statement 15 people had been arrested, including the leaders of the criminal organisation, while a further 68 people have been investigated. Of the 83 people implicated in the case, 28 were professional tennis players, playing in the ITF Futures and Challenger categories, and one whose identity was not revealed competed in the 2018 U.S. Open. “Our officers have proved the group had been operating since February 2017 and estimate that they had earned millions of euros through the operation,” added the Civil Guard’s statement. News of the arrests came a day after the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) revealed that in 2018 more tennis players were disciplined for violations of anti-corruption rules than in any other year since the body’s creation. Twenty-one individuals broke anti-corruption rules with the majority sanctioned for match-fixing or betting offences, while eight lifetime bans were imposed, most notably to Italian former world number 49 Daniele Bracciali for match-fixing and facilitating betting. An independent review panel, set up by the sport’s four governing organisations, the ATP, WTA, ITF and Grand Slam Board, last month published a report into the threat of match-fixing in the sport. It described the current tennis environment as “a lamentably fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity”, in particular the lowest rungs of the professional game. The report said there were around 14,000 notional professional players in 2018 but that only about 600 earned enough money to cover the annual cost of competing. Of the 400 match specific alerts flagged up by betting organisations to the TIU in 2018, 91 percent were generated at the lowest and mid-levels of the sport where prize money is minimal compared to what is on offer on the main Tours. “The imbalance between prize money and the cost of competing places players in an invidious position by tempting them to contrive matches for financial reward,” the report said.

2019-02-08," (This January 8 story deletes reference to maximum exit deadline delay in paragraph 9.) By Alastair Macdonald BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is looking at how Brexit might be postponed and is open to the idea, with EU officials talking of delays from a few weeks to a full year, but it questions whether any such move can prevent a divided nation crashing out in chaos. Senior representatives of member states and EU institutions in Brussels who are close to negotiations told Reuters that an extension to the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the bloc was becoming more likely as Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to win parliamentary backing for a treaty she agreed last month.   “It’s probably the most likely outcome now,” said one senior official who said EU leaders now expected May to either lose a vote on the withdrawal agreement due next Tuesday — or to postpone a reckoning with lawmakers, as she did a month ago. “We can, of course, postpone Brexit. No one wants a no- deal,” said a second. “But the question would remain - what is it for? To hold a general election? Another referendum?” It is not clear that Britain can resolve its problems, this person said, so EU leaders would question the point of a delay. The senior figure said a no-deal Brexit would hurt the EU less than Britain and added, in an echo of May’s defiant mantra early in the talks: “No deal is better than a bad deal.” Defeat for May would leave the process in uncharted territory. Talks between Britain and the EU on how to handle that have been very limited, with only close aides to leaders involved, EU officials say. EU experts have prepared various scenarios and British officials have sought indications of how delaying Brexit might work, one official said. May’s government insisted on Tuesday that it has no plans to delay the March 29 departure, following a newspaper report that British officials had sounded out the EU about a postponement. Among Brexit scenarios now being considered in Brussels are:  — Britain asking to delay departure under Article 50 of the EU treaty. This would require unanimous approval by the other 27 states — something EU officials say would be likely to be granted.  — Britain revoking its notice of withdrawal, while avoiding a huge backlash from Brexit supporters by indicating it would revive its notification shortly. Under an EU court ruling last month this would not need EU approval and so may prove simpler. — Britain revoking its notice of withdrawal pending a new election or referendum to decide how — or whether — to leave. — A short delay of at most three months, so as to avoid a problem for the European Parliament. The legislature is due to meet in July for a first sitting after EU elections in late May. — A longer delay of up to a year, which would complicate the legal status of the new European Parliament. This might mean Britain having to elect new EU lawmakers in May, even if it still planned to leave the Union within the coming year. May has been seeking fresh commitments from Brussels to appease opponents, some of whom prefer leaving with no deal and others who would rather not leave the EU at all. But EU leaders have lined up to rule out any change to the draft and officials say that any public “reassurances” that the EU might give would be limited to reiterations of the terms.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China and South Korea called for concessions from the United States as well as North Korea, ahead of a possible second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, suggesting a U.S. pressure campaign aimed at the North’s denuclearisation may be slipping.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday that he would cooperate with the international community to at least partially ease sanctions to allow for some inter-Korean business and tourism ventures, while later noting that Pyongyang needed to take “bold steps” towards denuclearisation to win concessions from Washington. “I think North Korea knows that they clearly have to denuclearise for the easing of international sanctions, and the U.S. also understands that there needs to be corresponding action to expedite the North’s denuclearisation,” Moon told reporters at the presidential Blue House. Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted Kim in Beijing this week and said he hoped the United States and North Korea would “meet each other halfway,” Chinese state media reported. China, the North’s lone major ally, and U.S-backed South Korea have been key players in two years of “maximum pressure” led by the United States, but both countries are signalling an increased willingness to ease sanctions and improve ties with North Korea. Pyongyang and Washington have been struggling to find a breakthrough despite a pledge by Kim at a landmark summit with Trump in Singapore in June to work towards denuclearisation “of the Korean peninsula”. North Korea, which has been developing nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, has demanded Washington lift sanctions and declare an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War. Those demands were in response to Pyongyang’s initial, unilateral steps towards denuclearisation that included dismantling its only known nuclear testing site and a key missile engine facility. North Korea has rejected calls for unilateral disarmament, and has said it is now up to the United States and the international community to make concessions like easing sanctions. For its part, the United States has instead increased sanctions and said it will not lift the measures until North Korea takes more steps towards giving up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. In prepared remarks for his annual New year speech, Moon made no mention of any steps North Korea needs to take, instead focussing on the economic benefits of making peace with North Korea. But when pressed by journalists at a briefing afterward, Moon said North Korea should take more steps, such as abandoning its missiles and dismantling weapons production lines and other nuclear complexes, to secure U.S. concessions such as sanctions relief.  He said reducing U.S. military commitments, such as a withdrawal of troops or strategic assets from the region, would be an unlikely option for Washington. North Korea used the reference to denuclearisation “of the Korean peninsula” in the past to include the removal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella in the region. “The second summit would be a venue where they settle on terms of what specific measures North Korea will take and how those moves will be reciprocated by the United States,” Moon said. “But U.S. forces in South Korea or strategic assets in places like Guam and Japan are not linked with North Korea alone, as they exist for the stability and peace of the entire Northeast Asia.” Kim renewed his resolve to meet Trump again during his meeting with Xi in Beijing this week. Moon said Kim’s latest trip to Beijing signalled that a second Trump summit was imminent. Another U.S.-North Korea summit would also expedite an unprecedented visit by Kim to Seoul, planned for last year but delayed amid the nuclear standoff, Moon said. “I expect we’ll hear about high-level talks between North Korea and the United States before long for their second summit,” Moon said. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made several trips to Pyongyang last year. However, a meeting between Pompeo and senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol has yet to be rescheduled after an abrupt cancellation in November. North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday Kim and Xi held “in-depth, frank discussions” on the Korean peninsula and nuclear issues during Kim’s stay in Beijing, his fourth since March 2018. Kim told Xi about the difficulties and concerns in improving North Korea-U.S. relations and denuclearisation negotiations, KCNA said. Xi agreed that North Korea’s reasonable concerns must be addressed properly, it said. KCNA reported that Xi once again accepted Kim’s invitation to visit Pyongyang, but Chinese officials would not provide further details. China’s official Xinhua news agency also said Pyongyang’s “legitimate concerns” must be taken seriously in order to achieve a comprehensive resolution. Xinhua quoted Xi as saying he hoped that North Korea and the United States could meet each other half way and that the international community expected peaceful negotiations.  “The political settlement of the peninsula issue faces a rare historic opportunity,” said Xi, who “spoke highly of the positive measures taken by the (North Korea) side to maintain peace and stability and promote the realization of denuclearisation on the peninsula.” Kim reiterated a pledge from his New Year’s speech that the North would try to make a second summit achieve a result that the international community would welcome, Xinhua said. Wang Yiwei, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, said he believed North Korea was becoming impatient and beginning to lose hope with the United States for asking it to make changes without in turn removing sanctions. “The crux is how to let North Korea denuclearise and to give it security guarantees. On this, the United States and North Korea don’t have trust, so China has to act as a bridge,” Wang said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling is likely to gain more than 8 percent this year — assuming Britain and the European Union part ways amicably, according to a Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists. The pound has largely been ignoring economic data, instead swinging wildly on any snippet of news about Britain’s departure from the EU in less than three months. While it has showed some strength to start the year, that is largely down to dollar weakness. Its performance against the euro has been more muted. With only a short time left, the Brexit outcome remains uncertain. British lawmakers are expected to vote next week against a Brexit agreement Prime Minister Theresa May struck with the EU in November. May’s government suffered a defeat in parliament on Tuesday when lawmakers who oppose leaving the EU without an accord won a vote creating a new obstacle to a no-deal Brexit. On Wednesday, May failed to win over the Northern Irish party which props up her government and then lost a vote which means she has a shorter period of time to come up with an alternative plan if she is beaten next week. A November Reuters poll said sterling would rise around 5.5 percent in the event of an amicable split but fall over 6 percent if there is a hard Brexit. Still, there is only a median 25 percent probability of a disorderly Brexit, a Reuters poll predicted last month. Almost 90 percent of economists surveyed expect a free-trade deal between the two sides. [ECILT/GB] Those economists also mostly expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.0 percent as soon as April, which would support the currency.  Ongoing doubts about the health of the world’s two biggest economies - the U.S. and China - as well as a trade war between them that’s hurting growth have raised questions about how high U.S. interest rates will go this year. The dollar’s rally is largely over, according to about two-thirds of the currency strategists polled by Reuters. They said dialling back rate hike expectations has diminished the dollar’s strength. [EUR/POLL] On Wednesday, the pound rose towards $1.28 after reports May was attempting to win over the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party in next week’s crucial vote but dropped when she failed.  Sterling also rallied on Tuesday following reports British and European officials were discussing the possibility of extending the formal exit process amid fears a Brexit deal will not be approved by March 29. In a month, sterling will be little moved from Wednesday’s levels, trading at $1.27. When Britain and the EU part ways it will have strengthened to $1.30. By mid-year it will have climbed to $1.32 and at year-end it will be over 8 percent higher at $1.38. “Ultimately, we assume the removal of the current Brexit uncertainty, which will prompt a period of pound appreciation as the year unfolds,” noted analysts at MUFG, who expect a sterling rally to $1.43 by year end. However, that 12-month median forecast is still lower than the $1.50 sterling was hovering around before the June 2016 Brexit referendum. Only three of 66 analysts with 12-month forecasts expected it to strengthen past that. Highlighting the uncertainty around the pound’s future, the 12-month forecast ranged from $1.22 to $1.59. Against the euro, the pound will make modest gains. On Wednesday, a euro was worth about 90.0 pence. In six months, forecasts are for 87.0p and in a year 86.5p.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Australia said on Wednesday it would consider taking in a 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled to Thailand saying she feared her family, which she accused of abuse, would kill her. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun arrived in Bangkok on Saturday appealing for asylum. Australia said on Tuesday it would consider resettling her if the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) deemed her a refugee. “The UNHCR has referred Ms Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun to Australia for consideration for refugee resettlement,” Australia’s Department of Homeland Security said in an email on Wednesday. The department said it would consider the referral “in the usual way, as it does with all UNHCR referrals”. It declined to comment further. The UNHCR office in Thailand also declined to comment. Qunun has refused to meet her father and brother who flew to Bangkok this week, Thai immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said. “He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,” he said, adding that her father denied Qunun’s allegation that her family was abusing her physically and emotionally. Surachate added that Qunan’s father would remain in Thailand, under the care of the Saudi Arabian embassy, until it is clear where Qunun will receive asylum. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne is due in Bangkok on Thursday for a visit arranged earlier, during which she will discuss the case of Bahrain footballer Hakeem AlAraibi, who has refugee status in Australia but is in jail in Thailand. Qunun was initially denied entry to Thailand when she arrived on Saturday. She soon started posting messages on Twitter from the transit area of Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport saying she had “escaped Kuwait” and her life would be in danger if forced to return to Saudi Arabia. Within hours, a campaign sprang up on Twitter, spread by a loose network of activists around the world, prompting the Thai government to reverse a decision to force the young woman onto a plane that would return her to her family. Qunun’s case has drawn global attention to Saudi Arabia’s strict social rules, including a requirement that women have the permission of a male “guardian” to travel, which rights groups say can trap women and girls as prisoners of abusive families. It comes at a time when Riyadh is facing unusually intense scrutiny from its Western allies over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October and over the humanitarian consequences of its war in Yemen. Thai authorities arrested and charged AlAraibi, a Bahraini footballer who has a refugee status in Australia, late last year. Bahrain made a request to have him extradited and he is in jail, waiting for a hearing to decide his case. “AlAraibi was granted permanent residency by the Australian government in recognition of his status as a refugee,” Payne said in a statement, saying that she would seek his safe return to Australia. Rights group Amnesty International said Thai authorities should “show humanity” to AlAraibi the same way they had to Qunun. “We welcome the leadership shown by the Thai authorities in Rahaf’s case,” the group’s Middle East director of campaigns, Samah Hadid, said in a statement. “No person should be deported to a country where they are at risk of serious human rights violations ... the humanity shown to Rahaf must not be a one-off.” Reporting by Byron Kaye, Colin Packham and Jonathan Barrett in SYDNEY, Juarawee Kittisilpa, Patpicha Tanakasempipat, and Panu Wongcha-um in BANGKOK; Editing by Robert Birsel and Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-saudi/australia-to-consider-taking-in-saudi-teen-who-fled-family-abuse-idUKKCN1P30HM,2019-02-08,,Australia to consider taking in Saudi teen who fled family 'abuse'
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Air France KLM (AIRF.PA) said anti-government protests in France had hit its revenue, taking the shine off a rise in its overall December passenger traffic figures and knocking its shares. Analysts said the latest passenger data showed that the Dutch KLM airline was again doing better than Air France, with KLM and the smaller Transavia division flying fuller planes. “The rise in passenger numbers was essentially led by KLM and Transavia, whereas the performance at Air France was more flat,” Gregoire Laverne of Roche Brune Asset Management, which does not hold shares in the airline, said. Air France KLM said the “yellow vest” protests, which have been marred by violence and disrupted shopping areas and the transport network, were estimated to have had a negative revenue impact of around 15 million euros (£13.5 million). A spokeswoman for Air France KLM said it had arrived at the estimate by taking into account last minute cancellations of bookings that had occurred as a result of the protests, which started in mid-November but intensified and grew more violent over the course of December. The airline said in a statement that it carried around 7.7 million passengers in December, up 3.6 percent from a year earlier, while for the whole of 2018 it flew around 101 million passengers, 2.8 percent higher than the previous year. Shares in Air France KLM, which is due to report full-year earnings on Feb. 20, were down 3.7 percent at 1150 GMT. Air France KLM hired Benjamin Smith as its new group chief executive in August, after devastating strikes led to his predecessor’s resignation. Smith has said Air France must narrow the profitability gap with its more efficient KLM stable mate. Analysts at Credit Suisse kept a “neutral” rating on Air France KLM, highlighting the pressures of the French protests. “We see a key driver of the differential between Air France and KLM load factors as the ‘gilets jaunes’ protests in France, which have cost 15 million euros, or around 0.3 percent of unit revenue in the quarter,” Credit Suisse said in a research note.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump urged Congress in a televised speech on Tuesday to give him $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico but stopped short of declaring a national emergency to pay for the barrier with military funds. Facing Democratic opposition in Congress to a wall that he promised to build as a presidential candidate, Trump said in his first prime-time address from the Oval Office that there was a growing security and humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. Using blunt language in an attempt to win public support, the Republican president said illegal immigrants and drugs flowing across the southern border posed a serious threat to American safety.  “How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?” he said, recounting gruesome details of murders he said were committed by illegal immigrants.  But after days of hinting he might use presidential powers to declare an emergency as a first step towards directing money for the wall without congressional approval, Trump said he would continue seeking a solution to the impasse with Congress. Trump’s speech came 18 days into a partial government shutdown precipitated by his demand for the wall. Public opposition to the shutdown is growing and that could hurt Trump, as he said last month he would be proud to close the government to fight for the wall. Democratic leaders, in a rebuttal also carried live on national television, accused the president on Tuesday night of using fear tactics and spreading misinformation about the situation along the border. “The president has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives.  “The fact is, President Trump has chosen to hold hostage critical services for the health, safety and well-being of the American people and withhold the paychecks of 800,000 innocent workers across the nation, many of them veterans,” she said. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found that 51 percent of adults mainly blamed Trump for the shutdown, up 4 percentage points from late December, while 32 percent blamed congressional Democrats and 7 percent faulted Republicans in Congress. Republican lawmakers have increasingly expressed concerns about Trump’s handling of the long-running dispute. But he has shown no signs of giving up. He is scheduled to visit the southwest border on Thursday and may still choose to make the national emergency declaration.  Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Monday the president was considering the possibility and the White House counsel’s office was studying its legality. Democrats and other opponents of a wall have threatened to take legal action if Trump issues an emergency order. They say he is manufacturing a crisis in a bid to meet his 2016 presidential campaign promise for a wall that he said at the time would be paid for by Mexico. The Mexican government has refused to provide such funds. Trump was to meet at the White House on Wednesday with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. Politics coloured the remarks from both sides on Tuesday. Trump said African-Americans and Hispanics were especially hard hit by the border crisis; both groups are key Democratic constituencies. Pelosi pointedly mentioned that veterans were hurt by the shutdown; Trump has courted veterans as a candidate and as president. Trump at times tried to adopt a softer tone. “This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul,” he said, suggesting that women and children were among the migrants often victimized by trafficking across the border.  Hoping to demonstrate flexibility during his nearly 10-minute speech, Trump said of the border barrier he wants built: “At the request of the Democrats it will be a steel barrier and not a concrete wall.” But Democrats have opposed not just the construction materials to be used, but the extent of a project that could end up costing more than $24 billion over the long run. Democrats also argue that a mix of fencing, which already has been constructed in many parts of the border, and higher-tech tools would be cheaper and more effective in securing the border. Pelosi said Trump rejected bipartisan legislation to reopen the government agencies shuttered as a result of the fight over the wall, and that he was obsessed with “forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall.” She has previously called the wall immoral. Trump took issue with that in his speech. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized,” he said. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who delivered a rebuttal along with Pelosi, urged the president to reopen the government while the debate over immigration policies continued. “The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30-foot wall,” he said. “So our suggestion is a simple one.  Mr. President: Reopen the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.” Reporting by Jeff Mason and Richard Cowan; Additional reporting by Amanda Becker, Eric Beech and David Alexander in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-shutdown/in-oval-office-speech-trump-demands-a-wall-but-does-not-declare-emergency-idUKKCN1P20AT,2019-02-08,President Donald Trump urged Congress in a televised speech on Tuesday to give him $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) this year to help build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico but stopped short of declaring a national emergency to pay for the barrier with military funds.,"In Oval Office speech, Trump demands a wall but does not declare emergency"
2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed an expected U.S.-North Korea summit in talks in Beijing on Tuesday, Yonhap news agency said, days after Kim warned he may take an alternative path if the United States does not ease sanctions.  Kim’s visit to China, confirmed by North Korean and Chinese state media, comes amid plans for a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula. South Korea’s Yonhap, without identifying its sources, said the two leaders held talks for an hour in which they discussed the second U.S.-North Korea summit and strengthening bilateral ties. The meeting was followed by a dinner hosted by Xi and his wife, Yonhap said. Kim held three summits last year with Xi, his most important ally, before and after summits with Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim and Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation at their landmark June summit in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specifics. Negotiations have made little headway since. “Kim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,” Harry J. Kazianis, Director of Defence Studies at the U.S.-based Centre for the National Interest, said in an e-mailed statement.  “In fact, during his New Year’s Day speech, Kim’s ‘new way’ that he referred to may well have been a veiled threat to move closer to Beijing. That should make America quite concerned.”     Kim left for China on a private train on Monday afternoon accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol Ju, and senior North Korean officials, including Kim Yong Chol, a key negotiator in talks with the United States, and foreign minister Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s state-run KCNA news agency said.  China’s official Xinhua news agency confirmed that Kim was visiting from Monday to Thursday at Xi’s invitation. The visit coincides with what South Korean officials say is Kim’s 35th birthday on Tuesday. Kim’s visit to North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic ally follows reports of advanced negotiations for a second summit between Washington and Pyongyang aimed at resolving the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes.  Kim said in his New Year speech he was ready to meet Trump any time to achieve their common goal of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But he warned that he may seek an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised China’s support for resolving the North Korean crisis and said he did not think the U.S. trade dispute with China would affect this. Kim’s visit comes as a U.S. delegation opened a second day of talks with Chinese counterparts in Beijing aimed at ending the trade war between the world’s two largest economies.   “The Chinese have been very clear to us that these are separate issues,” Pompeo said. “Their behaviour has demonstrated that as well and we appreciate that. China has actually been a good partner in our efforts to reduce the risk to the world from North Korea’s nuclear capability; I expect they will continue to do so.” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked during a daily briefing whether there was a connection between Kim’s visit and the possibility of another meeting between Kim and Trump, said China believed contact between the United States and North Korea was important.  “China has always supported both sides to continue to hold talks and to reach a positive outcome,” Lu said.    Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said Kim’s trip would have no direct influence on the progress of trade talks.  While no details were released about an agenda in China, Kim has been seeking relief from sanctions, a peace declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War and more investment.  Ties between China and North Korea, which had frayed as Pyongyang stepped up its missile and nuclear tests up to late 2017, warmed over the past year as Kim engaged with China, South Korea and the United States.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A partial shutdown of the federal government entered its 18th day on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to make a nationally televised address to promote construction of his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. Trump, when he ran for president in 2016, said Mexico would pay for the barrier along the nation’s southern border. The Mexican government has steadfastly refused, causing Trump to demand payment from a Congress that also has balked. As a result, Trump has refused to support legislation funding about one-quarter of government activities unless lawmakers provide $5.7 billion (4.5 billion pounds) for a project that eventually could cost well over $23 billion. Democrats, who control the U.S. House of Representatives, have called on Trump to reopen the government while talks continue on the wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted that he will not bring any government funding bill up for a vote if Trump opposes it, although some of his fellow Republicans are tiring of the prolonged standoff. The following are some key dates: Vice President Mike Pence speaks to congressional Republicans at the U.S. Capitol at 5:30 p.m. EST (2230 GMT). Trump makes televised speech from the Oval Office about the border wall at 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT Wednesday). Some Democratic lawmakers plan an afternoon protest in front of the White House at Lafayette Park in Washington. House Democrats plan to begin approving individual bills to restore funding to federal agencies affected by the shutdown, without any wall funding. If passed, the bills would then go  one-by-one to the Republican-controlled Senate, which is not expected to consider them, unless public pressure for action builds to higher levels. Trump travels to the U.S.-Mexico border to pitch for the wall. Federal workers affected by the shutdown plan to rally in near the White House, the National Federation of Federal Employees union said.  If still underway, the shutdown will be tied for the longest in recent history. In late 1995 and early 1996, under Democratic President Bill Clinton, federal agencies were shuttered for 21 days as he tangled with Republicans over budget matters. JAN. 21-25 Congress is scheduled to leave Washington for a week for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Trump is scheduled to deliver his annual State of the Union address to Congress.

2019-02-08,"COPENHAGEN/BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The European Union on Tuesday froze the assets of an Iranian intelligence unit and two of its staff, as the Netherlands accused Iran of two killings on its soil and joined France and Denmark in alleging Tehran plotted other attacks in Europe. The move, although in part symbolic since one of the men is in prison in Belgium, marks the first time the EU has enacted sanctions on Iran since lifting a host of curbs on it three years ago following its 2015 nuclear pact with world powers. The decision, which includes designating the unit and the two Iranians as terrorists, follows last year’s disclosure by Denmark and France that they suspected an Iranian government intelligence service of pursuing assassination plots on their soil. Copenhagen sought an EU-wide response.  “EU just agreed to enact sanctions against an Iranian Intelligence Service for its assassination plots on European soil. Strong signal from the EU that we will not accept such behaviour in Europe,” Denmark’s Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Twitter. France, which has already hit the two men and the ministry unit with sanctions, has said there was no doubt the Iranian intelligence ministry was behind a failed attack near Paris. On Tuesday, the Dutch government publicly accused Iran of the plots, as well as two killings in 2015 and 2017, sending a letter to parliament to warn of further economic sanctions if Tehran did not cooperate with European investigations. The letter signed by the Dutch foreign and interior ministers said Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium met Iranian officials to convey “their serious concerns regarding Iran’s probable involvement in these hostile acts on EU territory.” “Iran was informed that involvement in such matters is entirely unacceptable and must be stopped immediately ... further sanctions cannot be ruled out,” the letter said. Iran has denied any involvement in the alleged plots, saying the accusations were intended to damage EU-Iran relations. “Accusing Iran won’t absolve Europe of responsibility for harboring terrorists,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday in a tweet. “Europeans, incl(uding) Denmark, Holland and France, harbor MEK,” he added, referring to an exiled Iranian opposition group Mujaheedin-e Khalq. Paris accused Iran of a plot to carry out a bomb attack at a rally near Paris organised by the MEK. Denmark says it foiled a Iranian intelligence plan to assassinate an Iranian Arab opposition figure on its soil. On Tuesday, the Netherlands said it had “strong indications” that Iran was behind the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin, in 2015 and in 2017. The latter was dissident Iranian Arab activist Ahmad Mola Nissi who was gunned down by an unidentified assailant in front of his home in The Hague. Iran denies any involvement in the killings. The decision to impose the curbs was taken without debate at an unrelated meeting of Europe ministers in Brussels and the asset freeze comes into effect on Wednesday, EU officials said. The Danish Foreign Ministry named the two employees as the deputy minister and director general of intelligence, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, and a Vienna-based diplomat, Assadollah Asadi. Their names are to appear in the EU’s Official Journal on Wednesday.  Sanctions on the intelligence ministry, which is under the control of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, are unlikely to change what the European Union says are Iran’s destabilising activities in Europe and the Middle East.   The deputy minister and director general of intelligence is in Iran, while the Iranian diplomat was charged and is being held by Belgian authorities. Neither appear to have assets in France, which first imposed the asset freeze late last year. But imposing economic sanctions on Iran, once the EU’s top oil supplier, remains highly sensitive for the bloc.  The EU has been straining to uphold the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and world powers that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. It has been less willing to consider sanctions, instead seeking talks with Tehran. Iran has warned it could ditch the nuclear deal if EU powers do not protect its trade and financial benefits.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to hold a vote in parliament on the government’s deal to leave the European Union on Jan. 15, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Tuesday after a meeting of senior ministers. May again told her cabinet it was not government policy to delay Brexit by extending the so-called Article 50 notice, the spokesman said, adding the idea may have been discussed by EU officials but not by British officials.  “Subject to parliament approving a business motion, the debate will be opened tomorrow ... The prime minister said that she would close the debate next Tuesday, which is January 15, when the vote will take place,” her spokesman told reporters.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A smiling construction worker, a grinning farmer and a jolly pensioner: these are the cartoon faces the government is using to try to reassure Britons that the country can cope with a no-deal Brexit. A cheery illustrated banner on a new government website sits atop links to information on how to prepare for a no-deal Brexit that critics have said could cause food and medicine shortages, long border delays and widespread economic disruption. On Tuesday, the government launched the euexit.campaign.gov.uk site with a low-key public information campaign consisting of adverts on commercial radio stations and tweets from some government departments. A radio advert broadcast on LBC radio at around 0530 GMT featured a range of voice actors asking questions about renewing passports, mobile phone charges, and exporting goods. It directed them to the new website for answers. The site covers all exit scenarios and includes previously published advice on topics ranging from new restrictions on taking pets on holiday, to extra paperwork when importing goods from the bloc. With less than three months until Britain leaves the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to win parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal, increasing the chances that the country ends up leaving without a deal. A no-deal exit is the default scenario if May’s deal is rejected, and the prospect of supply chain disruption and blocked ports has in recent weeks pushed companies and the government to ramp up contingency planning. Some Brexit supporters say a no-deal exit is the only way to truly leave the bloc, and that warnings of the economic consequences have been overblown to drum up support for May’s deal.   The department in charge of no-deal planning did little to herald the launch of the information campaign on Tuesday, but has previously said it would be stepped up in coming weeks to include billboard advertisements and other media.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The following are prepared remarks by Carlos Ghosn, ex-chairman of Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), for his court appearance in Tokyo on Tuesday regarding allegations against him of aggravated breach of trust. The statement was released by Ghosn’s lawyers in the United States. Statement of Carlos Ghosn  Your Honour, I am grateful to finally have the opportunity to speak publicly. I look forward to beginning the process of defending myself against the accusations that have been made against me.  First, let me say that I have a genuine love and appreciation for Nissan. I believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company, I have acted honourably, legally, and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company — with the sole purpose of supporting and strengthening Nissan, and helping to restore its place as one of Japan’s finest and most respected companies. Now I would like to address the allegations.  1. The FX Forward contracts When I first joined Nissan and moved to Japan almost 20 years ago, I wanted to be paid in U.S. dollars, but was told that was not possible and was given an employment contract that required me to be paid in Japanese yen.  I have long been concerned about the volatility of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. I am a U.S. dollar-based individual - my children live in the U.S. and I have strong ties to Lebanon, whose currency has a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar.  I wanted predictability in my income in order to help me take care of my family.   To deal with this issue, I entered into foreign exchange contracts throughout my tenure at Nissan, beginning in 2002.  Two such contracts are at issue in this proceeding. One was signed in 2006, when the Nissan stock price was around 1,500 yen and the yen/dollar rate was around 118. The other was signed in 2007, when the Nissan stock price was around 1,400 yen and the yen/dollar exchange rate was around 114. The 2008–2009 financial crisis caused Nissan’s shares to plummet to 400 yen in October 2008 and to 250 yen in February 2009 (down more than 80% from its peak) and the yen/dollar exchange rate dropped below 80. It was a perfect storm that no one predicted. The entire banking system was frozen, and the bank asked for an immediate increase in my collateral on the contracts, which I could not satisfy on my own.   I was faced with two stark choices: 1. Resign from Nissan, so that I could receive my retirement allowance, which I could then use to provide the necessary collateral. But my moral commitment to Nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time; a captain doesn’t jump ship in the middle of a storm. 2. Ask Nissan to temporarily take on the collateral, so long as it came to no cost to the company, while I gathered collateral from my other sources.  I chose option 2. The FX contracts were then transferred back to me without Nissan incurring any loss.     2. Khaled Juffali Khaled Juffali has been a long-time supporter and partner of Nissan. During a very difficult period, Khaled Juffali Company helped Nissan solicit financing and helped Nissan solve a complicated problem involving a local distributor - indeed, Juffali helped Nissan restructure struggling distributors throughout the Gulf region, enabling Nissan to better compete with rivals like Toyota, which was outperforming Nissan. Juffali also assisted Nissan in negotiating the development of a manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia, organising high-level meetings with Saudi officials.  Khaled Juffali Company was appropriately compensated - an amount disclosed to and approved by the appropriate officers at Nissan - in exchange for these critical services that substantially benefited Nissan.   3.The FIEL Allegations Four major companies sought to recruit me while I was CEO of Nissan, including Ford (by Bill Ford) and General Motors (by Steve Rattner, the then-Car Czar under President Barack Obama).  Even though their proposals were very attractive, I could not in good conscience abandon Nissan while we were in the midst of our turnaround. Nissan is an iconic Japanese company that I care about deeply. Although I chose not to pursue the other opportunities, I did keep a record of the market compensation for my role, which those companies offered me if I had taken these jobs. This was an internal benchmark that I kept for my own future reference - it had no legal effect; it was never shared with the directors; and it never represented any kind of binding commitment.   In fact, the various proposals for non-compete and advisory services post-retirement made by some members of the board did not reflect or reference my internal calculations, underscoring their hypothetical, non-binding nature. Contrary to the accusations made by the prosecutors, I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed. Moreover, I understood that any draft proposals for post-retirement compensation were reviewed by internal and external lawyers, showing I had no intent to violate the law.  For me, the test is the “death test”:  if I died today, could my heirs require Nissan to pay anything other than my retirement allowance? The answer is an unequivocal “No.”  4. Contribution to Nissan I have dedicated two decades of my life to reviving Nissan and building the Alliance. I worked towards these goals day and night, on the earth and in the air, standing shoulder to shoulder with hardworking Nissan employees around the globe, to create value. The fruits of our labours have been extraordinary. We transformed Nissan, moving it from a position of a debt of 2 trillion yen in 1999 to cash of 1.8 trillion yen at the end of 2006, from 2.5 million cars sold in 1999 at a significant loss to 5.8 million cars sold profitably in 2016. Nissan’s asset base tripled during the period.  We saw the revival of icons like the Fairlady Z and Nissan G-TR; Nissan’s industrial entry into Wuhon, China, St. Petersburg, Russia, Chennai, India, and Resende, Brazil; the pioneering of a mass market for electric cars with the Leaf; the jumpstarting of autonomous cars; the introduction of Mitsubishi Motors to the Alliance; and the Alliance becoming the number one auto group in the world in 2017, producing more than 10 million cars annually. We created, directly and indirectly, countless jobs in Japan and re-established Nissan as a pillar of the Japanese economy. These accomplishments - secured alongside the peerless team of Nissan employees worldwide - are the greatest joy of my life, next to my family. 5.Conclusion Your Honour, I am innocent of the accusations made against me. I have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several-decade professional career. I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.   Thank you, your Honour, for listening to me.

2019-02-08,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi discussed insurgent attacks on Myanmar police on Monday in a rare meeting with the military chief, and her administration called for the armed forces to “crush” the rebels, a government spokesman said. Fighting between government forces and the rebel Arakan Army in the western state of Rakhine has displaced thousands of people since early December, according to the United Nations. The Arakan Army wants greater autonomy for Rakhine, where the mainly Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group makes up the majority of the population. Rakhine State saw a military-led crackdown in 2017, following attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents that prompted hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee westwards into neighbouring Bangladesh. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay said Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other cabinet members met military leaders, including army chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy and the military intelligence chief, to discuss “foreign affairs and national security”.  “The president’s office has instructed the military to launch an operation to crush the terrorists,” Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw. While Suu Kyi is barred from being president by a military-drafted constitution, Win Myint is a loyalist. Suu Kyi is seen as de facto leader of the civilian government, while the military remains in charge of security. The insurgents killed 13 policemen and wounded nine in attacks on four police posts on Friday, as Myanmar celebrated Independence Day, state media reported. An Arakan Army spokesman outside Myanmar told Reuters last week the group attacked the security forces in response to a broad military offensive in northern Rakhine State that also targeted civilians. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Monday that 4,500 people were sheltering in monasteries and communal spaces after being displaced by the fighting in the past month.  Zaw Htay described the Arakan Army as a “terrorist organization” and said it had surprised security forces on guard against Rohingya insurgents. He said the Arakan Army could destabilise Rakhine State for years to come and warned people not to give it support. “Do they want to see a cycle of violence lasting decades?” he said. “I want to tell Rakhine people who are supporting (the Arakan Army): Don’t think about yourself, but think about your next generation.” Myanmar governments have battled various ethnic minority insurgent groups since shortly after independence from Britain in 1948, though some have struck ceasefire agreements. Zaw Htay also accused the Arakan Army of meeting the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a group of Rohingya insurgents that Myanmar also considers terrorists but added that Myanmar was unable to eliminate the groups as they had bases across the border in Bangladesh. A Bangladeshi foreign ministry official and two Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) officers denied the accusation.  One BGB officer asked Myanmar to provide evidence of militant camps in Bangladesh. “All the terrorism is taking place on the other side of the border,” said Lieutenant Colonel Manzural Hasan Khan, a BGB commander in Cox’s Bazar, the district where more than 900,000 Rohingya Muslims are sheltering having fled bouts of violence that have drawn international condemnation against Myanmar. “The world knows what happened on the other side,” he said. The Myanmar government and military leaders also discussed a temporary ceasefire the military announced last month in other parts of the country, where other insurgent groups operate, Zaw Htay said. The meeting was held at the request of the president’s office, he said.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering ways to help Prime Minister Theresa May convince the British parliament to back the Brexit treaty she agreed with EU leaders last month but ruled out on Monday any change to the deal. EU sources told Reuters that senior officials in Brussels are discussing whether and how to issue “reassurances” that might help May overcome resistance to the deal before lawmakers vote in London next week. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC he hoped the EU and United Kingdom could find a way to avoid “negative ramifications from a hard Brexit related not only to commerce and trade, but importantly to the national security issues that we have with the British as well as the European Union.” Among the reassurances EU officials were considering was a request they said May put to fellow EU leaders at a summit before the Christmas break, on Dec. 14, to commit to having a new UK-EU free trade treaty in place by the end of 2021. However, the European Union shows no sign of going beyond an existing aspiration to do that, not a hard promise. The date is important as it could allow May to assure her own party and others that the unpopular “Irish backstop” in the treaty would not be triggered after a status-quo transition period ends some time by 2022. The backstop would bind Britain to follow EU rules to avoid a “hard” customs border across the island of Ireland unless a better way is agreed to do that by means of a new trade pact. Critics of May’s deal to smooth Britain’s passage out of the EU on March 29 say the backstop could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely, long after it gives up any say over them. EU officials familiar with the discussions said they saw little sign of any shift in the position of EU leaders last month, when they said the agreement could not be renegotiated and they would make no binding commitments that could be construed as altering it. “We can provide reassurances,” one official said. “But whatever it might be will just reiterate the (summit) conclusions from last month.” Among ways in which the EU could offer more detail and clarity on its agreed position, officials said, would be an exchange of legal letters with the British government setting out expectations of when a trade deal could be completed. However, EU leaders are wary of introducing legal ambiguity if the language of any statement differs from the original text. The EU executive repeated on Monday that leaders would not renegotiate the treaty and said it was pressing on with planning for Britain to crash out of the Union without a deal. “The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,” the European Commission’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “This deal will not be renegotiated.” He also repeated that there were no talks planned between negotiators from the two sides as “negotiations are complete”. Schinas said that Juncker’s conversation with May on Friday was “friendly” and that the two would speak again this week. May also spoke last week to EU summit chair Donald Tusk.

2019-02-08,"MANSTON, England (Reuters) - A convoy of nearly 90 trucks rolled through the southeast English countryside to Britain’s main port to continental Europe on Monday in a government test-run for a potentially chaotic Brexit that was mocked as a farce by opponents of the split.  Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to force her Brexit deal through parliament but lawmakers are expected to reject it. If so, business chiefs and investors fear the world’s fifth-largest economy will leave the European Union at 2300 GMT on March 29 without an agreement on their future relationship. With parliament deadlocked, the ultimate destination of the Brexit project remains unclear. Possible outcomes range from another referendum on European Union membership to a disorderly departure with no deal. May’s government has repeatedly warned that a no deal will lead to severe economic disruption, and Monday’s exercise was part of preparations to ensure essential supplies can keep flowing through Dover, Europe’s busiest ferry port. The transport ministry said it was testing Manston airfield as a holding facility for lorries and traffic congestion on Kent roads in the event of disruption at the border. Setting off from Manston, 87 trucks drove the 20 miles (32 km) to Dover and back again. They then drove again to Dover. Hiring the lorries cost 48,950 pounds ($62,484), the transport ministry said. The ‘war game’ was criticised by lawmakers as a waste of time and money and mocked on Twitter as “a fake traffic jam ... to show the EU we are ready for no deal”.  Britain’s Road Haulage Association (RHA) said the trial was too little, too late and would need to be repeated to properly stress-test the management of thousands of lorries.  “Less than a hundred lorries is a drop in the ocean compared to the more than 10,000 that go to the channel ports every day,” said Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative lawmaker for Dover.  “Sending lorries across Kent on a wild goose chase to Manston airport and then to the port of Dover by small and winding, often single track ‘A roads’ through Kent villages is not the right plan.” Dover has been Britain’s most important gateway to Europe since Roman times and the port now handles 17 percent of the United Kingdom’s goods trade. Up to 10,000 trucks a day pass through with everything from perishable food to medicines. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker who wants another referendum on EU membership, said the truck journey would not convince the EU that Britain was ready for no deal.  “This is a taxpayer-funded farce,” Moran said.  Brexit supporters say that, while there may be some short-term disruption, in the long-term the UK will thrive outside the EU, which they cast as a doomed and excessively bureaucratic project dominated by Germany. But pro-Europeans fear Britain’s exit will hammer the economy and undermine the West as it grapples with Donald Trump’s unpredictable U.S. presidency and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. “Today’s trial cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks being held at Manston airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” the RHA’s chief executive Richard Burnett said in a statement. “It’s too little too late — this process should have started nine months ago. At this late stage it looks like window dressing.” Facing defeat in parliament last month, May postponed a vote on the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU and pledged to seek further political and legal assurances from the bloc. The EU has signalled it may try to allay the fears of May’s critics but will not renegotiate the deal. May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament. A vote is due around Jan. 15. “It’s still hard to see any upside to Brexit,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which said new car sales in 2018 fell at their fastest rate since the global financial crisis a decade ago. “Everyone recognises that Brexit is an existential threat to the UK automotive industry and we hope a practical solution will prevail,” he said, calling for lawmakers to support May’s deal to guarantee a transition period. Britain’s main opposition Labour Party is expected to back a proposal on Tuesday that could mean the government needs parliamentary approval for a no-deal Brexit. The European Commission repeated on Monday that EU leaders would not renegotiate the Brexit deal agreed with May, who said she was seeking further assurances from Brussels on the deal. “The deal that is on the table is the best and the only deal possible,” chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters when asked about a phone conversation on Friday between May and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “This deal will not be renegotiated.” ($1 = 0.7834 pounds) Additional reporting by Costas Pitas, William James and Andrew MacAskill; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-lorries/no-deal-brexit-truck-war-game-prompts-scorn-idUKKCN1P10NX,2019-02-08,A convoy of nearly 90 trucks rolled through the southeast English countryside to Britain's main port to continental Europe on Monday in a government test-run for a potentially chaotic Brexit that was mocked as a farce by opponents of the split.,No-deal Brexit truck 'war game' prompts scorn
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday not to bend in his demand for a wall along the southern border with Mexico but said the barrier could be made of steel instead of concrete as a potential compromise with Democrats who refuse to fund it. Trump’s comments came at the start of the third week of a partial government shutdown resulting from the dispute that has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers idled or without paychecks. Trump threatened again, without providing specifics on where the funding would originate, to declare a national emergency as an alternative way to build the wall, depending on the outcome of talks in the coming days. Democrats have declined to approve the $5.6 billion (4.39 billion pounds) Trump wants to fulfil a 2016 campaign promise to curb illegal immigration. Led by new Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrats passed a bill in the House of Representatives last week to reopen the government without wall funding. Pelosi has called a border wall immoral. “This is a very important battle to win from the standpoint of safety, number one, (and) defining our country and who we are,” Trump told reporters at the White House before leaving for a short trip to the Camp David presidential retreat. “The barrier, or the wall, can be of steel instead of concrete, if that helps people. It may be better,” he said. The White House painted that offer, which Trump floated previously, as an olive branch. In a letter to congressional leaders on Sunday detailing its funding demands, the Trump administration included a request for an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs at the southern border. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that agreeing to a steel barrier would allow Democrats to stick to their refusal to fund a wall. “That should help us move in the right direction,” he said. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer did not show his hand when asked whether the White House offer to move away from a concrete structure was evidence of compromise.  “It’ll be discussed,” he said on NBC. Vice President Mike Pence led a second round of talks with congressional aides on Sunday about the issue, but Trump said he did not expect those talks to produce results, noting that the principals - himself, Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer - were the ones who could solve it quickly. “If we don’t find a solution, it’s going to go on for a long time. There’s not going to be any bend right here,” Trump said. He later tweeted that the Pence talks were productive. But a Democratic aide familiar with the meeting said Democrats urged the White House to pass measures to reopen the government without wall funding and Pence said Trump would not do that. The aide said no progress was made and no further meetings of the group were scheduled. Democrats could demand other concessions from the White House, such as protections for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, known as Dreamers, or changes to other spending provisions. Trump said he wanted to help on the Dreamer issue but preferred to wait for a Supreme Court ruling on it first. Democratic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin reacted coolly to Trump’s suggestion of declaring a national emergency. “I don’t know what he’s basing this on, but he’s faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent,” Durbin said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  Large chunks of the federal government were shut down on Dec. 22 after lawmakers and the president hit an impasse over Trump’s demand that a bill to keep the federal government operational include money to help build a $23 billion wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. About 800,000 government workers are either furloughed or working without pay. “I can relate,” Trump, a former New York businessman, said when asked if he could relate to the pain of federal workers struggling to pay their bills. “I’m sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments.” Asked if workers would get paid on Friday, Trump said: “We’ll see whether or not it’s settled.” Not all Republicans agree with Trump’s insistence on keeping government agencies shuttered until the border debate is resolved. “It is not a sign of weakness to try to figure out a middle ground, and I think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise,” U.S. Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on NBC. She called the debate over using steel versus concrete “bizarre.” House Democrats plan to pass a series of bills this week to reopen government, breaking up legislation they have already approved in a bid to get Republicans to agree to reopen certain agencies, Hoyer said on “Meet the Press.”  “We need to open up government and then negotiate. Not the other way around,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) has triggered contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components as well as use ports other than Dover.   Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 days but a negotiated withdrawal agreement looks set to be voted down by MPs next week, making a “no deal” exit - and disruption to trade - more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and is one of the country’s rare manufacturing success stories, has warned that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined its contingency plans in October, had no choice but to authorise them at a board meeting in December.  “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two years where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the “accumulating” cost of the plans.  “We programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don’t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.”  “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, joins a growing list of companies readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturers ramping up stocks in preparation for potential border delays. Aston is signing deals with supplier DHL to allow for the use of ports other than Dover - Britain’s busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any customs delays - and has authorised its supply chain team to make air freight bookings.  The government has said it will prioritise the movement of key supplies such as medicines if the flow of goods is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said.  Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delays imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturers face different challenges. Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), Britain’s favourite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, builds only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (F.N) counts Britain as its third-largest market but makes no cars there.  Meantime Nissan (7201.T), which builds around half a million cars at its northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (7203.T) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicles to the rest of the EU. While mass-market brands are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end players such as Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customers could absorb extra costs and are more concerned about customs checks and delays.  Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, as interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer criticised politicians on both sides of the Channel. “Both the European and the UK politicians are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. State Department officials recently met multiple times with North Korean counterparts in Hanoi and discussed planning a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday.  U.S. officials discussed the schedule for the second Trump-Kim summit while in contact with North Korean officials in the Vietnamese capital city, fuelling speculation that Vietnam could host the event, the Munhwa Ilbo reported, citing unnamed diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington.  Vietnam has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, with North Korea maintaining a diplomatic office in Vietnam, and has the symbolic significance of a communist country that has reformed its economy, the newspaper reported.  A spokesperson for the U.S Embassy in Seoul did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Sunday, Trump told reporters in Washington that the United States and North Korea are “negotiating a location” for a second summit.  “It will be announced probably in the not too distant future,” Trump said. “They do want to meet and we want to meet and we’ll see what happens.”  While the two sides had “a very good dialogue” and the American president had “indirectly” communicated with Kim, Trump said sanctions would be enforced until more progress is made. In a nationally televised New Year address, Kim said he is willing to meet Trump again anytime to achieve their common goal of denuclearising the Korean Peninsula, but warned he may have to take an alternative path if U.S. sanctions and pressure against the country continued. “I am always ready to sit together with the U.S. president anytime in the future, and will work hard to produce results welcomed by the international community without fail,” Kim said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shops suffered a fall in December sales for the sixth straight year, a survey showed on Saturday, hurt by brittle consumer confidence and the ongoing shift to buying online. Accountancy and business advisory firm BDO said its monthly High Street Sales Tracker (HSST) showed in-store high street sales fell by 1.9 percent year-on-year in December - an eleventh consecutive month of decline. BDO said online sales grew 11.9 percent in December. “As retailers suffered the worst year for well over a decade for in-store sales, it’s clear that consumer confidence is low,” said Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO. “Shoppers have exercised extreme caution or shopped strategically online, seeking out discounts rather than visiting bricks and mortar stores or making impulse purchases,” she said, adding 2019 was set to be another challenging year for the sector. Analysts have highlighted a disconnect between supportive economic factors - with consumers’ real earnings growing and employment levels high - and an apparent reluctance to spend, partly due to uncertainty over Britain’s departure from the European Union in March 2019. Britain’s economic growth slowed to a crawl at the end of 2018 and the housing market is stalling, according to data published on Friday, less than three months before Brexit day. Clothing chain Next (NXT.L) is the only major listed UK retailer to have reported on Christmas trade so far. It fared better than expected, with a late surge in online demand offsetting steep falls in store sales. A raft of retailers are due to update next week, including Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Morrisons (MRW.L) and Debenhams (DEB.L).

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that Britain would be in uncharted territory if her Brexit deal is rejected by parliament later this month, despite little sign that she has won over sceptical lawmakers. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 but May’s inability so far to get her deal for a managed exit through parliament has alarmed business leaders and investors who fear the country is heading for a damaging no-deal Brexit. May said the vote in parliament would be around Jan. 15, as expected, contrary to reports she could delay it. May has already delayed the vote once, in December, when it became clear she would lose unless extra reassurances from the EU were agreed. Describing what would happen if she was defeated, May told the BBC: “We’re going to be in uncharted territory. I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we’ll see in parliament.” Amid the uncertainty over Britain’s next steps - which range from leaving without a deal to not leaving at all - a poll showed more Britons want to remain a member of the EU than leave, and voters want to make the final decision themselves. May’s party itself is divided over her deal, with many fearing that an insurance policy designed to avoid the re-emergence of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely. One of those leading that opposition, lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, said in a newspaper article that it was “wishful thinking” that time away from parliament over the Christmas holiday could persuade him to change his mind and back the deal. The Northern Irish party that props up May’s minority government called on her to stand firm in demanding that the EU changes its “poison” backstop provision on Ireland’s post-Brexit border. With the parliamentary debate on her deal due to begin on Jan. 9, May said there was still work to do to get reassurances over the backstop from the EU. She also promised parliament would have a greater say in the rest of the Brexit process and warned that rejecting her deal could prevent Britain’s exit. “Don’t let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good, because the danger there is actually we end up with no Brexit at all,” May said. She did not answer whether she would, if defeated, make a second attempt to get the deal passed by parliament. May also did not directly respond, when asked, if she was leading the country toward a no-deal Brexit.  On Tuesday, her government could face a bid to block an unmanaged exit when a group of lawmakers try to amend budget legislation to deny funding for some no-deal preparations unless they are approved by parliament.  It is unclear yet whether the amendment has enough support to pass.   May repeated her objections to holding a fresh public vote on the deal.  She said a second referendum would be divisive, and also highlighted the lack of time available to hold a new referendum.  “Practically, actually you couldn’t get a referendum in time before the 29th of March - you’d be talking about extending Article 50,” she said, referring to the two-year exit notice Britain sent to the EU in March 2017.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government has told Renault (RENA.PA) to provide more details on compensation paid to senior executives via a Dutch holding company jointly owned with alliance partner Nissan, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. Le Maire made the demand after France’s CGT trade Union voiced concerns over payments made to certain high-ranking executives via the alliance’s Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch venture and called for more transparency at the carmaker. Corporate governance inside the alliance has come under tight scrutiny after Japanese authorities arrested its chairman Carlos Ghosn in mid November on suspicion of under-reporting his income at Nissan (7201.T). The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder.  Le Maire told CNews television that the government had written to Renault’s leadership to “request all details necessary for full transparency on these compensation payments”.  “I want to know who these payments were made to, if they were declared and therefore whether ... the Renault board was aware of them.” A Renault spokesman did not immediately return calls and messages seeking comment. The Ghosn affair, sparked by a Nissan internal investigation, has rocked the auto industry, strained Nissan’s ties with Renault and complicated diplomatic relations between Japan and the France. A one-time titan of the auto industry, Ghosn, who has since been ousted as Nissan chairman, is also accused of aggravated breach of trust in transferring personal investment losses to Nissan. Ghosn denies all the charges against him. Renault board members including the French state’s representatives have yet to be given full access to Nissan’s findings against Ghosn, which have been shared with Renault’s lawyers. The restrictions are justified by judicial confidentiality, the company has said.  Executives from both carmakers - including Renault General Secretary Mouna Sepehri, who oversees communications with the board - had looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through RNBV or other shared finances, Reuters revealed last month. Those two efforts were ultimately abandoned. Immediately after Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest, however, Nissan told Renault privately it was extending its internal investigation to cover their Dutch-registered alliance holdings. Ghosn will make his first public appearance in seven weeks at a Tokyo court on Tuesday after he requested an open hearing for an explanation on his continued detention. Ghosn’s son, Anthony, told the Journal du Dimanche that Japanese prosecutors wanted his father to sign a confession..

The Torrance Police Department said officers responded to a shot-fired call at the location found multiple gunshot victims. Two men were taken to hospital, two opted to seek their own medical attention, and three were pronounced dead at the scene. “Investigators are currently conducting a follow-up investigation, and are working to identify the suspect(s) involved,” the department said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday the United States had detained a Russian citizen, a day after Moscow arrested the former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan on suspicion of spying. Whelan was taken into custody by Russia’s Federal Security Service on Dec. 28. His family have said he is innocent and that he was in Moscow to attend a wedding. The ministry said the United States detained Russian citizen Dmitry Makarenko on Dec. 29 on the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean, and had transferred him to Florida. “... Makarenko, born in 1979, has arrived on Saipan Island with his wife, underage children and elderly parents. He was detained by FBI personnel at the airport right after his arrival,” the ministry said. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow could not immediately be reached for comment. A State Department spokesman in Washington referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond. Papers filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida show Makarenko was accused in June 2017 by federal prosecutors of conspiring with another man, Vladimir Nevidomy, to export defence articles including night-vision scopes from the United States to Russia without U.S. approval. Makarenko, who was listed as a resident of Vladivostok, was declared a fugitive from U.S. justice in Jan. 2018. Nevidomy, a resident of Hallandale Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty in June 2018 and was sentenced to 26 months in prison, the court papers showed.  The accusations from both sides could further complicate a strained relationship between Moscow and Washington, despite the professed desire of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to build a personal rapport. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week that Washington had asked Moscow to explain Whelan’s arrest and would demand his immediate return if it determined his detention is inappropriate. Britain cautioned Russia on Friday that individuals should not be used as diplomatic pawns. Whelan also holds a British passport. The Russian ministry said in its statement that Moscow diplomats had not been able to reach Makarenko in Florida and said Washington had yet to explain his detention.  Before Moscow gave details of Makarenko’s detention, experts had speculated that Moscow could exchange Whelan for Russian nationals held by Washington. Commenting on that possibility, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday: “I see no reasons to raise this issue in context of exchanges. We should undergo all the procedures needed in this situation,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying. Whelan’s Toronto-based twin brother David Whelan told Reuters on Saturday that U.S. embassy officials met with his sibling on Wednesday and would visit him again next week. “He seemed as well as can be expected in a Russian jail. He was missing a lot of personal necessities, like toilet paper, that aren’t provided,” David Whelan said in a telephone interview. “So the State Department has helped us set up an account ... so that he can buy the supplies that he needs.” Reporting by Maxim Rodionov in Moscow and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Editing by Alison Williams and Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-russia-usa-detention/moscow-says-fbi-arrested-russian-a-day-after-it-detained-ex-u-s-marine-idUKKCN1OZ09Y,2019-02-08,,Moscow says FBI arrested Russian a day after it detained ex-U.S. Marine
2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s BSI cyber defence agency on Saturday defended its role in responding to a far-reaching data breach, saying it could not have connected individual cases it was aware of last year until the entire data release became public. The government said on Friday that personal data and documents from hundreds of German politicians and public figures including Chancellor Angela Merkel had been published online, in what appeared to be one of Germany’s biggest data breaches. The incident has shocked the establishment and prompted calls for security agencies to clarify whether any security deficiencies they were aware of had been exploited, and if they could have acted sooner to head off the breach. The BSI said in a statement that it was contacted by a lawmaker in early December about suspicious activity on their private email and social media accounts. “Only by becoming aware of the release of the data sets via the Twitter account ‘G0d’ on Jan. 3, 2019, could the BSI in a further analysis on Jan. 4, 2019 connect this case and four other cases that the BSI became aware of during 2018,” it said. “At the beginning of December 2018, it was not foreseeable that there would be more cases.” The BSI said on Friday all but one of the seven parties in the lower house had been affected. German media said that party was the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD).     Last year, lawmakers said a powerful cyber attack had breached the foreign ministry’s computer network. Security officials have blamed most previous breaches of data security on a Russian hacking group, while the Kremlin has consistently denied involvement in such incidents. After the latest data breach, Justice Minister Katarina Barley said she was considering stricter security requirements for software makers and Internet platform operators. “We are examining the extent to which stricter legal provisions are useful and necessary here,” she told weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag, according to a pre-released article. Authorities were investigating all possibilities, including espionage, one government source said on Friday, adding that it was unlikely any single person could have compiled the massive amounts of data that had been released. The BSI said investigations so far had showed the data breaches predominantly concerned private and personal accounts, but that it is responsible for the operational protection of government networks.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s chief executive Tim Cook has his work cut out in China this year: the iPhone maker faces the looming threat of a court-ordered sales ban, the uncertain outcome of trade war talks and the roll-out of a new 5G network, where it finds itself behind rivals like Huawei and Samsung. The complex outlook raises a challenge for Apple as it looks to revive its China fortunes after weakness there sparked a rare drop in its global sales forecast, knocked $75 billion from its market valuation and roiled global markets. Cook told investors that the main drag on the firm’s performance in China had been a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the country’s economy, exacerbated by the impact of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. “We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” he said. Chinese shoppers told Reuters another element had been key: the high price-tag on Apple’s flagship phones. Analysts said the firm faced a brewing storm of challenges: an economic slowdown, stronger rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] bringing out comparable tech at lower prices and bubbling patriotic sentiment amid the trade war. A Chinese court has also issued a preliminary injunction banning some Apple phones, part of a legal battle with chip maker Qualcomm Inc. This ban, potentially hitting iPhone models from the 6S through the X, has yet to be enforced. On Thursday a local industry body, the China Anti-Infringement and Anti-Counterfeit Innovation Strategic Alliance, called on Apple to heed the court order and not “trample the Chinese law by leveraging its super economic power and clout.” Apple declined to comment on the group’s statement but has previously said it believes its current phones comply with the Chinese court’s order.  “These are tough times for Apple in China,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint, adding the iPhone could see its market share slip to 7 percent this year in the face of stronger local rivals and worry about the sales ban. Apple’s market share in the third-quarter of 2018 was around 9 percent, and has dipped from above 14 percent in 2015, overtaken by local rivals like Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Apple vs Huawei: tmsnrt.rs/2GWXNEf Another question mark for Apple is its 5G strategy in China, where the U.S. firm is not expected to have a 5G-enabled phone until 2020, behind rivals like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp and Samsung Electronics. China is looking to push ahead with its rollout of a faster 5G network, with a pre-commercial phase this year and a commercial network in 2020. Some are looking to make an early bet on the technology. Huawei is planning a 5G phone mid-year, while Xiaomi is aiming for the third quarter. Samsung is expected to unveil a 5G phone in the first half of the year. Industry insiders, however, said Apple would likely hold off until the fall of 2020 to have its own 5G-enabled phone, a strategy that would bypass the untested early period of the technology, but which could mean Chinese shoppers delay iPhone purchases or buy another brand that switched to 5G earlier. “I’ll definitely be paying attention to 5G functionality when I buy my next phone,” said Wu Chengjun, a graduate student in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone X. With the exception of Huawei, which makes it own 5G chips, Qualcomm is providing the technology to many of the major phone makers releasing 5G handsets this year. “If you’re a [phone maker] looking for a ‘super cycle’ [of sales], if you don’t have 5G, your situation won’t get any better,” Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm’s president, told Reuters in an interview. “The carrier channel is going to be incentivized to start selling 5G phones in the second half” of 2019, he said. But there are risks integrating 5G too early into high-end smart phones because the technology requires deeply re-designing the devices with multiple new antennas. Given spotty coverage in 2019, gambling on a new design before networks are mature could be more risk than reward, said Darryn Lowe, a Bain & Co partner who works with the wireless industry. “When you think about 5G, it’s a heck of a lot more complicated than an aluminum strip running around the phone,” he said.  And other shoppers and analysts said Apple’s more cautious approach to 5G made sense and that the firm would not likely lose out too much to rivals by delaying its launch. Apple’s decision to wait to adopt 4G until after other makers didn’t hurt it. But that was when consumers commonly purchased a phone every two years, a cycle that has elongated and might prompt buyers to want a more “future proof” device, said Glenn Lurie, CEO of Synchronoss Technologies and the former head of AT&T’s wireless unit. “If you’re going to walk in to make a 30-month decision, the concept that I’ve already got 5G built in, it feels pretty good,” Lurie said. But buyers such as Li Hongzhuo, 22, a student in Beijing, said he was interested in 5G, but it wouldn’t be the deciding factor and he preferred to wait until the technology was tried and tested. “Typically my needs for my phone are high speeds for downloading videos or transferring files from chat apps. This will get faster (with 5G), but 4G already satisfies my needs,” said Li. “I won’t really consider switching my phone until 5G has been operating stably on the market for some time without any bugs – or unless they stop offering 4G.” Reporting by Adam Jourdan and Josh Horwitz in Shanghai, Cate Cadell in Beijing, Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Heekyong Yang in Seoul; writing by Adam Jourdan and Stephen Nellis; Additional reporting by Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Nick Zieminski",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-apple-china-5g/court-battle-trade-war-and-5g-spell-tough-2019-for-apple-in-china-idUKKCN1OY1UF,2019-02-08,,"Court battle, trade war and 5G spell tough 2019 for Apple in China"

2019-02-08,"LONDON, Jan 4 - Lending to British consumers grew at its slowest pace in nearly four years in November and the number of mortgage approvals fell, Bank of England data showed, adding to signs of a pre-Brexit slowdown in the economy. The annual growth rate in unsecured consumer lending slowed to 7.1 percent from 7.4 percent in October, the BoE figures showed, the slowest increase since March 2015. There have been signs from many retailers that British consumers reined in their spending in late 2018, faced with the possibility of the country leaving the European Union without a deal to smooth the economic shock. Prime Minister Theresa May faces a make-or-break vote on her Brexit plans in the week of Jan. 14, little more than two months before Britain is due to end its membership of the EU. A survey of Britain’s dominant services industry published on Friday suggested the economy grew by just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with the previous three months, as uncertainty about Brexit mounted. The BoE said the number of mortgages approved for house purchase fell to 63,728 in November, the lowest figure since April and down from 66,709 in October. The figure was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Britain’s housing market weakened in 2018 with major mortgage lenders reporting price growth at a five-year low. Nationwide said earlier on Friday that prices fell in December by the most in monthly terms since mid-2012 and rose at their slowest annual pace in nearly six years.    The BoE data showed net mortgage lending, which tends to lag behind approvals, at 3.453 billion pounds in November, up from 4.089 billion pounds in October. BoE Governor Mark Carney warned last month that in the event of a “disorderly” departure from the EU — which is not the central bank’s base-case scenario — house prices could slump by 30 percent as part of a broader economic shock. The central bank has also said demand for consumer lending had been subdued by Brexit uncertainty, but might ramp up again once the situation is clearer. Figures for November alone showed a 924 million-pound net increase in consumer lending, slightly weaker than economists’ forecasts. The BoE also said net gilt purchases by foreign investors totalled 2.387 billion pounds in November compared with a revised lower 5.014 billion pounds in October and 8.649 billion pounds in November 2017.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices took a pre-Brexit hit in December, falling by the most in monthly terms since mid-2012 and rising by their slowest pace in nearly six years in annual terms, according to data from mortgage lender Nationwide. House prices fell by 0.7 percent from November, the biggest monthly fall since July 2012, Friday’s data showed. Compared with a year earlier, prices rose by just 0.5 percent compared with a 1.9 percent rise in November. Both readings were below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. Nationwide said it expected prices to rise at a “low single-digit pace” in 2019 but its forecast was dependent on the economy continuing to grow modestly, something that looked “unusually uncertain.” Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to overcome deep opposition in her own Conservative Party to the Brexit divorce deal she agreed with other European Union leaders, raising the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal departure from the EU in March. Britain’s housing market has weakened since the June 2016 Brexit vote, led by price falls in London. At the time of the referendum, Nationwide’s measure of house prices was rising by about 5 percent a year.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party that props up Prime Minister Theresa May’s government said on Friday that it would not support her Brexit deal but that businesses should be relaxed about leaving the EU without an agreement. “In fact we’re more alarmed about what is coming out from the EU and especially the Irish government,” the Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson said when asked if he was reassured by signals from Brussels. May still hopes to get her deal through parliament, though even members of her own cabinet admit privately that to do so she will need to make significant changes and win over lots of opposition lawmakers. If the lower house of the British parliament does not approve May’s deal then the world’s fifth-largest economy will leave the EU without one on March 29 at 2300 GMT as the date is set in law - the 2018 Withdrawal Act. The Northern Irish DUP, whose 10 lawmakers have propped up May’s minority government, has demanded she ditch the Irish backstop, something the EU and May have ruled out. The DUP’s Wilson told BBC radio that the Irish backstop was a “con trick” and added that farmers and businesses should be totally relaxed about a no-deal Brexit. “If anyone should be worried about the tariffs on beef and sheep then it should be the Irish because of course, we, the United Kingdom are net importers of food,” Wilson said. Facing the defeat of her deal last month, May postponed a parliamentary vote on it, pledging to seek “legal and political assurances” from the EU.  Those efforts appear so far to be in vain. The EU said it will not reopen the negotiation though it signalled it might offer some concessions. May needs 318 votes to get a deal through parliament yet 117 of her 317 lawmakers voted against her in a confidence vote on Dec. 12.  So she will need the support of some of the Labour Party’s 257 lawmakers or to win over swathes of her own party and the DUP.

2019-02-08,"MADRID (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon’s biggest warehouse in Spain started a two-day strike on Thursday just ahead of a gift-giving feast day, as part of a long-running campaign for better pay and conditions. The strike, called by the country’s two main unions, CCOO and UGT, may affect the delivery of products for Epiphany, the day on which three kings brought gifts to Jesus in Christian tradition, which most Spaniards mark by exchanging presents. “We have been protesting for a year. This is the richest company in the world and they want to keep profiting by taking away workers’ rights,” said David Matarraz, an Amazon worker outside the warehouse close to Madrid. Amazon workers in Germany and Poland have also walked off the job, demanding better conditions. German and Spanish workers went on strike two months ago on Black Friday, the discount spending spree that kicks off the Christmas shopping season, but Amazon said this had no impact on customer orders. Seventy percent of employees at the Spanish center joined Thursday’s strike, CCOO representative Douglas Harper said. An Amazon spokesman denied this, saying most employees at the center had been at work on Thursday.  Employees at the Madrid center earn a minimum 19,300 euros ($21,933) per year, the spokesman said. Spain’s legal monthly minimum wage is 1,050 euros.  Protesters at the site lit a bonfire and a man walked around wearing a mask showing the face of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Two French scientists who validated Jeanne Calment’s status as the oldest person ever to have lived, have dismissed claims by Russian researchers who say that she didn’t really survive to 122.  Mathematician Nikolay Zak and gerontologist Valery Novoselov claim that Calment’s daughter, Yvonne Calment, assumed her mother’s identity decades earlier. The Russians analyzed photographs, official documents and interviews to produce a body of evidence they acknowledge is circumstantial. Gerentology is the scientific study of old age. Jean-Marie Robine, one of the two French scientists who validated Calment’s age, told France Inter radio late on Wednesday that the stir being caused in France by the Russians’ findings was a “ridiculous controversy”. A spokesman for Guinness World Records, which registered Calment’s age as a world record, said they were aware of the Russians’ claims.    “Extensive research is performed for every oldest person record title we verify, which is led by experts in the gerontology field and they have been notified of the current situation,” a spokesman said.  In a paper for the Moscow Center For Continuous Mathematical Education, Zak cites discrepancies between the color of Jeanne Calment’s eyes, her height and the shape of her forehead in a copy of a 1930s identity card and in her appearance later in life.  “I do not have cast-iron proof,” Zak told Reuters on a snow-blanketed street in Moscow. “I reviewed the whole situation. There are lots of small pieces of evidence.” The second French scientist who validated Calment’s age, gerontologist Michel Allard, acknowledged that even if far-fetched, the Russians’ conclusions should be given consideration, although he rejected their suggestions of discrepancies between early images of Calment and her appearance in later life.  “In the last years of Jeanne Calment’s life, I saw so many transformations of her physiognomy,” he told France Inter.        Jeanne Calment was born on Feb 21, 1875, more than a decade before the Eiffel Tower was built and a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone.  She married a distant wealthy cousin and outlived her daughter Yvonne — who died of pneumonia in the early 1930s according to official documents — her husband and a grandson before passing away in Arles, southern France, on Aug 4, 1997.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost to insure Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) debt hit its highest point since May 2010 on Thursday, following the announcement that the U.S. pharmaceutical company would acquire rival Celgene Corp (CELG.O) in a deal worth about $74 billion (£59 billion). As the price of long-dated Bristol-Myers bonds fell, the associated credit default swap BMY5YUSAX=MG jumped 66 percent, bringing the cost to insure $1 million of the company’s debt to $23,000. The moves happened because a portion of the acquisition will be funded by debt, raising the investment-grade company’s credit risk. Bristol-Myers is currently rated A+ by S&P Global Ratings and A2 by Moody’s Investors Service.    The $74-billion deal, worth $90 billion with Celgene’s debt incorporated, is the largest healthcare acquisition on record, and will be financed in part by a $33.5-billion bridge loan, the second largest ever U.S. healthcare bridge loan, according to Refinitiv data.  Bristol-Myers “will be coming to market later this year to fund the deal with about $28 billion of new debt,” a significant addition to its current debt load of $7.3 billion, said Monica Erickson, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Group. The new debt would push the merged company’s leverage from 1.8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to 3.5 times, said Erickson.  As Bristol-Myers added, Celgene shed credit risk. Celgene is currently rated BBB+/Baa2, two notches above junk status.  “It’s good for Celgene bond holders, but not so good for Bristol-Myers bonds holders,” said Erickson.   Celgene’s longer-dated bonds rose, particularly for issues with the full amount borrowed still outstanding. A $2 billion bond coming due in 2045 151020AU8= was up 6.6 percent, and the company’s $1.5 billion 2048 bond 151020AZ7= rose 6.3 percent.

2019-02-08,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government launched a barrage of measures on its first day in office on Wednesday to crack down on crime and shrink the size of the state, sending Brazilian markets higher. Former army captain Bolsonaro, whose election in October marked a sharp swing away from three decades of centre-left governments in Brazil, took office on Tuesday saying he would free Latin America’s largest nation from “socialism and political correctness.” Taking the helm of their ministries on Wednesday, Bolsonaro’s cabinet unveiled sweeping plans to step up privatisations, toughen prison sentencing guidelines and hand control over indigenous land claims to the powerful Agriculture Ministry. Brazil's real currency BRL= strengthened 2.4 percent and the Sao Paulo Bovespa stock index .BVSP rose 3.6 percent as investors cheered pledges by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes - a former investment banker - to reduce taxes and overhaul Brazil's costly social security system. “If we have solid pension reform, we will get 10 years of growth,” said Guedes, who heads a team of orthodox economists already being likened to the ‘Chicago boys’ who radically overhauled Chile’s economy in the 1970s and 1980s.  Guedes said he planned to cut Brazil’s tax burden to 20 percent of gross domestic product from 36 percent, free the credit market from overcrowding by state banks, and reduce protectionism. Bolsonaro’s government - Brazil’s first far-right administration since a military dictatorship gave way to civilian rule in 1985 - has stirred concerns it could jeopardise human rights with a promised crackdown on crime and destabilise the sensitive Amazon biome through commercial exploitation. Fulfilling a campaign promise to his staunch supporters in the farm sector, one of Bolsonaro’s first moves in office was to decree that indigenous land claims, a source of bloody clashes on Brazil’s agricultural frontier, would be decided by the Agriculture Ministry. The gift to the powerful agribusiness sector enraged environmentalists already worried by Bolsonaro’s plans to loosen protections of the Amazon rainforest.  Brazil’s military has long been concerned with national sovereignty over the Amazon and its riches. Foreign non-governmental organizations were alarmed by a decree to monitor their activity, a task assigned to a retired general in the new cabinet. The new president was elected on a platform to clean up Brazilian politics, and has put Brazil’s top anti-corruption campaigner, Sergio Moro, in charge of a Justice Ministry beefed up to fight graft and battle organised crime. Moro, a former federal judge who spearheaded the “Car Wash” corruption trials that put former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and other high-profile politicians in jail, said on Wednesday he would help usher in a new era of law-and-order.      “The top mission given to me by the president was clear: end impunity for corruption cases and combat organised crime to reduce violent crimes,” Moro said after being sworn in. He said he plans an ambitious anti-crime bill that would stiffen prison sentences. An outspoken admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro has pledged to strengthen relations with Washington while pursuing a nationalist agenda that downplays multilateral bodies and regional trade blocs.  His inauguration was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said the United States and Brazil will jointly defend democratic values in the region. “We have an opportunity to work alongside each other against authoritarian regimes,” Pompeo said on Wednesday after discussing Venezuela with Brazil’s new Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who was picked by Bolsonaro for his admiration of Trump’s conservative nationalism. Bolsonaro’s rise to power culminates a swing to conservative rule in Latin America that has isolated leftist governments such as Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. While Bolsonaro surprised Brazil’s political establishment by surging to victory over a leftist coalition led by Lula’s Workers Party, he takes office with the lowest approval rating of any new Brazilian president, according to a Datafolha poll Tuesday. He has also yet to build a base in Congress, where he has eschewed the political horse-trading that traditionally helped Brazilian presidents govern. As a result, he may have an uphill battle to enact his agenda, which includes austerity measures to bring down an unsustainable budget deficit of about 180 billion reais (37.88 billion pounds). Many investors, however, remain optimistic that Bolsonaro’s economic team will succeed in passing reforms needed to reduce the deficit and restore confidence and growth to a slow-moving economy. One of Bolsonaro’s first steps was to decree a less-than-expected increase to the minimum wage, to 998 reais ($260) a month from 954 reais. Preferred shares in the country’s largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6.SA) jumped 14.5 percent after new Energy & Mines Minister Bento Albuquerque said the company would be partially privatised. Doing even better was gun manufacturer Forjas Taurus SA, (FJTA4.SA) whose shares rose 47.6 percent on Bolsonaro’s plan to ease gun controls, which he has argued will help Brazilians arm themselves in self defence against crime.

2019-02-08,"MAGNITOGORSK, Russia (Reuters) - Thirty-nine bodies have been pulled from under the rubble of a Russian apartment building that partially collapsed this week after an apparent gas explosion, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble.  The emergencies ministry said earlier on Thursday that 37 people had been killed. But the death toll went up to 39 when rescuers recovered another two bodies from the rubble on Thursday afternoon. Deputy Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan told Interfax there were no more bodies under the rubble and that the search and rescue operation was over.  A Reuters witness at the scene said that workers were removing debris from the site using cranes and other equipment.  Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast. It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion.  Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Treasury named Colette Bowe, a former senior civil servant and regulator, and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, until recently the head of a start-up bank, to serve on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee. Bowe, currently chair of the Banking Standards Board (BSB) industry group, will replace Richard Sharp on the FPC, which monitors risks in Britain’s financial system, from the end of March. Gadhia, who was chief executive of lender Virgin Money for more than 10 years until it was taken over by CYBG (CYBGC.L), will replace Martin Taylor at the end of June. “As chair of the Banking Standards Board, Colette has led the way in developing and embedding better standards of conduct across the banking sector,” BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a statement on Thursday. “Jayne-Anne brings deep and relevant experience in retail banking and her successful business career.” Since the 1990s Bowe has had several jobs at the top of consumer regulation, notably heading the Personal Investment Authority and Britain’s telecoms watchdog, Ofcom. As a senior civil servant in the 1980s, Bowe was drawn into a political scandal as former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and her ministers secretly competed to swing the sale of British helicopter maker Westland to either U.S. or European suitors.  Under orders from the trade and industry minister Leon Brittan and with Thatcher’s blessing, Bowe leaked a confidential legal memo to undermine defence minister Michael Heseltine’s bid to secure a European buyer for Westland. Bowe kept silent about who ordered the leak for nearly 30 years, citing the principle of confidentiality between ministers and civil servants. She once said she had “nothing but contempt for people who blab”. As chair of the BSB, which was set up in a bid to improve conduct standards at banks after a string of scandals, she told MPs last year that bankers were still too afraid to admit mistakes to colleagues. MPs have previously criticised the finance ministry for appointing too few women to the Bank’s three main monetary, financial and regulation policy committees. Bowe and Gadhia will bring the total number of female policymakers at the Bank to six, compared with 16 men.  The finance ministry said it interviewed five women and three men for the posts. Gadhia has long been an advocate for greater representation of women in senior roles in Britain’s financial services, where the four big banks all have male chief executives and chairmen. Gadhia and Bowe will at some point appear before MPs from parliament’s Treasury Committee.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (Reuters) - As Ralph Snake walked across Washington’s National Mall on Wednesday, he stopped every few feet to pick up litter that has accumulated in the once-tidy expanse of grass since a budget showdown partially closed the federal government 12 days ago. “I decided to clean up this one section, because that’s what Americans will do,” said Snake, a 64-year-old member of the indigenous Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin. Snake came to the U.S. capital to witness Sharice Davids get sworn in as one of the first two women of native American descent to become members of Congress.  The partial shutdown, which has cut off many government services, entered its 12th day on Wednesday with no end in sight. It stems from an impasse between congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives as of Thursday, and President Donald Trump, who is demanding $5.6 billion (4.5 billion pounds) in funding for a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. National parks have closed campgrounds out of fear that toilets will overflow with human waste. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working without pay. The immigration court system, already suffocating under a backlog, is largely shuttered. The prospects for an end to the showdown remained unclear, even as congressional leaders visited the White House on Wednesday.  In Washington, the 17 museums run by the Smithsonian as well as the National Zoo closed their doors on Wednesday after running out of emergency funding, leaving tourists frustrated with politicians of both parties. “It’s stupid,” said Laura Vanbragt, a 20-year-old student from Grand Rapids, Michigan. “There should just be more communication between the two, more give on both sides.” Outside the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Clint Woods and his family stood waiting for a guided tour with other visitors who were locked out of more popular venues. “It’s like two squabbling children,” Woods, 43, said of Trump and Democratic leaders in Congress. “They both think they’re right, and they’re dug in.” At Joshua Tree National Park, which is named after the spiked yucca plants that grow all over the park’s desert landscape, roads and scenic turnouts were full of cars on Wednesday but campgrounds were closed. Rock climbers Kiera Waskey, 21, and Stefan Nelson, 22, were able to camp in the park for three nights after arriving on a visit from Minnesota. “We were told that today we had to clean up camp and we can’t camp here anymore, which was a bummer,” Waskey said, standing near rock outcroppings dotted by several climbers. “I guess we take it for granted almost, these beautiful places that we have and we never thought we’d have to prepare for it (the shutdown),” he said. Public bathrooms and trash bins at the park were well kept, because volunteers were cleaning them, visitors said. The booth at the park’s entrance was closed, so visitors were able to roll in without paying an entrance fee. Frequent park visitors Marie Hoffman and Trevor Goodman, who are both 19 and students at University of California, Davis, said they noticed a lot more climbers and general visitor than they normally see at the park. “It looks like Disneyland today with just all the cars and everything, so many visitors,” Hoffman said, attributing the increased traffic to the temporary lack of an entrance fee.  Unlike in some previous government shutdowns, many national parks have remained open, though without staff to collect trash and service restrooms. Advocates have voiced alarm that an extended shutdown could cause environmental damage. “We’re very concerned about the reports we’re seeing of human waste in inappropriate places,” said John Garder, senior director of budget and appropriations for the National Parks Conservation Association. “Trash is a serious concern for wildlife.” The impact of the shutdown has reached the nation’s 62 immigration courts as well. Hundreds of judges are on furlough, and only cases of immigrants in detention are being heard. The Trump administration has expanded the system, which is run by the U.S. Department of Justice, aiming to cut down on the backlog of more than 800,000 cases, but the shutdown will complicate that effort, said Ashley Tabaddor, the president of the national immigration judges’ union. “To reschedule these cases can take several years because the judges are all booked,” she said. A Justice Department spokesman said he could not respond to a request for comment because of the shutdown. Meanwhile, some 800,000 government workers are either furloughed or working without pay until the shutdown ends. Shekina Givens, a 32-year-old Transportation Security Administration officer in Atlanta and president of the local chapter of a union that represents government employees, said she is avoiding using her credit cards and putting off some expenses. “I’m the only person that’s working in my household and paying all the bills,” she said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares lost further ground in their first trading day of 2019 on Wednesday as fears about global growth, trade wars and political instability rolled over into the new year while investors sought safety in stocks considered less risky. While sentiment had already been hit by disappointing data from China, fresh surveys showed Euro zone manufacturing activity barely expanded at the end of 2018 in a broad-based slowdown. Euro zone stocks .STOXXE ended down just 0.3 percent and the pan European STOXX 600  closed 0.2 percent lower after trimming earlier heavy losses as Wall Street turned positive.     Paris .FCHI notched up the biggest drop, down 1 percent, while Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan all managed to move back into positive territory by the close. Turnover on the STOXX 600 was extremely low, though - with just 75 percent of the 90-day average daily volume traded - as many investors remained on holiday. “Investors are still cautious about the outlook for the second largest economy in the world,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “China has been undergoing an economic slowdown for years, and the manufacturing report underlined the point that the second largest economy in the world is cooling.”  Some analysts drew comfort from the tentative turnaround in market fortunes on the day as investors tried to put 2018 - which saw the worst stock market performance in a decade - behind them. “Bruised by the volatility of Q4 2018, investors aren’t yet grabbing the chance to buy the dip with both hands, but it is at least encouraging to see a continuation of the move higher instead of the relentless selling of the past few weeks,” said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.  Still, the laggards of 2018 took some of the biggest hits. Miners, autos and banks fell, and investors dumped the cyclical parts of the market most exposed to a slowing global economy. The basic resources sector .SXPP was the weakest performer, dropping 1.8 percent, while autos and parts stocks fell 1.5 percent. Among individual moves, medical equipment maker Gerresheimer (GXIG.DE) dropped 5.8 percent to its lowest since July 2015 after JP Morgan cut its rating on the stock to “underweight”, according to traders. Bargain hunting in crude futures helped heavyweight oil stocks .SXEP reverse earlier losses to rise 1.1 percent on the day, while defensive stocks popular in times of economic strife - healthcare, utilities and telecom - were in favour. In Italy, market watchdog Consob suspended trading in shares of Banca Carige (CRGI.MI) while the European Central Bank appointed temporary administrators in a bid to save the struggling lender after it failed to raise capital late last year.

2019-02-08,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Six people were killed when a passenger train hit a freight trailer that had blown off a wagon coming the other way on a bridge linking Denmark’s two main islands on Wednesday, officials said. The train with 131 passengers on board was heading towards the capital, Copenhagen, when it hit the trailer. Apart from the dead, 16 people were injured but were not in critical condition, police said. The accident happened shortly before 7.35 a.m. (0635 GMT) during a severe storm that hampered the rescue operation on the 18-km (11-mile) Great Belt Bridge between Zealand and Funen, Denmark’s two major islands.  “This morning’s tragic accident on the Great Belt Bridge with many killed and wounded has shaken us all,” Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen tweeted.  “Ordinary Danes on their way to work or on the way home from Christmas holidays have had their lives shattered.” A preliminary investigation by the Danish Accident Investigation Board showed a trailer had blown off a freight wagon onto the oncoming tracks, a spokesman said.  “There was a very, very loud bang and then the train stopped,” a witness who had been onboard the train with his daughter told broadcaster TV2. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven blamed the weather. “Terrible train accident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark as a result of the storm Alfrida. Our thoughts are with the injured and with the families and relatives of the dead,” he tweeted. TV footage showed a severely damaged freight trailer adorned with the logo of Danish beer maker Carlsberg. Crates of beer could be seen inside. A train operated by DB Cargo, the logistics arm of Germany’s Deutsche Bahn which carries goods from Carlsberg’s Fredericia brewery to Copenhagen, was involved in the accident, a Carlsberg spokesman said. DB Cargo was on site and “doing its utmost to support the investigation”, Deutsche Bahn said in a statement. A spokesman said the trailers were fastened to the railcars with metal rods, a system in use across Europe. The bridge remained closed for trains while car traffic in both directions resumed. Danish rail operator Banedanmark said it did not expect rail traffic by to resume before Thursday. The Great Belt, part of a route that links Denmark and Sweden to Germany, carries around 21,000 train passengers and more than 27,000 vehicles each day.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is expected to announce in the next few days that it has poached media finance veteran Spencer Neumann from Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) to be its chief financial officer, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Neumann will start at Netflix in early 2019, the source said. Earlier on Monday, Activision Blizzard said in a regulatory filing that it intended to fire Neumann for an unspecified reason. Neumann has served in a variety of finance roles including at Walt Disney Co (DIS.N). He replaces David Wells, who in August said he planned to step down after 14 years at the streaming media giant. The source said Netflix, which is making more of its own films and series, would like its next CFO to be based in Los Angeles with a focus on production finance. Wells is based northern California. Activision in its regulatory filing said that it intended to terminate Neumann “for cause unrelated to the company’s financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures.” It said that Neumann had been placed on paid leave.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - At least eight people were injured, one seriously, when a vehicle ploughed into crowds celebrating New Year’s Day in Tokyo early on Tuesday. A police spokesman said the driver had been detained and national broadcaster NHK said the man had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.  He was identified as Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, from Osaka, a major city about 400 km (250 miles) southwest of Tokyo, NHK said. NHK said the suspect had initially described the incident as an “act of terror” but later said the attack was in retaliation for capital punishment. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in the popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. “I can’t believe it, this is a place I’m familiar with, so it’s very shocking,” said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area. The street was closed to vehicles at the time of the incident to accommodate the large number of pedestrians making their way to the shrine for New Year’s prayers. TV pictures of the scene on Tuesday showed a grey coloured light vehicle used in the attack, positioned across the street. The front of the vehicle was badly damaged and dozens of police and rescue officials were at the scene. The suspect fled from the scene and assaulted a passerby before he was captured 20 minutes later, NHK said. About 20 litres of kerosene were found in the vehicle. “I learned about the incident later. But I shudder to think. If the incident had happened five minutes later, I would’ve been involved,” a woman who walked past the scene shortly after the incident told NHK. In a similar attack in 2008, a man who said he was tired of life drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Tokyo before jumping out and stabbing several people. At least seven people were killed and a dozen injured.

2019-02-08,"BELFAST (Reuters) - The Northern Irish party that props up Britain’s minority government will hold Prime Minister Theresa May to her commitment to secure changes to the divorce deal struck with the European Union, its leader said on Monday. With less than three months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, May plans to hold a vote on her deal in mid-January, after pulling it from parliament this month after admitting its ratification would be defeated.  She is first seeking “assurances” from EU leaders over the so-called Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between the British province and EU-member Ireland that her Northern Irish allies and members of her own party oppose. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster reiterated that her party required changes to the actual withdrawal agreement but said they would work with the government to “achieve a better deal”. “For our part, we want to leave with a sensible deal which works for the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland in particular but also our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland. We want an orderly exit which implements the referendum result,” Foster said in a statement.  “We have been consistent throughout the negotiations that Great Britain is Northern Ireland’s main market therefore, any deal which will undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom single market, will not have DUP support.”  Northern Irish business groups have overwhelmingly come out in favour of May’s draft agreement, including the contentious backstop. Foster said the DUP was mindful of people in all sectors, who she said were frustrated with the pace of negotiations and the lack of certainty.   “We share the frustration. As politicians, we have a duty to look to the long-term impact of any deal on our core industries. That’s where our energies will be focused in the coming days,” she said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will spend more than 100 million pounds chartering extra sea ferries to ease cross-Channel congestion if the United Kingdom fails to secure a trade deal before leaving the European Union next year. Just three months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world’s largest bloc, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising — the nightmare scenario for many businesses, which are now planning for an economic shock. Extra ships will be needed to work new routes across the Channel in the event that the main French terminal of Calais and Britain’s Dover and Folkestone are clogged up by customs checks. Currently, Britain’s membership of the EU means that trucks drive smoothly through border checks within the bloc. But in a no-deal Brexit, even a few minutes’ delay at customs for each truck would be likely to mean vehicles backing up at ports and queuing on feeder roads on both sides of the Channel. To ease a potential backlog, the government has awarded three contracts to provide additional freight capacity on routes from English south-coast ports including Poole, Portsmouth and Plymouth. They comprise one worth 47 million pounds with the French firm Brittany Ferries, a 47 million pound deal with the Danish shipping company DFDS and a 14 million pound contract with Seaborne Freight. The leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat party, Vince Cable, called the move “complete madness” and said public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome. The contracts were not put out to tender. The Department for Transport said it was responding to a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”. About 16,000 trucks pass between Dover and Calais every day, transporting everything from perishable food to medicines and the industrial goods needed to keep factories running. “This extra capacity is a small but important element of the DfT’s no-deal planning,” the Department for Transport said in a statement. “While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached, the department is helping ensure the rest of government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios.” Earlier this month, the government announced that all government departments must step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, including putting 3,500 armed forces personnel on standby to deal with any disruption.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The number of British citizens applying for Irish passports rose by 22 percent in 2018, Ireland’s foreign office said on Monday, more than doubling the total of annual applications since Britain voted to leave the European Union. Almost 100,000 eligible Britons sought to hang onto their EU citizenship via a passport from their nearest neighbour this year, up from 81,000 last year and 46,000 in 2015, the year before the Brexit vote led to a sharp rise in applications.  Anybody born in the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland, or with an Irish parent or grandparent, is entitled to an Irish passport - a total of about 6 million British citizens. They are able to hold dual citizenship. Registrations for Irish passports in Northern Ireland, whose citizens can hold both an Irish and British passport as the province is part of the United Kingdom, rose by 2 percent in the year to the end of December. With three months left until the UK is due to leave the EU on March 29, the draft divorce deal reached between both sides is floundering ahead of a planned vote in the British parliament next month, opening up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a trade deal to calling it off entirely.

2019-02-08,"PARIS/BORDEAUX (Reuters) - France’s “yellow vest” demonstrators kept numerous roads across the country blocked on Saturday as groups of protesters marched in city centres, but the anti-government backlash was more dispersed and muted than in previous weeks. Driven by anger over a perceived squeeze on household income, the movement has shaken Emmanuel Macron’s presidency and hurt retailers and other businesses after the spontaneous protest against fuel taxes gave way to riots in early December.  Sporadic clashes with police broke out as protesters in several cities including Bordeaux and Nantes were pushed back by teargas and stun grenades, though the turnout across France dwindled on the seventh Saturday of demonstrations.  Official estimates were not yet available, though French TV channel LCI, citing unnamed sources, put the turnout at 12,000, well below the nearly 40,000 last week.  In Paris, where protests turned violent in early December, police said by early evening that they had detained some 57 people after 800 demonstrators took to the streets, down from at least 109 arrests last week with a similar number of protesters.  People wearing high-visibility vests mingled among shoppers and tourists and chanted “Macron, resign!” on the Champs Elysees avenue, home to boutiques that were smashed and bore the brunt of lootings at the height of the violence. Major stores, including some that were boarded up on recent weekends, opened their doors.  Other demonstrators converged west of the capital near the headquarters of 24-hour news channel BFM TV, where scuffles ensued; and several cars were set on fire outside the offices of the Parisien newspaper in the evening, though it was initially unclear who had torched them and whether it was directly linked to the protests.  In Toulouse, where like in Bordeaux crowds exceeded 2,000 people, protesters set bins on fire and some hurled yellow paint at police. Several highway tolls and motorway slip-roads across France were blocked, operator Vinci said, and traffic on some of the roads leading to Spain was severely backed up.  SIT-INS The protests — 18 months into Macron’s tenure, and his bid to reshape the economy — are expected to rumble on into January despite his attempts to defuse them, including by backtracking on planned fuel tax hikes and signalling wage rises for the poorest workers. “We will continue until we win, until Macron backs down and gives us what we deserve: more purchasing power, less taxes, a healthy life without having to tighten and tighten and tighten the belt at the end of every single month,” a protester in Nantes who only gave her name as Virginie told Reuters.  “My son asks me for something and (I say) no I can’t, but I work so it is not normal.” Stemming in part from a feeling of disconnect between more provincial and rural areas and an urban elite Macron has come to represent for his critics, the protest has spawned sit-ins at roundabouts and roadsides as people dig their heels in, demanding more measures to help household incomes.  The “yellow vest” protests —  named after the garments that drivers have to carry in their cars in case of emergency — have been concentrated on Saturdays, after first erupting on Nov. 17 following a campaign spread on social media. But protesters were also being urged to turn out on Dec. 31, including for a show of force on the Champs Elysee, where revellers tend to gather for New Year’s celebrations and a firework display. The city council has said festivities, usually boxed in by a heavy police presence, would go ahead as planned. Macron is expected to address voters in a traditional New Year’s Eve televised message.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is not trying to keep Britain in and wants to start discussing future ties the moment the UK parliament approves Brexit, partly to focus on its own unity ahead of May elections, the head of the bloc’s executive said.       “It is being insinuated that our aim is to keep the United Kingdom in the EU by all possible means. That is not our intention. All we want is clarity about our future relations. And we respect the result of the referendum.” Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag in an interview. Juncker said the EU was ready to start negotiating a new deal with Britain right after the British parliament approves the divorce deal. A vote is now due in the week starting Jan. 14.   He also said Britain should get its act together. “And then tell us what it is you want,” he said.  “I am working on the assumption that it will leave, because that is what the people of the United Kingdom have decided,” he added, refusing to be drawn into whether Britain would hold a second Brexit vote. “That is for the British to decide.” On other challenges facing Europe, Juncker said he was watching closely U.S. President Donald Trump on trade. “I trust him for as long as he keeps his word. And if he no longer keeps it, then I will no longer feel bound by my word either,” Juncker said of tensions between the EU and Washington around car tariffs. He said he felt EU citizens were increasingly growing apart, another problem to tackle ahead of Europe-wide parliamentary elections in May.  “We have to ensure that these rifts do not become too deep,” Juncker said. “We must not imply that the populists are right ... they are just loud and do not have any specific proposals to offer on solving the challenges of our time.” He said Europe had to stand united “in combating the trolls and hacker groups from China or Russia” that could seek to sway the European vote.  He expressed doubt about EU state Romania, which takes over the bloc’s rotating presidency from Jan. 1, but struggles with corruption and bitter divisions. “The government in Bucharest has not yet fully understood what it means to take chair over the EU Member States ... Romania’s internal situation is such that the country cannot act as a compact unit in Europe,” Juncker said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. commanders planning for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria are recommending that Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State be allowed to keep U.S.-supplied weapons, four U.S. officials said, a move that would likely anger NATO ally Turkey. Three of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the recommendations were part of discussions on a draft plan by the U.S. military. It is unclear what the Pentagon will ultimately recommend to the White House.  Discussions are still at an early stage inside the Pentagon and no decision has yet been made, the officials said. The plan will then be presented to the White House in the coming days with U.S. President Donald Trump making the final decision. The Pentagon said it would be “inappropriate” and premature to comment on what will happen with the weapons.  “Planning is ongoing, and focused on executing a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces while taking all measures possible to ensure our troops’ safety,” said Commander Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman.The White House did not comment.  Trump last week abruptly ordered a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, drawing widespread criticism and prompting Defence Secretary Jim Mattis’ resignation. The U.S. officials said Trump’s announcement has upset U.S. commanders, who view his decision as a betrayal of the Kurdish YPG militia, which has led the fight to eradicate Islamic State from northeastern Syria. Ankara views the YPG as an extension of a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey. Turkey has threatened to launch an offensive against the YPG, raising fears of a surge in violence that could harm hundreds of thousands of civilians.   The United States told the YPG that they would be armed by Washington until the fight against Islamic State was completed, one of the U.S. officials said. “The fight isn’t over. We can’t simply start asking for the weapons back,” said the official. The proposal to leave U.S.-supplied weapons with the YPG,  which could include anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and mortars, would reassure Kurdish allies that they were not being abandoned. But Turkey wants the United States to take the weapons back, so the commanders’ recommendation, if confirmed, could complicate Trump’s plan to allow Turkey to finish off the fight against Islamic State inside Syria. The Pentagon keeps records of the weapons it has supplied to the YPG and their chain of custody. But, the U.S. officials said, it would be nearly impossible to locate all of the equipment. “How are we going to get them back and who is going to take them back?” one of the officials asked. The debate over whether to leave weapons with the YPG coincides with Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton’s visit to Turkey and Israel next week for talks on Syria. In May 2017, the United States started distributing arms and equipment to the YPG for an offensive against Raqqa, the de facto capital of the self-declared caliphate that Islamic State  overran in Iraq and Syria in 2014. The United States told Turkey that it would take back the weapons after the defeat of Islamic State, which has lost all but a few slivers of territory in northeastern Syria. “The idea that we’d be able to recover them is asinine. So we leave them where they are,” said a U.S. official. A person familiar with the discussions of the U.S. withdrawal plan said the White House and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan would oppose the proposal to allow the YPG to keep its U.S.-supplied weapons. The recommendation “is a rejection of Trump’s policy to withdraw from Syria,” said the person, who asked not to be further identified. Turkey has said weapons supplied to the YPG have in the past ended up in the hands of its Kurdish separatists, and described any weapon given to the insurgents as a threat to Turkey’s security. A phone call between Trump and Erdogan led to the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria.  In the call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials said. Instead, in the course of the conversation, Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Turkey the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s declaration in a phone call with Tayyip Erdogan that he was pulling U.S. troops from Syria has stunned Turkey and left it scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border. In the phone call two weeks ago, Trump had been expected to deliver a standard warning to the Turkish president over his plan to launch a crossborder attack targeting U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeast Syria, U.S. officials say. Instead, in the course of the conversation Trump reshaped U.S. policy in the Middle East, abandoning a quarter of Syrian territory and handing Ankara the job of finishing off Islamic State in Syria. “Trump asked: ‘If we withdraw our soldiers, can you clean up ISIS?’”, a Turkish official told Reuters. He said Erdogan replied that Turkish forces were up to the task. “Then you do it,” Trump told him abruptly. To his national security adviser John Bolton, also on the call, Trump said: “Start work for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria.” “I have to say it was an unexpected decision. The word ‘surprise’ is too weak to describe the situation,” said the official, one of five Turkish sources who spoke to Reuters about the Dec. 14 call between the two leaders. Trump’s decision was also a shock in Washington, where senior administration officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, tried for days to change the president’s mind, U.S. officials said. When Trump made clear he would not back down, Mattis and a senior official coordinating the fight against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, both resigned. On a visit to a U.S. air base in Iraq this week, Trump said that military commanders had repeatedly requested extensions for the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria - requests that he finally turned down because he said Islamic State was largely beaten. “We’ve knocked them silly. I will tell you I’ve had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them out also, and he’ll do it,” he told American troops.      For Turkey, Trump’s decision offers opportunity and risk. Ankara has complained bitterly for years that the United States, a NATO ally, had chosen the Kurdish YPG militia as its main partner on the ground in Syria against Islamic State. Turkey says the YPG is a terrorist group, inseparable from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged an insurgency in southeast Turkey in which 40,000 people have been killed. The U.S. withdrawal potentially frees Turkey’s military to push the YPG back from 500 km of border without risking a confrontation with American forces. It also removes a main cause of this year’s diplomatic crisis between the two countries. But it also opens up an area of Syria far larger than anything Turkey had expected to fill, potentially pitting it against not just Kurdish forces but also the Damascus government - which is committed to regaining control of all of Syria - and its Russian and Iranian backers. The YPG on Friday asked the Syrian government to take over the town of Manbij, which the Kurdish militia currently controls with U.S. support, to protect it from Turkish attack. And if Turkish forces are to take on Islamic State in its last pocket of Syrian territory near the Iraqi border, they would first have to cross 250 km of territory controlled by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.  “Erdogan got more than he bargained for,” said Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute. “He had asked the U.S. to drop the YPG, but not withdraw from Syria”. Erdogan has for years backed rebels who once hoped to  topple Bashar al-Assad, but the Syrian president’s survival has been assured by support from Tehran and Moscow even though the north and east - including Syrian oilfields - remain beyond Assad’s control for now. As it takes stock of the new challenge, Turkey is launching intensive talks with Washington and Moscow. Ankara expects U.S. military officials to visit within days, as well as Bolton and possibly the U.S. special Syria envoy, James Jeffrey. Turkey’s intelligence chief and defence and foreign ministers are also due in Moscow on Saturday, the spokesman for Erdogan’s AK Party said. “Of course it will be difficult. The whole issue needs to be planned again from the start,” a Turkish security official said. A U.S. official said military planners were drafting plans that could see a withdrawal over the course of several months. One of the proposals under consideration is a 120-day withdrawal period, according a person familiar with discussions. Washington is also grappling with what to do with weapons it provided to the YPG militia and promised to take back after the campaign against Islamic State ended.  Turkey says the weapons must be collected so they are not used against Turkish troops, but U.S. officials say they cannot disarm their own allies when the fight is not yet over. Erdogan announced last week Turkey is postponing its planned military operation against the YPG in light of Trump’s decision. The Turkish military has already carried out two incursions into north Syria, backed by pro-Turkey Syrian rebels. In 2016 they targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters, and earlier this year took control of the YPG-held Afrin region. But Ankara and its Syrian rebel allies alone do not have the capacity to take over the whole region which the United States  is abandoning, Cagaptay said. Turkey’s priority therefore may be to secure its southern frontier. “Distancing the YPG from the border and wiping out these elements is of critical importance,” the security official said. He stressed the need for careful coordination over who should fill other areas which departing U.S. forces will leave, and warned of problems ahead if agreement could not be reached. “Is it a big victory for Turkey?” another official said. “I’m not sure right now.” Additional reporting by Tulay Karadeniz in Ankara and Humeyra Pamuk and Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Dominic Evans and Angus MacSwan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/syrian-surprise-how-trumps-phone-call-changed-the-war-idUKKCN1OR0PN,2019-02-08,President Donald Trump's declaration in a phone call with Tayyip Erdogan that he was pulling U.S. troops from Syria has stunned Turkey and left it scrambling to respond to the changing battlefield on its southern border.,Syrian surprise: How Trump's phone call changed the war
2019-02-08,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army said it had deployed forces to Manbij in northern Syria on Friday after the Kurdish YPG militia urged Damascus to protect the town, where U.S. forces operate, from the threat of a major Turkish offensive. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said the government forces had entered a strip of territory at the edge of Manbij, not inside the town itself, creating a barrier with Turkey-backed fighters nearby. Manbij, which U.S.-backed forces captured from Islamic State in 2016, has emerged as a focal point of new tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces whose presence has effectively deterred Turkey. After the Syrian army announcement, Turkey-backed Syrian rebels stationed in nearby territory said they had begun moving together with Turkish forces towards the town in readiness for “the start of military operations to liberate” it. A witness said convoys of Turkey-backed insurgents, with armoured vehicles and machine guns, were moving towards the frontline with the town. Manbij, where U.S. troops have a military base, is held by a local militia allied to the YPG which Turkey deems a security threat.  A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters that U.S. troops had not changed their positions in Manbij and dozens still remained. The official said they had not seen Syrian military forces inside Manbij but rather on the outskirts of the city. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has vowed to crush the YPG, said Turkish officials would visit Russia - Assad’s most powerful ally - on Saturday and discuss Syria. He indicated Turkey was not in a hurry to launch an offensive.  Trump’s abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria has alarmed the Kurdish-led fighters who have fought Islamic State alongside them for years.   Kurdish leaders are scrambling for a strategy to protect their region stretching across the north and east, where the presence of some 2,000 U.S. troops has so far deterred Turkey. A deployment of Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, would complicate any offensive by Turkey and its Syrian rebel proxies.   U.S. military support for the Kurdish fighters has infuriated Turkey, which sees the YPG as an extension of the PKK movement that has been waging an insurgency inside Turkey for decades.   Syrian state media circulated a video showing dozens of soldiers marching on a countryside road, chanting for President Bashar al-Assad. The military statement said troops had raised the national flag in Manbij on Friday and would guarantee security “for all Syrian citizens and others present.”   A resident inside the town said nothing had changed and he had not seen any such flags. The YPG said on Friday its fighters had withdrawn from Manbij before to fight Islamic State elsewhere.  “We invite the Syrian government, to which we belong, as people, land and borders, to send its armed forces to take over these positions and protect Manbij in the face of Turkish threats,” it said. In November, Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij after reaching a deal that includes the YPG exiting the town.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Royal Mail apologised on Friday after historians pointed out that a stamp design it planned to issue to commemorate the D-Day landings in France in fact showed U.S. troops going ashore thousands of miles away weeks earlier. The stamp, part of a series of 11 to mark the 75th anniversary of the June 1944 landings, was part of a special programme for 2019 to showcase the “Best of British”.  “The stamp issue will be a timely commemoration of all those who participated and will use images from the day itself,” the Royal Mail said before the blunder was revealed. However, after a preview of the stamp was put on the Royal Mail’s Twitter feed, historians and others noticed that it actually showed U.S. troops wading ashore in May 1944 in Dutch New Guinea, now Indonesia, from a landing craft that was not involved in the D-Day landings.  “We sincerely apologise that our 2019 Special Stamp preview included a design which had been incorrectly associated with the D-Day landings,” Royal Mail said on Twitter. “This stamp design has not been printed. We would like to reassure our customers that this image will not be part of the final set.”  (This story has been corrected in the first paragraph to show U.S. troops landed weeks, not months earlier) Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-stamps-dday/royal-mail-sorry-for-d-day-landings-stamp-blunder-idUKKCN1OR12R,2019-02-08,,Royal Mail sorry for D-Day landings stamp blunder
2019-02-08,"AL ASAD AIR BASE, Iraq (Reuters) - President Donald Trump made a surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday, his first trip to a conflict zone nearly two years into his presidency and days after announcing a  pullout of American troops from neighbouring Syria. Trump was looking for some positive headlines after several  days of turmoil over his decisions to withdraw the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, pull out half of the 14,000-strong contingent  in Afghanistan, and push out Defence Secretary James Mattis two  months earlier than planned for criticizing his policies. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and speaking at the Al Asad Air Base west of Baghdad, Trump defended the withdrawal from Syria and said it was made possible by the defeat of Islamic State militants.  “Our presence in Syria was not open ended and it was never intended to be permanent,” he told troops wearing camouflage fatigues in a hangar at the base. He said some troops “can now return home to their families.” Many Republican and Democratic lawmakers have heaped scorn on Trump over his Syria policy, saying the fight against Islamic State is far from over and the withdrawal leaves allies in the lurch.  One of those critics was Mattis, who said in a candid resignation letter last week that his views did not align with Trump’s, particularly on the treatment of U.S. allies.  Mattis had planned to leave at the end of February, but Trump forced him to go on Jan. 1 after his resignation letter was made public.  Trump has also drawn fire from some in the U.S. military for not having visited U.S. troops in conflict zones since taking office in January 2017, particularly after he cancelled a trip to a World War One cemetery in France last month due to rain.  While there has been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeats last year, some 5,200 U.S. troops train and advise Iraqi forces still waging a campaign against the militant group.                  Trump spent a little more than three hours in Iraq. On his way home, he stopped for about an hour and a half at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where he shook hands and posed for pictures with some of the hundreds of troops lined up inside a hangar. After Ramstein, Trump headed back to Washington.  Trump was supposed to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi but in the end they only spoke by telephone.  Abdul Mahdi’s office said there was “a disagreement over how to conduct the meeting.” Iraqi lawmakers said the prime minister declined Trump’s request to meet him at the military base.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the meeting could not be arranged due to security concerns and the short notice of the trip, but she said they had a “great call” and that Abdul Mahdi accepted Trump’s invitation to the White House in the New Year. The unannounced visit in Iraq followed in the footsteps of two of Trump’s predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, who both made surprise trips to see troops.  For security reasons, the visits are usually kept secret until after the president arrives. A small group of aides and Secret Service agents, and a pool of reporters, were with Trump and the first lady on the overnight flight from Washington. Trump said his main security concern was for the first lady. While in Iraq, Trump also spoke to military commanders and the U.S. ambassador. Sanders said they “came up with a powerful plan that will allow us to continue our path to total victory” over Islamic State. Unlike Syria, Trump said he had no plans to withdraw from Iraq.  Trump has had an uneven relationship with America’s military. He did not have to serve during the Vietnam War after being diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels.  As president-elect, Trump was drawn to the brawn of the armed forces and stacked his first Cabinet with generals, many of whom have since left his administration.  Trump has also wanted to end protracted U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts, and to force allies to pay more of the costs that he says fall disproportionately on American taxpayers, a point he made again on Wednesday.  Trump spoke to troops gathered in a dining hall festooned with holiday decorations and teased soldiers about their favourite football teams. To reporters, he lamented the wear and tear of overseas conflicts. “It’s time to get our young people out,” Trump said. “And I’ve been signing plenty of letters and I don’t like sending those letters home to parents saying that your young man or your young woman has been killed. “I don’t like doing it. We’ve been doing it long enough.” Reporting by Steve Holland; editing by Mary Milliken, Alistair Bell, Tom Brown and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump/in-a-first-trump-makes-surprise-visit-to-u-s-troops-in-iraq-idUKKCN1OP171,2019-02-08,"President Donald Trump made a surprise Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday, his first trip to a conflict zone nearly two years into his presidency and days after announcing a  pullout of American troops from neighbouring Syria.","In a first, Trump makes surprise visit to U.S. troops in Iraq"

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s CGT union has called for more transparency at Renault (RENA.PA) and its Dutch holding company and asked the French government, one of the carmaker’s shareholders, to try to shed light on its workings, a CGT representative said on Thursday.  Renault, and its alliance with Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), has been in the spotlight after the partnership’s architect Carlos Ghosn was arrested in mid-November in Japan amid allegations his Nissan income was understated.  The CGT wrote to French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire in early December questioning the way Renault had handled the affair and to denounce a lack of transparency at RNBV, a joint Renault-Nissan holding company based in the Netherlands, FranceInfo reported on Thursday.  A CGT spokesman confirmed the union had reached out to Le Maire and to Renault’s deputy CEO Thierry Bollore, adding it was calling for clarity on additional wage payments made via RNBV to an unidentified member of the French carmaker’s executive committee.  “Workers have no information about RNBV,” the CGT spokesman said.  Spokesmen for Le Maire and for Renault declined to comment. The French state owns 15 percent of Renault.  Executives from both carmakers in the Renault-Nissan alliance looked at least twice at legal ways to pay Ghosn undisclosed income through the partners’ shared finances, including via RNBV, Reuters reported earlier in December. The two efforts discussed were ultimately abandoned.      Ghosn, who remains Renault’s chairman and chief executive but was ousted as Nissan’s chairman, has been in a Tokyo jail since mid-November.  He had been expected to possibly go free on bail last Friday but was re-arrested by Japanese prosecutors on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million (£13.12 million) in personal investment losses.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Earnings at China’s industrial firms in November dropped for the first time in nearly three years, as slackening external and domestic demand left businesses facing more strain in 2019 in a sign of rising risks to the world’s second-largest economy.  The gloomy data points to a further loss of economic momentum as a trade dispute with the United States piles pressure on China’s vast manufacturing sector and as firms, bracing for a tough year ahead, shelve their investment plans, executives say.  Industrial profits fell 1.8 percent in November from a year earlier to 594.8 billion yuan (68.2 billion pounds), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website on Thursday. It marked the first decline since December 2015. The fall in profits largely reflected slowing growth in sales and producer prices as well as rising costs, He Ping of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data. Economists expect earnings to continue to worsen next year, weighed down by smaller gains in industrial prices due to cooling demand, with some even warning of the risk of deflation.  “Soft economic indicators such as producer prices, industrial output and orders all point to further pressure on corporate profitability,” said Nie Wen, a Shanghai-based analyst at Hwabao Trust, adding that firms’ revenues have been hit by shrinking demand. “Industrial profits next year might very well post a 5-10 percent decline on average.” In November, China’s factory price growth slowed to the weakest pace in two years as domestic demand lost further momentum. “Survival is paramount for us (next year) – we will be more cautious with our investments,” Jiang Ming, chairman of Henan-based Tianming Group that has businesses in healthcare, construction and finance, told Reuters. “We also need to maintain better cashflows and save our ammunition to prepare for the tight, tough and difficult days ahead.” China’s economy expanded at the slowest pace last quarter since the global financial crisis, hit by a years-long deleveraging campaign, cooling property market and a trade dispute with the United States, and is expected to cool further next year.  The growing pressure has prompted the government to roll out a range of measures to juice up demand. In a key annual economic conference held this month the country’s top leaders said they will ratchet up support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and keeping liquidity ample, while promising to push forward trade negotiations with the United States. At the beginning of this month, U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce delaying a planned U.S. tariff hike on Jan. 1 as they negotiate a trade deal.  Yet there is uncertainty whether the two sides can bridge their differences over a myriad of issues - including trade and intellectual property rights - to reach a durable pact.  Earnings growth at China’s industrial firms has been cooling  since April this year as factory price gains slowed on the back growing strains in the global economy. The bitter trade war with the United States has also pressured overall output and demand in a blow to business investment plans.  For the first eleven months, profits at industrial firms rose 11.8 percent from the same period a year earlier to 6.1 trillion yuan, slowing from a 13.6 percent increase in January-October. In the same period, earnings growth at state-owned industrial enterprises also cooled.  Upstream sectors such as oil extraction, coal and metal mining still commanded the lion’s share of profit gains in the 11-month period but again their growth softened in November.  Profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 333 percent in the first eleven months of the year, easing off from a 371 percent jump for January-October. “The next drag on profits would likely come from upstream sectors where raw material prices have been sliding fast,”  Hwabao Trust’s Nie said. With the arrival of winter, industrial output has taken a hit as the government intensifies a crackdown on pollution to restrict production in smoke-belching factories.   China’s top steelmaking city Tangshan asked steel mills earlier this month to cut extra output during December 9 and 31, which is an additional reduction on top of that ordered during the winter heating season. All of this pointed to more bad news for businesses next year. “We expect the downtrend in industrial profit growth to extend into 2019 given weakening domestic demand, the continued credit downcycle and an escalation in the China-US trade conflict,” Nomura analysts said in a note to clients.

2019-02-08," (This December 1 story has been refilled to correct typographical errors in paragraphs 16 and 22) By Shoon Naing and Poppy McPherson YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar youth activist and television host Thinzar Shun Lei Yi would once have called herself one of Aung San Suu Kyi’s greatest fans. Now, she is one of her most vocal critics. The 27-year-old belongs to a small but high-profile group of liberal activists, many former die-hard Suu Kyi supporters, who are growing increasingly disillusioned with the administration they voted into power with sky-high hopes three years ago. “I lost my idol, I’m confused, frustrated and lost,” said Thinzar Shun Lei Yi, who hosts an ‘Under 30’ talk show on a popular local website. “Most of the activists and youths are now thinking: ‘What is next’, ‘What will happen?’, ‘What can we do?’ At this stage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is going her own way and nobody can intervene, and she won’t listen to civil society organisations,” she said, using the honorific for women in Myanmar. While Suu Kyi continues to inspire devotion among many ordinary Burmese, the emergence of a dissenting youth movement – driven by anger over her handling of ethnic minorities, including the Muslim Rohingya, as well as curbs on the media and civil society – presents a new challenge for her administration. At stake is the future of Myanmar’s transition towards democracy after years of military rule. With a general election looming in 2020, the country’s first civilian government in decades is confronted by growing divisions among activists who once coalesced around her National League for Democracy party. NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt said the party was trying to win over young people, increasing the budget for education and supporting vocational training programmes. “The youth and the people expected a lot from our government,” he said. “We couldn’t live up to their expectations, we admit. But we are doing our best.” Suu Kyi took power in 2016 after a landslide election win, vowing to continue democratic reforms and end the country’s long-running civil wars. Since then, the administration has come under pressure over its response to a military crackdown against the Rohingya minority that the United Nations has described as “ethnic cleansing” with “genocidal intent”, as well as faltering peace talks with ethnic armed groups and a stagnating economy. Activists say the civilian government has also become increasingly authoritarian, failing to use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap colonial-era laws used to stifle dissent, while tightening restrictions on civil society.  In recent months, they have staged several protests, including an anti-war march in the commercial capital of Yangon in May that ended in scuffles. A total of 17 people were charged with unlawful protest, including Thinzar Shun Lei Yi. Their trial is ongoing. “Sensitive issues are banned, and protesters arrested and beaten,” she said. “The National League of Democracy, the party using the name of democracy, must respect democracy and human rights.” According to free speech organization Athan, which means ‘Voice’ in Burmese, 44 journalists and 142 activists have faced trial since the Suu Kyi government took power. They include Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were sentenced to seven years in prison in September after being convicted of breaking the colonial era Official Secrets Act. The journalists are appealing their conviction to the country’s High Court, citing evidence of a police set-up and lack of proof of a crime. Suu Kyi said in September their jailing had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The government says Myanmar’s courts are independent. Athan’s founder, poet and activist Maung Saung Kha, was among the protesters charged alongside Thinzar Shun Lei Yi in May. Four months later, in September, they both helped organise another demonstration, this time for free speech.  Facing the crowd, Maung Saung Kha – who is still an NLD member – donned the orange shirt traditionally worn by his party’s lawmakers and draped a green jacket resembling military garb over it. Armed with a copy of the state-run daily newspaper The Mirror, he began beating journalists gathered nearby.  “The government has failed to use its power to protect people’s rights,” he told Reuters.  Myo Nyunt, the party spokesman, said the government was cooperating with non-governmental organisations, but their activities needed to be examined case-by-case. “If it is not related to security or not a divisive issue among ethnics, we accept them,” he said. “We are going forward to democracy so we acknowledge the role of NGOs, but we have concerns that NGOs are being influenced by sponsors instead of being independent.” While she has no control over the military, Suu Kyi has faced international criticism for failing to defend the Rohingya, more than 730,000 of whom fled a sweeping army crackdown in western Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The operation was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces. Myanmar denies almost all the allegations of atrocities made by refugees, saying the army was carrying out a legitimate campaign against terrorists. While many among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority revile the Rohingya, the young activists offer a rare sympathetic voice. “We acknowledge Rohingya. We totally denounce the fact that they are referred to as ‘Bengali’,” said Maung Saung Kha, referring to a term commonly used in Myanmar to imply the Rohingya are interlopers from Bangladesh, despite a long history in the country. “We haven’t seen any acknowledgement or punishment for the things that happened,” he said. “The refugees will not come back as long as these people think of them as less than humans, and that it is not a crime to kill them.” Khin Sandar, another young activist facing unlawful protest charges, spent months campaigning for the NLD ahead of the 2015 election but lost faith in Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rakhine crisis.  Her family was affected in a wave of communal violence in 2012, when not only Rohingya but members of the Kaman Muslim minority, who also face discrimination but unlike the Rohingya are considered Myanmar citizens, were driven from their homes. They live in crowded internal displacement camps outside the Rakhine state capital Sittwe and are subjected to severe restrictions on movement. In a speech after last year’s violence, Suu Kyi said all residents of Rakhine “have access to education and healthcare services without discrimination”. “My own nephew and nieces are still living in the Sittwe camps and they don’t have those rights,” said Khin Sandar. “I was shocked. How can she say that in her speech?” Afterwards, she said, she quit her job as researcher for an NLD lawmaker. While the youth activists represent only a small segment of Myanmar society they are increasingly influential in the grassroots activism scene, while their protests and public comments have attracted significant attention from media and from their vast social media followings. Mostly in their 20s and 30s, they highlight the gulf between Myanmar’s young population – the median age is 27 – and its ageing leadership, comprised of mostly men in their 60s and 70s. “Myanmar is a very conservative country, these young people especially from Yangon are now challenging that,” said Myat Thu, a political analyst from the Yangon School of Political Science. “In order to have a revolution of ideas, not many people need to know. They will spread it gradually.” Reporting by Shoon Naing and Poppy McPherson; Editing by Alex Richardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-activists/lost-idol-new-wave-of-myanmar-youth-activists-look-beyond-suu-kyi-idUKKCN1O02WQ,2019-02-08,,Lost idol - New wave of Myanmar youth activists look beyond Suu Kyi
2019-02-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi political and militia leaders condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise visit to U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday as a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty, and lawmakers said a meeting between Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi was cancelled due to a disagreement over venue. Sabah al Saadi, the leader of the Islah parliamentary bloc, called for an emergency session of parliament “to discuss this blatant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and to stop these aggressive actions by Trump who should know his limits: The U.S. occupation of Iraq is over.” The Bina bloc, Islah’s rival in parliament and led by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, also objected to Trump’s trip to Iraq. “Trump’s visit is a flagrant and clear violation of diplomatic norms and shows his disdain and hostility in his dealings with the Iraqi government,” said a statement from Bina. Abdul Mahdi’s office said in a statement that U.S. authorities had informed Iraq’s leadership of the president’s visit ahead of time. The statement said the Iraqi prime minister and U.S. president talked by telephone due to a “disagreement over how to conduct the meeting.”  Iraqi lawmakers told Reuters that the pair had disagreed over where their planned meeting should take place: Trump had asked to meet at the Ain al-Asad military base, an offer which Abdul Mahdi declined. Trump’s visit comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran, as Washington seeks to counter Iran’s sway in the Middle East. The formation of Iraq’s government has stalled as well amid intensifying discord between the Islah and Bina blocs. Falih Khazali, a former militia leader turned politician allied with Bina, accused the United States of wanting to increase its presence in Iraq. “The American leadership was defeated in Iraq and wants to return again under any pretext, and this is what we will never allow,” he said. Bina said Trump’s visit “places many question marks on the nature of the U.S. military presence and its real objectives, and what these objectives could pose to the security of Iraq.” While there has been no full-scale violence in Iraq since Islamic State suffered a series of defeats last year, some 5,200 U.S. troops train and advise Iraqi forces still waging a campaign against the militant group. Islah is headed by populist Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr has long opposed the U.S. presence in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. He led two uprisings against U.S. forces in Iraq and is one of the few Shi’ite leaders to also distance himself from Iran.  Iraq’s Shi’ite militias, also known as the PMF, many of which are supported by Iran, oppose the presence of U.S. troops in the region. The PMF was made formally part of the security forces this year after helping the military defeat Islamic State in Iraq in 2017. Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the powerful Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia said on Twitter, “Iraqis will respond with a parliamentary decision to oust your (U.S.) military forces. And if they do not leave, we have the experience and the ability to remove them by other means that your forces are familiar with.”  Some Iraqis, however, were less concerned with the U.S. president’s visit.  “We won’t get anything from America,” said Baghdad resident Mohammad Abdullah. “They’ve been in Iraq 16 years, and they haven’t given anything to the country except destruction and devastation.” Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed and Raya Jalabi; additional reporting by Maher Nazih; editing by Chris Reese",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-iraq/iraqi-lawmakers-criticise-trump-visit-as-blow-to-iraqi-sovereignty-idUKKCN1OP1AQ,2019-02-08,,Iraqi lawmakers criticise Trump visit as blow to Iraqi sovereignty
2019-02-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in his Christmas message to the world, urged people on Tuesday to see differences as a source of richness instead of danger and called for reconciliation in places torn apart by conflict. Francis delivered the traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message to tens of thousands of people in a sunny St. Peter’s Square from the same basilica balcony where he first appeared as pontiff shortly after his election on March 13, 2013. Security has been tight around the Vatican for the Christmas season, with military jeeps stationed at key access routes and tourists undergoing metal detector and bag searches. Last week police in southern Italy arrested a Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter’s. In his address, in what appeared to be a reference to the shrill political climate in a number of countries, Francis called for “fraternity among people with different ideas, yet capable of respecting and listening to one another”. Francis, the first pope from Latin America, alluded to polarisation over migration, saying God wanted “love, acceptance, respect for this poor humanity of ours, which we all share in a great variety of races, languages, and cultures”. “Our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger; they are a source of richness,” he said. Francis, 82, called for the resumption of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians to “undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 years has lacerated the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love”. He urged the international community to work for a political solution in Syria and said he hoped a truce brokered in Yemen’s civil war could bring relief to a population exhausted by violence and famine. The Argentinian-born pope also called for social harmony in Nicaragua and Venezuela, both racked by internal political conflicts. The millions of refugees or displaced people in Africa who are in need of humanitarian assistance and food security should not be forgotten, he said. In Ukraine, he called for “a peace respectful of the rights of every nation”. Ukraine’s relations with Russia have been locked in a downwards spiral since Moscow annexed Crimea 2014 and backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

2019-02-08,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan authorities on Tuesday collected 43 bodies from a government compound in the capital Kabul that was targeted by a suicide bomber and extremists armed with assault rifles on Monday, officials said. The attack began when the suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden car in front of a government building that houses a public welfare department in an eastern neighbourhood of Kabul.  Some of the attackers rampaged through the building of the Ministry for Martyrs and Disabled Persons taking workers hostage, and others fought a prolonged gun battle with local security forces. Health ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said so far 43 bodies and 10 injured had been transported by ambulances from the attack site. One policeman was killed and three militants were gunned down during seven hours of fighting inside the government compound. Afghan forces evacuated over 350 civilians from the building before calling off the operation on Monday night. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the complex attack that was identical to previous attacks by Taliban insurgents on government offices, foreign buildings, and military bases. Abdullah Abdullah, the government’s chief executive, blamed the Taliban for the attack.  “The ‘Taliban’ crime syndicate must know that with every attack they carry out against our people our resolve is further strengthened to eliminate them. Their conduct is a disgrace to the very notion of peace,” he said in a tweet. However, the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement that the group was not involved in the attack on Monday. The latest assault came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was considering pulling out at least 5,000 of the 14,000 U.S. troops currently deployed in Afghanistan.  The possibility of thousands of U.S. troops leaving has triggered confusion and panic in the Kabul government and foreign missions who fear that sudden withdrawal would lead to the return of the Taliban regime, who are fighting to expel foreign forces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law in Afghanistan. But Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff who was in Afghanistan on Christmas Eve, was quoted by local news channels as saying that the mission for troops in Afghanistan continues without any changes. “There are all kinds of rumours swirling around,” said Dunford while addressing hundreds of U.S. troops gathered Monday at a base in Afghanistan. “The mission you have today is the same as the mission you had yesterday,” he said.  The Taliban controls nearly half of Afghanistan and are more powerful than at any time since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. They carry out near-daily attacks, mainly targeting security forces, government officials and civilians as human shields.  Even as diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict have intensified, fighting between the Taliban and Afghan forces backed by foreign troops has not subsided. In the north, Taliban fighters killed a district police chief and kept up the pressure to seize control over parts of Faryab province on Tuesday. Karim Youresh, a spokesman for the Faryab police said the police chief died in clashes in the Garziwan district that also killed 16 insurgents.      In eastern Nangarhar province, the Taliban killed eight pro-government militia members and injured 12 during clashes in the Bati Kot district.  Attaullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the Nangarhar governor said the Taliban attacked several security checkpoints, with the battles continuing for hours. Ten Taliban were killed and dozens were wounded. Afghan forces also killed a Taliban field commander in western Herat province on Monday. Mullah Javed, a Taliban military commission chief, and three aides were killed in an air strike in the Zawul district, said a police official in Herat on Tuesday. Air and ground operations have surged in recent weeks as General Scott Miller, who took command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in September, has pressed government forces to go on the attack to strengthen their hand in any talks.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey began reinforcing its positions on both sides of its border with Syria on Sunday, a Reuters witness said, as Ankara and Washington agreed to coordinate a U.S. withdrawal from Syria. The heightened military activity comes two days after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would postpone a planned military operation on Kurdish YPG militia east of the Euphrates river in northern Syria following the U.S. decision to pull out. He also said Turkey would take over the fight against Islamic State militants.  The Turkish presidency said Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call on Sunday agreed to establish military and diplomatic coordination to prevent an authority vacuum from developing as the United States withdraws. Earlier in the day, footage from broadcaster TRT World showed some Turkish convoys entering Syria via the Turkish border town of Karkamis, which is located some 35 km (22 miles) north of the northern Syrian town of Manbij.  The convoys are crossing into an area controlled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a Turkish ally, and are heading to the frontlines of Manbij, TRT World said. Manbij has been a major flashpoint between Ankara and Washington. In June, the NATO allies reached an agreement that would see the YPG ousted from the town but Turkey has complained the roadmap has been delayed and said Turkish forces would enter the town if the United States does not remove the Kurdish militants. The YPG has been a main U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State. Ankara says the militia is a terrorist organisation and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s. A Reuters witness saw hundreds of vehicles head to the southern border province of Kilis after leaving Hatay, another border province, around 0030 GMT on Sunday, as citizens sounded their horns to celebrate. The convoy included tanks, howitzers, machine guns and buses carrying commandos, the witness said.  Part of the military equipment and personnel are to be positioned in posts along the border while some had crossed into Syria via the district of Elbeyli situated some 45 km (28 miles) northwest of Manbij, Demiroren News Agency (DHA) reported. Reuters could not independently verify the reason for the reinforcements and Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment. Turkey, with support from the FSA, carried out two cross-border operations in northern Syria, dubbed “Euphrates Shield” and “Olive Branch”, against the YPG and Islamic State.  The military offensives were focused on areas to the west of the Euphrates and Turkey has not gone east of the river, partly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. The operations carved out de facto buffer zones, which are currently under the control of Turkey and the FSA.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - British shares dipped on Monday as world stocks fell on reports that U.S. President Donald Trump privately discussed firing the head of the Federal Reserve and a partial U.S. government shutdown. The FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.5 percent and the mid-cap index .FTMC was 0.8 percent lower, setting a bleak tone for a holiday-shortened week. Weakness in the dollar weighed on companies with a greater international presence, making them the biggest drags on Britain's main index .FTSE. HSBC (HSBA.L) slipped 1.1 percent, while GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) was 1 percent lower. Diageo (DGE.L), the world’s biggest drinks marker, and consumer goods giant Unilever (ULVR.L) were down by around 1 percent, while tobacco firms Imperial Brands (IMB.L) and British American Tobacco (BATS.L) fell 2 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Investors came back to oil stocks following sessions of steep losses in crude prices that hit oil companies. Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) managed slight gains as oil prices rose on signs the price fall may start crimping supply from the United States.[O/R] Most global markets were hit following reports that Trump discussed firing Fed chair Jerome Powell. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a tweet on Saturday that Trump had told him he had “never suggested firing” Powell.[MKTS/GLOB]     That added to nerves over a partial federal government shutdown as Democrats rejected Trump’s demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico. British indexes are on track for their worst yearly performance since the 2008 financial crisis, as jittery investors dumped shares amid concerns over Brexit, a slowdown in global economy, plunging oil prices and a trade spat between Washington and Beijing. Britain’s mid-cap index, which is more exposed to the outcomes of Brexit, has lost more than 16 percent in the year-to-date and is a little over 1 percent away from confirming a bear market with a 20 percent drop since its peak close in June. “If 2018 was the beginning of the end of the 10 year bull market, 2019 could well give stocks an additional shove to the downside,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said. Among the few news-driven moves, mid-cap gambling software company Playtech (PTEC.L) gave up 7 percent, after earlier hitting its lowest in over six years, as it flagged that a change in Italian gambling tax law would hit its 2019 core earnings. Gambling companies GVC (GVC.L), Paddy Power Betfair (PPB.I) and William Hill (WMH.L) also fell between 0.6 percent and 2.1 percent. Shares in London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) were among the top losers on the main index with a 3.9 percent dip after exchanges group Euronext (ENX.PA) announced plans to buy the owner of the Oslo stock exchange for 625 million euros. Martin Sorrell’s S4 Capital (SFOR.L) slipped nearly 3 percent on its first trading day on the London Stock Exchange’s main market.   Swimming against the tide, Whitbread (WTB.L) added 1.3 percent after it said the European Union approved its sale of Costa coffee chain to Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and announced a 500-million-pound share buyback.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Paddy Ashdown, the face of centrist politics in Britain for more than a decade and a one-time marine commando who sought to secure peace in the former Yugoslavia, died on Saturday after being treated for cancer. He was 77. Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats for 11 years up to 1999, steering it to become a campaigning force in British politics against the Conservatives and the Labour Party. The party said Ashdown died on Saturday evening after a short illness. He had recently been hospitalised with bladder cancer. It said he would be remembered as someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism. Tributes came in from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Theresa May said Ashdown served his country with distinction. “He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed,” she said in a statement.   Calling Ashdown a “true patriot”, former Conservative Prime Minister John Major said: “In Government, Paddy Ashdown was my opponent. In Life, he was a much valued friend.”      Jeremy John Ashdown was born in India on Feb. 27, 1941, the eldest son of an Indian army colonel. When he was five, his father became a pig-farmer in Northern Ireland. He was educated at an English private school where he earned the nickname Paddy because of his strong Irish accent. He spent years in the Royal Marines, and was on active service as a commando in the jungles of Borneo. He entered parliament in 1983 and was virtually unknown when he became leader of the pro-European party five years later.  However his craggy good looks - he had short sandy hair - and an earnest expression swiftly helped him to become one of his country’s most popular leaders and for a time the “Mr Clean” of British politics. He also gained in stature during the 1991 Gulf War, which allowed him to display his military experience and diplomatic skills. Ashdown’s image as a family man above the sniping of mainstream politics took a hit in February 1992 when he was forced to admit to a brief extra-marital affair with his secretary. Having stood down in 1999, he went on to become the United Nations high representative and European Union special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ashdown described himself as having few gifts other than strong willpower. “People said I couldn’t learn Chinese, they said I couldn’t run 30 miles in six hours. This sounds extraordinarily arrogant but I can’t remember a thing upon which I’ve set my mind that I didn’t succeed in doing,” he said in early 1992. He was replaced as head of the party by Charles Kennedy who enjoyed further electoral success when he opposed Blair’s decision to invade Iraq, and the party under Nick Clegg entered power in a coalition David Cameron’s Conservatives in 2010.  It has since been decimated at the polls.  Ashdown, the author of several books, had two children with his wife, Jane. He had in recent years campaigned alongside Cameron and other leaders for Britain to remain within the European Union. He warned that chaos could ensue if it voted to leave and described Brexit as “a sense of personal bereavement”.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets continued a week-long sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and comments from a top White House trade adviser casting doubt that a breakthrough on trade tensions with China can be achieved compounded investor anxiety that global economic growth is slowing. MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.5 percent, dragged down by broad declines in Europe and Asia. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks initially moved higher after Commerce Department data showed the U.S. economy is on pace to grow by 3 percent this year. But they pared their gains and then turned lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 414.23 points, or 1.81 percent, to 22,445.37, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 50.8 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,416.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 195.41 points, or 2.99 percent, to 6,333.00. Stocks fell after Trump administration trade adviser Peter Navarro told Nikkei it would be “difficult” for the United States and China to reach a long-lasting trade agreement that would end the simmering trade war between the world’s two largest economies.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from its recent highs, for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008. Broad stock markets in the United States and Europe are on pace for the worst quarter since 2008, while the Dow finished its worst week since late 2008. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation that the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless Congress authorizes money for a Mexico border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. Adding to the air of crisis was news that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was also planned. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 1 percent to $45.41 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 fell 1.5 percent to $53.52.  Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks  slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.783 percent, from 2.789 percent late on Thursday. As recently as October, yields had been at a seven-year high of 3.261 percent. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.76 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.74 percent to $1.1359.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British police on Sunday released without charge two people arrested in an inquiry into the illegal use of drones at London’s Gatwick Airport that crippled operations for three days last week. Sussex Police arrested a 47-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman from the local area late on Friday after drones were flown onto the airfield between Wednesday and Friday, forcing about 1,000 flights to be diverted or cancelled and affecting 140,000 passengers. “Both people have fully co-operated with our inquiries, and I am satisfied that they are no longer suspects in the drone incidents at Gatwick,” Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said on Sunday. The two were held after information was passed to the police by a member of the public, Tingley told Sky News. He said he was confident the arrests were justified. He said authorities were continuing to actively follow lines of investigation to catch those responsible for the most disruptive incursions from unmanned aerial vehicles seen at any major airport. A damaged drone had been recovered a close to the perimeter of the airport, he said, and it was being forensically examined, for example for clues about whether it was controlled remotely from afar or by somebody in the vicinity. No group has claimed responsibility for the disruption. “We have kept an open mind throughout and that is still the case with regards to the motivation behind these incidents,” he said. The drones were spotted at Britain’s second-largest airport on Wednesday evening, forcing it to close its runway in the run up to Christmas. Every time the airport sought to reopen the runway on Thursday, the drones returned. Authorities finally regained control over the airfield after the army deployed unidentified military technology to guard the area, reassuring the airport that it was safe enough to fly. The drones caused misery for travellers, many sleeping on the airport floor as they searched for alternative routes to holidays and Christmas family gatherings. Airlines operating at Gatwick, which is located south of London, include easyJet, British Airways and Norwegian. The airport said on Sunday it was offering a reward of 50,000 pounds ($63,275) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. It said it was expecting to operate a full schedule of 785 flights on Sunday, although a small number of delays and cancellations could occur as the airport fully recovered.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey will take over the fight against Islamic State militants in Syria as the United States withdraws its troops, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, in the latest upheaval wrought by Washington’s abrupt policy shift. The surprise announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump this week that he would withdraw roughly 2,000 troops has felled a pillar of American policy in the Middle East. Critics say Trump’s decision will make it harder to find a diplomatic solution to Syria’s seven-year-old conflict. For Turkey, the step removes a source of friction with the United States. Erdogan has long castigated his NATO ally over its support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters against Islamic State. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group and an offshoot of the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), fighting for Kurdish autonomy across the border on Turkish soil. In a speech in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey would mobilise to fight remaining Islamic State forces in Syria and temporarily delay plans to attack Kurdish fighters in the northeast of Syria - shifts both precipitated by the American decision to withdraw. The news was less welcome for other U.S. allies. Both France and Germany warned that the U.S. change of course risked damaging the campaign against Islamic State, the jihadists who seized big swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014-15 but have now been beaten back to a sliver of Syrian territory.  Likewise, the U.S.-backed militia spearheaded by the YPG said a Turkish attack would force it to divert fighters from the battle against Islamic State to protect its territory. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said American troops may continue to operate against Islamic State in Syria. The Pentagon is considering using Special Operation teams based in Iraq to target militants in Syria, the official said. The official emphasized that using special operators on the ground was one of many options being considered, was still in the planning stages and that no final decision had been made. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday in Syria’s southeast against the U.S.-backed SDF militia, employing car bombs and dozens of militants. “We will be working on our operational plans to eliminate ISIS (Islamic State) elements, which are said to remain intact in Syria, in line with our conversation with President Trump,” Erdogan said. The Turkish president had announced plans last week to start an operation east of the Euphrates River in northern Syria to oust the YPG from the area that it largely controls. This week, he said the campaign could come at any moment. But on Friday, he cited the talk with Trump as a reason to wait. “Our phone call with President Trump, along with contacts between our diplomats and security officials and statements by the United States, have led us to wait a little longer,” he said. “We have postponed our military operation against the east of the Euphrates river until we see on the ground the result of America’s decision to withdraw from Syria.” Erdogan said, however, that this was not an “open-ended waiting period” and that, due to past “negative experiences”, Ankara welcomed the United States’ statements with an equal amount of pleasure and caution. Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it says is the slow implementation of a deal with Washington to pull YPG fighters out of Manbij, a town in mainly Arab territory west of the Euphrates in northern Syria. The United States will probably end its air campaign against IS in Syria when it pulls out troops, U.S. officials have said. Erdogan’s foreign minister said the withdrawal plan would be discussed by the two countries in Washington in January. Trump maintained that IS had been wiped out, a view not shared by key allies, that Washington had been doing the work of other countries and it was “time for others to finally fight”. His defence secretary, Jim Mattis, opposed the decision and abruptly announced on Thursday he was resigning after meeting with the president. In a candid letter to Trump, the retired Marine general emphasised the importance of “showing respect” to allies that have voiced surprise and concern about the president’s decision.  Russia said on Friday it did not understand what the United States’ next steps in Syria would be, adding that chaotic and unpredictable decision-making in Washington was creating discomfort in international affairs. Several of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress, joined by opposition Democrats, urged the president to reverse course, saying the withdrawal would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran in Syria and enable a resurgence of Islamic State.  Trump has given no sign of changing his mind. He promised to remove forces from Syria during his 2016 election campaign. The roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, many of them special forces, were ostensibly helping to combat Islamic State but were also seen as a possible bulwark against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has retaken much of the country from his foes in the multi-sided civil war, with military help from Iran and Russia. IS declared a caliphate in 2014 after seizing parts of Syria and Iraq. The ultra-hardline Sunni militants established their de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe. A senior U.S. official last week said Islamic State was down to the last 1 percent of the territory it once held. The group has no remaining territory in Iraq, though militants have resumed attacks since their defeat there last year. Islamic State launched an attack on Friday on positions held by the SDF in Syria’s  southeast and the U.S.-led coalition mounted air strikes in the area, an SDF official said. Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria may not be able to continue to hold Islamic State prisoners if the situation in the region gets out of control after a U.S. pullout, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said on Friday.

2019-02-08,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is seeking $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) over its dealings with scandal-linked state fund 1MDB, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Friday, citing the finance minister. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Singapore had expanded its criminal investigation of 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs, in a sign of increasing scrutiny of the bank’s role in the suspected multi-billion-dollar money laundering scheme. Malaysian prosecutors this week filed charges against Goldman Sachs in connection with its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the first criminal action against the U.S. bank over the scandal. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales.  In addition to the bonds’ total value, Goldman Sachs should also return $1 billion to cover $600 million in fees paid to the bank and bond coupons that were “higher than the market rate”, the FT quoted Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng as saying. Lim also told the FT that reparations should at least be more than $1.8 billion, the sum Goldman Sachs has told investors it had set aside to cover potential losses related to 1MDB legal proceedings. “Their figure is $1.8 billion. Ours is $7.5 billion,” Lim said. Malaysia is not currently negotiating with Goldman, but charges filed on Monday could bring the bank to the table, Lim said.  In an emailed response to Reuters, a Goldman Sachs spokesman said the bank intended to “vigorously contest these charges”. “The 1MDB bond offerings were meant to raise money to benefit Malaysia; instead, a huge portion of those funds were stolen for the benefit of members of the Malaysian government and their associates,” the spokesman said. “Certain members of that government and 1MDB lied to Goldman about the use of proceeds from these transactions.” Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds. Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly. Malaysia has sought jail terms and billions in fines from Goldman Sachs and four individuals who allegedly misappropriated about $2.7 billion from the 1MDB bond proceeds. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that a total of about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and used to buy, among others, real estate in London and New York, expensive jewellery and artwork, and a private jet. Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources, reported that Singapore has expanded a criminal investigation into fund flows linked to 1MDB to include Goldman Sachs. Authorities in Singapore were trying to determine whether some of the $600 million in fees that Goldman earned from the three bond deals flowed to the Singapore subsidiary, the news agency said. In response to the report, the Singapore police said their criminal investigation into entities involved in 1MDB-related offence in Singapore had been going on since 2015. They did not comment further. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said in a statement: “The firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter.” Goldman Sachs (Singapore) PTE was one of the three units charged by Malaysia this week. Shares of the U.S. investment bank fell to a two-year low this week after Malaysia filed the charges.  Two former Goldman Sachs bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, have been charged by Malaysia and the U.S. Department of Justice.  Singapore has banned Leissner, the bank’s former Southeast Asia chairman, from its securities industry for life after he pleaded guilty in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The United States is also seeking extradition of Ng, who has been detained in Malaysia. Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Additional reporting by A.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive David Solomon on Friday defended the bank against criticism of its compliance and oversight related to dealings with the sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, according to a message sent to employees obtained by Reuters.  “We believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today,” Solomon said in the video message, reported earlier Friday by Bloomberg. “We will not allow the culture to be defined by those who break our rules and don’t uphold the values we hold dear.” Solomon’s comments come after the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman on Monday, the first charges to be brought against the bank, which has consistently denied wrongdoing. The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that $4.5 billion was misappropriated from Malaysia’s 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.

2019-02-08,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Police dragged Catalan separatists off roads and arrested 13 during protests on Friday as the Spanish cabinet met in the regional capital of Barcelona in both a show of central power and an attempt at negotiation. Secession supporters used tyres and rubbish to barricade highways from before dawn, and thronged the streets of Barcelona in their thousands, many flying the striped Estelada, the Catalan independence flag that bears a lone star.  Some set off flares and burned an image of King Felipe VI, while police scuffled with masked youths in chaotic scenes. Emergency services said 32 people suffered light injuries, most of them local police. More peaceful rallies continued into the evening, with thousands marching along the Passeig de Gracia shopping street, normally a draw for tourists, chanting ‘Freedom for political prisoners!’ and ‘Independence!’.  Many were wearing yellow, a colour that had become associated with jailed separatist leaders. Protester Joan Toll lamented the lack of progress after an illegal referendum and self-declaration of independence in 2017. “If you think about what has happened in the last year, we have achieved nothing. We are only being repressed more,” Toll, a 44-year-old chemist, said during one of the morning rallies.   “No one wants to see violence but people are getting tired.” The decision by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to convene his cabinet in Barcelona for the first time since the crisis began underlined Madrid’s opposition to full independence for the prosperous northeastern region of 7.5 million people.  But it could also help him to secure the survival of his minority government with the aid of Catalonian pro-independence parties in return for more autonomy. Sanchez, who has been trying to get voters on his side before a series of elections in the next two years, decreed a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage, the biggest in four decades. His Socialist party controls only a quarter of seats in the Spanish parliament and will need all the support he can muster to pass next year’s budget, to be presented in January. On Thursday, Sanchez met Quim Torra, who heads Catalonia’s pro-independence regional government. The pair agreed to a deeper dialogue despite what their governments described in a statement as their “notable differences”. Friday’s protests were patrolled by Catalonia’s local police force, unlike during last year’s illegal referendum when national officers’ use of batons and rubber bullets caused an outcry. Meeting at a 14th century building on Barcelona’s historic sea front, the cabinet approved a handful of symbolic measures for the region, including renaming an airport after Josep Tarradellas, Catalonia’s first president following the end of Spain’s dictatorship in the 1970s. It also took steps to overturn a trial which led to the execution of former Catalan leader Lluis Companys by firing squad in 1940, and freed up over 100 million euros in investment for regional infrastructure - measures the Catalan government dismissed as being of little to no value. Four jailed Catalan leaders ended a hunger strike on the eve of Sanchez’s visit and their party vowed to back his broad plan for the national budget in 2019 and 2020. Failure to approve the budget could topple the government, raising the possibility of a right-of-centre administration with stronger centralist preferences - a risk some Catalan politicians would prefer to avoid.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Yellow vest protesters, who have blocked roads across France and fought running battles with police since mid-November, will march in the former royal city of Versailles on Saturday in their fight against the government’s reforms.  The Versailles chateau and gardens, a symbol of French state power and one of Europe’s top tourist attractions, will be closed on Saturday as authorities expect hundreds of protesters in the wealthy suburb, 20 km (12 miles) west of Paris.  Jean-Jacques Brot, prefect of the Yvelines region, told reporters the demonstration would be confined to the city’s  central avenue, well away from the palace and shopping areas. Versailles was a focal point of the French revolution and the October 1789 march on the palace by the Parisian mob led to overthrown and subsequent execution of King Louis XVI.  According to a prefecture official quoted by daily Ouest France, about 1,400 people have said they would take part in the march following a call to demonstrate in Versailles by one of the yellow vest leaders on Thursday.  “We are ready in case the protest focuses on Versailles, but it could also be elsewhere,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on Thursday.  Yellow vest leaders have called for new demonstrations on Saturday and encouraged their supporters to block trucks at the borders in a sixth weekend of nationwide protests, which have led to rioting and looting in Paris and other big French cities.  Nine people have died in the protests, mostly in traffic accidents at yellow vest roadblocks. Retailers, restaurants and hotels have lost millions of revenue in the weekends leading up to Christmas as they were forced to closed their doors for fear of looting and violence.  But the movement - named after the fluorescent vests motorists are required to have in their cars - has gradually lost steam in recent weeks, with just 66,000 people taking part in protests nationwide last Saturday compared to nearly 300,000 on Nov. 17., according to interior ministry data.  President Emmanuel Macron has announced a raft of measures costing the state budget some 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) to appease the yellow vests, boosting the minimum wage and easing tax increases on pensioners. Macron has also promised to organise a broad nationwide debate about taxation in the coming three months.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The BBC said on Friday it worked in full compliance with Russia’s laws and regulations to deliver independent news after the country’s media regulator said it would carry out checks on the British broadcaster in an escalation of tensions.  Russia’s media regulator said it would carry out checks to determine if the BBC World News channel and BBC internet sites complied with Russian law, a move it described as a response to British pressure on a Russian TV channel. “As everywhere else in the world, the BBC works in Russia in full compliance with the country’s laws and regulations to deliver independent news and information to its audiences,” said a spokeswoman for the British publicly owned broadcaster.  Roskomnadzor, the Russian regulator, was responding to Britain’s media regulator Ofcom which said on Thursday that Russian broadcaster RT had broken impartiality rules in news and current affairs programmes, including coverage of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A former Canadian diplomat detained in China is being denied legal representation and is not allowed to turn the lights off at night, people familiar with the situation said, offering new details on the closely watched case. China last week detained two Canadians - Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat and an adviser with the International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank, and businessman Michael Spavor - after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s  chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on Dec 1. Canada arrested Meng at the request of the United States, which is engaged in a trade war with China. Meng faces extradition to the United States to face fraud charges which carry a maximum sentence of 30 years jail for each charge. China has given only vague details of why they have detained the two Canadians, saying they are suspected of engaging in activities that endangered China’s security, and has not drawn a direct link to Meng’s arrest.     Canada has said the detentions are unacceptable and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said China should free the men. ICG President Robert Malley has also called for Kovrig’s release.  The sources familiar with Kovrig’s case said he was taken away at around 10 p.m. (1400GMT) on Monday last week while on a street in Beijing. China formally notified the Canadian government of Kovrig’s detention two days later, at 4 p.m. (0800GMT) on Wednesday last week.  Canada only gained consular access to him at a police station on Friday last week, when he was visited for half an hour by the Canadian ambassador and two other Canadian diplomats, the sources said. “He’s not allowed to apply for bail and not allowed to see a lawyer,” said one source, adding Kovrig was being held at an undisclosed location, questioned every morning, afternoon and evening and not allowed to turn the lights off at night. He is also only allowed one consular visit a month and is not allowed to see family or loved ones. “He is physically all right but tired and stressed,” the source said. “Physically he does not appear mistreated.” Two other people familiar with the case corroborated the details. A third person said Kovrig was being confined to a single room, but despite the stress remained lucid. “Our previous comments on this case stand,” said Adam Austen, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, when asked about Kovrig. The comments on Kovrig from the sources were made in recent days. All the sources requested anonymity citing the sensitivity of the situation. Under Chinese criminal procedure law, special forms of detention and interrogation can be used for state security suspects.  Rights groups say conditions in Chinese detention facilities are often basic and can be harsh, with lack of legal representation and due process compounding worries about treatment. In 2015, a British corporate investigator accused Chinese officials of deliberately withholding medical treatment while he was in jail to try to force him to confess to a role in a scandal involving drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc. While details are unclear, it is possible Kovrig is being held in a form of detention known as “residential surveillance at a designated location”, according to Hong Kong-based Amnesty International East Asia Research Director Joshua Rosenzweig. Previous reported experiences of individuals held under this measure have included prolonged questioning, close and constant monitoring and sleep deprivation, Rosenzweig said. Both the United Nations and Amnesty have singled out this form of detention as “creating a potent environment for abuse aimed at extracting confessions, which are highly prized in China’s criminal justice system”, he said.     Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday the details of Kovrig’s detention and treatment needed to be checked, and referred specific questions to the “relevant authorities”. The Ministry of State Security, which is leading the investigation into Kovrig, has no publicly available contact details. “We have already said that China has in accordance with the law guaranteed Michael Kovrig’s lawful rights and humanitarian treatment,” Hua told a daily news briefing. Canada has been provided “necessary help” to get consular access, she said. “I don’t know whether you paid attention to the treatment or the human rights of the Chinese citizen who was illegally detained in Canada at the request of the United States?” Hua said, referring to Huawei’s Meng. A Canadian court last week granted Meng bail. Among conditions of her bail, the 46-year-old executive must wear an ankle monitor and stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.  The Canadian government has said several times it saw no explicit link between the arrest of Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, and the detentions of Kovrig and Spavor. But Beijing-based Western diplomats and former Canadian diplomats have said they believed the detention of the Canadians were a “tit-for-tat” reprisal by China. If a Canadian judge rules the case against Meng is strong enough, Canada’s justice minister must next decide whether to extradite her to the United States. If so, Meng would face U.S. charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions. No details have been revealed about Spavor’s detention. China on Thursday said a third, female Canadian was undergoing “administrative punishment” for working illegally, after Canada’s government confirmed the detention.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain sent troops to its second-biggest airport after an unprecedented attempt to cripple Christmas travel with large drones forced all flights to be cancelled on Thursday. As thousands of passengers waited at Gatwick Airport, south of London, police hunted unsuccessfully for the operators of the large drones which reappeared near the airfield every time the airport tried to reopen the runway. Police said there was no indication of a terrorism motive behind the devices, which first appeared on Wednesday night.  “The assessment earlier on today was that we wouldn’t be using firearms,” Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Tingley said late on Thursday. “This is continually reviewed so you will know and have seen that we have firearm officers deployed.” Europe’s air traffic control agency Eurocontrol said the airport would remain closed until 0600 GMT on Friday. The armed forces were also deployed to help resolve the situation.  “We are there to assist and do everything we can,” Defence Minister Gavin Williamson told reporters.  Drones were seen as recently as the last hour, a Gatwick spokesman said at about 2200 GMT on Thursday, more than 24 hours after their first sighting. The airport said flights would remain shut down for the rest of the evening on a day when 115,000 people were scheduled to pass through, many en route to seasonal breaks. Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman condemned the standoff as “irresponsible and completely unacceptable”.  Passenger Ani Kochiashvili had been bound for Georgia but spent six hours overnight sitting on a plane with her children. “I’m very annoyed because I’m with two kids, a three-month-old and three-year-old,” she told Reuters by phone among thousands camped in the terminal.  “They require a lot of space and food and changing and all that, and the airport is crazy busy so it’s challenging.”  Flights were halted at 2103 GMT on Wednesday after two drones were spotted near the airfield, triggering the biggest disruption at Gatwick since a volcanic ash cloud in 2010. Police said more than 20 units were hunting the operators near Gatwick airport, 50 km (30 miles) south of London. Transport minister Chris Grayling said it was clearly a deliberate act. “This is a commercial-sized drone,” he said. “Every time Gatwick tries to re-open the runway, the drones reappear.” Grayling temporarily lifted night-flying restrictions at other airports to ease congestion caused by diverted aircraft, Sky News reported. With a surge in public enthusiasm for drones, there has been an increase in near-collisions by unmanned aircraft and commercial jets in recent years.  The number of near misses between private drones and aircraft in Britain more than tripled between 2015 and 2017, with 92 incidents recorded last year, according to the UK Airprox Board regulator.  Richard Parker, head of air traffic management technology firm Altitude Angel, said this was the first time a major airport had been hit by such a sustained and deliberate incursion into its airspace. “It’s sophisticated, not from a technology side, but it’s organised. People have charged lots of batteries, and are deliberately trying to avoid being caught, probably by driving around to different locations,” he told Reuters.  “It really is unprecedented.” Gatwick’s Chief Operating Officer Chris Woodroofe described one of the drones as a heavy industrial model. “The police advice is that it would be dangerous to seek to shoot the drone down because of what may happen to the stray bullets,” he told BBC radio. Drone expert Peter Lee of Portsmouth University said he and others had been anticipating disruption.  “One of my concerns about today is that it may well encourage copy-cat incidents because you can achieve a high amount of disruption for a very, very low cost,” he said. It is illegal to fly drones within 1 km (0.6 mile) of a British airport boundary, punishable by five years in prison. Even after Gatwick re-opens, the backlog and disruption are expected to last for days. Gatwick said it was working with its airlines, the biggest of which also include British Airways and Norwegian, on recovery plans once the runway re-opens.  Safety was its “foremost priority”, it said.  Gatwick, which competes with Europe’s busiest airport Heathrow, west of London, had previously said Sunday would be its busiest day of the festive period. Passengers took to Twitter to share their stories.  One waiting at the airport said: “At Gatwick Airport, drone chaos, surprisingly good natured, but complete mayhem.” Reporting by Sarah Young in London and Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, Alison Williams and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-drones-gatwick/drones-paralyse-british-airport-grounding-christmas-travellers-idUKKCN1OI2TP,2019-02-08,Britain sent troops to its second-biggest airport after an unprecedented attempt to cripple Christmas travel with large drones forced all flights to be cancelled on Thursday.,"Drones paralyse British airport, grounding Christmas travellers"
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hackers working on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security breached the networks of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and IBM, then used the access to hack into their clients’ computers, according to five sources familiar with the attacks. The attacks were part of a Chinese campaign known as Cloudhopper, which the United States and Britain on Thursday said infected technology service providers in order to steal secrets from their clients. While cybersecurity firms and government agencies have issued multiple warnings about the Cloudhopper threat since 2017, they have not disclosed the identity of technology companies whose networks were compromised.  International Business Machines Corp said it had no evidence that sensitive corporate data had been compromised. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said it could not comment on the Cloudhopper campaign. Businesses and governments are increasingly looking to technology companies known as managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely manage their information technology operations, including servers, storage, networking and help-desk support.  Cloudhopper targeted MSPs to access client networks and steal corporate secrets from companies around the globe, according to a U.S. federal indictment of two Chinese nationals unsealed on Thursday. Prosecutors did not identify any of the MSPs that were breached. Both IBM and HPE declined to comment on the specific claims made by the sources. “IBM has been aware of the reported attacks and already has taken extensive counter-measures worldwide as part of our continuous efforts to protect the company and our clients against constantly evolving threats,” the company said in a statement. “We take responsible stewardship of client data very seriously, and have no evidence that sensitive IBM or client data has been compromised by this threat.” HPE said in a statement that it had spun out a large managed-services business in a 2017 merger with Computer Sciences Corp that formed a new company, DXC Technology.  “The security of HPE customer data is our top priority,” HPE said. “We are unable to comment on the specific details described in the indictment, but HPE’s managed services provider business moved to DXC Technology in connection with HPE’s divestiture of its Enterprise Services business in 2017.”  DXC Technology declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not comment on reports about specific cyber events and hacking groups.  Reuters was unable to confirm the names of other breached technology firms or identify any affected clients. The sources, who were not authorized to comment on confidential information gleaned from investigations into the hacks, said that HPE and IBM were not the only prominent technology companies whose networks had been compromised by Cloudhopper.  Cloudhopper, which has been targeting technology services providers for several years, infiltrated the networks of HPE and IBM multiple times in breaches that lasted for weeks and months, according to another of the sources with knowledge of the matter. IBM investigated an attack as recently as this summer, and HPE conducted a large breach investigation in early 2017, the source said. The attackers were persistent, making it difficult to ensure that networks were safe, said another source.  IBM has dealt with some infections by installing new hard drives and fresh operating systems on infected computers, said the person familiar with the effort.  Cloudhopper attacks date back to at least 2014, according the indictment. The indictment cited one case in which Cloudhopper compromised data of an MSP in New York state and clients in 12 countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain and the United States. They were from industries including finance, electronics, medical equipment, biotechnology, automotive, mining, and oil and gas exploration. One senior intelligence official, who declined to name any victims who were breached, said attacks on MSPs were a significant threat because they essentially turned technology companies into launchpads for hacks on clients. “By gaining access to an MSP, you can in many cases gain access to any one of their customers,” said the official. “Call it the Walmart approach: If I needed to get 30 different items for my shopping list, I could go to 15 different stores or I could go to the one that has everything.”  Representatives with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. Officials with the U.S. Justice Department and the Chinese embassy in Washington could not be reached.  A British government spokeswoman declined to comment on the identities of companies affected by the Cloudhopper campaign or the impact of those breaches.  “A number of MSPs have been affected, and naming them would have potential commercial consequences for them, putting them at an unfair disadvantage to their competitors,” she said.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will keep troops in northern Syria for now because Islamic State militants have not been wiped out, contrary to the U.S. view, and has started talks with the United States on the conditions and calendar of its withdrawal, officials said. France is a leading member of the U.S.-led coalition fighting militants in Syria and Iraq and has special forces based in the north of the country, deployed alongside Kurdish and Arab forces, and carries out air strikes against the group. A French presidency source told reporters members of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S. partner in the area, would be in Paris on Friday to hold talks with officials over the move. “He (Trump) is cutting corners, risking a serious accident ... the coalition’s spine is the United States,” the source said. France is especially sensitive to the Islamic State threat after several major deadly attacks on its soil and officials believe the militant group continues to pose a threat. Hundreds of French nationals have joined the group in Syria. President Emmanuel Macron spoke to President Donald Trump on Tuesday after learning in advance of Trump’s intentions, to try convince him not to pull out, as was the case in April when Macron convinced him to stay engaged in Syria by citing the threat of Iran in the region, the source said. French diplomats told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump’s decision to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from the region had taken Paris by surprise. U.S. officials justified the decision by saying Islamic State had been defeated. “Islamic State has not been wiped from the map nor have its roots. The last pockets of this terrorist organisation must be defeated militarily once and for all,” Defence Minister Florence Parly said on Twitter..   Europe Minister Nathalie Loiseau told C-News television that for now French troops would stay. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said Paris and its coalition allies had started talks with Washington on the timeframe and conditions for the U.S withdrawal. “The protection of the populations of northeastern Syria and the stability of this zone must be taken into account by the United States to avoid any new humanitarian drama and any return of the terrorists,” it said.  It said Paris would be careful to ensure the security of all the U.S. partners in the area, including the SDF, who fear an assault from Turkey. “We’re used to it now with the Trump administration. The devil is in the detail,” a French diplomat said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States’ sudden change of course on Syria is surprising and risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Thursday after the United States decided to withdraw from Syria. U.S. officials said on Thursday the United States would end its air campaign against Islamic State in Syria when it pulls out troops, sealing an abrupt reversal of policy which has alarmed Western allies as well as Washington’s Kurdish battlefield allies. “IS has been pushed back but the threat is not yet over. There is a danger that the consequences of this decision will damage the fight against IS and jeopardise the successes already achieved,” Maas said.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Any deal for North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal must include “completely removing the nuclear threats of the U.S.”, North Korean state media said on Thursday, in one of the clearest explanations of how North Korea sees denuclearisation. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a statement after a historic meeting in Singapore in June reaffirming the North’s commitment to “work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” and including U.S. guarantees of security to North Korea. Conflicting or vague views of what exactly “denuclearisation” means, however, have complicated negotiations that now appear stalled. “When we refer to the Korean peninsula, they include both the area of the DPRK and the area of south Korea where aggression troops including the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are deployed,” the North’s state-run KCNA news agency said in a commentary, using the initials of North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “When we refer to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, it, therefore, means removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted.” The United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea from 1958 to 1991. Since they were withdrawn, the United States has extended its “nuclear umbrella” of support to Japan and South Korea using bombers and submarines based elsewhere. North Korea rejects American calls for it to unilaterally denuclearize, and Washington should “give up its ambition” to force Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons by “high-handed practices and pressure”, the news agency said. The United States needs to understand the phrase denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula “before it is too late”, it said. A spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in - who has said Kim intends to achieve “complete denuclearisation” - declined to comment on the North Korean call to lift the U.S. nuclear protection from South Korea, saying there was “no need to respond to every KCNA comment”.     ‘SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH’ The United States has said that it will not lift sanctions on North Korea until more progress has been made toward its verifiable denuclearisation. The United States has also rejected any suggestion that it would reduce its military presence in the region as part of a deal with North Korea. But in a surprise step after the June summit, Trump announced that the Pentagon would cancel most of its largest military exercises conducted with the South Koreans. The exact definition of denuclearisation is likely to be raised again as Trump has said he is working to meet again with Kim sometime early next year. “It is a self-evident truth that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is a joint work which can never come true unless the DPRK and the U.S. make joint efforts,” KCNA said in the commentary, arguing that U.S. threats had forced North Korea to develop a nuclear deterrent. “It would be proper to say that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula means ‘completely removing the nuclear threats of the U.S. to the DPRK’, before it means the elimination of its nuclear deterrence.” At a press briefing in Washington on Tuesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said he would not “split words” when asked about whether the promise of “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” means only North Korea or the broader region. “We are focused on the denuclearisation of North Korea,” Palladino said. “We remain confident and we look forward to the commitments that Chairman Kim and that President Trump have made.” Reporting by Josh Smith; Editing by Michael Perry, Robert Birsel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-usa-denuclearisation/north-korea-media-says-denuclearisation-includes-ending-u-s-nuclear-threat-idUKKCN1OJ0IY,2019-02-08,"Any deal for North Korea to give up its nuclear arsenal must include ""completely removing the nuclear threats of the U.S."", North Korean state media said on Thursday, in one of the clearest explanations of how North Korea sees denuclearisation.",North Korea media says denuclearisation includes ending 'U.S. nuclear threat'

A day earlier the Moroccan authorities said they were seeking three more suspects after one man was arrested in Marrakech. The general prosecutor said the man in custody was a member of a militant group, but did not name the organisation.

2019-02-08,"MILAN (Reuters) - A disappointing rate outlook from the Federal Reserve dragged European shares down sharply on Thursday with several benchmark indexes hitting two-year lows on worries that tighter monetary conditions could further weigh on sluggish economic growth. The pan-European STOXX 600  index fell 1.6 percent by 0815 GMT, while Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE and France's CAC .FCHI indexes fell 1.5-1.7 percent, having all hit their lowest levels since December 2016. After raising interest rates for the fourth time this year, the Fed signalled “some further gradual” rate hikes ahead, disappointing market expectations of a more dovish message from the world largest economy’s central bank. “Concerns in the U.S. about the real estate sector and leveraged loans remain. It’s clear that interest rates cannot continue to rise for long without having important consequences for economic growth,” said Edoardo Fusco Femiano, market analyst at brokerage eToro. The sell-off in Europe was broad-based with all sectors trading in the red but cyclical sectors such as miners and banks led the steep falls, down 2.7 and 1.9 percent respectively. Defensive sectors such as pharma and utilities outperformed but nevertheless traded in negative territory.  Among individual movers, shares in aluminium company Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) fell nearly 4 percent and was among the top fallers in Europe after the U.S. said it would lift sanctions against its competitor Rusal. The news depressed aluminium prices to 16-month lows. Among other materials stocks, heavyweight miners Rio Tinto (RIO.L), BHP (BHPB.L) and Glencore (GLEN.L) all fell more than 3 percent. All but two stocks on the STOXX 600 were trading in negative territory.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Win, lose or draw? The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun signalling the end of its rate-hike cycle is not far off, winding down its sometimes Sisyphean effort to restore a semblance of normalcy to monetary policy. It has been a slow slog - the Fed has managed just nine increases in three years, and it may squeeze in just a couple more.  The Fed has picked up a few wins along the way, but it also notched some losses and draws. Here are a few: UNEMPLOYMENT - The 3.7 percent jobless rate at a 49-year low is arguably the Fed’s touchstone achievement of the post-financial crisis era.  Sure, other steps helped along the way, including the Republican tax cut and spending boost from the Trump administration. But the historic run of job growth has gone on longer than even the Fed expected. So score one for the central bank's ""lower for longer"" strategy of keeping rates pinned down, its steady guidance that any increases would be ploddingly slow, and arguably its massive balance sheet that anchored home mortgage and other important longer-term rates.  tmsnrt.rs/2R5gWrv BALANCE SHEET - At its peak, the Fed’s stash of bonds totalled an eye-popping $4.25 trillion and served as a key plank of its crisis response.  Over time this became a political liability as Republicans in particular urged the central bank to pull back from financial markets. Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen ignored their demands to sell off the assets out of concern a too-quick withdrawal from the Fed could shock global bond markets - never a good thing.  Instead the Fed is allowing its assets to mature and “roll off” by as much as $50 billion per month, so far with little apparent disruption. Over the last year it has winnowed its stash to around $3.9 trillion INTEREST ON EXCESS RESERVES - The crisis upended the Fed’s method for controlling its target interest rate, which it previously had done by raising or lowering the supply of scarce reserves in the banking system.  In the post-crisis world, the Fed’s expanding balance sheet meant banks were flush with reserves and that the Fed needed a new system. Using powers earlier authorized by Congress, banks are now paid interest on reserves parked at the Fed, creating a baseline for other, market-based rates.  Though also politically unpopular among some lawmakers, the system has largely worked well, with some adjustments, at fixing the federal funds rate within the range set by officials. FORECASTING - The Fed in 2012 began releasing projections each quarter from its governors and reserve bank presidents for economic measures. That first set of forecasts showed median growth for 2014 expected at 3.65 percent. Actual growth was 2.4 percent - the first in a series of forecast misses that showed just how poorly the country’s top economic minds were at unravelling how the Great Recession changed the economy. It didn't matter much to policy at the time - rates were not going to be raised anyway. But it arguably nicked the Fed's credibility as policymakers were continually forced to downgrade their outlook year by year. tmsnrt.rs/2GENOUa NEUTRAL - The neutral rate of interest, blessed with the wonky moniker “R star,” went from being a cornerstone of policy and a fixation of researchers under former Chair Janet Yellen, to a source of confusion under Jerome Powell.  It is important to economic models in trying to assess the point at which the Fed is no longer influencing economic decisions, but holding things steady. But consider: policymakers’ first public estimates of the “longer run” federal funds rate ran from 3.75 to 4.5 percent. The most recent, issued this week, were in a completely different range, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent.  Foggy, to say the least. POLITICAL ECONOMY - The Fed ventured into the unknown during the crisis, slashing interest rates to zero and launching a massive asset purchase program. Its oversight since has been intense, with criticism pulling it in all directions depending on which end of Pennsylvania Avenue was speaking the loudest. Here’s Republican Andy Barr of Kentucky grilling Powell in February: “Your task is to continue to unwind the Fed’s asset purchases, gradually, and predictably return to market-based interest rates, and remove monetary distortions from the economy without producing excessive disruption.” President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has heaped scorn on the Fed for doing just that, calling rate hikes “loco” and asking them to “stop with the 50B’s,” when it comes to the monthly $50 billion balance sheet runoff.  INFLATION - The Fed has yet to formally ""declare victory"" on its 2 percent inflation target. Even though the pace of price increases has edged toward that goal, it has not convincingly hit or exceeded it in a way officials believe will stick. And the readings of late have been weaker. tmsnrt.rs/2GusFM1 COMMUNICATIONS - The Fed in the post-crisis era has become far more open in how it talks to the public and markets, a plus in an era when it was acting in unconventional ways and needed to maintain public trust.  But that same openness has caused confusion, from the hailstorm of chatter from reserve bank presidents to the misbegotten nature of the “dot plot” of officials’ estimates of where the fed funds rate is heading. The Fed says it isn’t a forecast, but markets read it as such, and have made a parlour sport of guessing which dot is the chair’s, and thus first among equals. Meanwhile, Powell, like his predecessors, has had his stumbles, confounding markets in recent weeks by implying rates would rise fast, then having to dial that back. Just this week the Fed’s projections showed a slowing economy and a slowing set of rate increases, while its statement was a bullish recount of U.S. strength.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets gave up earlier gains and continued a weeklong sell-off on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a fresh interest rate hike and said “some” further rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead.  The decision, announced at 2 p.m. Eastern time (1900 GMT), slashed more than 700 points off of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and sent MSCI’s index of global stocks down nearly 0.9 percent for the day. The index is down nearly 13 percent since the start of December due to concerns that global economic growth is slowing. “This is clearly a disappointment for those hoping for a dovish rate hike,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston. “It is a more moderate rate hike but it is a rate hike and there is still a gap between where the Fed is and where the market is in terms of policy expectations for next year.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 351.98 points, or 1.49 percent, to 23,323.66, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 39.2 points, or 1.54 percent, to 2,506.96 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 147.08 points, or 2.17 percent, to 6,636.83. U.S. stocks are on pace tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks added to the selling pressure in U.S. stocks when he said the pace of the balance sheet reduction is on a preset course and adjusting the pace of the balance sheet reduction is not an option at this time. The U.S. central bank’s rate hike will likely dampen investor appetite for riskier assets throughout the globe, said Jorge Mariscal, emerging markets chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.  “People are worried about growth and to hear the Fed isn’t (worried) concerns the market,” he said. “In turn, that supports the U.S. dollar and that is negative news for emerging markets in general.” The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan, which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy.  Logistics and delivery firm FedEx Corp, (FDX.N) considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed 2019 forecasts, noting “ongoing deceleration” in global growth. The company’s shares sunk over 12 percent, pushing its stock down nearly 35 percent since the start of the year.  “It’s a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,” said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. Expectations of slower growth and the equity sell-off have sent 10-year Treasury yields to their lowest since August.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 16/32 in price to yield 2.7655 percent, from 2.823 percent late on Tuesday. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.02 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.08 percent to $1.137.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is investigating a cyber hack of its diplomatic communications, allegedly by Chinese hackers, that revealed EU concern about U.S. Donald Trump, Russia and Iran, the bloc said on Wednesday. “The Council Secretariat is aware of allegations regarding a potential leak of sensitive information and is actively investigating the issue,” the body that represents EU governments in Brussels said in a statement. The Secretariat declined to comment further but said it “takes the security of its facilities, including its IT systems, extremely seriously”, referring to concerns about vulnerabilities in its data systems across 28 EU states. The New York Times reported late on Tuesday that hackers had broken into the EU’s diplomatic communications for years, downloading cables that showed worries about the Trump administration, struggles to deal with Russia and China, and the threat of Iran reviving its nuclear programme.  More than 1,100 cables were supplied to the Times by security firm Area 1 after it discovered the breach, the newspaper said, adding that Area 1 investigators believed the hackers worked for China’s People’s Liberation Army. The cables include memorandums of conversations with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Israel and other countries that were shared across the European Union, according to the report. One cable, the Times said, showed European diplomats describing a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Finland as “successful (at least for Putin)”. Another, written after a July 16 meeting, relayed a detailed report and analysis of talks between European officials and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was quoted comparing Trump’s “bullying” of Beijing to a “no-rules freestyle boxing match”. A third, from March 7, shows Caroline Vicini, the deputy head of the EU mission in Washington, recommending that the trade bloc’s diplomats describe the United States as “our most important partner”, even as it challenged Trump “in areas where we disagreed with the U.S. (e.g., on climate, trade, Iran nuclear deal)”. The hackers also infiltrated the networks of the United Nations, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and ministries of foreign affairs and finance worldwide, the Times report added.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) has removed hundreds of additional accounts, pages and groups in Myanmar from its social networks after discovering what it called “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” and links to the country’s military. The social media giant had previously removed accounts, including that of Myanmar’s army chief, after criticism it had failed to act on hate speech amid violence against Rohingya Muslims in the country. Facebook said in a blog post late on Tuesday that it had removed 425 pages, 17 groups and 135 accounts from its social network and 15 accounts from its Instagram photo-sharing service. It was continuing to investigate other pages that “mislead others about who they are, or what they’re doing” and could breach the company’s policy on misrepresentation, Facebook said. The shuttered pages included “seemingly independent news, entertainment, beauty and lifestyle Pages were linked to the Myanmar military” and other pages removed in August, Facebook said. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer a phone call seeking comment on Wednesday.     The removal of Myanmar-linked pages in August followed a U.N. fact-finding mission that called for top Myanmar generals to be prosecuted for what it said was a campaign of mass killings and gang rape against the Rohingya carried out with “genocidal intent”. In 2017 the military led a crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents, pushing more than 730,000 Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies. A Reuters special report in August found that Facebook failed to promptly heed numerous warnings from organizations in Myanmar about social media posts fuelling attacks on minority groups such as the Rohingya. (link: here) The U.N. fact-finding mission singled out Facebook for criticism over its failure to address hate speech in Myanmar.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 5 percent on Tuesday in heavy trade due to fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand, extending a selloff that has taken major crude benchmarks down more than 30 percent from an October peak.  U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent both extended declines in post-settlement trade after trade group The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories unexpectedly climbed in the latest week. [API/S] U.S. crude oil fell $3.64, or 7.3 percent, to settle at $46.24 a barrel, the weakest since August, 2017. In post-close trade, the contract was down 8 percent to $45.91 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent lost $3.35, or 5.62 percent, to settle at $56.26 a barrel. During the session, Brent hit a 14-month low of $56.16.  U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 14 to 441.3 million, API said, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels. If that build is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. [EIA/S] More than 900,000 contracts changed hands on Tuesday, far exceeding the 200-day moving average of 591,000 contracts. Investor confidence is deteriorating, with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s December investor survey showed. “There was a flood of supply-side news yesterday which, in combination with the demand destruction that the stock market slide implied, got us below $50 (a barrel for U.S. crude), and that gave us a strong sell signal,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures with Mizuho in New York. World stock markets inched higher as investors focused on the next move for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Equity markets have had steep declines over the last two months, with several stock sectors having reached bear-market territory. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday amid a host of calls to pause its tightening cycle or risk harming the economy.  Among the bearish factors, Britain’s largest oilfield restarted production, increasing supply, the U.S. government said output from shale would top 8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and data suggested U.S. crude inventories would rise this week.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected by year-end to surpass 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Britain’s largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipe work, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 bpd and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline that brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields. Separately, Libya’s state oil firm declared force majeure on operations at the country’s largest oilfield, El Sharara. The 315,000 bpd field, located in the southern part of the country, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge fiercely criticized President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday for lying to FBI agents in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and delayed sentencing him until Flynn has finished helping prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that he had arguably betrayed his country. Sullivan also noted that Flynn had operated as an undeclared lobbyist for Turkey even as he worked on Trump’s campaign team and prepared to be his White House national security adviser. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia’s ambassador in Washington, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. The conversations took place between Trump’s November election victory and his inauguration in January 2017. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia ahead of the election, had asked the judge not to sentence Flynn to prison because he had already provided “substantial” cooperation over the course of many interviews. Lying to the FBI carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison. Flynn’s plea agreement stated that he was eligible for a sentence of between zero and six months. Sullivan sternly told Flynn his actions were abhorrent, noting that Flynn had also lied to senior White House officials, who in turn misled the public. The judge said he had read additional facts about Flynn’s behaviour that have not been made public. At one point, Sullivan asked prosecutors if Flynn could have been charged with treason, although the judge later said he had not been suggesting such a charge was warranted. “Arguably, you sold your country out,” Sullivan told Flynn. “I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offence.” Flynn, dressed in a suit and tie, showed little emotion throughout the hearing, and spoke calmly when he confirmed his guilty plea and answered questions from the judge. Sullivan appeared ready to sentence Flynn to prison but then gave him the option of a delay in his sentencing so he could fully cooperate with any pending investigations and bolster his case for leniency. The judge told Flynn he could not promise that he would not eventually sentence him to serve prison time. Flynn accepted that offer. Sullivan did not set a new date for sentencing but asked Mueller’s team and Flynn’s attorney to give him a status report by March 13. Sullivan later imposed travel restrictions on Flynn, ordering him to surrender his passport and to obtain court permission before travelling outside the Washington area. The curbs are typical for people released on their own recognizance, the judge said. Prosecutors said Flynn already had provided most of the cooperation he could, but it was possible he might be able to help investigators further. Flynn’s attorney said his client is cooperating with federal prosecutors in a case against Bijan Rafiekian, his former business partner who has been charged with unregistered lobbying for Turkey. Rafiekian pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to those charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 11. Flynn is expected to testify. Prosecutors have said Rafiekian and Flynn lobbied to have Washington extradite a Muslim cleric who lives in the United States and is accused by Turkey’s government of backing a 2016 coup attempt. Flynn has not been charged in that case.  Flynn was a high-profile adviser to Trump’s campaign team. At the Republican Party’s national convention in 2016, Flynn led Trump’s supporters in cries of “Lock her up!” directed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. A group of protesters, including some who chanted “Lock him up,” gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, along with a large inflatable rat fashioned to look like Trump. Several Flynn supporters also were there, cheering as he entered and exited. One held a sign that read, “Michael Flynn is a hero.” Flynn became national security adviser when Trump took office in January 2017, but lasted only 24 days before being fired.  He told FBI investigators on Jan. 24, 2017, that he had not discussed the U.S. sanctions with Kislyak when in fact he had, according to his plea agreement. Trump has said he fired Flynn because he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts with Kislyak.  Trump has said Flynn did not break the law and has voiced support for him, raising speculation the Republican president might pardon him. “Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning. After the hearing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the FBI had “ambushed” Flynn in the way agents questioned him, but said his “activities” at the centre of the case “don’t have anything to do with the president” and disputed that Flynn had committed treason. “We wish General Flynn well,” Sanders said. In contrast, Trump has called his former long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges, a “rat.” Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe has cast a shadow over his presidency. Several former Trump aides have pleaded guilty in Mueller’s probe, but Flynn was the first former Trump White House official to do so. Mueller also has charged a series of Russian individuals and entities. Trump has called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and has denied collusion with Moscow.

2019-02-08,"MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Clothing retailers have felt a pre-Christmas chill slicing through their margins as they try to lure shoppers to spend rather than hold off in anticipation of ever-bigger price cuts. This has left investors worried whether recent profit warnings, which have spread to online players such as British online store ASOS (ASOS.L) from bricks-and-mortar retailers, may be a taste of the future. Monday’s warning from ASOS, a high-fashion, online-only player seen as better placed than most to weather shopper fatigue, raised concerns about weakening consumer strength globally and even hit shares in internet retail giant Amazon (AMZN.O). “We have seen in fashion an unprecedented amount of discounting, certainly not something I’ve seen before, and that’s been across the board,” ASOS Chief Executive Nick Beighton told analysts. “Whether this is a high street or an online issue isn’t relevant right now; what is, is the underlying fragility of the customer,” Beighton added. While online retailing has made shoppers more savvy, comparing prices and trawling more widely for discounts, factors ranging from street demonstrations in Paris to unseasonable weather have been blamed for a reluctance to buy new clothes. Fashion chains including Primark (ABF.L), Superdry (SDRY.L) and Italy’s low-cost OVS (OVS.MI) have all warned of weak sales in the crucial run-up to Christmas. And while Zara owner Inditex (ITX.MC) resisted discounting, it reported disappointing sales. “Customer behavior is becoming more and more difficult to predict,” Stefano Beraldo, chief executive officer at OVS, said last week after an 11 percent drop in same-store sales. Most retailers have responded by expanding their traditional summer and new year sales to year-round promotions, even in the crucial Christmas period when they have previously counted on shifting stock at full price. “Discounting has been building for a number of years and has gone hand-in-hand with the rise of online,” said Samantha Dover, senior retail analyst at market research firm Mintel, said. A walk down a British high street shows Gap children’s jumpers at half price, women’s leather boots reduced by 40 percent at Hobbs and a half-price Laura Ashley wool-mix coat. “I saw the ‘sale’ sign and I came in,” said 54-year-old investment banker Kez, rifling through a bargain rail at affordable fashion chain Top Shop in London’s Canary Wharf financial district. She said she was always attracted to a bargain and would “definitely” compare prices online before buying, although if she needed an item she would buy it at full price. Deloitte says consumers in Britain are enjoying record pre-Christmas price cuts, with discounts at an average of 43.6 percent and likely to hit a new record by Christmas Eve. The consultancy expects the number of sale days at British retailers to be as many as 38 this year, six more than 2012. Research by Mintel shows almost half of British consumers have delayed buying clothing to see if it goes on promotion. At upmarket fashion chain Reiss, banker Daniel Radford, 45, said he wouldn’t shop just anywhere for a bargain but “depending on the brand, it can be important”. “Sales are happening all the time now,” he said, adding that in the case of a big-ticket item he would wait for it to be discounted.  Promotional activities like Black Friday have meant shoppers expect discounts earlier in the season, while they can also shop around more easily and compare prices. “People are going to buy where the discounts are and then that hits margins across the board,” said Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at GlobalData. Some clothing retailers have adapted better than others to changing shopping habits - Inditex has set the pace with its tight control of inventory, meaning it is able to leverage its network of stores and online apps to sell items at full price. H&M, however, has had to mark down prices as it failed to react quickly to demand swings, some of which have resulted from changing weather patterns or increasingly fickle tastes driven by a growing army of online influencers setting trends. Another factor in the mix this autumn has been country-specific troubles such as political unrest in France and fears about Britain leaving the European Union which have kept shoppers at home, leaving piles of unsold clothing. The French retail federation has estimated stores have lost at least 1 billion euros as a result of four weeks of ‘yellow vest’ protests in France. And German retailers have been disappointed by Christmas sales so far, the German Retail Association said, capping off a weak 2018. “We had a year of soft trading in Germany,” George Garfield Weston, CEO of Primark owner AB Foods (ABF.L), said last month. German retailers including Zalando (ZALG.DE) and Metro (B4B.DE), like others in northern Europe, have blamed unseasonable weather for weak demand.

2019-02-08,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - British Airways will resume flights to Pakistan next year after a 10-year absence that followed a major hotel bombing, becoming the first Western airline to restart flights to the South Asian nation. BA halted flights following one of the most high-profile attacks in Pakistan’s history, the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in the capital, Islamabad, which took place during a period of devastating Islamist militant violence that swept the country. But security has since improved, with militant attacks sharply down in the mainly Muslim country of 208 million people. In Islamabad, a web of road checkpoints dotted across the city for more than a decade has mostly been dismantled. Richard Crowder, the Deputy British High Commissioner to Pakistan, told reporters in Islamabad BA’s return was in large part due to “an improvement in the security environment in this country”. Pakistani officials hailed BA’s move, saying it will offer confidence to other foreign investors and make the country less isolated. “Once it gets around the world that British Airways has put its stamp of approval on Pakistan, it will put us one or two notches up as a country to do business with,” said Commerce Minister Abdul Razak Dawood.     BA, which is owned by Spanish-registered IAG, is due to begin the London Heathrow-Islamabad service on June 2, with three weekly flights by the airline’s newest long-haul aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. At present, only loss-making national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flies directly from Pakistan to Britain, but its aging fleet of planes is a frequent source of complaints by passengers. Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates have a strong presence in Pakistan and have been eating into PIA’s dwindling market share. Turkish Airlines also lays on a regular service to Pakistan. Islamabad has been running international advertising campaigns to rejuvenate its tourism sector that was wiped out by Islamist violence that destabilised the country following the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001 and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. Pakistan was formed at partition at the end of British rule in India in 1947 and more than a million people of Pakistani origin live in Britain. Robert Williams, Head of Sales for Asia Pacific and the Middle East for British Airways, said the carrier believes the route “will be particularly popular with the British Pakistani community who want to visit, or be visited by, their relatives”. Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari, a special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said “British Airways coming back after a decade shows you where we were and how far we have come”. “Pakistan is becoming less isolated and more connected to the world, and that’s the Pakistan we want to see.” (This story corrects to clarify that BA flights will begin next year on June 2, not June 15, paragraph 7) Editing by Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pakistan-airline-britishairways/british-airways-to-resume-pakistan-flights-after-a-decade-idUKKBN1OH0T0,2019-02-08,,British Airways to resume Pakistan flights after a decade
2019-02-08,"MILAN (Reuters) - European shares remained stuck in a “Santa Crash” on Tuesday in a fourth straight session of losses, dragged down by poor economic data and lower oil prices.  The pan-European STOXX 600  index ended the day down 0.6 percent, just a few points away from two-year lows hit last week on slowing economic growth worries. A vast majority of European bourses and sectors traded in the red and didn’t recover when the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened higher after the previous session’s slump. “We are stuck in our European doldrums”, said Oddo Securities trader Mikael Jacob, noting no spillover effect from  investors’ new-found optimism that the Federal Reserve might adopt a dovish tone at its meeting on Wednesday. The STOXX 600 is down more than 12 percent so far this year,  hit by a slowing economy and political instability in Europe.  Oil and gas stocks .SXEP fell 2.5 percent as concern over oil demand sent crude prices down.  Among heavyweights, Total (TOTF.PA), Royal Dutch (RDSa.AS) and BP (BP.L) lost 2.5 percent, 2.3 percent and 2.2 percent respectively.  Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) rose at the open after its unit T-Mobile and Sprint won backing from two U.S. national security reviews for their $26 billion merger. The go-ahead came after indications that both groups had offered to stop using Huawei [HWT.UL] equipment. Shares in the German phone group pared gains to fall 0.5 percent at the close.  Among the few gainers was Getlink (GETP.PA), up 5.5 percent after French builder Eiffage (FOUG.PA) bought a five percent stake in the company, which operates the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives called nearly unanimously on Thursday for the government of Myanmar to release Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were imprisoned one year ago in a landmark free speech case. House members voted by 394 to 1 for a resolution calling for release of Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were found guilty in September of violating Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison. The case has raised questions among a number of political leaders in the United States and Europe, human rights advocates and the United Nations about Myanmar’s progress towards democracy. The measure is non-binding, but intended as a strong message to the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, as well as to President Donald Trump’s administration that members of the U.S. Congress want the two men released. The resolution also calls the Myanmar military’s campaign against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority a genocide. In a report issued on Aug. 27, U.N. investigators said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with “genocidal intent” and for the first time explicitly called for Myanmar officials to face genocide charges over their campaign.  The U.S. Department of State, which would make an official determination, has not made that official designation using the term genocide. The Myanmar embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House of Representatives vote. The military in Myanmar, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied past accusations that it had committed genocide against the Rohingya and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism. The one “no” vote came from Representative Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona. Asked to comment on Biggs’ vote, Daniel Stefanski, a spokesman for the congressman, did not directly address the question but said the Myanmar military’s “continuing oppression of the Rohingya is inhumane” and called on the Trump administration “to use maximum diplomatic pressure to end the genocide and demand the release of the two journalists.” The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed papers by police shortly before they were detained, and a police witness testified that they had been set up. They had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys as part of a military response to insurgent attacks. Lawyers for the two Reuters reporters have lodged an appeal against their conviction and sentence. An appeal hearing is scheduled for Dec. 24. Among other things, the House resolution also condemns attacks against civilians by the Burmese military and calls on Trump to impose additional sanctions on senior members of the Burmese military and security forces it says are responsible for human rights abuses. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (This story corrects spelling of name Stefanski in eighth paragraph.)

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares tumbled on Monday when a profit warning from online fashion retailer ASOS sent retail stocks into nose-dive as investors fretted that consumers were failing to deliver the traditional pre-Christmas spending boost to markets. Euro zone stocks .STOXXE were down 1 percent while Germany's DAX .GDAXI fell 0.8 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 .FTSE lost 0.9 percent.  ASOS (ASOS.L) shares plunged 37.5 percent after the British retailer - a favorite of investors keen to back internet-focused retail - cut its forecasts, saying November was “significantly behind expectations”. It was the latest in a string of profit warnings and negative outlooks from retailers including Sports Direct, Dixons Carphone and Bonmarche highlighting poor performance in the pre-Christmas trading period. Europe’s retail sector .SXRP fell 2.6 percent and closed to its lowest level since July 2016.  Shares in Zalando (ZALG.DE), a German rival of ASOS and Europe’s biggest online retailer, dropped 11.6 percent, the biggest STOXX 600 fallers. ASOS peer Boohoo (BOOH.L) fell 13.7 percent after it reported record Black Friday sales. Swedish retailer H&M (HMb.ST) fell 8.5 percent despite reporting in-line sales figures, as the ASOS stress spread. Next (NXT.L) and Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) fell both 4.6 percent.  Outside retail, M&A drove some big moves with Ingenico (INGC.PA) tumbling 7.4 percent after it said it had dropped talks over a possible deal. Sopra Steria (SOPR.PA) and Worldline (WLN.PA) fell 11.4 percent and 6.8 percent respectively after Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on the stocks.  Swedish electrical components maker Dometic (DOMETIC.ST) fell 5.3 percent after Kepler Cheuvreux cut their rating on the stock to a “hold” from a “buy”.  Leading euro zone stocks and Britain’s FTSE 100 were all set for their worst quarter since 2011, when the region was in the throes of the sovereign debt crisis. Investors smarting from a tough year also had a week of central bank events looming with meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England likely to move markets. Despite this, Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for Global Wealth Management at UBS, said: “On balance, we are not yet convinced that the profitable thing to do is to position for further policy errors or poor sentiment upending the economy.” He concurs with the Fed’s assessment that the risk of a recession in the next 12 months is only around 20 percent, and sees global equities as “reasonably valued”.

2019-02-08,"YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Nissan Motor’s CEO called on directors at alliance partner Renault to heed its reasons for sacking former Chairman Carlos Ghosn over alleged financial misconduct amid tensions over how to handle the fallout from his arrest. Renault’s interim chairman Philippe Lagayette said on Friday that its board had not considered replacing Ghosn, who was ousted by Nissan days after his arrest in Japan in November, as head of the French carmaker. Ghosn has denied wrongdoing, media reports say, although he has not made any public statements since his arrest.  “We hope the board will listen to our explanation,” Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa told reporters after a board meeting of the Japanese carmaker at which it confirmed plans to strengthen corporate governance following the Ghosn crisis. Although sources familiar with the matter say Nissan has briefed Renault lawyers on its findings relating to Ghosn’s alleged misconduct, Renault directors have yet to be given access to the full information. “We understand that the raw details of the misconduct have yet to reach each of Renault’s board members,” Saikawa said of the allegations against Nissan’s once-revered boss. Nissan said it has already shared its findings with the board of Mitsubishi Motors, which is the third, junior member of the carmaking alliance.  While Nissan is almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy to Renault, which owns a 43.4 percent in its Japanese partner. Nissan has a 15 percent non-voting stake in Renault, whose biggest shareholder is the French state with 15 percent. Ghosn, who was arrested on Nov. 19 by Japanese authorities, was officially charged in a Tokyo court last week and remains in detention. The Japanese automaker was also indicted for its role in the scandal. Nissan’s board met on Monday after Thierry Bollore, Renault’s deputy CEO, asked Nissan in a Dec. 14 letter to call an extraordinary shareholders meeting, a source said on Sunday. Saikawa declined to comment on the report. Nissan said it was establishing a special committee for improving governance, as well as an advisory committee to propose a chairman.  Saikawa said he expected the governance committee would “take a scalpel” to Nissan’s governance team, and that he did not have a deadline for naming a successor to Ghosn. “We shouldn’t hurry, we should take our time ... I will make every effort (to ensure that a new chairman is selected soon), but I will refrain from setting a deadline for this,” he said.  He also brushed off calling a shareholder meeting in the immediate future, saying that he planned to summon shareholders after the board comes up with changes based on recommendations from the special committee, expected in late March. The board, until last week, had been expected to name an interim chairman on Monday. But a panel of external directors put off their selection, deciding to prioritize measures to improve governance, a source familiar with the matter said. Critics have said Nissan lacked adequate governance, with few truly independent voices capable of questioning its leadership and looking out for regular shareholders’ interests. Its three external board members include retired Renault executive Jean-Baptiste Duzan, considered to represent the views of the French automaker. The other two are former bureaucrat Masakazu Toyoda and racing car driver Keiko Ihara.

2019-02-08,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia on Monday denounced U.S. Senate resolutions calling for an end to U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying they were based on unsubstantiated claims. The votes last Thursday were a rare rebuke to President Donald Trump, but largely symbolic. To become law, they would need to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis. “The Kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,” a foreign ministry statement said. Khashoggi, a royal insider who became a critic of Prince Mohammed and began writing for the Washington Post after moving to the United States last year, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the crown prince ordered his death. The murder has sparked global outrage and damaged the international reputation of 33-year-old Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto leader, who is pushing economic and social changes in the world’s top oil exporter. Saudi Arabia has also come under increased scrutiny for civilian deaths and a humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where it support the internationally-recognised government against Iranian-aligned Houthis in a nearly four-year-old civil war. At U.N.-mediated talks in Sweden last week, the warring parties agreed to a local ceasefire to try to avert more bloodshed in the port of Hodeidah, which is vital for food and aid supplies. Opponents of the Senate resolutions want to maintain the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, which they consider an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran. Administration officials also see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be disclosed by the Trump administration. And they have argued that ending U.S. support could complicate Yemen peace efforts. The Saudi statement said the kingdom “hopes that it is not drawn into domestic political debates in the United States of America, to avoid any ramifications on the ties between the two countries that could have significant negative impacts on this important strategic relationship.” Reporting by Mohamed El-Sherif, writing by Stephen Kalin, editing by Chris Reese, Larry King",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-khashoggi/saudi-arabia-denounces-u-s-senate-resolutions-on-khashoggi-yemen-idUKKBN1OF0WA,2019-02-08,,"Saudi Arabia denounces U.S. Senate resolutions on Khashoggi, Yemen"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc welcomed on Monday the British government’s response to a review into workplace rights, which looks set to preserve the business models of gig economy companies, but unions rubbished the business ministry’s plans. Firms like Uber, best-known for its ride-hailing service, and food courier Deliveroo, have been criticized for hiring workers on a self-employed basis, which means they are not entitled to many workplace rights, including the minimum wage. Uber and taxi service Addison Lee have lost court battles over the issue. A government-commissioned review looked into the matter of modern workplace practices and in response on Monday the business ministry said it would legislate to improve the clarity of the employment status tests. The government said its reforms reflect the review’s findings that completely banning zero hours contracts, which offer no guarantees on working hours, would negatively impact some people and that the flexibility of ‘gig working’ was not incompatible with access to employment protections. “We welcome more clarity from the government and look forward to working closely with them to make sure drivers can keep all the benefits that come from being your own boss,” said an Uber spokeswoman.    Deliveroo said it would work with the government to ensure the interests of its riders can be advanced. But Britain’s biggest trade union Unite criticized the government’s plans. “People on zero hour contracts and workers in the insecure economy need much more than a weak right to request a contract and more predictable hours,” said General Secretary Len McCluskey. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which has won court cases against Uber on worker rights but recently lost to Deliveroo, was similarly downbeat. “Exploited workers in this country are sick of press releases, rhetoric and self-congratulatory government announcements,” said General Secretary Jason Moyer-Lee. As part of the plans, Britain’s governing Conservatives will introduce legislation to scrap the ‘Swedish derogation’, which currently allows agency workers to be employed on cheaper rates than permanent counterparts by some companies.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Transport minister Chris Grayling will sign an agreement with Switzerland on Monday to ensure air services continue to operate between the two countries after Brexit. Britain is due to leave the European Union in March next year, but uncertainty over how, or even if, Brexit will happen has increased the possibility of the country exiting without a deal on departure terms - a scenario that some companies said would usher in chaos. “The UK aviation sector is the biggest in Europe and will play an even more crucial role as we further develop as an outward looking global nation,” Grayling said in a statement. “These agreements will ensure Britain continues to prosper as we leave the EU and I’m confident the UK will reach a mutually beneficial deal, whilst we continue to prepare for all eventualities.” His department said the new bilateral deal guaranteed the terms of the current EU-Switzerland agreement on air services, safeguarding the route that carried 6.8 million passengers by air in 2017. The government is also launching the Aviation 2050 consultation, which proposes new measures including commitments to signing more air service agreements, the department said. “Our aviation sector is world-leading and the Aviation 2050 strategy will promote success in the coming decades,” Liz Sugg, aviation minister, said. “Our ambition is to expand our international connections, boost trade and investment and strengthening domestic links to support businesses and travelling passengers.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-air/uk-signs-air-service-deal-with-switzerland-for-post-brexit-flights-idUKKBN1OG00A,2019-02-08,,UK signs air service deal with Switzerland for post-Brexit flights
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Renault (RENA.PA) requested a full Nissan shareholder meeting, a source close to the company said - appearing to escalate the carmaker’s standoff with its Japanese alliance partner in the wake of the pay scandal engulfing Chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn. Thierry Bollore, the French group’s deputy CEO, issued the demand in a Dec. 14 letter to Nissan, the source said on Sunday, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal. “We respectfully ask that the board consider calling an extraordinary general meeting of Nissan shareholders as promptly as practicable,” Bollore wrote in the letter. A Renault spokesman declined to comment. Ghosn’s arrest in Japan for alleged financial misconduct has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken Renault’s control. Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding. The call for a shareholder meeting will likely be seen as an attempted show of force by Renault’s interim management, led by Bollore and Mouna Sepehri, Ghosn’s long-standing chief of staff who also heads legal affairs and communications. The letter made no mention of using the shareholder meeting to hire or fire Nissan board members but remained vague about its purpose, saying only that it would “allow for appropriate disclosure and discussion of governance and other matters”. It added that the indictment of Nissan “creates significant risks to Renault, as Nissan’s largest shareholder, and to the stability of our industrial alliance”. At a Dec. 13 Renault board meeting, directors were briefed on the Nissan investigation that led to Ghosn’s arrest. He was charged alongside Nissan this week over the company’s failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive. He and alleged accomplice Greg Kelly remain in custody. While Nissan ousted Ghosn days after his arrest, the Renault board reiterated its earlier decision to keep him in office. Directors have yet to be given access to the Nissan findings, which are being closely held by Renault lawyers. Bollore’s demand for a Nissan shareholder meeting was a “management decision” that was not raised at the previous day’s board session, the company source said, adding that it had been discussed subsequently with “all of the directors”. Senior director Philippe Lagayette is standing in as chairman. The French government, Renault’s biggest shareholder, is backing Michelin CEO Jean-Dominique Senard to replace Ghosn permanently as chairman, Le Figaro reported.

2019-02-08,"EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - A young Guatemalan girl who died after she and her father were detained by U.S. border agents was in no medical distress when they arrived and had received adequate food and water on their journey, relatives said on Saturday through representatives in Texas. A statement from the family of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin, released to reporters in El Paso, Texas, by the head of a migrants shelter where her father was staying, disputed media reports that the girl had gone days without food or water and become dehydrated while travelling from Guatemala through Mexico to the U.S. border. News of the child’s death, and suggestions that border officials ignored or overlooked a medical crisis, added to criticism from migrant advocates and congressional Democrats of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. But neither the father nor other family members cast blame on U.S. border authorities in their first statements about the tragedy.  Ruben Garcia, director of the Annunciation House shelter, said the girl’s father, Nery Caal, 29, told him he had no inkling his daughter was ill when they arrived by bus with dozens of other migrants at the U.S. border in Antelope Wells, New Mexico, on the night of Dec. 6. Garcia also said the father agreed with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) account of the father and daughter’s brief detention, including CBP’s assertion there was no indication that the girl had been suffering from any medical problem until several hours after their arrival. “Jakelin had not been crossing the desert for days,” her family wrote in the English-language statement, which Garcia said was prepared by their attorneys.  “She and her father sought asylum from Border Patrol as soon as they crossed the border,” the statement said. “She had not suffered from a lack of water or food prior to approaching the border.” According to CBP’s account, the girl and her father also had access to water and restrooms during the seven hours they waited to board a CBP bus that would take them early on Dec. 7 from Antelope Wells to another Border Patrol station at Lordsburg, about 95 miles (153 km) away.  The CBP said Nery Caal told agents just before their bus departed that his daughter was vomiting, and by the time they arrived 90 minutes later she had stopped breathing.  She was treated in Lordsburg by emergency personnel, then rushed to an El Paso hospital, where she died the next morning, Dec. 8, after doctors found she was suffering brain swelling and liver failure. Although the father did not contest CBP’s chronology of events, the family’s statement called for “an objective and thorough investigation ... within nationally recognised standards for the arrest and custody of children.” The family did fault CBP for relying on interview forms printed in English, a language the father did not understand. The family’s native tongue is Q’eqchi’, a Mayan dialect, with Spanish being their second language.  The girl’s mother, Claudia Maquin, told Reuters on Saturday in the family’s home village of San Antonio de Cortez in central Guatemala that her spouse and daughter were among thousands of migrants seeking to escape “the extreme poverty that we live in.” The couple have three remaining children. But Jakelin’s grandfather said the 7-year-old and her father had an especially close bond. The El Paso County medical examiner has conducted an autopsy on the girl, but the results will not be made available for up to two weeks, Garcia said. The father was not present for the news conference. Garcia said he was declining to speak to the media for now. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general vowed to conduct an inquiry. Democrats on Capitol Hill want that probe to examine why Congress was not informed of the incident within 24 hours, as they said is required of any death in CBP custody.

2019-02-08,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Nearly 200 nations agreed on Saturday on a rulebook for implementing a landmark 2015 global deal to tackle climate change. After two weeks of talks and two years of work, nations overcame political divisions to reach consensus on a more detailed framework for the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to limit a rise in average world temperatures to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters took to the streets of French cities on Saturday in the fifth weekend of demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron’s government, ignoring calls to hold off after a gun attack in Strasbourg this week. In Paris, police were out in force to contain outbursts of violence. But the demonstrations were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks, possibly a response to the Strasbourg attack or to the cold, rainy weather. Police fired water cannon and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes with riot police on the Champs-Elysees and adjacent streets. Topless feminist activists braved the cold to face off with security forces, a few metres away from the Elysee Palace, the president’s residence. And French media showed footage of clashes between police and protesters in Nantes, western France, and further south in Bordeaux and Toulouse. The ‘yellow vest’ movement started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macron’s economic policies. Successive weekends of protests in Paris have lead to vandalism and violent clashes with security forces. Despite the protests, several major stores, such as the Galeries Lafayette, opened to lure in Christmas shoppers.   Loic Bollay, 44, marching on the Champs-Elysees in a yellow vest, said the protests were more subdued but the movement would go on until the demonstrators’ grievances were addressed. “Since the Strasbourg attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays...it will come back.” The Interior Minister said around 69,000 police were active on Saturday with a reinforced presence in Toulouse, Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne.  Official figures said 66,000 protesters had been counted in France by 1700 GMT, compared to 126,000 at the same time a week before. In Paris, some 4,000 protesters marched in splintered groups in several neighbourhoods, and at least 168 were arrested, a Paris police official said. On Friday, President Macron called for a return to calm in France after nearly a month of protests by the so-called ‘yellow vest’ movement against his government’s policies. The demonstrations have hit growth and caused widespread disruption. “France needs calm, order and a return to normal,” Macron said, after a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels. In a televised address on Monday, Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners in further concessions meant to end the movement, but many said they would maintain pressure. The government, as well as several unions and opposition politicians had called on protesters to stay off the streets, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in the historic city of Strasbourg.

2019-02-08,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates at U.N. climate talks in the Polish city of Katowice point to the mining museum next to the conference venue as the proper place for coal, which provides 80 percent of the country’s electricity. Poland’s decision to host the negotiations to revive the 2015 Paris agreement on phasing out fossil fuel has laid bare the tension between high-minded goals and business realities. A short drive from the conference venue, at the Silesian region’s dozen or so remaining mines, tonnes of freshly dug coal thunder down shoots to be rail-roaded to power plants for carbon-intensive generation.    Coal bosses see a need to address climate risk, but say Poland must use thermal coal for electricity until it has a better option.     Silesia also produces coking coal, used in steel, and viewed as a strategic mineral even by the European Union, which seeks to be an environmental leader. Poland’s JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, is seeking to grow.  “The world has to tackle the increase of carbon dioxide emissions, but I do not see a chance the world can live without steel these days and there is not an easy solution to substitute steel and substitute coking coal,” CEO Daniel Ozon told Reuters. Financial backing can be an issue for all forms of coal and JSW has its eye on Chinese banks as international lenders are wary. For many Poles, coal mining symbolizes national independence.  State-dominated companies can look to a government striving to win over an electorate divided between an older generation that associates coal with a reliable income and a sense of community, and youths engaged in climate protests. As the demonstrators march, international business works to keep shareholders on side. One of the climate team from the world’s biggest producer of coking coal BHP was among business representatives taking part in the side events accompanying the negotiations. The U.N. talks have proved long and fractious, with flash-points including a revolt by Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait against a major scientific report that laid out the reasons to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “The real challenge is not whether it’s 2 degrees or 1.5 degrees; it’s that not enough is happening,” Graham Winkelman, BHP’s practice lead on climate change, said in an interview. BHP stands apart from other big miners with a goal to make its own operations carbon neutral, in line with the Paris agreement, by the second half of the century. But just as governments have to work out practicalities, it is also unclear how BHP can achieve its goals. “There is no definitive path-way,” Winkelman said, although he repeated a frequent industry request for a carbon price to help shift investment towards a greener technology. Poland’s aim is to share the challenges of bringing about a “just transition”, Polish Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka, who presided over the talks, said. As a graduate of Paris’ elite Ecole Polytechnique, a physicist, an economist and an engineer, his favored solution is electric vehicles. With fewer moving parts and less wasted heat than internal combustion engines, he says they will help even if they run on coal-fired power. As a citizen of a country that switched in 1989 from “a centrally planned to a market economy,” Kurtyka has first-hand experience of deep change. “In my young days, growing up in Krakow, that was a completely different city from now. At 8 p.m. the lights switched off. You could not open the window because of air pollution,” he said. In Katowice, some residents say they still can’t let the air in and are not confident that is about to change.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will deploy tens of thousands of police nationwide and around 8,000 in Paris on Saturday to handle a fifth weekend of ‘yellow vest’ protests, although the movement appears to be losing steam after concessions by President Emmanuel Macron. The chief of police in Paris said concerns remained about violent groups infiltrating the protests. Anti-riot officers will protect landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and prevent people getting close to the presidential palace. “We need to be prepared for worst-case scenarios,” police chief Michel Delpuech told RTL radio. He expected businesses in the capital to be less affected this weekend after heavy disruption over the past three weeks when major stores shut, hotels suffered cancellations and tourists stayed away during the usually busy run-up to Christmas. Nicknamed “Acte V” of the protests, the yellow vest demonstrators will take to the streets this weekend as France recovers from an unrelated attack on a Christmas market in the eastern city of Strasbourg on Tuesday, when a gunman shot and killed three people and wounded several others. Hundreds of police officers were redeployed to Strasbourg to search for the gunman, who was shot dead in an exchange of fire on Thursday evening. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said it was time for the yellow vests to scale down their protests and accept they had achieved their aims. Police officers also deserved a break, he added. “I’d rather have the police force doing their real job, chasing criminals and combating the terrorism threat, instead of securing roundabouts where a few thousand people keep a lot of police busy,” he said. (Graphic - Yellow vests in France tmsnrt.rs/2SIjOaN)  Attractions such as the Louvre museum and Opera Garnier will be open this weekend, as will luxury department stores like Galeries Lafayette and Printemps. Last Saturday they were closed as thousands of sometimes violent protesters tore through the city. The previous weekend the Arc de Triomphe was vandalised, cars were overturned and torched and businesses smashed up. The protests have taken a toll on the economy, with output in the last quarter of the year set to be half initial projections, while Macron’s concessions are likely to push the budget deficit above an EU agreed limit. The yellow vest movement, which began as a protest against fuel taxes and then grew into an anti-Macron alliance, appears to have calmed since the president announced a series of measures to help the working poor. However, many people wearing the high-visibility motorists’ safety jackets which are the symbol of the protests were manning barricades outside cities on Friday.  After heavy criticism for not being seen to respond to the protesters’ complaints, Macron made a TV address this week during which he said he understood their concerns and acknowledged the need for a different approach.  As well cancelling fuel tax increases that were due to kick in next month, Macron said he would increase the minimum wage by 100 euros (£90) a month from January and reduce taxes for poorer pensioners, among other measures.  Since the first yellow vest protests on Nov. 17, supporters  have kept up a steady stream of dissent, although the numbers joining marches have steadily fallen.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday he had no mandate to reopen Brexit negotiations with Britain, while the head of the bloc’s executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he “admired” Prime Minister Theresa May.  Tusk and Juncker were speaking at a news conference after two days of talks at an EU summit that were dominated by the issue of Brexit and saw the other 27 national leaders of the bloc offer May only vague assurances over their Brexit deal.  “I have no mandate to organise any further negotiations. We have to exclude any further opening of the withdrawal agreement,” Tusk said. “But of course, we are staying here in Brussels and I’m always at the PM’s disposal.” Juncker, captured by cameras earlier on Friday during an apparently heated exchange with May, said: “We have to bring down the temperature” around Brexit talks.  He said he did not mean to offend May and his comments describing the British position as “nebulous” referred to the broader state of the Brexit debate in the United Kingdom. “We sypmathyse with Mrs May,” Juncker told a news conference. “I have the highest respect for the British PM.” He added the EU, in answering May’s plea for more assurances on the Brexit deal so that she could get it past her parliament, promised to start negotiations with the UK on their new trade deal “the second after” their divorce deal is approved, so that the contentious Irish backstop hopefully never has to kick in.  Tusk also offered his words of respect. “We have treated PM May with the outmost respect, all of us. We really appreciate the efforts to ratify our common agreement,” Tusk said. “We have treated PM May with much greater empathy and respect than some British members of parliament.” Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska and Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-tusk-juncker/eus-tusk-says-no-more-brexit-negotiations-idUKKBN1OD21H,2019-02-08,,EU's Tusk says no more Brexit negotiations
2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm Inc patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues. Apple will carry out the software updates at the start of next week “to address any possible concern about our compliance with the order”, the firm said in a statement sent to Reuters. Earlier this week, Qualcomm said a Chinese court had ordered a ban on sales of some older iPhone models for violating two of its patents, though intellectual property lawyers said the ban would likely take time to enforce. “Based on the iPhone models we offer today in China, we believe we are in compliance,” Apple said. “Early next week we will deliver a software update for iPhone users in China addressing the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case.” In a statement, Qualcomm’s general counsel Don Rosenberg said “Apple continues to disregard and violate the Fuzhou court’s orders” despite the planned software changes. “They are legally obligated to immediately cease sales, offers for sale and importation of the devices identified in the orders and to prove compliance in court,” he said in the statement. The case, brought by Qualcomm, is part of a global patent dispute between the two U.S. companies that includes dozens of lawsuits. It creates uncertainty over Apple’s business in one of its biggest markets at a time when concerns over waning demand for new iPhones are battering its shares. Qualcomm has said the Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in China found Apple infringed two patents held by the chipmaker and ordered an immediate ban on sales of older iPhone models, from the 6S through the X. Apple has filed a request for reconsideration with the court, a copy of which Qualcomm shared with Reuters.  Qualcomm and Apple disagree about whether the court order means iPhone sales must be halted.  The court’s preliminary injunction, which the chipmaker also shared with Reuters, orders an immediate block, though lawyers say Apple could take steps to stall the process. All iPhone models were available for purchase on Apple’s China website on Friday. Qualcomm, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, filed its case against Apple in China in late 2017, saying the iPhone maker infringed patents on features related to resizing photographs and managing apps on a touch screen. Apple argues the injunction should be lifted as continuing to sell iPhones does not constitute “irreparable harm” to Qualcomm, a key consideration for a preliminary injunction, the copy of its reconsideration request dated Dec. 10 shows. “That’s one of the reasons why in a very complicated patent litigation case the judge would be reluctant to grant a preliminary injunction,” said Yiqiang Li, a patent lawyer at Faegre Baker Daniels. Apple’s reconsideration request also says any ban on iPhone sales would impact its Chinese suppliers and consumers as well as the tax revenue it pays to authorities. The request adds the injunction could force Apple to settle with Qualcomm. But it was not clear whether this referred to the latest case or their broader legal dispute. Qualcomm has paid a 300 million yuan ($43.54 million) bond to cover potential damages to Apple from a sales ban and Apple is willing to pay a “counter security” of double that to get the ban lifted, the copy of the reconsideration request shows. Apple did not immediately respond to questions about the reconsideration request and Reuters was not independently able to confirm its authenticity. Yiqiang Li said the case would undoubtedly ramp up pressure on Apple, especially if a ban was enforced. “I think that Qualcomm and Apple, they always have those IP litigations to try to force the other side to make concessions. They try to get their inch somewhere. That’s always the game.” Reporting by Adam Jourdan in Shanghai and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Phil Berlowitz",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-apple-qualcomm-china/apple-to-push-software-update-in-china-as-qualcomm-case-threatens-sales-ban-idUKKBN1OD0B7,2019-02-08,"Apple Inc , facing a court ban in China on some of its iPhone models over alleged infringement of Qualcomm Inc  patents, said on Friday it will push software updates to users in a bid to resolve potential issues.",Apple to push software update in China as Qualcomm case threatens sales ban
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government is seeking candidates to replace Renault’s (RENA.PA) embattled boss Carlos Ghosn, as some board members began to voice doubts about keeping him in office after his indictment in Japan for suspected misconduct, several sources told Reuters. In a statement on Friday, interim chairman Philippe Lagayette said Renault’s board did not consider replacing Ghosn at a meeting the previous day and denied reports of boardroom divisions. At Thursday’s meeting, Renault directors were briefed on an investigation by alliance partner Nissan (7201.T) that led to Ghosn’s arrest last month. He was charged this week over the company’s failure to declare $43 million in deferred income he had arranged to receive. Nissan fired Ghosn as chairman three days after his detention, but Renault has resisted pressure to dismiss him, as the scandal strains their carmaking alliance. The Renault board stuck by its earlier decision to keep him on, with its lead director standing in as interim chairman and deputy CEO Thierry Bollore heading operations. In an initial statement issued by Renault after the meeting, the board “noted that, at this stage, it does not have information concerning Carlos Ghosn’s defence.” But during the five-hour session, several directors led by Cherie Blair, wife of the British former prime minister Tony Blair, began to express impatience with the situation, two people with knowledge of the matter said. “What she said, in effect, was that we can’t remain in this situation forever,” one source said of Blair. “At some point you need to move forward and move on.” Lagayette “refutes the press rumours reporting differences of opinion” among board members at the meeting, Renault said in its statement on Friday. In a separate statement to Reuters, Blair said she was “saddened that the confidentially of board meetings has been breached in particular in respect of your entirely inaccurate description of my contribution.” She added: “I can confirm that I, along with other members of the board, asked a number of questions of Renault’s lawyers concerning their knowledge of the Japanese legal system, their estimation as to how long Mr Ghosn will be held custody, and their best estimation of when Mr Ghosn would be available to resume his duties.” French officials have already begun listing possible candidates to replace Ghosn as CEO, the two sources and a third person close to the company said. Senior Toyota executive Didier Leroy will be considered, one of the sources said. “There’s nothing official yet but the government is working on a lineup,” the source said. “They’re ready to turn the page.” A finance ministry official declined to comment. The government, Renault’s biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake and two board seats, typically plays a major role in succession planning. “I have no comment on speculation, and I am 100 percent concentrated on my job at Toyota,” Leroy told Reuters. The boardroom crisis has shaken the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, with Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa calling for changes to weaken the French parent’s control. Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose reciprocal 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan in turn controls Mitsubishi via a 34 percent holding. Blair’s board intervention was echoed during the meeting by two other independent directors as well as Renault staff representatives, two of the sources said - with some also voicing misgivings over management’s handling of the crisis. At the risk of worsening tensions, Bollore instructed Nissan to refrain from contacting Renault directors ahead of the meeting, Reuters reported on Tuesday, as the Japanese carmaker sought to share its findings. Directors had also clashed with Renault managers over their right to hire independent board counsel with access to Nissan’s findings, two other people said.  Company attorneys answering to Mouna Sepehri - who doubles as board secretary and head of Ghosn’s CEO office - have so far declined to share the report with directors or their lawyers, citing the secrecy of the investigation. Interim chairman Lagayette played down talk of tensions. “The board of directors, contrary to certain press allegations, has congratulated the company’s managers” for their handling of the situation, Lagayette said. The meeting had “not considered the potential succession of Mr Ghosn”, he added. Under French government pressure, Ghosn had been exploring a deeper tie-up or even a full merger between the alliance partners, despite strong reservations at Nissan. Whether or not they broke the law, Ghosn’s undisclosed compensation plans - doubling his total Nissan package for the five years to March 2015 - are politically sensitive in France, where President Emmanuel Macron has been battling protests. Defence arguments advanced by Ghosn’s lawyers and supporters have not contested the plans’ existence. His Japanese lawyer Motonari Otsuru said in a media statement that the pay agreements had not been properly ratified. Nissan has said its whistleblower investigation also uncovered personal use of company funds and other misconduct, detailed in the report shared with Renault lawyers this week. Renault, which launched an audit into its own payments to Ghosn after his arrest, said on Thursday its “preliminary conclusion” was that his compensation had been “in compliance with applicable law” and governance guidelines. Ghosn and an alleged accomplice, Nissan director Greg Kelly, remain in custody and have had limited opportunity to respond to the allegations or defend themselves, particularly in public.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s crude steel output dropped to its lowest in seven months in November, government data showed on Friday, hit by shrinking profit-margins at mills and winter restrictions on emissions. The world’s top steelmaker produced 77.62 million tonnes of steel last month, down from a record 82.55 million tonnes in October and the weakest level since April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. That compares to 66.15 million tonnes in November last year. Average daily output also dipped to the lowest level since April, at 2.59 million tonnes, according to Reuters calculations based on the NBS data. But that was still much higher than the 2.2 million tonnes per day produced in November 2017. Profit-margins at Chinese steel mills plunged more than 66 percent in November, data tracked by Jinrui Futures showed, because of oversupply in the market and tepid demand from end-users. The weekly utilisation rates at blast furnaces in steel mills in China were around 67 percent last month before dipping to 65.75 percent this week as winter restrictions started in mid-November, according to data from Mysteel consultancy. That is up from 62 percent in same period last year. The China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute, a government consultancy, expects China’s 2018 crude steel output to reach a record of 923 million tonnes due to firm demand and fat profit-margins this year. However, output for the rest of 2018 may fall as mills might be ordered to halt some production to reduce emissions under pollution control rules.  Major steelmaking cities Tangshan and Xuzhou have asked mills to further curtail output as city officials are concerned they will not meet their pollution reduction targets for the year. The government expects several bouts of heavy pollution to blanket northern China in December. The industrial heartland of Hebei, Shandong and even the southwestern province Sichuan have issued smog alerts this week. Output over the first 11 months of the year was 857.37 million tonnes, up 6.7 percent on the same period last year, according to the NBS data.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate delivered a rare double rebuke to President Donald Trump on Saudi Arabia on Thursday, voting to end U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blame the Saudi crown prince for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.         The votes were largely symbolic because to become law the resolutions would have to pass the House of Representatives, whose Republican leaders have blocked any legislation intended to rebuke the Saudis. In a historic move, Senators voted 56-41 to end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s civil war. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire human crisis, with the country on the brink of famine.  It was the first time either chamber of Congress had backed a resolution to withdraw U.S. forces from a military engagement under the War Powers Act. That law, passed in 1973, limits the president’s ability to commit U.S. forces to potential hostilities without congressional approval. Seven of Trump’s fellow Republicans joined Senate Democrats to back the measure. Immediately after the Yemen vote, the Senate backed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi’s murder and insisting that Saudi Arabia hold accountable anyone responsible for his death. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The Senate vote, which was unanimous, puts pressure on House leaders to allow a vote on the Khashoggi resolution this month, before Congress adjourns for the year. “Unanimously, the United States Senate has said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is a strong statement. I think it speaks to the values that we hold dear,” said Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and sponsor of the resolution. Trump has said he wants Washington to stand by the Saudi government and the prince, despite a CIA assessment it was likely he ordered Khashoggi’s killing. He promised to veto the war powers resolution. Opponents of the resolution are reluctant to take any action to disrupt the strategic U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, seen as an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran, arch-enemy of close U.S. ally Israel.  Administration officials also see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be unveiled by the Trump administration. And they have argued that ending U.S. support could complicate Yemen peace talks. Asked to comment on the Khashoggi resolution, a White House spokesperson noted sanctions imposed on 17 Saudis over the killing and said, “Our shared strategic interests with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remain, and we continue to view as achievable the twin imperatives of protecting America and holding accountable those responsible for the killing.” But backers of the resolutions, including some Republicans, promised to press ahead. On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators promised to push in the new Congress legislation for humanitarian sanctions and a ban on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. “What’s next is to do everything possible to demand that the House of Representatives do what the members of the House want done, an opportunity to vote on this,” Senator Bernie Sanders told Reuters. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he would bring the resolution up again after the new Congress convenes in January, when Democrats will control the House of Representatives. The measure could pass the Senate again, given the bipartisan support it received on Thursday, even though Trump’s Republicans will have a larger majority in the upper chamber next year. “I think we’re going to win in the Senate and I think we are going to do what the American people want, that is to end our participation in this horrific and destructive war,” Sanders said. There was no immediate word from House leadership on whether they would allow a vote on either resolution. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who briefed House members on Thursday, urged senators during a briefing last month to keep supporting the Saudi-led coalition. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said her members supported congressional action. “There certainly is an appetite in our caucus for that,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the next House Speaker, told reporters. Yemen’s warring parties agreed on Thursday to cease fighting for the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah and withdraw their troops, the first significant breakthrough for U.N.-led peace efforts in five years of conflict.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders arrive in Brussels for two days of talks on Brexit, the euro zone, migration and Russia, among others.  Below are some of their comments made on arrival.  “We can have a political discussion tonight, but the legal framework and the agreement that were negotiated are not supposed to change.”  “It’s important to avoid any ambiguity: we cannot reopen a legal agreement, we can’t renegotiate what was negotiated for several months.” “It’s up to Theresa May to tell us what political solution she expects to pursue to find a majority for this deal.” “The kind of things that we talked about was how we might give the UK government a greater assurance that the future relationship treaty will actually be negotiated in an expeditious manner and will be negotiated and agreed long before we’d have to consider things such as the extension to the transition period or the implementation of the backstop.” “In that space, we all accept that the backstop is the backstop, it’s an insurance policy, nobody wants us to have to invoke it. And if it is invoked, we want to make sure that it’s only for as short a period as possible.” “If the backstop has an expiry date, if there is a unilateral exit clause, this is not a backstop. That would be to render it inoperable. That would mean reopening the substance of the withdrawal agreement and the European Union is unequivocal that this is not an option.” “The objective here is to get this agreement ratified.” “The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. Any agreement that deals with the withdrawal has to be an agreement between the EU and the UK... Ireland is Europe when it comes to these negotiations.”   “What we want is an enduring assurance that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland no matter what the circumstances. That an assurance that the UK government gave us over a year ago... The Withdrawal Agreement puts that into law and now we’d like to see that agreement ratified.” “It’s within the gift of the UK government and the UK parliament to take the threat of no-deal off the table. It impossible if the UK wishes to revoke the article 50... to seek an extension of the Article 50 so that the UK parliament has more time to come together and decide what they would like the outcome to be.” “It seems to me there is majority in Westminster in favour of the proposition that there shouldn’t be a no deal.” “Brexit Christmas wish: finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver,” she said on Twitter in posting a picture of a chocolate Christmas tree. “I think the withdrawal agreement has been negotiated very well.” “We have our principles and I do not see how the withdrawal agreement can be changed. We can (see) if there are additional assurances but in this the 27 EU member states are together and make their interests clear.” “We want very, very good relations with Great Britain after Great Britain has left the European Union.” “We are prepared to accommodate Theresa May.” “I think we have a good deal. My impression is that on the British side, people have not yet understood that this is a good deal.” “It is impossible to open the negotiated withdrawal agreement. That is now a given.  “There is nobody in their right mind in Europe who wants to use the backstop.” “The UK decided to leave the EU, to draw these red lines.” “Given Brexit, given the red lines, this deal is now on the table.” “We cannot break open or start to re-negotiate the withdrawal agreement. Then it is about clarification, the question is what language you put in this clarification. This is all up for debate.” “Today is about de-mystifying this whole Northern Ireland backstop. Nobody in the EU wants to use it. But we need to have it.” “How to make that clarification on paper - that’s something we have to look at tonight.” Q: Would EU extend Article 50? A: “If and when. It’s up to the UK to ask for that. At the moment, no such thing is on the table.” “I am sure that both sides, we need the agreement. The United Kingdom and also the European Union.” “We want to help, first of all. Our goal is that the new relationship is ready before the backstop (enters into force).” “Legally binding will be a bit difficult... Let’s see if we can find something from the legal side as well.” “I recognise the strength of concern in the House of Commons and that is what I will be putting to colleagues today.” “I don’t expect an immediate breakthrough but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.” “I said that in my heart I would love to able to lead the Conservative Party into the next general election but I think it is right that the party feels it would prefer to go into that election with a new leader.” “I will be seeking the legal and political assurances I believe we need.” “We will clarify certain points. We will not renegotiate the whole document. I am happy that Mrs May received support yesterday because otherwise we would have been heading towards a no deal.” “You should not forget that the whole referendum was based on lies. There were so many people who said that billions of euros would come back from Brussels into the health service... I would be not against it if Theresa May said rather a second referendum than a no deal.... This idea that you could just leave Europe in a mere click of the fingers and that you would only get benefits - a win for the UK and a loss for the rest of the world - we see that’s not the case.” “We are ready to help.” “The Council... will confirm our strong position and our demand for Russia to release the vessels and the crews.” “We’ll reaffirm not only our strong support to territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine but also our strong policy of non-recognition of the annexation of the Crimean peninsula; and a very substantial package of support to Ukraine that the EU has put in place so far and is ready to strengthen.” “We must support Ukraine and the people of Ukraine. We must support Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.” “It is fully unacceptable that the flow of migrants to Europe is managed by smuggler mafias.” “We have to help north African countries in a way like we did with Turkey. We have to help individual African countries. We want to help them improve their lives at home.” “This is not the time to enter a debate on France”.  “We are in the process of fighting terrorism.” “This is not a good moment to discuss other issues.” “It is not for us to say what should be done in internal French politics.” Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Alastair Macdonald, Jan Strupczewski, Elizabeth Piper, Francesco Guarascio, Gabriela Baczynska",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-summit-highlights/highlights-eu-leaders-arrive-for-two-day-summit-dominated-by-brexit-idUKKBN1OC1NA,2019-02-08,"European Union leaders arrive in Brussels for two days of talks on Brexit, the euro zone, migration and Russia, among others.",Highlights - EU leaders arrive for two-day summit dominated by Brexit

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition regulator has delayed plans to publish its initial view on a probe into Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) proposed 7.3 billion pound takeover of rival Asda (WMT.N). The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Thursday it would notify provisional findings and consider possible remedies in “January/early February”, ahead of the publication of its final report in “early March”. The CMA had previously said its initial report would be issued in “early January”. It said the revised timetable was unrelated to Wednesday’s move by Sainsbury’s and Asda to challenge a refusal by the CMA to give them longer to respond to the latest evidence. The companies are pressing ahead with an application to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) for a judicial review of the CMA’s phase two investigation of the deal, which started in September.  The companies have asked the CMA for an extra 11 working days over the Christmas period to respond to a large amount of evidence material recently provided to them but the CMA has declined the request. “The change to the administrative timetable does not relate to the litigation that has been brought before CAT,” a CMA spokesman said. “We will be vigorously defending our position (on Friday) in the CAT, as we are clear that any further delay to the timetable could be seriously detrimental to the investigation,” he said. Wednesday’s development sent shares in Sainsbury’s down over 5 percent as it pointed to growing tension between the two companies and the regulator. Sainsbury’s Chief Executive Mike Coupe had already said last month that the firm would challenge in the courts any unfavourable final ruling by the CMA on the deal if it believed it was not backed up by published evidence. Sainsbury’s shares were up 1 percent at 1305 GMT on Thursday.

Asked if he believed legislation would be required to revoke Article 50 or whether it could be done by a vote in parliament, Cox said: “That is a matter that is under review.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union has worked on creative solutions for Britain’s departure from the European Union for months but has nothing left to offer, a foreign policy expert for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives told a media outlet. “All possibilities have been exhausted. There’s nothing left,” Norbert Roettgen told the RND network of newspapers in an interview due to be published on Friday. “The loss of contact with reality in the Tory party is the real reason for the disaster,” he said, pointing to the decision of rebels in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party to trigger a no-confidence vote in their leader and then failing to muster the numbers to unseat her.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote by the Conservative Party on Wednesday, but a mutiny by more than a third of her lawmakers indicated parliament was heading towards deadlock over Brexit. While 200 Conservative lawmakers voted in support of May as leader, 117 dissented, indicating opposition not only from several dozen supporters of a hard Brexit but also from many more pragmatic lawmakers - and signalling that she was no nearer to passing her EU divorce agreement. It was not the robust affirmation she needed as she heads to Brussels on Thursday to ask the other 27 EU leaders, who have made room for her at a summit, for clarification of the deal to reassure the doubters. On Monday, May had cancelled a parliamentary vote on her deal, struck after two years of negotiations and designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc, after admitting it would be heavily defeated. With Britain due to leave the EU on March 29, parliament’s opposition has suddenly opened up possibilities including a potentially disorderly exit with no deal or even another referendum on membership. Speaking in Downing Street after the vote, May said she would listen to those who had voted against her and seek legal assurances on the most controversial part of her deal - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland. Many in her party fear that these “backstop” measures could last indefinitely. “A significant number of colleagues did cast a vote against me and I’ve listened to what they said,” May said. “We now have to get on with the job of delivering Brexit for the British people.” However, EU leaders have lined up to say they have no intention of changing the agreement.   And diplomatic sources in Brussels told Reuters the draft of a document being prepared for May included only the possibility that the bloc would look into giving Britain more assurances over the Irish backstop, without offering any immediately. Eurosceptic critics of the deal within May’s party triggered the no-confidence vote hours after she returned from a whistle-stop tour to meet European leaders at the start of the week. Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the eurosceptics who see her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. “It is a terrible result for the prime minister,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction, told BBC Television. “The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.” May, who voted to remain in the EU in the referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election.    But the confidence vote was also a proxy for the party’s divisions over Europe. “If you’re a PM and a third of your MPs vote against you, that is very bad news,” eurosceptic lawmaker Mark Francois told Reuters. The Northern Irish party that props up her government - and strongly opposes her withdrawal deal - said the fundamental arithmetic in parliament was unchanged. The opposition Labour Party said she must now bring the agreement back to parliament.  Brexit is Britain’s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. The outcome will shape Britain’s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for the economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected. “It is right at the top end of the number of people who were expected to be against her,” said John Curtice, one of Britain’s leading polling experts. “It is not unlikely that she will go by some point in April-May time.” Additional reporting by Andy Bruce, Kate Holton, Andy MacAskill, Ben Martin, David Milliken, William Schomberg and Paul Sandle in London and Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels; Writing by Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Mark John and Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/pm-may-survives-party-confidence-vote-but-brexit-deal-still-teetering-idUKKBN1OB0K1,2019-02-08,"Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote by the Conservative Party on Wednesday, but a mutiny by more than a third of her lawmakers indicated parliament was heading towards deadlock over Brexit.",PM May survives party confidence vote but Brexit deal still teetering

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party on Wednesday triggered a confidence vote in her leadership, plunging the country’s planned divorce from the European Union into deeper uncertainty. Reaction: Prime Minister Theresa May “I will contest that vote with everything I’ve got.” “A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country’s future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it.” “Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country.” Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: “The time for dithering and delay by this government is over. The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before parliament and let’s have the vote. “Will she now put this deal before parliament and halt this escalating crisis that is so damaging to the lives of so many people in this country?” Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond “The Prime Minister has worked hard in the national interest since the day she took office and will have my full support in the vote tonight. Her deal means we leave the EU on time, whilst protecting our jobs and our businesses.” John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy, JP Morgan     “If the government is led by a hard Brexiteer or parliament opts for a no deal, I would say sterling could fall 5 percent, it could fall 10. The reason is from there the focus will be around potential capital flight or long-term hedging as opposed to the liquidation of investor positions by traditional asset managers or hedge funds.  “The base case is eventually there will be a realisation that soft Brexit is better than hard Brexit and that there’s only one option to achieve that soft Brexit and a vote will pass even if there’s one or two failures first. But the timeline on this is obviously unclear. And there are other potential scenarios which add to the volatility of the market.”  Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays:  “We still think a crash out is very unlikely. Our base case is that we get a deal (but) the market is starting to price in a very high probability of a no deal scenario.  “I don’t think we can bet on who will win. I think it’s about the market’s interpretation of the capacity of the person in charge to get a deal, and about the timing left to get a deal done.  “I’m not so keen to predict a market move on a hard basis because things can change so quickly that I think no one is trying to position for this. We need to see some clarity on Brexit before people commit new money to Europe. People need to know a hard Brexit is going to be avoided.”     Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss “I fully support the prime minister and believe it would be completely wrong to have a leadership election now. She is the right person to deliver Brexit and has shown herself to be strong and determined.” Pro-EU Conservative lawmaker Anna Soubry “Removing Theresa May at this most critical of times is grossly irresponsible.” Environment Secretary Michael Gove “I am absolutely sure the prime minister will win. “I am backing the Prime Minister 100 percent - and I urge every Conservative MP to do the same. She is battling hard for our country and no one is better placed to ensure we deliver on the British people’s decision to leave the EU.” International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt: “The Prime Minister has my full support, not least because she has always done what she firmly believes is in the national interest. Our country needs us all to fight for a good deal and prepare for a no deal scenario. All eyes and hands should be on that task.” Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd: “The PM has my full support.  At this critical time we need to support and work with the PM to deliver on leaving the EU, & our domestic agenda - ambitious for improvements to people’s lives & to build on growth of wages & jobs.” European Research Group Chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg and Deputy Chairman Steve Baker: “Theresa May’s plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our Party will rightly not tolerate it. Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May’s leadership. In the national interest, she must go.” Conservative Party donor Alexander Temerko: “A new Prime Minister would definitely be good news for British business. A new Prime Minister would have at least some chance of making progress on Brexit. Mrs May has exhausted all her options and her staying in power is just creating more uncertainty for our economy. “Big and medium-sized business needs a robust guarantee to plan for the long term, not the myopic declaration we’re currently being sold.” Japanese investment bank Nomura: “We expect Theresa May should survive the vote... The big risk? It’s a secret ballot.” Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt: “I am backing Theresa May tonight. Being PM most difficult job imaginable right now and the last thing the country needs is a damaging and long leadership contest. Brexit was never going to be easy but she is the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29.” Home Secretary Sajid Javid: “The last thing our country needs right now is a Conservative Party leadership election.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) and Asda, the British supermarket groups that want to combine their businesses, will challenge a refusal  by the regulator probing their 7.3 billion pound ($9.2 billion) deal to give them longer to respond to the latest evidence. The move sent shares in Sainsbury’s down as much as 5.5 percent as it pointed to growing tension between the two companies and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) regulator.

The deal, agreed in April, between second-ranked Sainsbury’s and the British arm of Walmart (WMT.N), the number three player, could see the combined group vault Tesco (TSCO.L) as market leader. It is being assessed by the CMA, which has said it will publish preliminary findings in early January, ahead of a final report in March. Both companies said on Wednesday they will lodge an application with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) for a judicial review of the CMA’s phase two investigation of the deal, which started in September. Their application requests a review of the CMA probe’s timetable and process. “The current timetable does not give the parties or the CMA sufficient time to provide and consider all the evidence given the unprecedented scale and complexity of the case,” Sainsbury’s and Asda said. Sainsbury’s and Asda have said they do not believe the CMA will insist on a level of store disposals in locations where they both have shops that would make the deal unpalatable. The companies asked the CMA for an extra 11 working days over the Christmas period to respond to a large amount of material recently provided to them. The CMA declined the request. Sainsbury’s and Asda feared that without the extension they would not be able to meaningfully respond to some core issues before the CMA’s provisional findings are published. But the CMA said granting an extension would put its ability to complete the investigation by the required deadline “at very serious risk”. “As with all of our merger reviews, we construct our timetable to ensure that everyone has the chance to have their say, including customers, the companies involved and suppliers,” it said. The CMA said its first priority was assessing if customers would face higher prices or a lower quality of service. Tesco has said the deal should not be cleared without “extensive remedies”, and number four Morrisons (MRW.L) has raised concerns about an “effective duopoly” - Tesco and Sainsbury’s-Asda - controlling in excess of 60 percent of the market.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Northern Ireland’s largest Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein stepped up calls on Wednesday for a split from the United Kingdom, saying a referendum on Irish unity should be held in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit. Sinn Fein has been regularly calling for a vote for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland since Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016 while most voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain. However its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, raised the demand for the second successive day in the Dublin parliament, where - separate to their colleagues in the devolved assembly in Belfast - its lawmakers make up the third largest party. “A crash out Brexit will be catastrophic for our island. It will rupture our economy, our social fabric and our peace accords so the contingency planning required goes well beyond the recruitment of additional officials,” McDonald told Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. “In the event of a no deal situation arriving, it is the strong view of Sinn Fein that a referendum on unity must be advanced as a matter of urgency and priority.” Varadkar dismissed the timing of Sinn Fein’s call as “destructive and disruptive”, a day after McDonald said she raised it in a telephone call with British Prime Minister Theresa May, whom she said also disagreed with her. “I don’t believe now is the time for us to start talking about border polls,” Varadkar said. Under a 1998 peace deal that ended 30 years of sectarian violence in the province, the British government can call a referendum if it appears likely a majority of those voting would seek to form part of a united Ireland. A LucidTalk/Times newspaper poll on Friday showed that if there was a referendum next year, 30 percent of voters would definitely vote for a united Ireland if Britain leaves the EU on the terms Theresa May is currently proposing, but that would rise to 48 percent if Britain quit the bloc without a deal. The pollsters said the opposition to holding a referendum was driven by pro-British unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK with the province’s Irish nationalists leading calls for a vote. When deferring a parliamentary vote on her deal this week, May told lawmakers that if they cared about preserving the union  between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, they should listen to the people of Northern Ireland who she said supported her deal.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - An attempt to oust British Prime Minister Theresa May gathered pace on Tuesday, a day after her decision to delay a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal for fear of a rout angered many in her Conservative Party. With May on a tour of European capitals to try to secure “reassurances” to calm the crisis at home, the BBC and other media cited sources as saying the required number of letters from Conservative lawmakers calling for a no-confidence vote in her leadership of the party had been met. Only one member of the party knows how many lawmakers have submitted their letters - but her position looked more precarious than ever. With less than four months left until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, May’s premiership and her deal to stave off a disorderly departure or a bid to stop Brexit are hanging by a thread. If she is toppled — and it is far from certain that she would lose a vote among all the party’s members of parliament — — could further complicate Brexit. The BBC cited multiple sources as saying the required 48 letters had been reached.  The chairman of the party’s 1922 committee of backbench lawmakers, Graham Brady, asked to see May on Wednesday after her weekly question session in parliament, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted. Her chief whip, or party enforcer, entered her Downing Street residence on Tuesday night. Lawmaker Andrew Bridgen, a critic of May, said he believed Conservative members of parliament would vote on her leadership at the first opportunity, which could be on Wednesday night. May’s postponement of the vote on her deal to maintain close ties with the EU after leaving in March infuriated lawmakers on all sides of the debate - from hardline Brexit supporters to those who want to remain in the EU. Acknowledging that she faced “significant losses” if she asked parliament to vote on Tuesday, May had said she would try to ease lawmakers’ concerns, particularly over the so-called Northern Irish “backstop”. That took her on a tour of EU capitals on Tuesday. But there little sign that she might be able to do away with the backstop, a guarantee that there will be no return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Her former Brexit minister, David Davis, wrote in the Telegraph newspaper that “the prime minister’s latest ploy of looking for more fudge with which to buy off the House of Commons will not work”. He instead urged a change of strategy - rip up her deal and pursue a free trade deal similar to one that the EU has with Canada. “So now is the moment to seize control and deliver our own destiny,” he wrote. “We are crying out for leadership and direction. Kicking the can down the road is not a strategy, it’s a delaying tactic.” The message from the EU was also clear: It could give legally-binding assurances about how it interprets the exit treaty, but would not countenance reopening the text itself. Donald Tusk, who will chair an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, tweeted after talking to May: “Clear that EU 27 wants to help. The question is how.” Two sources said Merkel had told her own German conservative parliamentary group there would be no more negotiations, but efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances. May told Merkel that it was in nobody’s interest for Britain to leave with no accord, the sources said. European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said: “The deal we achieved is the best possible. It’s the only deal possible. There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation ... “But of course there is room enough to give further clarifications and further interpretations without opening the withdrawal agreement.” May’s team has continued working to try to get the vote through, with her ministers telling parliament that it will get its vote before Jan. 21. The pound, which has lost 25 cents against the U.S. dollar since the 2016 referendum, fell again amid the reports that May would face a leadership challenge. The biggest obstacle to approval remains the Irish backstop.  May’s critics say it could leave Britain subject to EU rules indefinitely. The EU has said neither side wants the backstop to take effect, but it has to be part of the deal just in case. With little hope of scrapping it, the options open to Britain range from a chaotic no-deal Brexit to risking the wrath of Brexit backers by calling the whole thing off. Both May’s Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party have pledged to implement the result of the 2016 referendum, in which Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU. But more and more backbench lawmakers, along with three of four living ex-premiers, say the only option may be a new referendum with an option to stay. The EU’s top court ruled this week that Britain could abandon Brexit with no consequences up until the moment it finally leaves.  Former prime minister John Major, who also faced a Conservative revolt over Europe in the 1990s, said Britain must revoke its divorce notice immediately. “It’s clear we now need the most precious commodity of all: time. Time for serious and profound reflection by both parliament and people.” Additional reporting by Michael Holden, Kate Holton, Elizabeth Piper, Andrew MacAskill, Jan Strupczewski and Gabriela Baczynska; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Peter Graff, Andrew Heavens, Richard Balmforth, Kevin Liffey, Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/after-brexit-vote-delay-leadership-challenge-looms-for-may-idUKKBN1OA0MH,2019-02-08,"An attempt to oust British Prime Minister Theresa May gathered pace on Tuesday, a day after her decision to delay a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal for fear of a rout angered many in her Conservative Party.","After Brexit vote delay, leadership challenge looms for May"

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets edged higher in volatile trade on Tuesday as investors waded through a chunk of geopolitical headlines, including threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to shut down the government over a funding fight and signs of a thaw in the U.S.-China trade battle.  European shares closed higher, in part from a boost in auto shares, and Wall Street opened on a strong note after a report that China is moving to cut import tariffs on American-made cars, which market participants viewed as a sign China is ready to make concessions on trade. That report came after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He exchanged views on the next stage of trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.  But U.S. stocks lost steam after the open and fell further after Trump openly sparred about government funding with the top two Democratic lawmakers during an Oval Office meeting, raising doubts a deal would be possible ahead of a deadline later this month.  “The key drivers of today’s volatility are the political and geopolitical headlines,” said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at Abbot Downing in Minneapolis. “We can’t control the headlines but the thing we can lean on is that the underlying fundamentals remain solid,” Schleif said. The S&P 500 traded in a wide range, gaining nearly 1.4 percent at the high and falling 0.62 percent at the low.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 53.02 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,370.24, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.94 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,636.78 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 11.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,031.83. Germany's DAX .GDAXI, which entered bear market territory last week and is Europe's most China-sensitive market, climbed 1.5 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 1.53 percent, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.09 percent, snapping a five-session skid. The uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, continued to haunt investors and held sterling near 20-month lows after British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed a vote on her deal. On Tuesday, German leader Angela Merkel ruled out further Brexit negotiations but said efforts were being made to give Britain reassurances.  Reports a threshold was reached to trigger a no confidence vote in May sent sterling to a fresh session low. Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2481, down 0.62 percent after hitting a low of 1.2479. After an initial softening, the dollar index .DXY, which  tracks the U.S. currency against six major peers, rose 0.25 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.31 percent to $1.132.     European bond markets were focused on France a day after President Emmanuel Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners, in further government concessions aimed at defusing weeks of often-violent protests, raising concerns over fiscal spending. In response, French bond yields rose to their highest spread in 20 months over Germany’s yields DE10FR10=RR, at 47.81 basis points.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will overshoot the European Union’s budget deficit ceiling next year without deeper spending cuts after President Emmanuel Macron caved in to anti-government protests. Macron announced wage increases for the poorest workers and a tax cut for most pensioners on Monday in an effort to quell a near month-long public revolt. But the measures will leave a 10 billion euro (8.64 billion pounds) hole in the Treasury’s finances, pushing France back over the EU deficit limit of 3 percent of national output and dealing a blow to Macron’s reformist credentials. “We are preparing a fiscal boost for workers by accelerating tax cuts so that work pays,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told parliament. “That inevitably has consequences on the deficit.”  Philippe did not give details on the impact of the concessions on public finances or possible spending cuts, saying only that the government aimed to keep spending from increasing.  “Under all likelihood, the 2019 public deficit will print above the 3.0 percent benchmark,” Societe Generale economist Michel Martinez wrote in a research note. Any failure to respect the EU deficit ceiling could shatter France’s fiscal credibility with its European partners after Paris flouted it for a decade before Macron took office. And any sign of leniency from Brussels could complicate the European Commission’s tense discussions with Italy about keeping its deficit down. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said Paris should be subject to the same treatment as Rome and now risked EU censure over its budget concessions. “If the deficit/GDP rules are valid for Italy, then I expect them to be valid for Macron,” Di Maio said.  France’s 10-year borrowing costs climbed to their highest level compared with Germany in a year-and-a-half on Tuesday. DE10FR10=RR Europe’s Scope credit rating agency said it was unlikely Macron would be able to push through reforms of France’s costly pension and healthcare systems if he continued to lose public support.  Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said Macron’s concessions would amount to 10 billion euros, including the cancelling of energy tax hikes announced last week. Darmanin told senators the government now expected a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2019, excluding the one-off impact of a long-planned payroll tax rebate scheme becoming a permanent tax cut at a cost of 20 billion euros.   That compares with a previous 2019 deficit/GDP forecast of 1.9 percent without one-offs, or 2.8 percent overall. The new, higher underlying deficit thus implies pushing the overall number towards 3.4 percent next year without measures to rein in spending. Moreover, the “yellow vest” protests are slowing economic growth. Two opinion polls on Tuesday showed roughly one in two French people think they should now end their protests. An Elysee official said on Monday France had some wiggle room on spending if the tax rebate was not taken into account. The European Union’s executive arm is to make a final assessment of France’s 2019 budget in the second quarter of next year when it releases new economic forecasts, a spokesman said.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vodafone’s (VOD.L) purchase of Liberty Global’s (LBTYA.O) assets in Germany and east Europe may damage competition in Germany and the Czech Republic, EU antitrust regulators said on Tuesday, as they opened a full-scale probe into the $21.8 billion (£17.13 billion) deal. The deal between the world’s second-largest mobile operator and U.S. cable pioneer John Malone’s Liberty would enable Vodafone to compete more effectively with Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) in the German rival’s home market. It also expands Vodafone’s reach in broadband, cable and mobile services elsewhere in Europe as it includes Liberty Global assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. The European Commission said some rivals might be shut out of the Czech market, where Vodafone offers mainly mobile telephony services and Liberty Global offers fixed services. In Germany, the deal might reduce competition in the retail fixed telecoms markets and retail TV markets, curb investments in next-generation networks and give the merged firm more power as a TV broadcaster, the EU competition enforcer said.  It saw no issues in Romania and Hungary and said it will decide whether to clear the deal by May 2. The deadline can be extended if Vodafone offers concessions. Reuters reported on Nov. 30 that the watchdog was set to launch a full-scale probe into the deal. Vodafone said it still expected EU approval by mid-2019. “On balance, we conclude based on the language in the press release that this transaction remains on track for a Phase II approval and closing,” Bernstein wrote in client note. The telecoms industry is hoping for a lighter regulatory touch from the Commission after it cleared without conditions Deutsche Telekom’s bid to acquire Tele2’s (TEL2b.ST) Dutch business despite earlier qualms. Telefonica Deutschland, which has called for the deal to be blocked, said it expected Vodafone to make every effort to avert the negative effects singled out by the Commission.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shale gas company Cuadrilla has again paused fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, northwest England, after tremors were detected, the company said. This marks the third time operations have been halted at the site following seismic activity under Britain’s so-called traffic light regulation system, since they began in October.  “A series of micro seismic events in Blackpool have been recorded on the British Geological Survey website this morning following hydraulic fracturing at our shale gas exploration site in Preston New Road, Lancashire,” Cuadrilla said in a statement. The largest tremor, of 1.5 magnitude, took place after fracking activities had already stopped, it said. “According to recent research by the University of Liverpool the impact would be like dropping a melon,” Cuadrilla said. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is opposed by environmentalists who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the government is keen to reduce the country’s reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around 80 percent of Britain’s homes. The company, which is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas (AJL.AX) and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, first attempted to frack gas near the coastal town of Blackpool in northwestern England in 2011, but the practice led to a 2.3 magnitude earth tremor. It said then that the quakes at that site were caused by an unusual combination of geological features, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected. “Cuadrilla will pause and continue to monitor micro seismicity for at least the next 18 hours... Well integrity has been checked and verified,” it said. Cuadrilla said last month it had extracted its first shale gas from the site. Gas flows were small but coming at such an early stage of the project were evidence of the site’s potential, it said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Six suspected migrants were rescued from a dinghy in the English Channel just off the port of Dover early on Tuesday morning, the interior ministry said. The five men and one woman all said they were from Iran, the latest in a growing trend of Iranians trying to reach Britain by sailing dinghies across some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to reach Britain. “They received a medical assessment and have now been transferred to immigration officials for interview, a ministry  spokesperson said. Nearly 100 would-be migrants, most of whom claimed they were Iranian, made similar journeys across the Channel to the UK last month.  The recent rise in the number of Iranians trying to enter the UK has been widely linked to Serbia’s offer of visa-free access to Iranians in August 2017 in an attempt to increase tourism. Hundreds of Iranians subsequently flew to Europe to take advantage of the offer.

2019-02-08,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A Canadian provincial court weighing whether to grant bail to a top executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], who is facing possible extradition to the United States, adjourned on Monday without deciding her fate. U.S. prosecutors want Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to be extradited to face accusations she misled multinational banks about Huawei’s control of a company operating in Iran, putting the banks at risk of violating U.S. sanctions which would incur severe penalties, court documents said. Meng, the 46-year-old daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested on Dec. 1 as she was changing planes in Vancouver. In a sworn affidavit, she said she is innocent and will contest the allegations against her at trial if she is surrendered to the United States. The judge in Monday’s bail hearing said he rolled the proceedings over to Tuesday at 10 a.m. PST (1 p.m. EDT/1800 GMT) because he wants to hear more about the issue of surety - who will take responsibility for Meng’s actions if she is released. Meng’s lawyer David Martin, who told the court high-tech surveillance devices and a 24-hour security detail would ensure his client does not flee and proposed a C$15 million (8.85 million pounds) bail guarantee, had offered her husband as surety. But the judge and the public prosecutor called into question whether Meng’s husband could perform this duty as he is not a resident of British Columbia, where Vancouver is located, and would not suffer if she were to breach her bail conditions. Meng’s arrest has roiled markets over fears it would exacerbate tensions between the United States and China, already at a high over tariffs. The two sides have agreed to trade  negotiations that must be concluded by March 1.  Beijing has demanded Meng’s immediate release and threatened “consequences” for Canada. But both Chinese and U.S. officials appear to be avoiding linking her arrest to the trade dispute. Meng’s lawyer offered C$14 million in property equity and C$1 million in cash as a guarantee. The public prosecutor said he wanted half in cash and half in property. At one point the judge asked why Meng had avoided travel to the United States since 2017 if not to avoid arrest. Martin cited a “hostile” climate toward Huawei in the United States. “I ask the court to ask itself, what motive could she possibly have to flee?” Martin said, arguing the evidence against her was not overwhelming. “If she were to flee, or breach order in any way ... it doesn’t overstate things to say she would embarrass China itself.”  Meng appeared confident in court early on Monday, smiling and taking her lawyer’s arm. But by mid-afternoon she appeared more tense, gesturing rapidly as she conferred with members of her legal team. She has argued she needs to be released because she has severe hypertension and fears for her health. Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92 billion last year. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas. U.S. officials allege Huawei was trying to use the banks to move money out of Iran. Companies are barred from using the U.S. financial system to funnel goods and services to sanctioned entities. Huawei and its lawyers have said the company operates in strict compliance with applicable laws, regulations and sanctions of the United States and other parties.  “We will continue to follow the bail hearing tomorrow. We have every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach a just conclusion,” the company said on Monday.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders will not renegotiate Britain’s Brexit deal, including the Irish border “backstop”, their chairman Donald Tusk said on Monday after Prime Minister Theresa May put off a parliamentary vote on a package that was facing heavy defeat. EU officials said European Council President Tusk could meet May as early as Tuesday to prepare talks on Brexit during a regular Brussels summit which May will attend on Thursday and Friday. Tusk said he had scheduled a meeting of the other 27 leaders on Brexit, to be held at some point during the summit. “We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop,” he said on Twitter after May said she would go back to European neighbours to seek new reassurances about the insurance clause which would bind Britain into a customs union with the EU in order to avoid a “hard” EU border for troubled Northern Ireland. May’s domestic critics want a time limit on the backstop, but Dublin and its EU allies insist that it must be able to be used until some better way is found to avoid customs checks on the EU-UK land border while letting Britain escape EU rules. EU officials said it was almost inconceivable that leaders would agree to reopen the withdrawal treaty they agreed with May two weeks ago, which includes the backstop. They might agree to tweak the accompanying, non-binding political declaration on future relations, though even that was doubtful. Finally, they could issue a new declaration of intent to try and help May. Tusk said only: “We are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.” But he also warned that the EU would forge ahead with preparing for there being no deal at all as it faces a Britain that seems incapable of forging a majority opinion on what kind of Brexit it wants - or even if it wants to leave at all. “As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario,” Tusk said, referring to the fact that Britain will be out of the bloc on March 29, according to a treaty timetable, with or without a deal.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Any assurances Britain secures from the European Union on the Irish backstop in the Brexit divorce deal will be “completely irrelevant” if they are not in the Withdrawal Agreement, eurosceptic lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said on Monday. He said the chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal had increased after Prime Minister Theresa May delayed a vote in parliament on the agreement and said she would instead go back to the EU to seek further reassurances. “Anything that is not physically in the treaty is ‘junior law’, so if the prime minister comes back with a statement, warm words, it’s completely irrelevant because the treaty outranks it,” Rees-Mogg told reporters. “Unless it’s an amendment to the treaty, it’s pointless.” The strongest opposition to May’s deal centres around the so-called backstop, an insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border between EU member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland. Rees-Mogg echoed the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is supposed to prop up May’s government but is committed to voting against her deal, by saying the backstop had to be removed entirely. “It would be transformative if the backstop were removed. But, this is the whole backstop, this isn’t some paragraph saying it will finish in 2025 or something. It has to be out, because no one would believe the 2025 date,” he said.

2019-02-08,"TERVUREN, Belgium (Reuters) - Belgium’s Africa Museum will reopen to the public on Sunday after five years of renovations designed to modernise the museum from an exhibition of pro-colonial propaganda to one that is critical of Belgium’s imperialist past. The museum, full of artefacts and stuffed wildlife, was often criticised for ignoring the brutalities of King Leopold II’s fiefdom, whose troops collected the hands of those who resisted slave labour at a time when millions of Congolese people are estimated to have died. Many of the artefacts remain, but there is more commentary from African people on video screens, displays by Congolese artists, one including a 120-member family tree, in a bid to centralize Africans rather than Europeans. Colonial history is now concentrated in one gallery, rather than dominating the whole museum, which also deals with current issues facing Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and its diaspora. “We also assume our responsibility that for more than 60 years, we’ve diffused, we’ve disseminated an image of a superior, western way of thinking to African cultures,” said museum Director Guido Gryseels. In the large rotunda, a statue remains of a European missionary with an African boy clutching his robes with a plaque that reads: “Belgium brings civilization to Congo”. But now the room is dominated by a giant wooden sculpture of an African man’s head, sculptured by an artist born in DRC. The museum also features a new entry pavilion. Many Belgians remain ignorant of their country’s harsh rule in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the late 19th century. It became the setting for Joseph Conrad’s influential 1899 novella “Heart of Darkness”. Belgium’s colonial past made the small European country one of the world’s most successful trading economies. The 66 million euros ($75.1 million) renovation to the Africa museum, set in a palatial, neoclassical building in a landscaped park just outside the capital Brussels, hopes to confront Belgians with their colonial past. But activists says that by containing stolen artefacts it represents a continuation of colonialism. “There is no decolonisation without restitution,” said Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, who was born in the DRC before moving to Belgium, where she authored a book on racism.  The debate about whether colonial-era art should be returned home has intensified after French President Emmanuel Macron promised to return some African art to the continent and Germany this year published guidelines for considering repatriation. Gryseels said the museum was open to returning some artefacts. King Philippe declined an invitation to attend the museum’s inauguration on Saturday, but Prime Minister Charles Michel and some ministers will attend.  Activists will hold a separate ceremony nearby at the graves of seven Congolese who died of influenza when they were imported for exhibition in a human zoo. The group is demanding Belgium erect a plaque in remembrance. A plaque was put up at the location of the human zoo, while a new exhibit in the museum casts the shadows of names of  Congolese people who died in Belgium over those of Belgians that perished in Africa.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s competition watchdog on Monday recommended tougher scrutiny and a new regulatory body to check the dominance of tech giants Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google in the country’s online advertising and news markets. The recommendation, in a preliminary report on the U.S. firms’ market power, is being closely watched around the world as lawmakers wrestle with the powerful tech firms’ large and growing influence in public life, from privacy to publishing. It comes days after Australia passed laws forcing tech companies to help police access private user data, and amid growing concern from authorities worldwide about the giants’ commercial behavior and distribution of so-called “fake news”. “When you get to a certain stage and you get market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities and that means, also, additional scrutiny,” Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney. He said the companies’ enormous market share - Google has a 94 percent share of web searches in Australia - and opaque methods for ranking advertisements gave the firms the ability and incentive to favor their businesses over advertisers’. “The idea of the regulator role would be to keep an eye on that and proactively bring some transparency,” he said, adding the two firms also had outsized influence over news distribution. Drafting the report had also spurred five investigations into possible consumer or privacy law breaches in Australia, Sims said, without disclosing which firms they concerned. Facebook and Google, in separate statements, both said they will continue to work with the ACCC while the regulator prepares its final report due in June. The two firms have already promised to do more to tackle the spread of fake news and, in submissions to the ACCC, said they provided users access to global news articles while providing advertisers a cheap way of reaching big audiences. The ACCC has said its recommendations are subject to change, but suggests handing the new regulator investigative powers to examine how the companies rank advertisements and news articles. “It is potentially a game changer,” Margaret Simons, an associate professor of media at Monash University in Melbourne, said by phone, since it would bring the tech companies under a regulatory framework more typically applied to media firms. “With the ‘if’ being whether or not governments act,” she said, adding that the ACCC’s work was being closely watched internationally. Australia’s government, which ordered the probe into the firms’ influence a year ago as part of wider media reforms said it would consider the ACCC’s final recommendations in June. Traditional media companies in Australia including Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd and News Corp’s local arm - already squeezed by online rivals - welcomed the ACCC suggestions in separate statements on Monday.

2019-02-08,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern fought back tears as she apologised on Monday to the family of a 22-year-old British woman who was killed while she was on a backpacking tour, two days after a man was charged with the Briton’s murder. The killing has shocked residents of New Zealand, where serious crimes are relatively rare and camping in remote mountains and farmlands is widely regarded as safe for tourists and New Zealanders alike. Grace Millane, who was travelling the world after finishing university, went missing in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, on Dec. 1. Police found Millane’s body on Sunday in a bush area just a few metres from a scenic drive in Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges. The body had not yet been formally identified but police said they believed it to be that of Millane. “On behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace’s family,” Ardern told a weekly news conference in parliament. There was an overwhelming sense of hurt and shame among New Zealanders that this happened in their country, she said. “Your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn’t, and I am sorry for that,” Ardern said. A 26-year-old man appeared in an Auckland court on Monday charged with murdering Millane. He was questioned by police after being seen with Millane at several places. The man requested that his name be suppressed in media coverage but this was declined by judge Evangelos Thomas, according to Radio New Zealand (RNZ). However, his lawyer Ian Brookie appealed against the judge’s decision and the man cannot be identified until a decision on that appeal is made, RNZ reported.  The man was remanded in custody until he appears in court in January. Thomas also addressed members of Millane’s family, who travelled from Britain to New Zealand and attended Monday’s court hearing. “I don’t know what to say to you at this time but your grief must be desperate,” Thomas said, according to RNZ. “We all hope justice will be fair and swift and ultimately brings you some peace.” Tributes poured in for the young backpacker from Essex, with flowers placed on Monday near the spot where her body was found. Nationwide candlelight vigils are being planned. The case has also sparked a debate on Twitter about whether New Zealand was still safe for female backpackers and whether the killing would discourage women from travelling alone.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The new leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats (CDU) outlined plans on Sunday to change the party’s migrant policies before next year’s European election, signalling that she could break with her mentor Angela Merkel’s liberal approach. The conservative party elected Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to replace Merkel as their leader on Friday, making her frontrunner to become the next chancellor of Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy. However, the narrow win over the more conservative Friedrich Merz exposed splits in Germany’s biggest party, which she must try to close before next May’s vote for the European Parliament and four state elections in 2019. One of the deepest divisions is over migrant policy. “I want to convene a ‘workshop discussion’ on migration and security with experts and critics of migrant and refugee policies to work on concrete improvements,” Kramp-Karrenbauer  told Bild am Sonntag weekly.  “Our programme for the European election will build on these results.” Merkel’s 2015 open-door approach eroded her popularity and led to losses in regional elections, culminating in her October decision to stand down as party leader. She aims to stay on as chancellor until the next federal vote in 2021. By voting for Kramp-Karrenbauer, the CDU chose continuity but the new leader told German television this did not exclude some changes. “You stand on the shoulders of your predecessor. What is good is continued and where there is room to change things, we will make changes,” she told broadcaster ARD.  While Kramp-Karrenbauer was less critical of Merkel’s migrant policy than her rivals in the leadership contest, she has argued that migrants must learn German and those with a criminal record cannot stay. But most of all, she has stressed that the CDU must not dwell too long on the damaging issue.  One of her main tasks in elections next year in three eastern states will be to win back voters who have turned to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has capitalised on fears about the integration of migrants. Now represented in all 16 federal states and polling at around 14 percent, it is the main opposition in parliament to Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’ of the CDU, its conservative Bavarian allies and the Social Democrats (SPD). An Emnid poll on Sunday put the conservative bloc on 29 percent, up 1 point from last week but down from 32.9 percent in last year’s election - its lowest result since 1949. The SPD has slumped to 15 percent from 20.5 percent in the election. Former SPD chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told Handelsblatt the CDU had made a mistake with its choice. “Merz would have been the chance to set the two main parties further apart from each other so the fringes on the left and right would get weaker. That is not just important for the CDU and SPD but for all Germany,” he told Handelsblatt daily.

2019-02-08,"NAYABANS, India (Reuters) - Nayabans isn’t remarkable as northern Indian villages go. Sugar cane grows in surrounding fields, women carry animal feed in bullock carts through narrow lanes, people chatter outside a store, and cows loiter. But this week, the village in Uttar Pradesh state became a symbol of the deepening communal divide in India as some Hindu men from the area complained they had seen a group of Muslims slaughtering cows in a mango orchard a couple of miles away. That infuriated Hindus, who regard the cow as a sacred animal. Anger against Muslims turned into outrage that police had not stopped an illegal practise, and a Hindu mob blocked a highway, threw stones, burned vehicles and eventually two people were shot and killed - including a police officer. The events throw a spotlight on the religious strains in places like Nayabans since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power at the national level in 2014 and in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Tensions are ratcheting up ahead of the next general election, due to be held by May. The BJP said it was “bizarre” to assume the party would benefit from any religious disharmony, dismissing suggestions that its supporters were largely responsible for the tensions. “In a large country like India nobody can ensure that nothing will go wrong, but it’s our responsibility to maintain law and order and we understand that,” party spokesman Gopal Krishna Agarwal said. “But people are trying to politicize these issues.” Nayabans, just about three hour’s drive from Delhi, has about 400 Muslims out of a population of 4,000, the rest are Hindu. Relations between the communities began deteriorating around the Muslim holy month of Ramadan last year when Hindus in the village demanded that loudspeakers used to call for prayer at a makeshift mosque be removed, local Muslims said. “For 40 years mikes were used in the mosque, calls for prayer were made five times a day, but no one objected,” said Waseem Khan, a 28-year-old Muslim community leader in Nayabans. “We resisted initially but then we thought it’s better to live in peace then create a dispute over a mike,” he said. “We don’t want to give them a chance to fan communal tensions.” Reuters spoke with more than a dozen Muslims from the village but except for Khan, no one else wanted to be named for fear of angering the Hindu population.  Several among a group of Muslim women and girls standing outside the mosque said they have been living in fear since the BJP came to power in the state in 2017. They said that Hindu groups now hold provocative processions through the village during every Hindu festival, loudspeakers blaring, something that used to happen rarely before. They said they felt “terrorised” by Hindu activists. “While passing through our areas during their religious rallies, they chant ‘Pakistan murdabad’ (down with Pakistan) as if we have some connection to Pakistan just because we are Muslims,” Khan said. The subcontinent was divided into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu-majority India at the time of independence from British colonial rule in 1947. During the violence on Monday, many Muslims in Nayabans locked themselves in their homes fearing attacks. Some who had attended a three-day Muslim religious congregation some miles away stayed outside the area that night to avoid making themselves targets for the mob. Muslim villagers say they are particularly fearful of the top elected official in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is a Hindu priest and senior BJP figure. Hindu hardliners started asserting themselves more in the village after he was elected, they say. Uttar Pradesh sends 80 lawmakers to the lower house of parliament, the largest of any state in the country.  Considered the county’s political crucible, it has also been the scene for spiralling Hindu-Muslim tensions.  Adityanath said the lead up to the rioting in Nayabans was a “big conspiracy”, but did not elaborate. In the only statement from his office on the incident, Adityanath ordered police to arrest those directly or indirectly involved in the slaughter of cows and made no mention of the death of the police inspector. He announced 1 million rupees (£11,083) as compensation for the family of the other dead man, a local who is among those accused by police for the violence. Both men were Hindus and died of bullet wounds, although police said it was not yet clear who shot whom. Police say they have arrested up to five people for the cow slaughter but have not given their religion. Locals say all the arrested people are Muslims. At least five Hindu men, including an off-duty soldier who was home during the violence, have been arrested for the unrest leading to the deaths. “All invidious elements who may have conspired to vitiate the situation will be exposed through a fair and transparent investigation,” Anand Kumar, the second highest police official in Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters. Asked if there was any bias against Muslims, Uttar Pradesh government spokesman Sidharth Nath Singh - who is also the state’s health minister - told Reuters: “We believe in equality and our motto is sabka saath, sabka vikas”, using a Hindi phrase often used by Modi that means “collective effort, inclusive growth”. The two communities in Nayabans have lived in relative harmony for years, residents from both groups said.  But now Hindus in the village, who mostly say they support Yogi, accuse the Muslims of trying to turn themselves into the victims when they weren’t. “Can’t believe they are raising our processions with journalists!” said Daulat, a Hindu daily wage labourer who goes by one name. “They are making it a Hindu-Muslim issue, we are not. Their people have been accused of killing cows, so they are playing the victim.” At a middle school, metres from the police outpost near where the two men got killed, two women teachers, sitting on a veranda soaking in the winter sun, said its 66 students stopped coming for classes in the first few days after the violence. “We worship cows and their slaughter can’t be accepted,” said one of the teachers, Uma Rani. “Two Hindus died here but nothing happened to the cow killers.” Both teachers were Hindus. Political analysts say relations between the two communities are likely to stay tense ahead of the national vote, particularly in polarised states such as Uttar Pradesh. The BJP made a near-clean sweep in Uttar Pradesh in 2014, helping Modi win the country’s biggest parliamentary mandate in three decades, but pollsters predict a tighter contest next year because of a lack of jobs and low farm prices. “Facing economic headwinds and lacklustre job growth, Modi will rally his conservative base by selectively resorting to Hindu nationalism,” global security consultancy Stratfor said last month. On Sunday, more than 100,000 Hindu monks and activists close to the BJP held a rally in Delhi demanding legislation for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site of a 16th century mosque that was pulled down in 1992, sparking riots across the country that  killed about 2,000 people. Many Hindus believe the mosque was built by a Muslim chieftain over the birthplace of Hindu god-king Ram. Muslims say they increasingly feel like second-class citizens in their own country. “The BJP will definitely benefit from such incidents,” said Tahir Saifi, a Muslim community leader a few miles from the area of violence who supports a regional opposition party in Uttar Pradesh. “They want all Hindus to unite, and when religion comes into the picture, other issues like development take a back seat.” Reporting by Krishna N.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling believes newspapers are helping “fuel racism” and “aggressive behaviour” with their portrayal of young black players. The 24-year-old made the comments in an Instagram post on Sunday, a day after he faced alleged racist abuse from a supporter during City’s 2-0 Premier League defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.  Sterling posted two photos, contrasting different newspaper headlines for similar stories involving black and white team mates at City — Tosin Adarabioyo and Phil Foden — who bought new houses this year. The headline referring to Adarabioyo, who is black, focuses on how he spent 2.25 million pounds ($2.86 million) on a house “despite having never started a Premier League match” while that on Foden says he bought a 2 million pound home “for his mum”. “You have two players starting out their careers - both play for the same team, both have done the right thing, which is buy a new house for their mothers who have put in a lot of time and love into helping them get where they are,” Sterling wrote.  “But look at how the newspapers get their message across for the young black player and then for the young white player.  “I think this is unacceptable, both innocent, have not done a thing wrong but just by the way it has been worded, this young black kid is looked at in a bad light, which helps fuel racism and aggressive behaviour.” Addressing the alleged abuse he received at Stamford Bridge, Sterling said that he “had to laugh” when he heard the remarks because he expects no better. Last December, a man was jailed for 16 weeks for racially aggravated common assault on Sterling. No arrests were made after Saturday’s league game but the Metropolitan Police and Chelsea said they would review footage to determine whether any racist abuse took place. Anti-discrimination group Kick it Out said soccer’s leaders could not stay silent on racism. “Where’s (Premier League chief executive) Richard Scudamore, where is (FA chairman) Greg Clarke, where is Chelsea’s chairman (Bruce Buck) — they should have been talking out last night and it has to be dealt with at the top,” the group’s chairman Herman Ouseley said in a statement. “We do not have any leadership at the top of the game to speak out, they just rely on Kick it Out.” The English Football Association condemned the incident on Sunday and called for witnesses to come forward. “We take allegations of discrimination extremely seriously and will work with the clubs and the relevant authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with appropriately,” the FA said. City suffered their first defeat of the season on Saturday and they dropped to second in the standings behind Liverpool.

2019-02-08,"ROME (Reuters) - Six people, including five young teenagers, were crushed to death in the early hours of Saturday following a stampede at a packed nightclub near Ancona on Italy’s Adriatic coast, officials said. The deaths occurred when a walkway leading out of the Lanterna Azzurra nightclub in the town of Corinaldo collapsed, causing dozens of people to fall into a trench below. Three girls, two boys and a mother who had accompanied her child to the event died in the crush. Police said the teenagers were aged between 14 and 16, while the dead woman was 39. More than 100 other people were injured, 13 of them  seriously. Local officials said witnesses reported seeing a hooded man spray a substance like pepper spray or tear gas into the crowd, triggering a panicked rush to the emergency exits. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who also serves as interior minister, said there were many more people than permitted inside the club, where popular Italian rapper Sfera Ebbasta had been due to perform. “The main hall had a capacity of 469 and they sold 1,300 tickets,” a sombre Salvini told reporters after visiting the site. “You can’t die at 14 in this way. You don’t need new laws here. You need to have a conscience and respect existing laws.” Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters that it appeared that only one of the nightclub’s three halls had been open at the time. “The numbers are all wrong,” he said. Magistrates have opened an investigation into the deaths and there was no immediate comment from the nightclub’s owners.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predicted a “deluge” of drugs, refugees and attacks on the West if U.S. sanctions weaken Iran’s ability to contain them. “I warn those who impose sanctions that if Iran’s ability to fight drugs and terrorism are affected ... you will not be safe from a deluge of drugs, asylum seekers, bombs and terrorism,” Rouhani said in a speech carried live on state television. Separately, Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that the United States is selling more arms into the Middle East than the region needs, making it a “tinderbox”. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil industry last month. Drug trafficking is a serious challenge for Iran as it borders Afghanistan - the world’s largest opium producer - and Pakistan, a major transit country for drugs. “We spend $800 million a year to fight drugs which ensures the health of nations stretching from of Eastern Europe to the American West and North Africa to West Asia. Imagine what a disaster there would be if there is a breach in the dam,” Rouhani said. In 2012, Iran accounted for two thirds of the world’s opium seizures and one fourth of the world’s heroin and morphine seizures, a U.N. report published in 2014 showed. “We have been just as determined in the fight against terrorism ... sacrificing hundreds of valuable troops and spending millions of dollars annually,” Rouhani said. “We don’t expect the West to pay their share, but they should know that sanctions hurt Iran’s capacity to fight drugs and terrorism,” Rouhani added. Iran, a key supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, has sent military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi’ite militias to fight militant groups.  In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers helped Iraq defeat Islamic State. “Economic terrorism means creating horror in a country and create fear in other countries that intend to invest (there). America’s withdrawal from the (nuclear accord) is undoubtedly a clear example of economic terrorism,” Rouhani told a meeting of heads of parliaments of China, Russia, and four other countries. More than 700,000 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran this year as the Iranian economy tightens, according to data from the U.N.’s migration agency, and Iranian media said some Afghans were seeking to enter Turkey to reach Europe.   Zarif warned about the dangers of large U.S. arms sales in the Middle East, where Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of Western weapons. “The Americans have turned the region into a tinderbox. The level of arms sales by the Americans is unbelievable and much beyond regional needs and this points to the very dangerous policies followed by the Americans,” IRNA reported Zarif as saying.

2019-02-08,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday to slash oil production by more than the market had expected despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. The producer club will curb output from January by 0.8 million barrels per day versus October levels while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd of cuts, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April.  Oil prices jumped about 5 percent to more than $63 a barrel as the combined cut of 1.2 million bpd was larger than the minimum 1 million bpd that the market had expected. Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has faced demands from Trump to help the global economy by refraining from paring supplies.  An output curtailment also would provide support to Iran by increasing the price of oil amid attempts by Washington to squeeze the economy of OPEC’s third-largest producer. Asked whether the decision to cut could sour Riyadh’s relations with Washington, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the kingdom was ready to pump more should a major supply outage occur. “We will not squeeze consumers beyond what they can afford,” he said, adding that given the United States had recently become the biggest oil-producing nation, its energy companies were “breathing a sigh of relief”. Further complicating Riyadh’s decisions this week was the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on the kingdom. Falih refrained from answering a question on whether the OPEC decision might prompt Washington to withdraw support, but said Saudi-U.S. relations were based on shared values. TWO-DAY MARATHON The OPEC deal had hung in the balance for two days - first on fears that Russia would cut too little, and later on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement. But after hours of talks, Iran gave OPEC the green light and Russia said it was ready to cut more. Russia gave a commitment to reduce output by 228,000 bpd from October levels of 11.4 million bpd, though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months.  The country’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed an output decrease with Saudi Prince Mohammed. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, pledged to cut 140,000 bpd. Falih said Saudi production had dropped to 10.7 million bpd in December from 11.1 million in November and was set to decline to 10.2 million bpd in January. Iran, Libya and Venezuela were effectively given exemptions. Nigeria, which has been exempt since the previous round of cuts from January 2017, agreed to participate. Helima Croft, managing director at RBC Capital Markets, said the deal exceeded expectations.  “Having the next meeting in April will be important for planning purposes to speed the cycle up a bit,” she said. OPEC normally meets once every six months. “We don’t know what will Iran’s sanctions picture look like. We don’t know the Iranian volumes which will be coming off the market,” Croft said. But Bob McNally, president of U.S.-based Rapidan Energy Group, said the details of the cut were “fuzzy” and would likely result in a lesser reduction than the headline figure. “President Trump will not be happy to see today’s headlines, but how strongly he reacts depends mainly on whether crude prices rise strongly as a result in coming days and weeks.” U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook met Falih in Vienna this week, in an unprecedented development ahead of an OPEC meeting. Saudi Arabia first denied the Hook-Falih discussion took place but later confirmed it. “U.S. political pressure is clearly a dominant factor at this OPEC meeting, limiting the scope of Saudi actions to rebalance the market,” said Gary Ross, chief executive of Black Gold Investors and a veteran OPEC watcher. The price of crude LCOc1 has fallen almost a third since October as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output to offset lower exports from Iran. [O/R] Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. On Thursday, U.S. government figures showed the country had become a net exporter of crude oil and refined products for the first time on record, underscoring how the surge in production has altered the supply equation in world markets.

2019-02-08,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank elected the favored candidate of its top shareholder as its new chairman on Friday to help steer the Danish lender through a multi-billion euro money laundering scandal.     Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States are investigating payments totaling 200 billion euros ($229 billion) made through Danske Bank’s tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. The threat of a heavy fine from the U.S. Department of Justice has sent Danske’s shares down almost 50 percent since March, erasing around $15 billion of market value and raising the prospect of legal action from investors. The Maersk shipping tycoon family, the bank’s top shareholder with a 21 percent stake, ousted chairman Ole Andersen and called Friday’s shareholder meeting to nominate Karsten Dybvad, 62 and another board member. The more than 600 shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in Copenhagen elected Dybvad to Danske’s board.  The modified board of directors then elected Dybvad, who for the last eight years was CEO of the Confederation of Danish Industry, one of the country’s most influential lobby groups, as its new chairman. Prior to that he had a long career as a government official working with ministers across the Danish political spectrum.    “We hope and are confident that Karsten can contribute to the dialogue with authorities which probably will take up a lot of time in the next couple of years,” said Robert Maersk Uggla, A.P. Moller Holding’s chief executive, at the meeting. Besides restoring Danske’s image, Dybvad is also tasked with finding a new chief executive to head the bank and ensure potential legal cases, not least in the United States, don’t detract from day-to-day business. “That’s the first task,” Dybvad told Reuters. “We will look at this with fresh eyes so it will take some time, but then we hope we can find exactly the right CEO,” he said. Dybvad declined to say if he saw current interim CEO Jesper Nielsen as a candidate for the role, although he said that he was doing a good job.  When asked if he wanted the entire board - consisting of 12 members, three elected by employees -  replaced as a measure to soothe U.S. authorities and thus try to minimize potential fines over the money laundering scandal, Dybvad said that two members could be elected at a general meeting in three months time, in addition to the two on Friday. “That’s practically a new board. So we’ll push forward together,” he said.  Outgoing chairman Andersen and other managers were criticized harshly by several private shareholders at the meeting. “There were probably things that many people should have done differently, and I will of course also reflect on whether there were things I should have done differently,” Andersen told Reuters after the EGM, adding: “There probably is. It is probably primarily related to the recent years.”  The investment firm of the Maersk family, which controls shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk, is usually a passive shareholder. However, Maersk Uggla said they had acted because they felt that Danske’s board had not moved fast enough to replace Andersen. The move was welcomed by others at the meeting. “We see this demonstration of active ownership as positive,” said Mikael Bak, chief executive at the Danish Shareholders’ Association, a lobby group for private investors. “We would have liked to see the large shareholders a little earlier, perhaps far earlier,” he added.  Claus Wiinblad, senior vice president at Denmark’s largest investor, pension fund ATP, said Dybvad faced big challenges. “There is great task in handling the ongoing investigations in relation to the Estonia case in a way that can contribute to re-establishing confidence in Danske Bank,” he said.  Dybvad said he had decided to prioritize his new job as chairman, stepping down from the Confederation of Danish Industry on Friday.

2019-02-08,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany’s Christian Democrats have played it safe. By opting for Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel as party leader, they have voted for a centrist who is long on party unity and short on major policy initiatives. Merkel’s decision to stand down as leader of her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is part of her slow, stage-managed exit from German politics and in Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, the party has chosen a successor from the same safety-first mould. Dubbed “Merkel 2.0” by opposition parties, Kramp-Karrenbauer was the continuity candidate in the leadership campaign, less bold in her policy proposals than rival Friedrich Merz. “The CDU has opted for centrist continuity. And it let Merkel have her way, one more time,” said Carsten Nickel, managing director at political consultancy Teneo. “Today’s close result shows: the party is as split as German society.” After her narrow victory - by 517 votes to 482 - over Merz, Kramp-Karrenbauer’s first priority is to unite the CDU after a series of electoral setbacks that threaten its role as Germany’s leading “Volkspartei”, or big popular party. In a short speech to accept the party leadership, she called for “all the factions, all members, everyone who carries responsibility to move forward with the goal that we share - to remain the big Volkspartei of the centre.” Her first act as leader was to invite her two rivals to take the congress stage with her in a show of party unity. Kramp-Karrenbauer has little time to waste. An election in Bremen next May is the first of four regional votes next year. In October, the CDU lost over 10 percentage points in another state election, in Hesse. Merkel announced she would stand down as party leader after that damaging result. After a robust campaign for the CDU leadership, Kramp-Karrenbauer must now try to engineer a rebound in next year’s state votes - a tough task that will soak up her time and energy and leave her little bandwidth for fresh policy initiatives. Teneo’s Nickel said the close leadership result “means continuity in Europe: beyond Merkel’s personal leadership in the Council, don’t expect bold initiatives from Berlin. The CDU will continue to be busy with itself.” Kramp-Karrenbauer is not prone to bold policy moves anyway. During the leadership campaign, she took more a cautious stance on the future of Europe than Merz, who said Germany should “contribute more” to the European Union as it benefits from a euro that is “too weak for our economy”. Last month, Kramp-Karrenbauer told a business conference: “With every wish to take Europe forward with a German-French nucleus, the proposals must always fit with German interests.” She said Europe must move towards a banking union, “but first the risks must be minimised so that it is acceptable in German interests as well.” Her great strength is her record as former state premier in Saarland, where she led an experimental broad coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats — alliance-building skills useful in Germany’s fractured political landscape. That ability to build bridges clinched her the CDU top job. “There is a feeling that we are strengthened,” delegate Stephan Toscani said after Friday’s leadership vote. “There is a willingness to pull together now. I am sure that Merkel will remain chancellor right through her term.” Merkel plans to stay on as chancellor until the next federal election, due by October 2021. The CDU’s election of Kramp-Karrenbauer makes that scenario more likely. Co-habiting with Merz, an old rival, would have proven harder for Merkel. The risk for Kramp-Karrenbauer is that opposition parties seize on her similarities to Merkel, whose authority has waned since her divisive decision in 2015 to keep German borders open to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East. “Kramp-Karrenbauer is a continuation of Merkel with other means,” said Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which surged into the Bundestag for the first time last year on a wave of discontent with Merkel. “She supported the refugee policy and will not correct it.” Additional reporting by Madeline Chambers and Michelle Martin; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-politics-cdu-leader/steady-as-she-goes-merkel-2-0-takes-centre-stage-in-germany-idUKKBN1O62AQ,2019-02-08,,Steady as she goes - Merkel 2.0 takes centre stage in Germany

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan Motor Co Ltd chairman Carlos Ghosn signed documents for the Japanese automaker to pay him 1 billion yen ($8.86 million) of deferred annual compensation after he left the company, the Asahi newspaper reported on Friday. Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa signed other documents related to payments to Ghosn in the event of departure, the Asahi said, without citing sources. Ghosn was arrested last month for allegedly conspiring to understate his income by about half for at least five years from 2010. Former Nissan representative director Greg Kelly was accused of assisting. The arrests shook the auto industry and were followed by Ghosn losing positions at both Nissan and alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Ghosn remains chairman and chief executive of French partner Renault SA. Prosecutors on Monday plan to indict Ghosn and Kelly over the alleged underreporting of salaries in five annual reports through the business year that ended in March 2015, the Nikkei business daily reported earlier.

2019-02-08,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Movies about race, politics and music dominated nominations for the Golden Globe awards on Thursday, setting the stage for a lively Hollywood awards season leading up to the Oscars in February. Dark comedy “Vice,” a scathing look at the rise to power of former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, led all comers with six nods. It was followed by the Lady Gaga musical remake of “A Star is Born,” British historical comedy “The Favourite” and road trip movie through 1960s segregated America “Green Book” with five nods apiece. Several expected contenders, including female-led heist thriller “Widows,” were left out in the cold, while moon landing movie “First Man” was snubbed in the best drama race and had to settle for just two nominations. “Vice” director Adam McKay described his film, which will be released on Dec. 25, as “an amazing portrayal of power.” “What we tried to do was reflect the times that we are living in, which can be pretty absurd and pretty dramatic and tragic at the same time,” McKay told Reuters on Thursday. “Vice” also won nods for actors Christian Bale, as Dick Cheney, Amy Adams as Lynne Cheney, and Sam Rockwell as former U.S. President George W. Bush. The film is distributed by independent Annapurna Pictures, which led studios with 10 nominations overall. The Golden Globes, chosen by the small Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), will be handed out at in Beverly Hills on Jan 6 in the season’s first major show business awards ceremony.  The movie line-up includes two films about racial injustice - “If Beale Street Could Talk,” director Barry Jenkins’ follow-up to his 2017 Oscar best picture “Moonlight,” and director Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman.” Walt Disney Co black empowerment superhero movie “Black Panther” also got a best drama nomination. “Green Book” star Viggo Mortensen, who was nominated along with Mahershala Ali, said in a statement that the Universal Pictures film asks audiences to “think profoundly about our society’s past and present.” “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first big Hollywood movie in 25 years with an all-Asian cast, further diversified the Globes contenders with nods for best comedy and best actress for Constance Wu. “Not in my wildest dreams did I ever think our movie would be embraced to this magnitude by the audience and now the HFPA,” “Crazy Rich Asians” director John Chu said in a statement. Music featured strongly with “Bohemian Rhapsody,” starring  Rami Malek as late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Malek gave a “heartfelt and humbled thank you to the man this is for and because of, Freddie.” “A Star is Born,” the Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper remake of the show business romance, solidified its status as a major contender for Oscars, while “Mary Poppins Returns,” a sequel to Disney’s beloved 1964 film, won nominations for stars Emily Blunt and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.  Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron’s much admired semi-autobiographical black-and-white film “Roma,” for streaming service Netflix, was nominated in the foreign language category. Cuaron, who also won a directing nod, said the film celebrated families “and encourages my belief that the human experience is one and the same for all.”  Briton Olivia Colman won a best actress nod for her turn as a petulant Queen Anne in the Fox Searchlight historical romp “The Favourite,” along with supporting stars Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. In television, limited FX series “The Assassination of Gianni Versace” about the murder of the Italian fashion designer, was ahead with four nods and helped the FX network take a leading 10 nominations. But favourites like “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “This is Us” were shut out of the biggest races in favour of newcomers including podcast-adaptation “Homecoming,” starring Julia Roberts, and comedies “The Kominsky Method” and  “Kidding.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant and Lisa Richwine; Editing by Nick Zieminski",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-awards-goldenglobes-nominations/politics-race-music-dominate-diverse-golden-globe-film-nominations-idUKKBN1O51JV,2019-02-08,"Movies about race, politics and music dominated nominations for the Golden Globe awards on Thursday, setting the stage for a lively Hollywood awards season leading up to the Oscars in February.","Politics, race, music dominate diverse Golden Globe film nominations"

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia must scrap its 9M729 nuclear-capable cruise missiles and launchers or modify the weapons’ range to return to compliance with a key Cold War-era arms control treaty and avert a U.S. pullout from the pact, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. “Either you rid the system, rid the launcher or change the system where it doesn’t exceed the range” in a verifiable manner, said U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Andrea Thompson. On Tuesday, the United States announced it was giving Russia 60 days to end what Washington charges is the missiles’ violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or it would begin to withdraw from the pact. The possibility that the treaty might unravel alarms Washington’s European allies, who fear its collapse would trigger a new U.S.-Russian nuclear weapons race with the danger that Europe itself could become a nuclear battleground.     U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, who briefed reporters with Thompson, said that a U.S. withdrawal from the treaty “does not mean we are walking away from arms control.” “We remain committed to arms control, but we need a reliable partner and do not have one in Russia on INF or for that matter on other treaties that it’s violating,” Huntsman said. Sounding a similar theme on Thursday at a Washington Post event, the top U.S. military commander warned that Russia’s continued breach of the INF pact could hamper extending the New START treaty, which limits U.S. and Russian offensive nuclear weapons deployments, beyond its Feb. 5, 2021, expiration. “I will not obviously not make this decision. I’ll make recommendations,” said Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “But it’s very difficult for me to envision progress in extending (New START) . . . if the foundation of that is non-compliance with the INF Treaty.” Unless the sides agree on a five-year extension provided by the pact, New START’s expiration will end all restrictions on their deployments of offensive nuclear weapons. Moscow denies the missile, which U.S. officials say can hit European targets with nuclear or conventional warheads, violates the INF Treaty. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday warned that Russia would develop missiles banned by the accord if the United States exits the pact. The United States and its European allies charge that what Moscow calls the 9M729 Novator cruise missile - designated the SSC-8 by the NATO Western security alliance - breaches the treaty’s range limit of 500 to 5,000 km (310 to 3,420 miles). The treaty also bans the production and testing of missiles with such ranges and their launchers. President Donald Trump on Oct. 20 said the United States would withdraw from the treaty after what U.S. officials said were dozens of meetings since 2013 in which their Russian counterparts first denied the 9M729’s existence and then said it complied with the pact. NATO leaders on Tuesday unanimously supported the U.S. charge that Russia has been violating the treaty. But they prevailed on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to give diplomacy another chance and allow Russia 60 days to return to compliance. The treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world’s two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The British parliament’s vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal will determine the future of the country, the chief EU Brexit negotiator said on Thursday, insisting that the deal was the only route to secure an orderly withdrawal from the EU.  “If there is no withdrawal treaty, there is no transition, no basis of confidence that we need with the British regarding the future relationship,” Michel Barnier told representatives from cities and regions in the European Union. Barnier told the gathering of the European Committee of the Regions that it was key now that the withdrawal treaty agreed between Brussels and London be ratified. “Now is now the moment for everyone to bear their responsibilities. You know the British parliament will give its verdict on this text and on the future relationship in the coming days. It is a vote in which the future of their country is at stake.” The British parliament is due to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal next Tuesday, with the odds looking stacked against May’s government winning that vote. Many of May’s Conservatives are particularly sceptical about the fallback arrangement, or “backstop”, to guarantee that there is no return to a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, seen as essential to preserving peace. Supporters of a clean break with the EU say the backstop could leave Britain forced to accept EU regulations indefinitely, or Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of Britain. “This backstop,” said Barnier. “We will do everything we can to avoid using it.”  Barnier repeated his view that the Brexit deal that May wants the British parliament to back is the best Britain will get to arrange its orderly withdrawal from the EU. “The agreement that is on the table — the withdrawal agreement and the agreement on the future relationship — are, in our view, the only and best possible to organise an orderly withdrawal,” he said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and daughter of the founder and CEO, jolted the global business community on Thursday and raised fears that a truce in the U.S.-China trade war could come to a swift end. Meng’s arrest came at the behest of U.S. authorities and is connected to an investigation into alleged violations of U.S. trade sanctions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. China’s foreign ministry said neither the United States nor Canada have explained reasons for the arrest. What is Huawei? Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92 billion (72.29 billion pounds) last year. Unlike other big Chinese technology firms, it does much of its business overseas and is a market leader in many countries across Europe, Asia and Africa. The company was founded in 1987 by former military officer Ren Zhengfei. It remains privately held and describes itself as employee-owned, though its ownership structure is unknown. It is based in the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen and employs about 180,000 people. How did the company become so successful? Huawei was a pioneering supplier of telecom gear at a time when China was spending heavily to upgrade its networks, importing much of its equipment. Huawei began competing internationally in the 1990s and was known for drastically undercutting rivals on price. Competitors branded Huawei a cut-rate vendor of copycat equipment, and companies including Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Motorola filed lawsuits over alleged trade secret theft. But Huawei spent heavily on research and development and is now regarded as a global leader in key telecom network technologies and high-end smartphones. In contrast, its major Western rivals, Nokia (NOKIA.HE) and Ericsson (ERICb.ST), have struggled financially in recent years. Huawei today continues to expand into new areas including chip development, artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Why have some governments banned Huawei equipment? U.S. intelligence agencies allege that Huawei is linked to China’s government and that its equipment could contain “backdoors” for use by government spies. No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims. But suspicions persist. Concern now centres on the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, where Huawei is at the cutting edge. A new law in China requiring any domestic firm to assist the government when asked has also stoked concern. The U.S. government has taken a series of steps to block the firm from U.S. markets, including banning government purchases of Huawei gear and denying government help to any carrier that uses Huawei equipment. Top carriers Verizon Communications (VZ.N) and AT&T (T.N) pulled out of deals to distribute Huawei smartphones earlier this year. Most countries, even close U.S. allies such as Canada, Britain and Germany, have not made any moves against Huawei, arguing they have sufficient procedures to test equipment for security. But Australia and New Zealand recently banned Huawei from building 5G networks, and there are indications that other countries including Germany are revisiting the issue. Is the arrest of Meng Wanzhou related to these security concerns? U.S. authorities have not disclosed circumstances surrounding Meng's arrest, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters the arrest relates to violations of U.S. trade sanctions. Reuters published an investigation almost six years ago about her and Huawei's ties to a company call Skycom that tried to sell Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to an Iranian mobile-phone operator, in contravention of those sanctions. (reut.rs/2SzlxPV) Wasn’t another Chinese company also accused of Iran sanctions violations? Huawei’s smaller rival ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to evade embargoes by selling U.S. equipment to Iran. Earlier this year, the U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE violated the settlement and barred it from buying any U.S. components - a move that all but halted many ZTE operations. A new settlement was reached and the ban lifted at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump, a perceived concession to Chinese President Xi Jinping that surprised and angered others in the U.S. government. Are these issues related to the U.S.-China trade war? The sanctions investigations long preceded the trade war. But the timing of the arrest tangles the issues as it came just as Presidents Trump and Xi reached a temporary trade war truce. Financial markets turned negative on news of the arrest on fears it could scupper the truce. However, there is no evidence of it being a deliberate provocation by the U.S. rather than just an awkward coincidence. What might happen to Huawei now? A ban on U.S. component purchases, such as the one temporarily imposed on ZTE, would be devastating, but there is no immediate reason to suggest that will happen. If the case prompts major European countries in particular to turn against the firm, that would have a long-term impact on its growth and influence. Still, Huawei’s status as a kingpin of China’s high-tech industry, at a time when the country is racing to catch up with the U.S. in difficult areas such as chip development, means it will almost certainly remain a powerful force for years to come.

2019-02-08,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The EU’s top court will say on Monday whether Britain can unilaterally halt Brexit, potentially offering a boost to those opposed to leaving the European Union on the very eve of a crucial and tumultuous vote in the British parliament. In a brief statement on Thursday, the Court of Justice in Luxembourg said judges would deliver a ruling at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Dec. 10 in a case brought by Scottish politicians who argue Britain can simply withdraw its plan to leave in March, without waiting for the approval of the other member states. Prime Minister Theresa May is battling to get a Brexit deal that she negotiated with the European Union through parliament and insists there is no question of her stopping Brexit. But in a vote due on Tuesday, the treaty faces opposition from lawmakers both for and against Britain leaving the bloc. Acting with rare speed in a case only brought in October, a legal adviser to the court said on Tuesday that Britain could indeed make a U-turn entirely of its own accord. Such advice is usually, though not always, followed by the judges.  Clarification of Article 50 of the EU treaty matters because opponents of Brexit want a second referendum that gives the option of staying in the EU. Stating that this does not need EU approval makes a new ballot more credible, according to supporters of a “people’s vote”. Britons voted in 2016 to leave the EU by 52 percent to 48. EU leaders have long insisted they would welcome Britain changing its mind, but many EU officials and legal experts had believed that the approval of either all or most of the other 27 members states would be needed to halt Brexit altogether.  It is far from clear whether or how Britain could organise a new referendum, notably given the short time left until Brexit. If May wins her vote on Tuesday, the withdrawal seems likely to proceed as agreed with Brussels last month. If she loses, her own position could be in jeopardy, there could be a move for a new election, or possibly to hold a new referendum. Many warn, however, that it could stir unrest. Opinion polls suggest that any new majority for staying in the EU is narrow. May said on Thursday that the alternatives to her deal, under which Britain will for now remain closely tied to EU regulations over which it has no say, were a disorderly “no deal” Brexit or no Brexit at all. That echoed, notably, EU summit chair Donald Tusk last week. He has repeatedly said Britain can still stay. Tusk will chair a regular summit next Thursday and Friday and, if May has lost the vote, EU diplomats expect leaders to offer her some prospect of further discussions on how to make the deal acceptable in London — while making clear there is no time left for substantial changes to agreed texts. But talk of a possible British U-turn has increased in Brussels in the light of the parliamentary opposition to May’s deal and of the ECJ opinion. Other governments are concerned that a deeply divided Britain would remain an awkward EU member. However, few appear willing to be seen to force Britain out. As a result, officials and diplomats say, most are ready to postpone Brexit from March 29, at least by a few weeks, either to ensure an orderly withdrawal or, just possibly, give time for a second referendum. Few see the latter as likely, however. The speed of the ECJ’s intervention, compared with rulings that typically take many months, prompted the likes of Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage to accuse it of meddling in politics. ECJ President Koen Lenaerts has long predicted that Britain’s withdrawal will end up before his court. In taking on what is known as the Wightman case after one of the lawmakers who brought it, the court said on Oct. 19 that it aimed to rule before the British parliament takes its decision on the deal.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The United Nations is renewing efforts to end the Yemen war under a peace plan that calls for a ceasefire between the Saudi-led coalition and Iranian-aligned Houthi insurgents, and the formation of a transitional governance deal.  The nearly four-year-old conflict pits the Houthis, who seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, against forces backed by a Sunni Muslim coalition trying to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths, who was named to the post in February, convenes the warring parties in Sweden on Thursday for consultations for the first time since 2016. The U.N. has sponsored a series of talks aimed at ending the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the impoverished country to the brink of starvation.  Below are U.N.-sponsored talks reported by Reuters: * Sept 8, 2018, Geneva: Talks are abandoned after three days of waiting for the Houthi delegation, which failed to show up. The group accused the coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, of preventing its delegation from travelling. - The Houthis wanted to fly on a plane supplied by Oman without coalition inspections, and evacuate some wounded to Muscat for treatment. The Yemeni government says the Houthis are trying to sabotage talks. - Griffiths discusses confidence-building measures with Hadi’s delegation, including prisoner swaps, increasing humanitarian access and reopening Sanaa airport. * April 21, 2016, Kuwait: Talks bring together the Houthis and their General People’s Congress allies with Hadi’s government. - Suspended on May 1 by the Yemeni government after the  Houthis capture a military base north of Sanaa. Resume May 4. - Suspended on May 17 by the Yemeni government, which demanded that the Houthis first commit to withdrawing from captured cities and handing over their arms. Resume May 21. - Suspended on Aug. 1 after the Yemeni government walks out when Houthis reject a plan proposed by U.N. envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed calling on the group to quit three main cities, including Sanaa, ahead of talks to form a government that would include the Houthis.  - Adjourned by U.N. envoy August 6. * Jan 14, 2016: Talks scheduled to take place but are repeatedly postponed due to tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are fighting a proxy war in Yemen, and disagreement over whether a ceasefire is needed for a new round of talks. * Dec 15, 2015, Geneva: U.N. Special Envoy Ahmed launches direct talks between the two sides. They are suspended the next day after the Houthis reject government demands to release detained senior officials. Indirect talks between the parties end on Dec. 20  * April 16, 2015, The U.N. envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, resigns three weeks after the Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen.

2019-02-08,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh summoned the Myanmar ambassador on Wednesday to condemn “irresponsible remarks” made by Myanmar’s religion minister about Rohingya Muslims, and called for action against him, senior officials at the Bangladesh foreign ministry said. Rohingya Muslims living as refugees in Bangladesh after escaping Myanmar are being “brainwashed” into “marching” on the Buddhist-majority nation, Myanmar’s religion minister Thura Aung Ko said in a video released by the news website NewsWatch. “We strongly protest their minister’s provocative remarks. It also hurt Muslim sentiments,” a senior official in the Bangladesh foreign ministry told Reuters on Thursday.  Condemning the comments about “marching on Myanmar”, he said: “We have zero tolerance towards militancy. We have never encouraged radicalism.” “If you give them citizenship and their property back, they will run for Myanmar. Instead of doing that, you are making provocative statements? This is unfortunate,” the official said. More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state in the wake of a brutal army crackdown last August, U.N. agencies say, and are now living in crowded Bangladeshi refugee camps. U.N. investigators have accused Myanmar soldiers of carrying out mass killings, rapes and burning hundreds of villages with “genocidal intent”. Myanmar denies most of the allegations.  When Bangladesh summoned Myanmar ambassador U Lwin Oo, he “tried to dilute the comments by saying they were the religion minister’s personal opinion,” said an official at the Bangladesh foreign ministry who was present at the meeting. “But we asked for action against the minister.” The religion minister’s comments come as both countries have been engaged in negotiations for more than a year to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar, often blaming each other for delays in the process. The latest plan was scuppered last month after no refugees agreed to return, saying they wouldn’t go back unless Myanmar met a series of demands, chiefly granting them citizenship rights.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s embassy in Canada criticised Canada and the United States on Thursday for wrongfully arresting a senior executive at Chinese telecoms giant Huawei [HWT.UL] and demanded her immediate release. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s global chief financial officer, is facing extradition to the United States and her arrest could rekindle tensions between Washington and Beijing only days after they agreed to a ceasefire in a bitter trade war. Meng was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1. Her arrest is related to violations of U.S. sanctions, a person familiar with the matter said. Reuters was unable to determine the precise nature of the violations.  The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Canada said that it resolutely opposes Meng’s arrest and demands her immediate release. “The Canadian police, at the request of the United States, arrested a Chinese citizen who had not violated any U.S. or Canadian law,” the embassy said in a short statement on its website. “China has already made solemn representations to the United States and Canada, demanding they immediately correct their wrong behaviour and restore Ms Meng Wanzhou’s freedom.” A court hearing has been set for Friday, a Canadian Justice Department spokesman said. Meng is one of the vice chairs on the Chinese technology company’s board and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei. Huawei is strategically important to China’s ambitions in technology from 5G networks to chips. Western governments are increasingly wary of what they say is possible Chinese state involvement in fifth-generation mobile and other communications networks. Huawei has insisted Beijing has no influence over the company. Huawei’s smaller rival ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) had to temporarily halt much of its business earlier this year after the U.S. imposed an export ban on the company related to it illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tariff-driven price increases have spread more broadly through the U.S. economy, though on balance inflation has risen at a modest pace in most parts of the country, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its latest report on the economy. The U.S. central bank’s “Beige Book” report, a snapshot of the economy gleaned from discussions with business contacts in the Fed’s 12 districts in the weeks through November 26, also said that the economy appeared to be growing modestly to moderately.  While a wide range of businesses cited concerns about the effects of a trade war between the United States and China, firms continued to hire and reported bumping up benefits and pay to compete for an increasingly scarce labour pool.  Labour markets tightened across a broad range of industries, and wage growth “tended to the higher side of a modest to moderate pace,” the Fed said.  In the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank’s district, “labour availability was widely seen as the biggest obstacle to short-term growth,” according to the Beige Book.  The dollar held onto slim gains after the report was released. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates at the close of its Dec. 18-19 policy meeting. Policymakers have said the United States’ strong economy could stoke higher inflation if they do not raise borrowing costs further.  At the same time, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled the Fed’s three-year tightening cycle is drawing to a close and central bankers are looking for signs a global growth slowdown and a U.S.-China trade war might be weighing on the U.S. economy.  The Beige Book report highlighted the developing risks that Fed officials have begun citing more frequently as they plan how far to continue their rate increase cycle. “Reports of tariff-induced cost increases have spread more broadly from manufacturers and contractors to retailers and restaurants,” the Fed said.  President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on hundreds of Chinese imports, prompting retaliation against U.S. exports. The Fed said incomes and conditions in the agricultural sector, which has born the brunt of Chinese retaliatory tariffs, were “mixed,” hit by tariffs and excessive rainfall. Chinese tariffs have disrupted America’s massive soybean industry, with large shipments of beans wandering U.S. waterways instead of heading for China. In the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s district, “local contacts note that barge activity has increased due to the large number of storage barges for soybeans affected by recent tariffs.” Reporting by Jason Lange and Howard Schneider in Washington and by Ann Saphir in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-fed-beigebook/tariff-effects-broaden-across-u-s-wage-growth-higher-fed-idUKKBN1O42JM,2019-02-08,"Tariff-driven price increases have spread more broadly through the U.S. economy, though on balance inflation has risen at a modest pace in most parts of the country, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its latest report on the economy.","Tariff effects broaden across U.S., wage growth higher - Fed"

2019-02-08,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.S. government confirmed that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met with U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook in Vienna on Wednesday, contradicting a Saudi denial that the talks had taken place. Sources familiar with the meeting said earlier that Hook, a senior policy adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had spoken with Falih a day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was due to debate oil output cuts. The United States reimposed sanctions on OPEC member Iran last month. The measure has severely reduced Iranian oil flows. Washington has said it wants ultimately to drive Iranian shipments to zero. A Saudi Energy Ministry spokesman said of the talks between Falih and Hook: “We categorically deny such a meeting took place.” However, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman later confirmed the meeting occurred. “Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook met briefly with the Saudi Minister of Energy in Vienna on Wednesday,” the State Department spokeswoman said. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, to refrain from production cuts in order to keep oil prices low. He said higher oil supplies were a payback from Riyadh for U.S. support against Saudi arch-rival Iran. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh criticised Hook over the meeting for what he said was his “meddlesome approach”. “If Mr. Hook has come to Vienna to apply for U.S. membership in OPEC, and this is the reason why he meets OPEC members, this request shall be reviewed,” Zanganeh told Iran’s Oil Ministry news website SHANA. “Otherwise, he has adopted an unprofessional, naive and meddlesome approach. OPEC is an independent organisation and is not part of the U.S. Department of Energy to take orders from Washington,” Zanganeh told SHANA.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is clear on the potential dangers of reopening the deal to leave the European Union, her spokesman said on Wednesday, adding that the withdrawal agreement was complete. Some critics of the deal are pushing May to win more concessions from the EU to try to garner support for the agreement in parliament, which could reject it in a vote on Dec. 11. The EU has said the deal is the best on offer. May is also meeting members of parliament to try to win their support for the deal, the spokesman said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in UK housebuilders bounced off two-year lows on Wednesday as investors and traders covered bearish bets ahead of next week’s vote on Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal. The bounce didn’t signal a sudden change of mind from the market over the challenges facing housebuilders in an economy hurt by the decision to exit the European Union, but rather an acknowledgement that they may not have much further to fall, traders said. FTSE 100 housebuilders Berkeley Group (BKGH.L), Barratt Development (BDEV.L), Persimmon (PSN.L), and Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) jumped 3.9 to 6.5 percent, topping the FTSE 100 .FTSE leader board.  Among mid-caps, housebuilders Bovis Homes (BVS.L), Crest Nicholson (CRST.L), Bellway (BWY.L), and Redrow (RDW.L) jumped 3.7 to 7 percent.  Earlier in the session, the housebuilding sector .FTNMX3720 was at its lowest level since December 2016, down 16.2 percent this year against a 10 percent fall in the FTSE 350. In afternoon trade, it was up 0.2 percent. With next Tuesday’s vote on Prime Minister May’s Brexit deal looming, short sellers in the shares may be unwinding their positions ahead of the vote, banking their gains as they bet the prices may not have much further to fall. Housebuilders’ shares are currently pricing in earnings-per-share cuts of 26 to 35 percent, Barclays analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday, which they said reflects a fall of up to 8 percent in house prices and a 30 percent reduction in transactions in the housing market.  In the Bank of England’s “disorderly” Brexit scenario, the central bank said house prices could fall by 30 percent. What some see as a higher probability of Tuesday’s vote ultimately yielding a “no Brexit” outcome also helped boost the shares which have been under pressure since the Brexit vote.  JP Morgan analysts upped their estimated probability of “no Brexit” to 40 percent from 20 percent on Wednesday. Speculation the Bank of England would step in to support housebuilders could also be helping them. “People might well think that the government will pump money into the economy, in which case construction and housebuilding are fairly obvious areas to go,” said Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.  With valuations nearly at their lows hit just after the Brexit vote, and dividend yields among the highest in the FTSE 350, housebuilders also look attractive to income investors willing to stomach the risk.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Brexit outcome that left a large segment of the British people feeling betrayed would damage the country more than the small economic cost of Prime Minister Theresa May’s preferred Brexit plan, Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Wednesday. May’s government looks unlikely to win parliament’s backing for the plan she has agreed with the European Union to leave on March 29, which will preserve some trade advantages but leave Britain subject to EU rules. If May loses the Dec. 11 parliamentary vote on her deal it would open up possibilities that include a limited renegotiation, Britain leaving with no transition deal, a new election or even a second Brexit referendum, although the last is something May has ruled out. Hammond told parliament’s Treasury Committee of the dangers of rejecting May’s plan and either not leaving the EU at all or abruptly breaking most ties with the bloc.  “Any solution which left the country divided, left a large segment of the population feeling betrayed, in my view, would have a negative political impact and societal impact that would far outweigh the very small economic impact that the White Paper scenario is showing here,” he told the committee. Hammond said it would be “catastrophic” for Britain if it remained mired in the Brexit debate for years to come. “We have to resolve this,” he said. A government analysis last week showed a plan similar to May’s preferred option would cause only a small amount of economic damage compared with staying in the European Union, while a “no deal” Brexit would hurt growth more. Separate Bank of England analysis showed that in a worst-case “no deal” scenario, Britain would suffer a sharper recession than after the financial crisis. The BoE would probably expect the government to step in to provide fiscal stimulus in that situation, due to its inability to cut interest rates at a time when sterling would be tumbling and inflation pressures mounting, Hammond said. Years, not months, would be needed for Britain’s ports to be ready to handle the customs and regulatory checks required under the standard World Trade Organization terms favoured by some Brexit supporters, he said. “To be very frank with you ... the planning system might struggle to approve such significant infrastructure changes in two years,” he said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Veteran German conservative Wolfgang Schaeuble, a highly-respected figure in his party, has publicly backed Friedrich Merz, a former rival of Angela Merkel, to succeed her as head of the Christian Democrats (CDU) in a vote set for Friday. The winner will be in pole position to be the CDU’s candidate for chancellor of Europe’s biggest economy in a 2021 election and the outcome could even spell the end of Merkel’s coalition with her Bavarian allies and Social Democrats (SPD). The two front runners are Merkel protege and CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who leads polls of ordinary voters and party supporters, and Merz, who Bild am Sonntag weekly newspaper said is ahead among CDU delegates. “A majority for Merz would be the best thing for the country,” Schaeuble, who was loyal to Merkel as her hardline finance minister but had previously been a rival, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Wednesday. Working with Merkel who wants to remain chancellor, the new CDU leader will be influential in shaping German domestic, economic and foreign policy from relations with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to helping shape the EU.   Schaeuble argued that Merz, who lost out to Merkel in a power struggle in 2002 and quit politics for business in 2009, would be able to boost the CDU by giving it a stronger profile and working better with its Bavarian sister party. Merz, an economic liberal on the right of CDU, has said he wants to halve support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), now on about 15 percent, which capitalised on anger with Merkel’s open-door migrant policy. In a dig at Merkel’s cautious approach, Schaeuble said: “(He) is a man who sends clear signals with clear ideas, who has the courage not to wait for the end of a debate but shape it.” After deep rows with her Bavarian allies in the summer and heavy losses for the CDU in the state of Hesse in October, Merkel announced she would stand down as party leader but remain chancellor until the 2021 election. That may prove impossible. Merz, a millionaire who has said he wants “bold steps” to strengthen the economic and monetary union, has said he respects Merkel, who has pulled the CDU into the political centre ground, and would work with her. Many commentators are sceptical and it is also unclear if the SPD, also desperate to boost its poll ratings which have slumped to about 14 percent, could work with him. With the more centrist Kramp-Karrenbauer, a former premier of the tiny state of Saarland, cooperation with Merkel and the SPD would be easier. She insists she is not a Merkel clone, but there is scant evidence she would break with Merkel’s main policies. The third candidate, trailing in all the polls, is Health Minister Jens Spahn, a harsh critic of Merkel’s migrant policy.  With many of the 1,001 delegates undecided, commentators say the speeches given by the candidates at a party conference in Hamburg on Friday before the vote could be crucial.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s aviation authority said it would take legal action to force Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.I) to pay compensation to customers affected by strikes by its staff this summer.  The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Wednesday that the strikes were not exempt from the EU’s 261 rules on compensation and it had started enforcement action against the airline.  Ryanair was hit by a number of strikes this year by cabin crew and pilots, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and disrupting travel plans of more than 100,000 customers. Responding to the CAA’s statement, Ryanair said that it believed that compensation was not payable in the case of strikes.  “Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ and EU261 compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and courts will follow this precedent,” a spokesman for Ryanair said.  Enforcement action is when the CAA seeks legal undertakings from operators to ensure they change their policies and comply with the law.  Analysts at Goodbody noted that rival airlines Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and IAG’s (ICAG.L) British Airways had not been obliged to pay out EU 261 compensation due to strikes their staff had recently held.

Lawmakers have attempted to have an increased say over the Brexit process if May’s deal is rejected by parliament, but Leadsom said that the default position if May loses the vote is for a no deal, a potentially disorderly scenario.  “Unless government were to do something completely different to change tack, or indeed to pass this deal, then we will be leaving the EU on 29 March next year without a deal, so it defaults to no deal,” Leadsom said.  Asked if lawmakers have the power to stop a no-deal, Leadsom replied: “I can’t see that they do.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States delivered Russia a 60-day ultimatum on Tuesday to come clean about what Washington says is a violation of a arms control treaty that keeps missiles out of Europe, saying only Moscow could save the pact. NATO allies led by Germany pressed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a meeting in Brussels to give diplomacy a final push before Washington pulls out of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, fearing a new arms race in Europe. “Russia has a last chance to show in a verifiable way that they comply with the treaty ... but we also have to start to prepare for the fact that this treaty may break down,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters. NATO foreign ministers agreed to formally declare Russia in “material breach” of the INF treaty in a statement in support of the United States, after Pompeo briefed them at the alliance headquarters in Brussels on Russian violations and on U.S. President Donald Trump’s stated aim to withdraw from it.  Russia denies undertaking any such development of land-based, intermediate-range Cruise missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads and hitting European cities at short notice.  Germany, the Netherlands and Belgian are concerned about the  deployment of U.S. missiles in Europe - as happened in the 1980s, touching off large anti-American demonstrations - while being caught up in nuclear competition between Moscow and Washington. A U.S. exit from the INF treaty would put another strain on NATO allies already shaken by Trump’s demands for higher defence spending and what diplomats say is a lack of clarity about where U.S. strategy is heading on the issue. While Stoltenberg said there would now be an intense diplomatic push to try to convince Russia to give up what Pompeo said were “multiple battalions of the SSC-8 missiles”, Washington is set to start to pull out in February, prompting a six-month withdrawal period under the accord, diplomats said. “Its range makes it a direct menace to Europe,” Pompeo said of the missiles, which also are called Novator 9M729. He added that Russia’s actions “greatly undermine America’s national security and that of our allies”.  Difficult to detect and fired from mobile launchers, the Russian missiles are especially dangerous because they reduce the warning time that NATO air defences might have to shoot them down, military experts say.  Pompeo said the U.S. government had raised the issue at least 30 times since 2013 with Moscow but had faced what he said were denials and counter-actions.  He also said that the United States had evidence that the test launches were from a single site in Russia, the Soviet-era base Kupustin Yar, near Volgograd, southeast of Moscow.  “In the light of these facts, the United States declares Russia in material breach of the treaty and will suspend our obligations ... effective in 60 days unless Russia returns to full and verifiable compliance,” Pompeo said. Washington has said it would be forced to restore the military balance in Europe after the 60-day period but Pompeo declined to elaborate, saying only that tests and deployments of new missiles were on hold until then. He also said that because China, Iran and North Korea were not signatories to the INF, the United States was putting itself at a disadvantage by not developing medium-range missiles, citing three failed diplomatic attempts to enlarge the treaty. However, experts believe the United States would be better off modernising its long-range missile deterrent and ensuring that it could penetrate sophisticated Russian air defences, rather than developing a new class of medium-range rockets. The INF treaty, negotiated by then-President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and ratified by the U.S. Senate, eliminated the medium-range missile arsenals of the world’s two biggest nuclear powers and reduced their ability to launch a nuclear strike at short notice. U.S. Cruise and Pershing missiles deployed in Britain and West Germany were removed as a result of the treaty, while the Soviet Union pulled back its SS-20s out of European range. The treaty requires the United States and Russia “not to possess, produce, or flight-test” a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), “or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.” Reporting by Robin Emmott; Editing by Mark Heinrich",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nato-russia-pompeo/u-s-gives-russia-60-days-to-comply-with-nuclear-treaty-idUKKBN1O32AD,2019-02-08,,U.S. gives Russia 60 days to comply with nuclear treaty

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Concerns about growth, doubts about a U.S.-China trade truce, and a rising pound drove Britain’s top stock index down on Tuesday, while precious metal miners regained their lustre as gold prices rallied. The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed down 0.6 percent with the stronger sterling dragging on its exporter-heavy constituents.  Still, the market outperformed its euro-zone peers due to gains in its heavyweight oil and gold mining sectors and a flight to defensive stocks, popular at times of economic turmoil. But as investors’ optimism on a deal between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to delay tariffs evaporated, concerns about Brexit returned. The currency rose as much as 0.9 percent after an adviser to the European Union’s highest court said Britain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice. Investors were on tenterhooks as the British parliament began five days of debates on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal ahead of a crucial Dec. 11 vote. “We’re fairly neutral on the UK, but we’re playing it mainly through passive exposure - because you get the benefit of the currency if it weakens,” said Rory McPherson, investment director at Psigma Investment Management.  The quarterly reweighting of the indexes also roiled some shares, with Hiscox (HSX.L) expected to oust Royal Mail (RMG.L) from the blue chips and storied carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) set for promotion to the midcap index just two months after its IPO.  Final moves will be announced by the LSE on Wednesday based on market cap at Tuesday’s close. BAE Systems (BAES.L), down 5.5 percent, was one of the biggest decliners after Deutsche Bank cut its price target on the stock. Ferguson (FERG.L), previously known as Wolseley, lost 4.3 percent after the world’s largest heating & plumbing equipment supplier published first-quarter results. While trading profit was in line with expectations, analysts said the performance of the U.S. business, the company’s largest market, disappointed. Mining stocks such as Antofagasta and Glencore, down 3.5 and 1 percent respectively, fell as copper prices eased back on doubts over how fragile a trade truce struck at the G20 on Saturday was. Randgold Resources RRS.L and Fresnillo (FRES.L) both rose more than 3 percent as the gold miners benefited from investors’ bid for gold, considered a safer store of value in volatile markets.  Gold prices climbed to over a one-month high as the dollar slipped. Energy shares were a relatively bright spot, with oil major BP (BP.L) rising 1 percent and Shell (RDSa.L) ending little changed. Both ended off earlier highs as worries over trade curbed gains on crude oil prices. Thomas Cook (TCG.L) shares fell as much as 16.9 percent to hit their lowest level in six years amid growing concerns about the tour operator’s debts.  The shares closed 3.9 percent lower after an extremely choppy session as investors braced for the stock to be demoted from the midcap index. Its credit default swaps soared and bonds fell to all-time lows. The tour operator and travel company has lost 60 percent in the past week since its second profit warning in as many months.  Shares in construction and engineering firm Kier (KIE.L) fell 4.1 percent after Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy” after the company’s recently announced rights issue.  “After fees, a worse than previously assumed working capital outflow and confirmation of the average debt level using daily averages, the annualised benefit from the rights issue is arguably only around 90 million pounds,” the analysts wrote.  Online financial trading firm IG Group (IGG.L), down 9.7 percent, was among the biggest decliners on the FTSE 250 after it forecast a drop in trading revenue. Ted Baker (TED.L) fell a further 8.4 percent, extending its losses from Monday when an employee petition criticising the CEO’s policy of hugging sent the stock down 15 percent.  Consort Medical (CSRT.L) shares plunged 21.5 percent after the pharmaceutical firm’s full-year pre-tax profit was dented by about 3 million pounds due to delays with Mylan in their Wixela drug programme.  The stock suffered its worst day in a quarter-century.  Overall, analysts are downgrading their estimates of domestic U.K. stocks’ earnings at the fastest rate since the Brexit vote of June 2016.  “We feel there’s better trades to be had than being exposed to U.K. domestics. It could be a fantastic trade if we get a good deal, but at the moment they’re very beaten down,” said Psigma’s McPherson.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Tuesday led lower by auto stocks as investors started to question whether the truce agreed by the United States and China on their trade dispute would lead to a long-term deal.  After enjoying a rally for its first day of trading in December, Germany's DAX .GDAXI – the most sensitive to China and trade war fears – fell 1.1 percent, while the broader pan-European STOXX 600  index declined 0.8 percent.  “The number one driver for global risk sentiment is the U.S.-China trade talks, which suddenly don’t look as promising as they did over the weekend,” Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger wrote.  The European automotive sector .SXAP, which is most sensitive to trade war fears, was the biggest sectoral faller, down 1.7 percent. Shares in German carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) fell between 1.6 and 3 percent. The tech sector .SX8P was also a big loser, down 1.4 percent. Chipmakers, which are also heavily exposed to China and trade, sustained heavy losses with AMS (AMS.S) down 5.1 percent, Siltronic (WAFGn.DE) down 8.1 percent.  Adding to the weak sentiment, the yield curve between U.S. three-year and five-year notes and between two-year and five-year inverted on Monday, a first since the financial crisis, excluding very short-dated debt. Analysts now fear an inversion of the two-year, 10-year yield curve could be imminent and point towards a possible U.S. recession. “Recessionary fear is starting to raise its ugly head,” wrote Stephen Innes at broker Oanda. Top faller on the STOXX 600 was IG Group (IGG.L), down 9.7 percent, after the British online trading platform forecast a drop in first half 2019 revenues as it suffered from newly-introduced limits on ordinary individuals making highly-leveraged financial bets. French catering group Elior (ELIOR.PA) sank 8.6 percent after cutting its sales growth outlook, and Belgian postal services firm Bpost (BPOST.BR) plunged 22.8 percent after a profit warning. France’s JCDecaux (JCDX.PA) fell 2.9 percent after Exane BNP Paribas reinitiated its coverage of the stock with an “underperform” rating.    Energy stocks .SXEP gave up earlier gains as crude prices came off highs on worries that demand would stall due to a Sino-U.S. trade war, and that Russia remained a stumbling block to a deal to cut global crude supply.  BP (BP.L) however rose 0.9 percent and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) ended flat. German industrial gases group Linde (LINI.DE) will replace British bank Barclays (BARC.L) on the leading index of pan-European stocks STOXX Europe 50 .STOXX50, STOXX Ltd, the operator of Deutsche Boerse Group's index business, said. The change comes as part of the quarterly reshuffle and will be effective at the opening of European trading on Dec. 24, STOXX said on Monday.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Mismanagement of Brexit has made Britain the new “hot heads” of Europe and caused damage to its valuable financial services industry that will take at least a decade to repair, the City of London’s policy chief said. Brexit poses the biggest challenge to the City since the 2007-09 global crisis as it will probably lead to banks and insurers losing full or partial access to the European Union, the world’s biggest trading bloc. Catherine McGuinness said banks, insurers and asset managers in the “Square Mile” financial district were pushing ahead with setting up new hubs in the European Union by March, without waiting to see if parliament votes through a divorce settlement. The prospect of lawmakers voting through the deal first time next Tuesday appears slim, raising the likelihood of a “hard” Brexit which throws up greater trade barriers for financial firms. “People realise it is going to be very turbulent whatever happens,” McGuinness told Reuters. “The worst-case scenario would be no-deal happening by accident or design.” The City is exasperated with the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which has hurt Britain’s image abroad and will take time to rebuild, she said. “We do travel the world quite extensively and I do find people asking what is going on in the UK, saying ‘you used to be so statesman-like and rather boring, and now you seem to have become the hot heads and hot bloods of Europe’,” she said. The uncertainty for Britain’s largest economic sector would continue, whether a transition deal starts next March or if Britain crashed out of the bloc, McGuinness said. About 5,000-13,000 financial jobs are expected to have left Britain by Brexit Day with a further shift in staff and operations likely. “We won’t know what we are going to look like for at least 10 years,” McGuinness said, adding that the City will remain a leading global financial centre which adapts to create jobs in areas like fintech. After a “standstill” transition is due to end in December 2020 - if approved - the sector faces more limited access to the EU’s financial market after an industry push for broader relations was rejected by Brussels. Looking back over the period since Britain’s 2016 referendum in favour of Brexit, McGuinness said the sector underestimated how unified the EU would be and the other pressing issues the bloc faces. “We forget it isn’t just an economic exercise for the EU27 but a major political one. It’s a lack of understanding on what the EU is seeking to achieve,” she said. Some lawmakers have proposed that Britain could, temporarily at least, have close ties with the EU like Norway, but McGuinness said that becoming a “rule taker” or having to follow the bloc’s regulation without a say, would be divisive. The financial sector also worries that if there is a general election to end political gridlock over Brexit, the opposition Labour Party could end up in government and introduce sweeping changes, such as tax on financial transactions. “Overseas and business are looking very carefully at what announcements are being made and whether they are business-friendly or not,” McGuinness said. “Anyone making policies needs to think very hard about priorities and jobs and growth, and what is best for the country.” Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill and Iain Withers, editing by Ed Osmond",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-banks/brexit-hash-makes-britain-hot-heads-of-europe-city-chief-idUKKBN1O30Y4,2019-02-08,,Brexit hash makes Britain 'hot heads' of Europe - city chief
2019-02-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A growing rivalry between two powerful Shi’ite Muslim factions has paralysed efforts to form a government in Iraq six months after an election aimed at steering the country towards recovery from years of war. The two largest parliamentary groupings to emerge after the vote in May - one led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and the other by Iranian-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri - formed a tacit alliance in October when they picked a president and approved 14 out of 22 cabinet ministers. But since then there has been stalemate, mainly over the empty interior ministry post dominated for years by allies of Amiri, who are backing the former head of a paramilitary force supported by Tehran. Sadr meanwhile says no one with a political affiliation should get the post. A vote in parliament to fill the vacant ministries in Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s cabinet has been repeatedly put back.  Iraq’s return to deadlocked parliamentary politics, now involving Shi’ite factions rather than the Sunni-Shi’ite sectarianism that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, prompted a plea last week from Iraq’s most senior Shi’ite cleric for politicians to work together. That now looks all but impossible. As Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani made his remarks, the two sides broke off talks, lawmakers said. “We reached a dead end,” Hanin Qaddo, a member of the bloc led by Amiri, told Reuters on Friday.  “There’s no need for more delays, no use in talks,” MP Ahmed al-Kinani said. “We will go to parliament and vote for the rest of the cabinet.”  He said they would do this without agreement from Sadr’s supporters even though the parliamentary arithmetic is against them. Sadr on Monday urged Abdul Mahdi to present the rest of his cabinet to parliament for approval as soon as possible, without disputed candidates. “You must not submit to what is going on behind the scenes,” Sadr told the prime minister. Sadr, whose alliance won the most parliamentary seats in the election, has threatened to walk out of the political process and stage mass demonstrations as he has done in the past, notably when protesters stormed Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone in 2016. “If Bina (Amiri’s bloc) ignores us then we will resort to all possible options including mobilising the street,” said a member of Sadr’s alliance, who declined to give his name. Whether Sadr’s walk-out is imminent or not, the confrontation is paralysing efforts to rebuild a country wrecked by its war with Islamic State and provide services in poor areas. Flash floods killed several people last month, and militants still stage small-scale attacks. Local officials blame  political infighting for failure to deliver services. “There’s no reconstruction or jobs here,” said Sheikh Abu Mashan, a tribal leader in Anbar province.  “Main electricity lines are still down. At first they said we’d get power by October. Now they say January. Authorities have no interest in us - they’ve spent nearly seven months talking and still have no government.” The deadlock also means a 2019 budget has not been passed, so provinces do not know how much they will have to spend on fixing services. “Heavy rainfall cut roads out of Mosul,” governor official Nouruddin Catalan said. “We don’t even have enough money to fix roads damaged by fighting.” Abdul Mahdi was seen by many parties as a compromise candidate for the post of prime minister who might form a government of independent technocrats capable of delivering services and reducing unemployment, the causes of protests that turned violent in September. He was approved by both parliamentary groupings, which include Sunni parties. Sunnis and Kurds also hold cabinet posts. But the power struggle between Sadr and Amiri has removed the initiative from the prime minister’s hands, and away from parliament, analysts say. “It’s not up to him and it’s not up to the parliamentarians - neither the executive nor the legislative branches of government have a say in forming the next cabinet,” said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London think-tank. “There’s no leader yet who’s able to sit the two sides together and get to the bottom of who will be interior (minister) ... it’s become a matter of principle.” These divisions among Shi’ite leaders could weaken Iranian influence in Iraq, which has grown since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein 15 years ago.  If the split persists, Iran would prefer to see Amiri and his fellow militia leaders in a strong position. But while Iran will try to stop the divisions getting any worse, there is no sign yet that it has mediated between the two factions. Lawmakers from Sadr’s parliamentary group said they sent a message last week to Amiri’s candidate for interior minister, Falih al-Fayyadh, the former head of a grouping that comprises Iraq’s Shi’ite militias, asking him to step down. MPs in Amiri’s bloc told Reuters they would try to push Fayyadh through parliament after giving up on talks with the Sadists. Without agreement from Sadr, however, the vote is unlikely to pass, putting further pressure on Abdul Mahdi’s crisis-hit government. “Despite the difficulties the prime minister is facing in nominating interior and defence ministers, he should complete this formation and present names. Otherwise his government cannot really continue like this,” said Dhiaa al-Asadi, a top adviser to Sadr. The defence ministry is also in play, but the interior post is the main sticking point. Asadi said Sadr would give Abdul Mahdi up to six months to form a full cabinet before withdrawing support. Pressure is also coming from Amiri’s side. “If Abdul Mahdi is convinced ... that Fayyadh is the right candidate, he needs to present him,” said Qais al-Khazali, a militia leader whose political wing has contributed lawmakers to Amiri’s bloc. “The prime minister doesn’t currently have a majority bloc in parliament that would support his government for four years,” Khazali said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers picked up the pace of their shopping in January which rose by the most in seven months, giving a bit of relief to retailers after their worst Christmas in a decade, a survey showed on Tuesday. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said its members reported total sales increased by an annual 2.2 percent, helped by higher spending on food and New Year price cutting. “While retail discounts helped tempt cautious consumers, there is no guarantee this momentum will continue after the sales have finished,” BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said. “Furthermore, the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit could see these fortunes reversed.” Prime Minister Theresa May wants European Union leaders to offer more concessions on Britain’s exit deal, less than two months to go before the country is due to leave the bloc. The BRC said colder weather helped drive clothing sales. British consumers have seen their spending power squeezed for much of the past 10 years although their wages have grown more quickly than inflation in recent months. Reflecting the squeeze, sales of non-essentials fell again in the three months to January, the BRC said.  Separately on Tuesday, Barclaycard said its measure of consumer spending rose by 2.9 percent in annual terms, also quicker than December’s 1.8 percent rise. Similar to the BRC, Barclaycard said the increase was driven mostly by spending on essentials which rose the most in five months, up 6.4 percent. Supermarket spending was up by 6.8 percent, the most since April 2017.   Supermarket groups Sainsbury’s and Morrisons both missed their Christmas sales forecasts. Sainsbury’s highlighted highly competitive and markets which were awash with discounts. Barclaycard’s figures are based on credit and debit card spending between Dec. 23 and Jan. 19. The BRC data cover Dec. 30 to Jan. 26.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Financial services firms in Britain paid a record 75 billion pounds in taxes in the last financial year, but City bosses warned a chaotic Brexit could blow a hole in the industry’s tax receipts in future years. The total tax haul in the year to the end of March was up 4 percent on the previous year’s 72.1 billion pounds, according to research from consultancy PwC and the City of London Corporation, the local government for the capital’s financial district.  The previous year’s tax take had also set a record. The sector is Britain’s largest taxpayer, accounting for more than a tenth of all tax receipts.    The research comes amid warnings that a disorderly Brexit could lead to thousands of finance professionals and billions of pounds of assets shifting overseas from Britain.  Lawmakers are preparing for a crucial vote on a withdrawal agreement between Britain and the EU on December 11, with City firms concerned rejection of the deal could lead to political turmoil and Britain crashing out without agreed terms next March. “With Brexit edging ever closer, it is more important than ever that the UK remains competitive to safeguard the sector’s employment and tax base,” said Catherine McGuinness, policy chair for the City. “It is crucial that we avoid a no-deal Brexit that could jeopardise financial stability and drive activity away from the UK.” A return to healthy profits at many of the country’s largest lenders after years of costly restructuring and fines for past misconduct after the financial crisis led to a surge in tax on earnings. The industry’s corporation (company) tax bill jumped more than a fifth to 14.1 billion pounds in the financial year to March 2018. This was up from 11.6 billion pounds the previous year. Of this figure, 1.8 billion pounds came from the bank surcharge on corporation tax - a levy targeted at City firms that banks have been lobbying to have dropped. Financial services firms paid more than a quarter (25.1 percent) of all British corporation tax receipts. Employment taxes for the period stood at 32.9 billion pounds, the largest proportion of the sector’s tax bill. Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the research “reinforces the value of the sector” to the British economy.  “Its overall financial and social contribution to the economy and wider society needs to be fully appreciated,” he added.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government should levy a tax on retailers with online sales accounting for more than 20 percent of revenue to save traditional shopping districts, the billionaire boss of Sports Direct told lawmakers on Monday. Mike Ashley said the move would be “a massive electric shock” for the sector, encouraging retailers to invest in physical stores. “You have to tax the internet for the good of the high street, the good of the all,” Ashley told the lower house of parliament’s Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee. “If I’m a retailer ... I will make sure not to pay the tax, I keep 80 percent of my revenues going through the high street,” he said, noting that Sports Direct has a 400 million pounds internet business. He said that, if the new levy came in, it would make sense for Sports Direct and retailers in general to invest in and keep stores open. With annual revenue of about 3.36 billion pounds,  Sports Direct currently would not be liable for the tax Ashley proposed.  Ashley also called on local councils to offer retailers free business rates (property taxes) for five years if every pound of free rates was matched by retailer investment in the site. The parliamentary committee is conducting an inquiry into the future of traditional retail districts after a torrid year for the sector.         A string of British store groups have gone out of business or announced shop closures this year as they battle subdued consumer spending, rising labour costs, higher property taxes, growing online competition and uncertainty over Brexit. Toys R Us UK, Maplin and Poundworld have all gone bust, while combined store closures from Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, Mothercare and House of Fraser are in the hundreds. A net 1,123 stores disappeared from Britain’s top 500 high streets in the first half of 2018, research by PwC showed last month. An estimated 40,000 people have been affected this year by the sector’s upheaval, the BBC reported on Monday.  In August Sports Direct snapped up the 59-store House of Fraser department store chain for 90 million pounds after it collapsed into administration. So far Ashley has secured the future of about 23 stores. He has blamed the closure of others on landlords for not offering more favourable terms. Ashley told lawmakers his target was to keep 80 percent of House of Fraser’s stores open. “I’m not Father Christmas, I’m actually, I believe, a very fair guy,” he told lawmakers.  In October Sports Direct purchased specialist bicycle retailer Evans Cycles for an undisclosed sum immediately after its parent went into administration, but Ashley said that only half of the chain’s 62 stores would avoid closure. Ashley’s parliamentary appearance was not his first. In 2016 he was summoned to explain Sports Direct’s working practices and conceded it had effectively paid some warehouse staff below the statutory minimum wage.

2019-02-08,"ST ANDREWS, Scotland (Reuters) - The chief of Britain’s foreign intelligence service warned the Kremlin on Monday not to underestimate the West after a brazen nerve agent attack on a retired double agent in England stoked fears about Russian covert activity abroad. In his second major speech since being named in 2014 to head the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, Alex Younger, ranged across the global threats faced by Britain as it prepares to exit the European Union in less than four months. Russia, the only national adversary named in his scripted speech, has a stance of “perpetual confrontation” with the West, said Younger, citing the nerve agent attack on former Russian  agent Sergei Skripal in March in the English city of Salisbury. Western allies ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War in response to the attack, in which Britain said Russian GRU military intelligence agents had used the Novichok nerve agent against Skripal. “The Russian state used a military-grade chemical weapon on UK soil,” Younger told students at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where he once studied economics and computer science before joining the British army and then MI6. “Our intention is for the Russian state to conclude that, whatever the benefits it thinks it is accruing from this activity, they are not worth the risk,” said Younger.  Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and accused British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.  Skripal, an officer in Russian military intelligence, betrayed dozens of spies to MI6, though he was later pardoned and exchanged in a Cold War-style spy swap. The motive of the attack remains unclear, as is the logic of using such an exotic nerve agent, which has overt links to Russia’s Soviet past. “I should emphasise that even as the Russian state seeks to destabilise us, we do not seek to destabilise Russia. We do not seek escalation,” Younger said. Younger, 55, also said that Britain’s spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas. MI6 continues to work with partner agencies to strengthen “indispensable security ties” in Europe, he said, adding that Britain had helped France and Germany prevent terrorist attacks. Answering questions from students, Younger said the global balance was tilting towards China as the world’s second largest economy gains significant capital, political clout and technological dominance. “Basically, power, money and politics is going east,” he said. “That’s a new political reality we need to adjust to.” He said 5G reliance on Chinese technology was something Britain needed to discuss, though a bigger issue was the likely Chinese future dominance of emerging technologies. Younger said he had been struck by President Xi Jinping’s “made in China” ambitions and that Beijing could within decades dominate all of the key emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and genetics. “This is something we really need to think about,” Younger said. “The future of knowledge is in play.” A career spy who joined MI6 as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Younger said that while technologies advanced, human intelligence remained crucial. “Even in an era of artificial intelligence you need human intelligence, in fact it will become even more important.” In a recruitment pitch, Younger gave some details of his own life, including drinking obscure homemade alcohol in an attempt to penetrate an organisation intent on genocide in the Western Balkans in the 1990s.

2019-02-08,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar said it will quit OPEC to focus on gas in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide. Doha, one of OPEC’s smallest oil producers but the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, is embroiled in a row with OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It said the surprise decision to exit OPEC, which has 15 members including Qatar, in January was not driven by politics and it did not name Saudi Arabia, but Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi said: “We are not saying we are going to get out of the oil business but it is controlled by an organisation managed by a country,” al-Kaabi said. Qatar would attend an OPEC meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Vienna and would abide by its commitments, he said, adding that Doha would focus on its gas potential. This was because it was not practical “to put efforts and resources and time in an organisation that we are a very small player in and I don’t have a say in what happens,” he added. For a graphic on Qatar's LNG and oil exports, see - tmsnrt.rs/2QbsLNg OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and fellow Arab states Bahrain and Egypt, have imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. Qatar’s former prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, said on Twitter that OPEC “is only used for purposes that hurt our national interests”. The United Arab Emirates said Doha’s decision was a reflection of its declining influence. “The political aspect of Qatar’s decision to quit OPEC is an admission of the decline of its role and influence in light of its political isolation,” Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said on Twitter. OPEC’s loss of a long-standing member undermines a bid to show a united front before a meeting that is expected to back a supply cut to shore up prices. Benchmark Brent is trading at around $62 a barrel, down from more than $86 in October. “They are not a big producer, but have played a big part in (OPEC’s) history,” one OPEC source said. It highlights the growing dominance over policy making in the oil market of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the world’s top three oil producers which together account for more than a third of global output. Riyadh and Moscow have been increasingly deciding output policies together, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on OPEC to bring down prices.  “It could signal a historic turning point of the organisation towards Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States,” said Algeria’s former energy minister and OPEC chairman, Chakib Khelil, commenting on Qatar’s move. For a graphic on Who produces what within OPEC?, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RxkhwC He said Doha’s exit would have a “psychological impact” because of the row with Riyadh and could prove “an example to be followed by other members in the wake of unilateral decisions of Saudi Arabia in the recent past.” Qatar, which Al-Kaabi said had been a member of OPEC for 57 years, has oil output of just 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared with Saudi Arabia’s 11 million bpd. But Doha is an influential player in the global LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes per year, based on its huge reserves in the Gulf. For a graphic on The world's biggest LNG exporters, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RvFB5z Al-Kaabi, who is heading Qatar’s OPEC delegation, said the decision was part of a long-term strategy and the country’s plans to develop its gas industry and increase LNG output to 110 million tonnes by 2024. “I assure you this purely was a decision on what’s right for Qatar long term. It’s a strategy decision,” Al-Kaabi said.   The exit is the latest example of Qatar charting a course away from its Gulf neighbours since the rift began last year. It comes before an annual summit of Gulf Arab states expected to grapple with the roughly 18-month standoff. Once close partners with Saudi Arabia and the UAE on trade and security, Qatar has struck scores of new trade deals with countries further afield while investing heavily to scale up local food production and ramp up military power. “There is a sentiment in Qatar that Saudi Arabia’s dominance in the region and the region’s many institutions has been counterproductive to Qatar,” said Andreas Krieg, a political risk analyst at King’s College London. “It is about Qatar breaking free as an independent market and state from external interference.” Oil surged about 5 percent on Monday after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war, but prices remain well off October’s peak. Asked if Qatar’s withdrawal would complicate OPEC’s decision on output this week, a non-Gulf OPEC source said: “Not really, even if it’s a regrettable and sad decision.” Al-Kaabi said state oil company Qatar Petroleum planned to raise its production capability from 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to 6.5 million barrels in the next decade. Doha also plans to build the largest ethane cracker in the Middle East and it would still look to expand its oil investments abroad, Al-Kaabi added.

2019-02-08,"SEVILLE/MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s far-right Vox party won 12 seats in an election in Andalusia on Sunday and could end up as a kingmaker in the region, in the first electoral success for the far-right since the country’s return to democracy in the late 1970s. It was the first time the nationalist surge that has swept much of Europe had reached Spain, long seen as immune because many still remember the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco. With the Socialists weakened in a region they governed since Franco’s death and which they could now lose to a right-wing coalition, the Andalusia result is likely to send shockwaves through the Spanish political landscape. A series of local, municipal and European elections will follow at the end of May with politics in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, long dominated by the Socialists and the conservative People’s Party, upended by start-up parties. “We are the ones who will bring about change, progress and the reconquest,” Francisco Serrano, Vox’s candidate in Andalusia told a loud crowd gathered in Seville, many of whom waved Spanish flags and chanted “Spain! Spain!”     There are a total of 109 seats in Andalusia’s regional assembly and the vote was very divided, in a fresh sign of how the large parties are finding it harder and harder to secure majorities in Spain.  With 99.9 percent of ballots counted, the Socialists received most votes.  But with only 33 seats for them and 17 for the far-left Podemos and its allies, that is well down from previous elections and they would struggle to secure a majority.     The conservative People’s Party (PP), which came second, said they would seek leadership of Spain’s most populous region. “Change has won in Andalusia!” PP candidate Juanma Moreno told a rally.  The PP’s national leader Pablo Casado said his party planned to hold talks in Andalusia with all the parties to the right of the Socialists. That would include Vox and the centre-right Ciudadanos. Together, they have a majority of seats. All three hailed the result of the Andalusia election and said they wanted to boot the Socialists out of the region.  The Socialists urged mainstream parties to block the far-right and said they saw Vox’s 12 seats as “very serious.” “This phenomenon we have seen in the rest of Europe and the world has now reached Spain and is entering the Andalusia parliament,” Susana Diaz, the Socialist candidate in the region, told supporters.     Andalusia, which has one of Europe’s highest unemployment rates, is the entry point for thousands of Africans who have been reaching Spain by sea in greater numbers as traffic on the other main route across the Mediterranean to Italy has been curbed. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen congratulated Vox, tweeting: “Strong and warm congratulations to my friends from @Vox, who tonight in Spain scored a very meaningful result for such a young and dynamic movement.”            The vote was the first electoral test for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who came to power without an election in June after parliament ousted the conservatives over a corruption scandal.      The next national election is due in 2020 but speculation has been rife for months that Sanchez, who controls fewer than a quarter of seats in the Madrid parliament, could call a snap vote. However, senior Socialists said before the Andalusia election that they did not expect it to trigger a general election, and there would seem to be little incentive for Sanchez to do so now after the disappointing results for his party in Andalusia. Much will depend now on whether the Socialists, who have not yet managed to get the country’s budget approved in parliament, gather enough support from smaller parties, including Catalan nationalists.

2019-02-08,"ST ANDREWS, Scotland (Reuters) - The chief of Britain’s foreign intelligence service will warn the Kremlin on Monday not to underestimate the West after a brazen nerve agent attack on a retired double agent in England stoked fears about Russian covert activity abroad. In his second major speech since being named in 2014 to head the Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, Alex Younger will say Russia has a stance of “perpetual confrontation” with the West. Younger will outline how, after the attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer who betrayed dozens of agents to MI6, Britain’s allies in Europe and the United States took its part and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Britain identified the nerve agent deployed in the town of Salisbury as Novichok, a highly potent group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s. Moscow has repeatedly denied involvement and accused British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria. But Younger will urge “Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies”, according to excerpts of the speech. Speaking at St Andrews University, where he once studied, Younger, 55, will say that Britain’s spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas. Less than four months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, Younger will also say MI6 continues to work with partner agencies to strengthen “indispensable security ties” in Europe. MI6, the home of fictional spies such as John le Carré’s George Smiley and Ian Fleming’s James Bond, has the job of defending Britain, and its interests, abroad.  A career spy who joined MI6 as the Soviet Union was crumbling, Younger will stress the need for espionage to embrace the new. “The era of the fourth industrial revolution calls for a fourth-generation espionage: fusing our traditional human skills with accelerated innovation, new partnerships and a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young,” he will say. “I want to speak to young people who have never seen themselves in MI6 ... If you want to make a difference and you think you might have what it takes, then the chances are that you do have what it takes, and we hope you will step forward.” Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-security/british-spymaster-cautions-russia-dont-underestimate-the-west-idUKKBN1O10US,2019-02-08,,British spymaster cautions Russia - Don't underestimate the West
2019-02-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A hard-headed hospital nun who disobeyed doctor’s orders saved the life of Pope Francis some six decades ago when he risked dying of pneumonia, the pope reveals in a new book.  When Francis was studying for the priesthood in Latin America in the 1950s he caught pneumonia, but it was mis-diagnosed by the seminary’s doctor, who thought is was the flu, and one day had to be rushed to hospital “on the point of death,” he says. A doctor at the hospital realised it was pneumonia and ordered staff to give the young Jorge Mario Bergoglio two types of antibiotics. But a hospital nun named Cornelia Caraglio, had a different idea. “As soon as the doctor left (she told the staff) ‘let’s double the dose.’ She certainly was a wise nun. By ordering that the dose be doubled she saved my life,” he said. Several months later, the future pope returned to hospital to have the upper part of one of his lungs removed because of an infection. Francis, 81, made the comments in a book-length interview with Spanish priest Fernando Prado called “The Strength of Vocation”, in which he discusses the challenges of being a priest or nun today. It is due to be published this week in several languages. An advance copy of the Italian version was made available to Reuters.

2019-02-08,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Japan will put issues ranging from global trade imbalances to the impact of ageing populations on the agenda when it chairs next year’s meetings of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies, government officials said. At the end of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Finance Minister Taro Aso unveiled the “priority issues” to be taken up by his counterparts and central bank governors next year when Japan takes over the chairmanship from Argentina. Japan will host a G20 financial leaders’ meeting in Fukuoka in western Japan on June 8-9, followed by a leaders’ summit in Osaka on June 28-29. Tokyo will assert that global current account imbalances should be fixed via multilateral policy coordination rather than bilateral trade deals, the officials said. They declined to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Excessive imbalances should be adjusted by improving the ratio of investment and saving through macroeconomic policy and structural reform, they added. Global imbalances had once been a key topic at G20 meetings with a focus on each country’s current account balance, or the overall flow of money including, but not confined to, trade. This approach runs counter to President Donald Trump’s focus on narrowing the U.S. trade deficit using import tariffs and bilateral deals. His “America First” policies and the U.S.-China trade war have overshadowed debates at recent G20 meetings. Japan’s plans underscore Tokyo’s view that instead of focussing too much on bilateral trade imbalances, there should be more emphasis on overall capital flows and structural factors behind the U.S. deficit - such as a lack of domestic savings. Saddled with its own ageing population and the industrial world’s heaviest public debt burden, Japan will also highlight the issue of ageing and its impact on fiscal and monetary policies at next year’s G20 meetings, the officials said. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said an ageing population could pose “serious challenges” for central banks, as it undercuts economies’ growth potential and requires them to use more monetary firepower than before to boost growth. Also on the agenda under Japan’s G20 chair will be the need to ensure debt sustainability, given rising debt in low-income countries, and to promote high-quality infrastructure investment.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday he has seen all the intelligence possessed by the United States on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and repeated that no direct evidence links Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the incident.  “I have read every piece of intelligence that is in the possession of United States government,” Pompeo said in an interview with broadcaster CNN in Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G20 summit. “When it is done, when you complete that analysis, there’s no direct evidence linking him to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That is an accurate statement, an important statement and it is a statement that we are making publicly today,” he said. Asked if the Central Intelligence Agency had concluded with “high confidence” that Prince Mohammed, de-facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, was involved, Pompeo said: “I can’t comment on intelligence matters, CIA conclusions.” The CIA has assessed that the crown prince ordered the Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of Washington Post columnist Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi crown prince. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. U.S. President Donald Trump sought to cast doubt on the CIA assessment that the prince ordered Khashoggi’s killing, telling reporters the agency had not formed a definitive conclusion. Many U.S. senators have said they believed otherwise. Pompeo said the United States was working with Saudi Arabia in Afghanistan and against Iran and that Riyadh was “an enormous support” for Washington. “They’re a relationship that has mattered for 70 years across Republican and Democrat administrations like ... We’re aiming to keep that relationship,” he said.

2019-02-08,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Two jailed Catalan separatist leaders awaiting trial for their role in the region’s failed bid to secede from Spain said on Saturday they were starting a hunger strike to protest over their treatment by Spanish courts. After Catalonia declared independence last year, Madrid took direct control of the region and brought charges including misuse of public funds and rebellion against Catalan leaders, nine of whom are in jail awaiting trial. Two of the leaders in custody — Jordi Sanchez and Jordi Turull — announced in a joint statement that they had started refusing food to protest at the failure of Spanish courts to process numerous appeals in relation to their cases. “We are not asking the court for special treatment. But we will not passively accept discrimination or unwarranted delays,” the two men said in the statement. Sanchez told Reuters in an interview last week that he was convinced he would not get a fair trial in Spain, but believed he and other separatist leaders would be acquitted by the European Court of Human Rights. A Spanish government spokesperson said the jailed separatists would get a fair trial. “Only the judiciary is responsible for sentencing,” the spokesperson added.

2019-02-08,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Britain will not use the European Union’s Galileo space project for defence or critical national infrastructure after Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday. A row over Galileo, which the bloc is developing to rival the U.S. Global Positioning System, erupted earlier this year when London accused the EU of shutting British businesses out of the project before Britain’s exit next March. The EU has said its rules prohibit it sharing sensitive security information with countries outside the bloc.  Britain will explore options to build its own Global Navigation Satellite System to help guide military drones, run energy networks and provide essential services for civilian smart phones, May’s office said. It will also work with the United States to continue accessing its GPS system. “I have been clear from the outset that the UK will remain firmly committed to Europe’s collective security after Brexit,” May, who is attending the G20 Summit in Argentina, said in a statement. “But given the Commission’s decision to bar the UK from being fully involved in developing all aspects of Galileo it is only right that we find alternatives.” Britain told the EU earlier this year it would demand the repayment of up to 1 billion pounds if the bloc restricted its access to Galileo.  A senior British official said the question of past contributions was still a “live issue” which would be discussed  as part of talks on Britain’s future relationship with the bloc. In August, Britain said its UK Space Agency, with support from the Ministry of Defence, would start work on an alternative satellite system to Galileo to ensure its national security if it were barred from equal access to the EU programme after Brexit, setting aside 92 million pounds for it. “I cannot let our armed services depend on a system that we cannot be sure of. That would not be in our national interest,” May said.

U.S. shares, however, turned positive midday after a Chinese official said at the Group of 20 industrialized nations summit in Argentina that the United States and China were making progress on trade talks. “Consensus is steadily increasing,” Wang Xiaolong, director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s department of international economic affairs, told Reuters on the sidelines of the summit.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of murders in London has fallen below that of New York City but could still hit a 10-year high if it continues at the current pace, police data analysed by Reuters shows. Provisional figures for February and March released earlier in the year suggested that the murder rate in London had overtaken New York for the first time in modern history. But the number of murders in New York so far this year is now double the number in London, according to figures from the NYPD and London’s Metropolitan (Met) Police. There had been 112 murders in London to October this year, compared to 238 in New York. But with more murders in London in November, the total for the year stands at 127, on pace to reach the highest number since 2008, when there were 154. “It’s difficult for us to be even slightly positive when we’ve got the murder rate that we have,” Patrick Green, CEO of the Ben Kinsella Trust, an anti-knife crime charity named after a young victim, told Reuters. (Graphics on 'London and New York: murder totals in 2018' - https://tmsnrt.rs/2PZnFn4) London and New York are similarly sized cities but there is less gun violence in Britain, which has strict gun control laws, than in the United States and most British police are not equipped with firearms. But the rise in violent crime in London is challenging that approach. The Met denied that it would routinely deploy armed officers in communities affected by violence after media reports on Friday, but did say armed police might be deployed in specific instances where violence had happened, or where intelligence suggested it could happen imminently. The rise is driven by an increase in knife crime. So far this year, 59 percent of homicides have been stabbings, while only 10 percent have been shootings. Met Police Commander David Musker said a Violent Crime Task Force, formed earlier this year, had arrested more than 2,000 people in the last eight months and seized more than 460 knives, 340 offensive weapons and more than 100 lethal firearms. “Whilst rates in London are now beginning to stabilise, we are not complacent and are committed to using all the powers at our disposal to tackle this issue,” he said. While members of parliament in Westminster obsess over Brexit, the rise in violent crime is still having political ramifications. During an election campaign last year Prime Minister Theresa May was criticised for her record as home secretary, where she presided over police cuts. Rather than bolstering support for her Brexit plan through the vote, she lost her parliamentary majority. May says that 460 million pounds has been made available for policing this year. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has highlighted the difficulties caused by cuts in police numbers, but has himself faced scrutiny for saying that London remains one of the safest global cities in the world. In general terms, Khan is right: London ranked 20th in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Safe Cities Index 2017, above Paris, Milan and Moscow, and last year had a lower murder rate than Berlin. But in an interview with BBC Radio this month, Khan said it could take “a generation” to deal with the increase in violent crime. “To really make significant progress, it can take up to 10 years,” Khan said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German Air Force said on Friday that there was no suspicion of criminal activity after a malfunction forced a plane carrying Chancellor Angela Merkel to the G20 summit in Argentina to make an unscheduled landing. Earlier German daily Rheinische Post cited security sources as saying the government was checking whether the incident on Thursday had a “criminal background”, though the sources added that investigators would typically look “in all directions” after such an incident. But a spokesman for the German Air Force said there was no suspicion of any crime, adding: “It’s a standard check of the radio equipment that failed.”  Merkel was on her way from Germany to the summit when the government’s Airbus A340 made an unscheduled but safe landing at Cologne-Bonn airport late on Thursday. Guido Henrich, commander of the German Air Force’s government fleet, told reporters the pilots experienced the radio failure over the Netherlands and that other systems failed too, so they landed at Cologne-Bonn airport. An electronic failure was the problem. “The part concerned was an electronic distribution box, which we have changed,” Henrich, adding that the Air Force was sending another plane to Argentina on Friday for Merkel’s return journey from the G20. Der Spiegel magazine said the government plane’s entire communication system malfunctioned, constituting a serious emergency, with the crew forced to plan the landing using an on-board satellite phone. The air force spokesman said the plane had not discharged jet fuel before landing in Cologne, contrary to earlier reports. Merkel called the incident a “serious malfunction”.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States should consider banning from their ports Russian ships originating from the Sea of Azov after Russia captured three Ukrainian vessels there, a senior ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel told Reuters on Friday. “One answer might be, for example, to stop Russian ships coming from the region - from the Sea of ​​Azov - from entering European or U.S. ports until this situation with Ukraine is resolved,” said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who is leading the race to succeed Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house price growth picked up slightly this month from October’s five-year low, but the future outlook remains depressed by an uncertain economy and a squeeze on household budgets, major mortgage lender Nationwide said on Friday. Annual house price growth rose to 1.9 percent in November from 1.6 percent in October, a bigger pick-up than the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, while monthly growth was also stronger than expected at 0.3 percent. “In the near term, the squeeze on household budgets and the uncertain economic outlook is likely to continue to dampen demand, even though borrowing costs remain low and the unemployment rate is near 40-year lows,” Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said. Figures on Thursday showed that consumer confidence sank to its lowest level in almost a year, with households concerned about the outlook for the economy as Prime Minister Theresa May faces an uphill battle to get her preferred Brexit deal passed by parliament on Dec. 11. Without a deal, Britain risks a disorderly departure from the EU next March — something which in a worst-case scenario could lead to a 30 percent fall in house prices, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned the public this week. However, BoE data for October had shown an increase in the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, and Nationwide said that if uncertainty lifted, it expected housing market activity to strengthen in 2019.

2019-02-08,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Relatives of some of the people missing on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 urged Malaysia on Friday to resume a search for the plane that disappeared in 2014, as they handed over what they believe are five new pieces of debris from it. Flight MH370 was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board, when it vanished, and became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries. The next of kin of some of those on board handed the government the five pieces of debris they said had been found by villagers in Madagascar, in three difference locations, one bit found as recently as August. “The fact that debris is still washing up now means that the investigation should still be live. It shouldn’t be closed,” said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane. Malaysian and international investigators believe the jet veered thousands of miles off course before plunging into the Indian Ocean. In July, investigators released a 495-page report, saying the plane’s controls were likely deliberately manipulated to take it off course but they were not able to determine who was responsible. More than 30 bits of suspected debris have collected from various places around the world but only three wing fragments, which washed up along the Indian Ocean coast, have been confirmed to be from MH370. Transport Minister Anthony Loke, who met the next of kin, said the government would consider resuming a search if provided with credible leads. “We are open to proposals, but we must have some credible leads before we decide,” Loke said. In May, Malaysia called off a three-month search by U.S. firm Ocean Infinity, which spanned 112,000 sq km (43,243 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean and ended with no significant findings. It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200 million ($144.80 million) search across an area of 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq miles) last year.

2019-02-08,"AMSTERDAM/TOKYO (Reuters) - Renault (RENA.PA) and Nissan (7201.T) vowed to stick by their  industrial alliance on Thursday but failed to name an interim boss to stand in for Chairman Carlos Ghosn, whose arrest has threatened the French carmaker’s control of the partnership. The two companies and Nissan-controlled Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T) “emphatically reiterated” their commitment to the alliance, as executives met in Amsterdam for the first time since Ghosn’s Nov. 19 arrest over misconduct allegations. But attempts by Renault to transfer Ghosn’s chairmanship of the Renault-Nissan board to his French deputy Thierry Bollore appeared to have foundered. There are no plans to name an interim alliance leader, Mitsubishi boss Osamu Masuko said afterwards. Instead, he said, leadership will be shared among the three companies’ CEOs. The crisis unleashed by Ghosn’s arrest has deepened as Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa seeks to end 43.4 percent-owner Renault’s grip on their alliance. Ghosn was swiftly ousted as Nissan chairman but remains at the helm of Renault. Renault had named Bollore as deputy CEO with “the same powers” as Ghosn a day after his arrest - in a bid to maintain the continuity of its leadership of the alliance. Under its 2002 master agreement, seen by Reuters, the alliance is chaired by the sitting chief executive of Renault, a post still held by Ghosn. Nissan’s reciprocal a 15 percent stake in its French parent currently has no voting rights. Changes to the alliance ownership structure were not discussed, Masuko said in Japan after joining the meeting by video link. Saikawa and Bollore also participated remotely. Ghosn, 64, and alleged co-conspirator Greg Kelly, a fellow Nissan director, were arrested in Tokyo over financial misconduct allegations after a Nissan investigation sparked by a whistleblower.  Both deny accusations that they under-reported Ghosn’s compensation, misrepresented Nissan investments and made personal use of company funds.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Investors have rewarded Italy for signs that it might curb its spending ambitions and reach a deal with the European Commission over its budget plans, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday. Italy has been locked in conflict with Brussels over its plans to spend more next year than allowed under European Union rules, raising the prospect of a drawn out battle and sanctions for one of the bloc’s biggest member states. “I expect that, at the end of the day, the Italian government will reach an agreement with the European Commission,” de Guindos told a news conference. “Adherence and full respect of the rules is something that is key.” He added that signs of a compromise in recent days had already pushed down borrowing costs and there was now a clear correlation between the prospect of a deal and Italy’s borrowing costs.  “What we have started to see is that there is a clear parallel evolution between the perception of this potential agreement with the Commission and the evolution of the market,” de Guindos said.  “Over the last 3-4-5 days we have seen that these organisations (could) potentially arrive at an agreement and immediately the spreads started to come down,” he added. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Wednesday that Italy was looking for ways to contain public spending while supporting flagging economic growth in a bid to head off EU disciplinary action. The comments came less than two days after the government signalled it may be willing to lower its deficit spending plans. Italian 10-year yields are about 290 basis points above German yields, down from above 325 basis points earlier this month. De Guindos said any attempt to increase spending is likely to punished by markets and the gain in spending will be offset by higher borrowing costs.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK shares jumped almost 1 percent on Thursday as Wall Street’s rally spread across Europe after the Federal Reserve chairman suggested it may be nearing an end to its tightening cycle, boosting investor appetite for assets considered riskier. The FTSE 100 .FTSE was up 0.8 percent at 0955 GMT and the midcap index .FTMC rose 0.6 percent. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the bank’s policy rate was now “just below” estimates of a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy U.S. economy. Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs, which can reduce economic activity and consumption. Still the blue-chips were on track for their second straight monthly loss amid continued worries about the outcome of Prime Minister Theresa May’s divorce deal with Brussels and Brexit’s impact on the UK economy. Parliament will vote on the agreement on Dec. 11. Investors were also cautious ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. and Chinese presidents at the G20 in Argentina at the weekend amid hopes the world’s two largest economies may resolve a prolonged conflict over trade at a time of slowing global growth. The British government’s assessment of different Brexit options on Wednesday, reinforced by central bank governor Mark Carney’s warning of a heavy hit to the British economy in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU, also kept investors on the sidelines. The market was also digesting a positive report following the central bank’s latest stress test of seven British banks and building societies, which showed they could withstand a disorderly Brexit without having to curb lending.  “All of the banks passed fairly comfortably in the most extreme scenarios, though Lloyds was perceived to be the most vulnerable due to its high UK exposure of credit card loans and mortgages,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The result was largely in line with expectations and banking stocks .FTNMX8350 were up 0.6 percent. Lloyds (LLOY.L) and RBS (RBS.L) were both 0.9 percent higher. Mining stocks .FTNMX1770 were some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Powell-induced bounce on the back of higher base metals prices. The sector was up 2.4 percent and on track for their best day in two weeks.  Copper supply worries also lifted the sector, with miner Antofagasta (ANTO.L), up 4.8 percent, topping the FTSE 100. Investors piled into building materials stocks after the dovish Fed comments, betting that slower-than-expected rate hikes may boost the flagging U.S. housing sector.  The sector .FTNMX2350, which includes CRH (CRH.I) and Melrose Industries (MRON.L) was up 3.1 percent, on track for their best day since April 2017. Ashtead Group (AHT.L), which rents equipment such as diggers and construction tools, got an extra boost, rising 3.7 percent, after news its CEO Geoff Drabble will step down next year. Most of the action was on the mid and small cap indexes, with Intu (INTUP.L)  losing more than a third of its market cap and hitting record low after a consortium led by deputy chairman John Whittaker abandoned its plan to buy the British shopping centre group. The news sent fresh shivers through the already-battered sector, dragging its rival Hammerson (HMSO.L) 4.8 percent lower. Elsewhere, earnings boosted soft drinks maker Britvic (BVIC.L) and pub group Greene King (GNK.L), which were up 6 percent and 5.6 percent respectively.  “If Greene King can continue to manage its margins and maintain decent sales, then investors will certainly be getting the rounds in when the full-year results are announced,” said Julie Palmer from consultancy firm Begbies Traynor.  Senior was lifted by a JPMorgan upgrade.  Investors in funeral services provider Dignity (DTY.L) mourned the news that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) have launched a probe into pricing in the funeral services sector after it found problems of large price hikes that hit “people at their most vulnerable”.  Shares plunged 15 percent to their lowest since June. Peel Hunt cut its rating to sell from hold on the news. “The best case scenario is that the CMA just ends up asking for greater visibility on pricing. However, the tone of the statement suggests greater remedies will be required,” the analysts said in a note.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s hawks have called for more sanctions on Russia after a fresh flare-up of tensions with Ukraine but the divided bloc is not going to act swiftly, if at all, diplomatic sources said. In a sign of their long-standing divisions on how to handle President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, the 28 EU states have taken three days to agree a joint statement after Russia seized Ukrainian navy vessels and sailors on Sunday. In the end the bloc issued a statement by its top diplomat Federica Mogherini on Wednesday night expressing “utmost concern about the dangerous increase of tensions” and dismay at the “unacceptable” use of force by Russia. The three former Soviet republics sitting on the Baltic Sea coast, backed by Poland and Britain, wanted much tougher language on more sanctions looming. Several senior European politicians raised the prospect on Tuesday and U.S. President Donald Trump said he might cancel a meeting with Putin later this week over the maritime clash he described as “aggression”. But the bloc’s top powers Germany and France have so far emphasised efforts to ease tensions. The statement by Mogherini did not mention sanctions but only says regarding the situation that the bloc will “continue to follow closely” and “act appropriately.” Countries including Italy, Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus have long called for a softer stance vis-à-vis Moscow, saying the bloc’s existing economic sanctions over Russia’s role in the turmoil in Ukraine hurt EU businesses too.  “We are not going to move very quickly on any new sanctions, there could be some later on, that is not ruled out. But for now the unity of the 28 is key. And focus on de-escalation,” one EU diplomat said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Putin and Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko on Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in France.  “There is a lot of contacts going on. Let’s see where they take us. I doubt we will rush on sanctions too much,” another EU diplomat also said.  The bloc first imposed sanctions after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Kiev in 2014. Brussels tightened the measures as Moscow went on to back rebels fighting against government troops in east Ukraine. EU leaders are expected to decide to roll the economic sanctions over for another year when they meet in Brussels in December. They could also look at any new punitive measures then after a discussion among their foreign ministers on Dec.10. “In order to discuss sanctions, we’d need to have a clearer picture of what happened,” another EU source said, highlighting unease in some EU quarters that Poroshenko could also stand to gain from the situation.  Putin on Wednesday accused Poroshenko of orchestrating a “provocation” in the sea to boost his flagging popularity ratings before an election next year. Following the incident, Ukraine introduced martial law in parts of the country it says are vulnerable to Russian attack. The European Commission has said it received “important” assurances from Poroshenko that this would not interfere with democratic processes or restrict citizens rights.      The EU statement called on Russia to free the Ukrainian vessels and sailors as well as ensure unrestricted sea access. It would urge both sides to show restraint and express support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, diplomatic sources said. EU diplomats said the latest escalation weakens the hand of Russia doves in the bloc. While the EU was unlikely to introduce new economic sanctions, it could add more names to its existing blacklists, including some Russian military personnel, the sources said. Despite the fact that imposing any sanctions requires the unanimity of all 28 EU states, the bloc has at times had problems enforcing them, as prominently showcased when gas turbines made by Germany’s Siemens were delivered to Crimea. Enforcing and policing EU sanctions is a matter for every state separately but they sometimes fail to act, lacking the political will or bowing to pressure from their businesses. The U.S. State Department called on the EU on Tuesday to do more to help Ukraine in its struggle with Russia, including through tougher enforcement of existing sanctions and dropping support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline with Moscow. Washington, which under Trump has promoted more exports of its own natural gas that competes with Russia, has long lobbied the EU against the construction of another pipeline that would deepen the bloc’s dependence on Russian gas deliveries. The U.S. government has threatened to sanction those involved in the project but Germany - the final destination of the pipeline and the project’s co-author with Russia - said it was sticking to it.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British court has rejected an extradition request from Turkey for exiled businessman Akin Ipek to face terrorism-funding, fraud and other charges, saying he faced a real risk of ill-treatment should he be returned. Ipek, 54, built a multi-billion-dollar fortune in Turkey based on gold mining but left the country in 2015 after relations between the government and followers of U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen soured. Ankara accused Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, of orchestrating a 2016 failed coup attempt and has carried out a widespread crackdown targeting his alleged followers. Gulen has denied any involvement. Ipek and two other men, Ali Celik and Talip Buyuk, who are said by Ankara to be high-ranking members of Gulen’s organisation (FETO), were arrested by Britain earlier this year following extradition requests from Turkey. They were accused of a series of charges including fundraising for terrorism, fraud and conspiracy to launder proceeds of crime. John Zani, District Judge at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court, said while he had “serious reservations about the current state of the rule of law in Turkey”, he accepted the men would receive a fair trial there. But he rejected the extradition requests saying the men risked ill-treatment on their return. “I am persuaded ... that there is substantial evidence that this request is politically motivated,” Zani said in his ruling. “I am entirely satisfied that, by reason of their actual or perceived political views, coupled with the assertion by the Turkish authorities that they are part of the hierarchy of the Gulenist Movement, each defendant before this court runs a real risk of Article 3 (of the Human Rights Act) breaches.” The Turkish government is expected to appeal to London’s High Court against the decision, while the justice minister said the verdict could not be accepted.  “It is an unacceptable ruling that our extradition request for FETO fugitives Akin Ipek, Ali Celik and Talip Buyuk was rejected by Britain,” said Abdulhamit Gul.      “Our struggle will continue until the members of the terrorist organisation are brought to Turkish justice.” In 2015, Turkey seized Ipek’s Koza-Ipek Group and its media outlets, including broadcasters and newspapers, on suspicion of financial irregularities, prompting criticism from rights groups in Turkey and abroad.

2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian investigator said on Wednesday it was too early to say whether issues with an updated Boeing 737 anti-stall system contributed to the crash of a Lion Air flight last month that killed all 189 people on board. Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at Indonesia’s transport safety committee (KNKT), said the agency had not yet determined if the anti-stall system, which was not explained to pilots in manuals, was a contributing factor.  “We still don’t know yet, if it contributed or not,” he said in response to a question at a briefing. “It is too early to conclude for now.” Contact with the jet was lost 13 minutes after it took off from Jakarta, heading north to the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co’s (7201.T) auditor had repeatedly questioned transactions at the heart of allegations of financial misconduct by former chief Carlos Ghosn but Nissan said they were proper, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC questioned Nissan’s management several times, chiefly around 2013, about purchases of overseas luxury homes for Ghosn’s personal use and of stock-appreciation rights that were conferred on him. But the Japanese automaker said the transactions and financial reporting were appropriate, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The revelation shows Nissan and its auditor were discussing the transactions, in apparent contrast with Nissan’s contention that the alleged misreporting of benefits for Ghosn was masterminded by Ghosn and a key lieutenant. A spokesman for EY ShinNihon, the Japanese affiliate of global accounting firm Ernst & Young, said he could not comment on specific cases. A Nissan spokesman declined to comment. Ghosn was arrested on Nov. 19 as he arrived in Japan. Prosecutors accuse him of falsifying Nissan’s annual reports to understate by about half his total compensation of some 10 billion yen ($90 million) over several years.  The high-profile former executive has denied the allegations, according to Japanese media. Ghosn remains in custody and is unable to speak publicly. He is represented by former prosecutor Motonari Otsuru, according to Japanese media. Otsuru’s law firm declined to comment on Wednesday, and Otsuru has not responded to requests for comment. Nissan has largely pinned the blame on Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a former representative director who was arrested along with Ghosn on the same allegations. “As a result of the investigation, we are certain these two are the masterminds,” CEO Hiroto Saikawa told a news conference on Nov. 19, referring to Ghosn and Kelly. He declined to say whether others at Nissan were involved in the alleged wrongdoing. An internal investigation is ongoing, and Nissan says it is cooperating with prosecutors. Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) have removed Ghosn as chairman in the wake of his arrest. The French member of the three-firm alliance, Renault SA (RENA.PA), retains him as chairman and CEO. EY ShinNihon questioned Nissan management about Zi-A Capital BV, asking whether the Dutch unit - which purchased the overseas homes for Ghosn’s use - was conducting business in line with its stated aim as an investment company, said the source, who is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.  The car maker said Zi-A was conducting its business appropriately, the source said. Japanese media have valued the transactions at more than 2 billion yen. Similarly, the source said, the auditor asked whether the stock-appreciation rights – which are like stock options but pay out in cash if a share rises to a certain price – should be declared, but Nissan replied that was not necessary. Japanese media say the rights were worth some 4 billion yen. EY ShinNihon had been auditor for Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and Olympus Corp (7733.T) during financial scandals at the two Japanese companies in recent years. The auditor’s questioning of Nissan on the transactions was first reported by Japanese public broadcaster NHK.

2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian investigators said on Wednesday a Lion Air Boeing 737 jet that plunged into the sea, killing 189 people onboard, was not airworthy on a flight the day before it crashed on Oct. 29.  The Oct. 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta had experienced similar technical issues to the doomed flight the next day from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, said Nurcahyo Utomo, head of Indonesia’s national transport safety committee (KNKT). The pilot of the Oct. 28 flight chose to press on to Jakarta after shutting down the plane’s anti-stall system, Utomo said. “This is the basis of our recommendation to Lion Air.

2019-02-08,"MEMPHIS(Reuters) - Ask Memphis residents and they might say that President Donald Trump got this one right: this is the best job market as far as many in this majority black city can remember. For single mother Latasha Harwell, it has meant finally landing a full time job as a medical assistant, one with the regular 9 to 5 hours she needs so she can care for her kids. Chiquita Clayton says she has an open offer to move from part-time to full-time work at a FedEx(FDX.N)  warehouse; forklift driver Kendrick Jefferson got $3 dollar an hour more for switching employers. Unemployment in Memphis hit a post-crisis low of 3.5 percent in April. It has since crept back above 4 percent, though partly because of more people joining the labor force. But with poverty rates here still among the highest in the country, workers, employment advocates, and government officials also say that is only half the story. For this good spell to truly matter to black Americans, they say, it will need to continue for years to come.  Trump often highlights that overall U.S. unemployment has reached a 50-year low on his watch, and that joblessness among black Americans has set a modern record as well.  The unemployment rate for blacks sunk to 5.9 percent in May, the lowest since 1972 when the figure was first reported separately, but the milestone reflects a trend that took shape years before Trump took office. Black employment has risen about 1.3 million under Trump to hit a record 19.3 million in October, but job gains were the strongest during Barack Obama’s second term when recovery from the Great Recession became more firmly rooted. Recent data indicate job gains for blacks may already be leveling off. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2PxGeh4) In Memphis, state officials, job recruiters and executives credit a confluence of forces, including a continued boom in logistics, warehousing, and related jobs, for creating what one employment agency executive deemed a ‘gold rush’ moment. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2DtWhGq)   Yet what matters for them is not who gets credit for today’s strong labor market, but whether it will be durable enough to help workers weather the next downturn, something past upswings failed to accomplish. National data analyzed by Reuters shows minority hiring has remained clustered in industries such as food service, retail, and logistics that tend to pay less and have been quicker to lay off staff when the economy slows. The fear is that will repeat itself, and that after outsized gains during the upswing, relatively more black workers will lose their jobs when leaner times arrive. That is what happened during the last recession, when white unemployment peaked at just over 9 percent while black unemployment shot above 16 percent. As a result, past recoveries have done little to narrow the gap between black and white incomes, as numerous studies, including recent work by the Atlanta Federal Reserve, have documented. Nationally, median incomes for black families remain a third below white household incomes. In Memphis the gap is even larger, with a $31,000 median annual income for blacks representing just 54 percent of that of white families. “It is a good thing that African American unemployment is at a very low level,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said at a meeting with community groups in Houston this month. “(But) if you look at what happens in a downturn you see the last people hired are the first to get fired,” he said. For that to change, workers such as Harwell need enough time to pay off student loans, get a raise or two, start saving for a home, and gain the additional skills and seniority needed to keep working through the next recession.       “This isn’t a job anymore, it is a career...Personally, I say I need two years,” to feel economically stable, Harwell said.   With the U.S. recovery pushing a decade and some signs of a growth slowdown ahead, local social service agencies and state officials say the time for “recession-proofing” is now. “We know it is not going to last forever,” said Deniece Thomas, an assistant commissioner at the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development. “There is a sense of urgency,” for workers to assess what skills their employers will need even if business slows, she said. To help them, the state has made community college free for high school graduates and adults who have not previously earned a degree, one of the most expansive efforts in the country to encourage non-college educated adults to improve their skills. Other programs provide certifications for specific jobs in industries, such as the booming medical device field, that are struggling with labor shortages.      A look behind the headline numbers shows there is still ground to cover. The black unemployment rate far outstrips the national average, now at 3.7 percent, and since reaching that record low in May has crept up to 6 percent and above even as white unemployment keeps edging lower. Other gauges, such as the employment to population ratio, also lag. Reuters analysis of the federal Quarterly Workforce Indicators shows that out of five U.S. industry groups where the share of jobs held by blacks grew the most between 2010 and 2017, three were among those that paid the least. Three of those five were also among the industries that shed the most jobs during the last recession. The QWI tracks 19 industry groups. Still, the gains are real. Overall black employment has soared by nearly a third since the crisis-era lows of late 2009, compared to a 6 percent increase in the number of jobs held by white workers, according to federal data. Blacks’ share of employment has also been catching up with their share of the U.S. working age population, and the gap is now at a record low. In Memphis, where 63 percent of the population is black and more than a quarter lives in poverty compared with a 14 percent national average, there is some optimism that there may be more than just a cyclical upturn at work. E-COMMERCE WINDFALL The city has long been politically and culturally important as a battleground of the 1960s civil rights movement, the site of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, and a cornerstone of American music where the careers of Elvis Presley, B.B. King and Otis Redding took off. Now, it is also making its name as a major logistics hub, a fulcrum of the internet economy that hosts FedEx’s global headquarters and the country’s busiest cargo airport.The e-commerce boom “is a game changer for us...Memphis is a poor city but logistics is a way for a lot of minorities to pull themselves into jobs,” said Neil Harris, president of the Prestigious Placements recruiting and hiring firm.  The firm has more than 2,000 workers placed around Memphis area warehouses and other facilities. Harris said that firms were so keen to fill vacancies that they were relaxing demands for prior experience, raising pay, offering more training, and becoming more flexible in scheduling. FedEx’s presence has led others to invest in this corner of western Tennessee, including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) , which is expected to hire 1,500 for distribution facilities near Memphis,  along with 5,000 at the facility it announced in Nashville earlier this month. In all, employment in transportation and warehousing in Memphis climbed to more than 53,000 last year from around 50,400 in 2014, with more than half the new jobs going to blacks. As of the end of October FedEx alone had about 400 vacancies posted on the Tennessee Department of Labor’s job site. The question is how long it can all last. Reid Dulberger, president of EDGE, a Memphis economic development group, said he was worried that automation will eventually eliminate many of the “brawn” jobs giants such as FedEx and Amazon now rely on to move tens of millions of packages in their warehouses. For now, though, forklifts still need drivers, and that demand gave Jefferson confidence to give two weeks notice at the warehouse paying him $11 an hour to move to one that pays $14. The years during and after the last recession were hard, the 31-year-old said, with work more difficult to find and mostly coming through temp agencies.  Those were years spent bouncing among “warehousing, fast food, janitorial,” Jefferson said. But now “a lot of opportunities have opened up,” and Jefferson said his aim is to build the experience needed to be brought on as a full-timer.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Iran’s nuclear chief said on Tuesday he was warning the European Union’s top diplomat that Iranian patience was running out on the bloc’s pledges to keep up oil trade despite U.S. sanctions. Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said the Islamic Republic could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity - seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants - if it fails to see the economic benefit of the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear programme. “If we cannot sell our oil and we don’t enjoy financial transactions, then I don’t think keeping the deal will benefit us anymore,” Salehi told Reuters ahead of a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels. “I will pass certainly a word of caution to her (Mogherini): I think the period of patience for our people is getting more limited and limited. We are running out of the assumed timeline, which was in terms of months.” Following the meeting, Mogherini said she and Salehi remained committed to safeguarding the nuclear accord. “They equally expressed their determination to preserve the nuclear agreement as a matter of respecting international agreements and a key pillar for European and regional security,” Mogherini’s office said in a statement. It said Mogherini also repeated the EU stance “on issues of concern such as Iran’s role in the region” - alluding to Iranian involvement in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria. Under the 2015 deal with world powers, Iran restricted its enrichment programme, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May, arguing it was weak because it did not halt Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad, and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil export sector earlier this month. But Europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security. The EU and other remaining parties - China and Russia - have struggled to preserve trade incentives for Iran to respect the deal’s nuclear limits under U.S. pressure. In Brussels for talks on civilian nuclear cooperation that EU officials intended as a signal support for the accord, Salehi said the bloc’s efforts were encouraging but added: “We have not yet seen any tangible results.” He welcomed an EU plan to establish a special financial vehicle for non-dollar trade with Iran but only if it could preserve Iranian oil exports - Tehran’s economic lifeline. “It (the SPV) could be helpful in keeping the deal alive,” he said. “If there is nothing to reap, then what is the purpose of us staying in because voices in Iran are day by day becoming more against the deal.” Iran’s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. However, output is expected to recover somewhat from December thanks to U.S. waivers, including for two EU nations - Greece and Italy. Under the 2015 deal, Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile. Salehi reiterated warnings that Iran has the technical capacity to ramp up enrichment if the deal unravels. “It is very easy for us to go back to what we were before - even to a better position. We can start the 20 percent enrichment activity. We can increase the amount of enriched uranium.” Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to run civilian nuclear power stations, though still well short of highly enriched, or 80 to 90 percent, purity needed for a nuclear bomb.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A plunge in tour operator Thomas Cook weighed on British stocks on Tuesday, as miners tumbled with metals prices dented by fears of a further escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions. The FTSE 100 .FTSE opened higher but gains quickly evaporated, leaving the index down 0.3 percent at the close. The mid-cap FTSE 250 .FTMC index was down 0.3 percent.  U.S. President Donald Trump told the Wall Street Journal he would slap further tariffs on Beijing and threatened to impose tariffs on iPhones imported from China. “The tussle between the two countries extends well beyond trade issues and is likely to endure, in our view,” Blackrock’s global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill wrote in a note. Miners, oil stocks and healthcare were among the biggest drags on the FTSE 100, with the mining index .FTNMX1770 hitting its lowest since Sept. 17. The more domestically focused FTSE 250 .FTMC fell 0.3 percent as several mid-cap stocks suffered severe falls.  Doubts continued to grow that Prime Minister Theresa May can get her Brexit deal through a divided parliament at the vote on Dec. 11, pushing the pound down against the dollar and euro. “The stock-market rebound has ground to a halt, as a fresh bout of doubts over the upcoming G20 meeting between the U.S. and China hit market sentiment once again,” said Joshua Mahony, IG market analyst. Thomas Cook Group (TCG.L) plunged as much as 31 percent after it suspended its 2018 dividend and cut its profit forecast for the second time in two months, saying an exceptionally hot summer had deterred Britons from holidaying abroad. “Thomas Cook’s third profit warning for 2018 cuts underlying EBIT by another c.10 percent versus consensus,” wrote Jefferies analysts.  They added that the dividend suspension may concern investors given dividends were only 9 million pounds in 2017.  The stock closed down 22.6 percent at 33.92 p, its weakest in nearly six years and also dragged rival TUI (TUIT.L) down 2.5 percent. In other big results-driven moves, Greggs (GRG.L) shares surged as much as 16 percent to a fresh record high after the bakery and food-to-go chain reported strong sales in October and November and said it expected higher 2018 profits. Shop sales growth was ahead of expectations, Shore Capital analyst Darren Shirley, wrote, and accompanied by good cost control. The shares closed up 11 percent. “We fully expect to upgrade our full-year 2018 forecasts ... with the pace and magnitude of our upgrades reflective of the high levels of operational gearing across the Greggs business,” Shirley wrote. Back on the FTSE 100, Coca-Cola bottling company CCH (CCH.L) climbed 4.6 percent, the top performer, after UBS upgraded the stock to “buy” from “sell”, saying its recent share price losses made it attractively valued. NMC Health (NMC.L) fell 1.1 percent to the bottom of the index after Jefferies analysts cut it to “underperform” from “hold”, saying they do not share the market’s optimism on Saudi Arabia, a key market for the firm. UDG Healthcare (UDG.L) shares fell 3.9 percent after the mid-cap healthcare facilities company said 2019 growth would be impacted by planned investments. Overall analysts are increasingly pessimistic about British firms’ results, and have been cutting their earnings forecasts for the FTSE 100 at the fastest pace in three years.

2019-02-08,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Britain can unilaterally reverse its decision to leave the European Union, an urgent hearing of Europe’s top court was told on Tuesday in a case supporters of EU membership hope could pave the way to a second referendum and ultimately stop Brexit. Lawyers for a group of Scottish politicians want the  European Court of Justice (ECJ) to interpret whether Britain can revoke its notice to withdraw from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty without agreement of the other 27 states. Britain is due to exit the EU on March 29, two years after London served notice in line with a June, 2016 vote to leave.  But the fate of Brexit remains up in the air, with Prime Minister Theresa May’s draft divorce deal, agreed with the EU on Sunday, facing a difficult vote in parliament on Dec. 11. May has said that if her deal is voted down, Britain could leave without a deal or there could be no Brexit at all.  Some opponents of Brexit want a second referendum giving British voters the option to remain in the EU. May’s government says a second referendum will not happen, and any ruling that would allow the reversal of Britain’s withdrawal notice would be irrelevant since it is against government policy. Aidan O’Neill, lawyer for the Scottish politicians, told the ECJ a ruling was necessary so that lawmakers could make informed decisions. “These petitioners need to know the options for revocation which are open to withdrawing member states now, to allow them - properly and in a fully informed way - to carry out their duties as democratically elected representatives,”  If Britain could not unilaterally reverse Brexit, then it could be forced out against its wishes, he said.  “It is fundamental to the treaties - and to the values of the European Union - that a member state can choose to revoke its withdrawal from the Union, without the need for the unanimous agreement of all the other member states,” he said.  The case was referred to the Luxembourg justices for a ruling by Scotland’s top court. It was “expedited” for Tuesday’s one-day hearing before a full court of judges. Article 50 of the EU treaty, which sets the rules for leaving the bloc, states that if a country decides to withdraw, it has two years to agree an exit deal, a deadline which can be extended only if the remaining EU states unanimously agree. There is no mention of whether a state can change its mind. No other member state has ever left the 60-year-old bloc. Richard Keen the lawyer for the British government, said the ECJ should refuse to consider the issue at all, saying it was hypothetical as the UK had no intention of reversing Brexit. “As you know, the UK does not intend to revoke its notification,” said Keen. He said the anti-Brexit campaigners behind the case wanted a ruling from the court for “political ammunition” to put pressure on the British parliament, likening it to opening Pandora’s Box. “We respectfully plead that the court should not open this box,” Keen said. Lawyers for the EU told the judges revocation would require the unanimous agreement of the other 27 EU states. Otherwise, said Hubert Legal, representing the EU’s executive Commission, it could allow states to notify their intent to leave and then seek better terms from the remaining EU countries, to “charm the notifying sheep back to the flock”.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Divisions within Europe and tension between the United States and China pose major challenges to the next round of United Nations talks on climate change. The most important U.N. climate conference since the Paris Agreement of 2015 opens on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, in one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in Europe. Success, according to the conference’s Polish host, will need a miracle. Delegates from about 195 nations are on a deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the pact, which the United States, at the behest of President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit. The 2015 deal aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The pact was 20 years in the making and commits almost every country to fight global warming. But rules are needed to bring about real cuts in emissions and ensure they are closely monitored. U.N. scientists in October added to pressure for a strong outcome from the talks, saying the world will hit the 1.5C threshold around 2040 and unprecedented changes are needed in  the way people use energy.    Despite this call for unified action, there are divisions within the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China, all of which have implications for climate policy.    The president of the talks, Poland’s former deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka, has expressed hopes of a compromise while at same time acknowledging the scope of the task ahead.  “Only by a miracle can we realise success,” he said last month, although miracles were “a Polish speciality”. Then earlier this month he added: “Undoubtedly, the geopolitical situation in 2015 was much easier for discussing global agreements than the one we have in 2018. However, my talks with representatives from the whole world show that there is a willingness to reach a compromise in Katowice.”    POLITICAL, ECONOMIC RIFTS    Developing nations and those vulnerable to climate change, such as islands and low-lying states, are looking to big industrialised countries to deepen cuts in emissions. Senior Chinese climate change official Li Gao told reporters last month that some industrialised countries more responsible for climate change were backsliding on the “polluter pays” principle, which “will make it hard to reach a consensus”.  In the European Union, European Commission climate chief Miguel Arias Canete’s call for more ambitious goals was rebuffed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said it would be counter-productive because some European countries, including Germany, were struggling to meet their targets.    The United States has a seat at the negotiating table until it can formally quit in November 2020 at the earliest.     It may use its remaining time to try to develop ammunition for its trade dispute with China. Former climate and energy adviser to President Trump, George David Banks, told Reuters the administration wants to make sure it “corrects as many of the flaws of the agreement that it can”.    The United States has always been interested in getting a robust framework for reporting and measuring emissions cuts, particularly for developing countries such as China.     “It helps inform your trade policymaking and negotiations vis-a-vis the Chinese and others,” Banks said. The United States also plans to promote fossil and nuclear fuels at the talks, repeating a strategy that infuriated global-warming activists last year.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Representatives from around 195 countries meet in Poland from Dec. 2-14 to agree on the rules of a landmark climate pact. Decades of climate talks have spawned a host of acronyms and jargon. Here is a guide: PARIS AGREEMENT - Successor to the international climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2020. It was agreed in December 2015 in the French capital and aims to limit temperature rises to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius this century and “pursue efforts” for a 1.5C limit.  COP24 - The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its 24th annual meeting will be held in Katovice, Poland. This year’s is the most important since 2015 as the end of the year is the deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the Paris Agreement. NDCs - Nationally Determined Contributions, or plans from each country to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change from 2020.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe may need to impose tougher sanctions against Moscow following Russia’s seizure of Ukrainian vessels, an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday. Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko has warned of the “extremely serious” threat of a land invasion after Russia seized three Ukrainian naval ships and took their crew prisoner at the weekend. Norbert Roettgen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union who chairs the German parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said Russia’s behaviour was deeply worrying and that tougher sanctions were an option. “So far there are no talks about tougher sanctions but I generally would not rule this out,” Roettgen told Deutschlandfunk radio.  “In my view, such behaviour cannot remain without consequences and I don’t think one should say that there won’t be any further sanctions.” Merkel has stressed the need for dialogue while the European Union, Britain, France, Poland, Denmark, and Canada all condemned what they called Russian aggression.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned Russia on Monday that its seizure of three Ukrainian vessels was an “outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory” and urged Moscow to reduce tensions caused by its “arrogant” act. Haley said she had spoken with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier on Monday and that her statement “reflects the concerns at the highest level.” “As President Trump has said many times, the United States would welcome a normal relationship with Russia. But outlaw actions like this one continue to make that impossible,” said Haley, a member of Trump’s cabinet. Russia seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tug boat, which Moscow said had illegally entered Russia’s territorial waters. Kiev said its vessels did nothing wrong and has accused Russia of military aggression. “The United States will maintain its Crimea-related sanctions against Russia. Further Russian escalation of this kind will only make matters worse. It will further undermine Russia’s standing in the world. It will further sour Russia’s relations with the U.S. and many other countries,” Haley said. Ukrainian U.N. Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko called on the international community “to implement a new set of sanctions aimed at addressing the situation in the region, including against Russia’s Azov ports.” He told the council that increased political pressure on Moscow would help de-escalate the situation, but also warned that Ukraine was “ready to use all available means in exercising our right to self-defence.”  Russian Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy accused Ukraine of planning the incident and suggested it was because President Petro Poroshenko’s popularity among voters was low ahead of an election next year. “How can he maintain power in these circumstances? It’s clear - organise provocation and once again accuse Russia of everything, inflate his own ratings and put himself forward as the saviour of the nation,” Polyanskiy told the council. “This is about cancelling the elections despite all of Poroshenko’s assurances to the contrary,” he said, warning that Russia “has never caused the first blow, but it knows how to protect itself.” Yelchenko rejected Polyanskiy’s remarks about motives. He told the council the incident was a “clear threat to international peace and security” and that Russia was mixing reality with fiction in trying to explain what happened. U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council the United Nations could not independently verify what had happened. “We strongly urge both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to refrain from any ratcheting up of actions or rhetoric and remind both of the need to contain this incident so as to prevent a serious escalation,” she said. The 15-member Security Council has met dozens of times over the crisis in Ukraine since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. It is unable to take any action as Russia is one of the council’s five veto powers. The Ukrainian vessels seized by Russia on Sunday had been trying to enter the Sea of Azov from the Black Sea via the narrow Kerch Strait that separates Crimea from the Russian mainland.

2019-02-08,"ABU DHABI/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates on Monday pardoned and released a British academic jailed for life on spying charges, granting a request for clemency after showing a video of him purportedly confessing to membership of the UK’s MI6 intelligence service. The case has strained ties between the long-time allies, leading London to issue a forceful diplomatic response after last week’s verdict was handed down, with a warning that it could hurt relations. The UAE president issued the pardon as part of a mass clemency of more than 700 prisoners to mark the country’s National Day, according to a statement on state news agency WAM.  The pardon was effective immediately and Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University held for more than six months, will be allowed to leave the country “once formalities are completed,” the statement said. A UAE official later said Hedges lad been freed. Britain’s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomed the move, which he called “fantastic news”. “Although we didn’t agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily.” Hunt said it was also a “bittersweet moment” because he was thinking about innocent people still detained in Iran, the arch-foe of Abu Dhabi. “Justice won’t be truly done until they too are safely home,” he said. Hedge’s wife Daniela Tejada said his family was “elated” over the news. The UAE had signalled on Friday that it was working on an “amicable solution” to the case after Prime Minister Theresa May had described last week’s sentence as deeply disappointing. Hedges has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit. Tejada has said he was kept in solitary confinement for more than five months and the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research. Last week’s hearing lasted less than five minutes, she said. The UAE’s ambassador to the UK has disputed the account, saying the case was “extremely serious” and there had not been a “five minute show trial.” Minutes before the pardon was announced, a UAE government spokesman showed journalists a video of Hedges purporting to confess to belonging to Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and researching which military systems the UAE was buying. In the video, which was sometimes inaudible and shown with subtitles that could not be independently verified, Hedges appeared to say he approached sources as a doctoral student. The spokesman, Jaber al-Lamki, said Hedges was “100 percent a secret service operative” and aimed “to steal the UAE’s sensitive national secrets for his paymasters”, but did not take questions on the case. He said Hedges aimed to gather information on government figures including “members of the UAE’s ruling families and their networks” and economic data related to strategic firms. Hedges had built an extensive network of contacts while working with Dubai’s Institute for Near East & Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA), then returned to the UAE “on assignment as an undercover student on research trip”, Lamki said. Hedges’ family and colleagues have cast him as a talented researcher who fell foul of the UAE security and justice system. His dissertation research focussed on security structures, tribalism and the consolidation of political power in Abu Dhabi, which are considered sensitive topics in the UAE, they said. Like most Gulf states, the UAE brooks little public criticism of ruling family members, senior officials or policy and has prosecuted pro-democracy activists for what it calls insulting the country’s leaders. After the pardon, his family thanked British authorities and others who had offered their support in urging UAE authorities to release Hedges. “The presidential pardon for Matt is the best news we could have received. Our six-plus months of nightmare are finally over,” said Tejada, his wife.

2019-02-08,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union judges dismissed a case brought by a World War Two veteran and other Britons living on the continent against the Brexit negotiation, ruling on Monday that their rights as EU citizens had not yet been infringed. Harry Shindler, a 97-year-old living in Italy, was among 13 expatriates who complained to the EU’s General Court that Brexit would deprive them of EU citizenship, and that the decision last year by the bloc’s Council of member states to accept notification of Britain’s withdrawal next March breached their rights because they had been denied a vote in the 2016 referendum. On Monday, the Court dismissed the action as inadmissible because the Council’s move to start talks with London did not in itself carry any definite consequences for their rights.  “The decision of the Council authorising the opening of negotiations on Brexit does not produce binding legal effects capable of affecting the interests of the applicants by bringing about a distinct change in their legal position,” it said. Julien Fouchet, a French lawyer acting for the plaintiffs, said they would appeal to the Court of Justice, the EU’s top court. “Unacceptable,” he tweeted. “The fight goes on.” Shindler had taken a demand that all expatriates be given a vote in the referendum to London’s High Court. Judges there ruled two months before the vote that this would be too difficult for the authorities. Campaigners say millions of British citizens fall foul of a law depriving them of a vote after 15 years abroad. Under Article 50 of the EU treaty, Prime Minister Theresa May notified the European Council on March 29, 2017, that Britain would leave the bloc, setting in motion a two-year countdown that will see Britain leave in four months’ time.  On Sunday, May and the other 27 EU leaders formally agreed a treaty setting terms for departure and outlining a close future trading relationship, but the British parliament may yet reject that deal. Britain could then leave without clear legal terms. On Tuesday, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg will hear a case brought by Scottish politicians who oppose Brexit and want judges to rule on whether the Article 50 notification process can be simply revoked by the British government, whether or not other EU states agree. They hope that can strengthen a campaign to have Brexit halted altogether, although May insists it will go ahead.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The deadliest wildfire in California history that destroyed the mountain town of Paradise and killed at least 85 people was 100 percent contained on Sunday, according to state fire officials. The number of people still missing from the Camp Fire north of San Francisco dropped to 249 on Sunday, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office said. The number was revised down from 475 as people who were believed missing were found in shelters, staying in hotels or with friends, officials said, adding that many did not know they were on the list.   The Camp Fire that started on Nov. 8 destroyed nearly 14,000 homes and burned nearly 154,000 acres (62,000 hectares) - an area five times the size of San Francisco.  Searchers will have a few more days of dry weather, but starting late Tuesday, another 2-5 inches (5 to 13 cm) of rain is expected to drop on the Sierra Nevada foothills through next Sunday, hampering the searchers work and renewing fears of flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said. “The fear is that the rain will drop in intense bursts,” Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the federal Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said early Sunday. “All the vegetation has burned away, and that’s a dangerous recipe for mudslides,” Hurley said. Last week, 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) of rain fell there and turned ash from the thousands of destroyed homes into slurry, complicating the work of finding bodies reduced to bone fragments. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea has warned that remains of some victims may never be found.     The town of Paradise was a popular destination for retirees, with people aged 65 or older accounting for a quarter of its 27,000 residents. Most of the victims of the fire identified so far were of retirement age. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the fire.  Thousands of people forced to flee Paradise spent Thanksgiving in warehouses in the nearby city of Chico, or with friends or relatives in nearby towns.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The 27 EU national leaders gathered on Sunday to endorse both a detailed treaty setting out the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union and a declaration outlining how Britain can keep close to its biggest market by following many EU rules after a two to four year transition. The following are their comments. “There was no applause, no flowers and everyone said it was an unhappy day.” “There is no plan B. This is the deal on the table and I’m not willing to contemplate defeat in the British parliament because I have every confidence in Theresa May and the wisdom of the British people.”  “I can only tell you in all honesty what the situation is and the situation is that there is no plan B. This is the deal on the table. If anyone thinks in the United Kingdom that by voting ‘no’ something better would come out of it, they are wrong. This is the best we can get for both the European Union and the United Kingdom.” “You can certainly say it was a historic summit and a historic day, which produces mixed emotions. It is tragic that Great Britain leaves the EU after 45 years but we have to respect the vote of the British people and, based on this, it is good that we agreed on a withdrawal agreement and a political declaration about future ties with Great Britain.” What if deal rejected by UK parliament? “This is a speculative question that I cannot answer. We have committed to something in a very difficult situation and I think that Theresa May, as British prime minister, will do everything she can to play her part and so we are concentrating on completing the course we have set ourselves on.” “The negotiations to date have been difficult and for the current and future ones we should base ourselves on the motto ‘where there is a will, is there a way’. In this tragic and sad situation, what is good is that we have gone down a difficult path with this withdrawal agreement and that should give us  assurance and strength so that we can sort out the future relations too.” “The European Parliament will stress its role (referring to any extension of the transition period)... Changes cannot be made without the due involvement of the European Parliament.” Said the parliament vote on the withdrawal treaty will be in either February or March. “Today is not a good day” Asked what would happen if UK parliament rejects deal: “It’s impossible to re-open the text.” “We must draw all the consequences that show that the European Union has a fragile side, it can be improved …. It shows that our Europe needs to be rebuilt and that is the option I support and will continue to work towards.” “On the issue of fishing, of reciprocal access, our fishermen will be well protected, that is a priority in our future relationship, reinstated in the text and very present in today’s conclusions.” “It’s not a day when we should celebrate, nor a day of mourning. It is the choice of a sovereign people. EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER “It is a sad day. Seeing a country like Great Britain, but I would say this of any others, leaving the European Union is not a moment of jubilation or celebration. It is a sad moment, a tragedy.” “I believe that the British government will succeed in securing the backing of the British parliament.” “I would vote in favour of this deal because this is the best deal possible for Britain.... This is the deal. It is the best deal possible and the European Union will not change its fundamental position when it comes to this issue.” “All along this extraordinary negotiation, very difficult we have worked to reach a deal. That means to organise in an orderly fashion the withdrawal decided by the UK.  We have negotiated with the UK, never against the UK. Now it is time for everybody to take their responsibility, everybody. This deal is a necessary step to build trust between the UK and the EU, we need build in the next phase of this unprecedented and ambitious partnership. We will remain allies, partners and friends.” “I think the loss of the United Kingdom is really bad news, I have always thought that. I think we now have an agreement that limits the damage for the UK and for the EU...  What we have found is an acceptable package, but it remains bad news but a balanced package for both sides.” “This is a balanced outcome with no political winners or victories, but I think it is acceptable. “I don’t expect a no vote. I expect a yes vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more.” “I don’t want to contemplate a no vote. I think there will be a yes vote, but more in general, I think this is the maximum we can all do, both Theresa May and her government as well as the European Union. No victors here today, nobody winning, we’re all losing, but given the context, that is acceptable.” Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Alastair Macdonald, Jan Strupczewski, Robin Emmot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-highlights/highlights-eu-leaders-comments-at-special-brexit-summit-idUKKCN1NU07S,2019-02-08,The 27 EU national leaders gathered on Sunday to endorse both a detailed treaty setting out the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union and a declaration outlining how Britain can keep close to its biggest market by following many EU rules after a two to four year transition.,Highlights - EU leaders' comments at special Brexit summit
2019-02-08,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L), has not yet seen a slowdown in its key markets and aims to more than double the number of cars it makes by 2025, its chief executive said on Sunday. The British automaker, whose sports cars feature in James Bond films, is on target to produce 6,400 vehicles this year despite the pressures of slowing Chinese demand and worries over the impact of Brexit. The company is looking to manufacture 14,000 cars by 2025 with the size of the company growing four-fold from what it was in 2014, said CEO Andy Palmer. It will also become a very profitable company, he said. In 2017, Aston Martin made a pre-tax profit of 87 million pounds ($111 million), its first annual pre-tax profit since 2010. “The rich are getting richer, they want more personalization,” Palmer told Reuters in Abu Dhabi on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix where Aston Martin is the title sponsor of the Red Bull Formula One team.  “On the other hand, the car industry is getting more and more commoditized because of technology,” he added. Palmer dismissed the notion that there was a slowdown in key markets. In the year-to-date the company saw turnover grow 185 percent in the U.S; 133 percent growth in Asia-Pacific and 118 percent growth in China, he said. “The retail part is not in dispute. China was slow, but not for us,” he said. The company is confident it will achieve higher profits in 2018 over last year minus the one-off costs such as those related to its initial public offering in October.  “If you focus on EBITDA, then yes we obviously will see growth. Excluding one-off costs, last 12 months, it all looks very healthy,” he said, without citing figures.  Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to 207 million pounds in 2017.  The company is on track to launch its new sport utility vehicle (SUV) in late 2019. It is betting on existing Aston Martin customers who also have an SUV in their garage, Palmer said, adding that demand for SUV’s in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region was similar in size to China.

The visit, which was not publicly disclosed, is one of the clearest signs of strain between crisis-stricken Venezuela and its key financier Russia. Over the last few years, Moscow has become Venezuela’s lender of last resort, with the Russian government and Rosneft handing Venezuela at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, according to Reuters calculations. State oil company PDVSA is repaying almost all of those debts with oil, but a meltdown in its oil industry has left it struggling to fulfill obligations. Sechin and a large delegation of executives met with officials at PDVSA in a Caracas hotel this week. Sechin also met with Venezuela’s leftist leader Maduro, and chided him overoil-for-loans shipments that are behind schedule. “He brought information showing that they were meeting obligations with China but not with them,” said one source with knowledge of the talks. “They’re running around in PDVSA because of this,” added the source, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to media. The country’s oil production has fallen to just 1.17 million barrels-per-day, a 37 percent drop in the last year, according to reports from secondary sources to OPEC, leaving itstruggling to ship Russian entities the roughly 380,000 bpd it has agreed to send, according to PDVSA documents seen by Reuters.  The closing of a dock at Venezuela’s main oil export port, through which the vast majority of shipments to Rosneft transit, has delayed millions of barrels in crude since August. Sechin handed Maduro graphics about oil shipments to Russian entities compared with China, the two sources said. Top financier China, which has ploughed more than $50 billion into Venezuela, also gets reimbursed in oil. According to Reuters calculations based on PDVSA data, the Caracas-based company delivered around 463,500 bpd to Chinese firms between January and August, a roughly 60 percent compliance rate. That compares with around 176,680 bpd to Russian entities, or a 40 percent compliance rate. Rosneft and PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the sources with knowledge of Sechin’s visit, as well as two separate sources, said a Chinese delegation was also in Caracas this week. As of early 2017, PDVSA began to fall months behind on shipments of crude and fuel under the loan deals with China and Russia due to problems in its oil industry, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The problems include operational mishaps, such as refining outages and delayed cleaning of tanker hulls, and financial disputes with service providers owed money by PDVSA. This April, Rosneft and PDVSA signed a refinancing agreement designed to allow the Venezuelan company to catch up on delayed loan payments by delivering more crude to Rosneft. Under the refinancing, PDVSA has to provide Rosneft with some 380,000 bpd, up from around 310,000 bpd, according to Reuters calculations. The Russian company was planning on using Jose’s South dock to pick up the cargoes, before an August tanker collision delayed exports to Rosneft. PDVSA reopened the dock earlier this month, sources said. China agreed to use ship-to-ship (STS) operations to avoid Venezuela’s clogged ports. However, the clients to whom Rosneft sends Venezuelan crude, Russian-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy and Indian conglomerate Reliance, did not agree to STS transfers, likely heightening delays.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The leader of the small Northern Irish party propping up Prime Minister Theresa May’s British government said it will vote against her Brexit divorce deal unless the so-called Irish backstop is removed. “Yes, we will vote against this withdrawal agreement if it is brought to parliament,” Arlene Foster told national Irish broadcaster RTE when asked if her party would oppose May unless she scrapped the insurance policy in the agreement that aims to keep the border on the island of Ireland open in all scenarios.

2019-02-08,"BELFAST (Reuters) - Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson on Saturday called for the government to appoint a minister to prepare for a “no-deal” British exit from the European Union in order to increase London’s leverage in talks with Brussels.  He also called for Prime Minister Theresa May to withhold much of Britain’s exit payment, to renegotiate its withdrawal deal and to dump the Northern Ireland backstop, while avoiding triggering a no-deal Brexit.   The withdrawal treaty’s ‘backstop’ provision could ultimately align Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the United Kingdom if no other way can be found to avoid a hard border with EU member the Republic of Ireland. The proposals received a rapturous reception from the audience at the annual conference of Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, but Johnson did not explain how he would secure EU acquiescence to the plan.  EU leaders have repeatedly said they are not willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, and observers have suggested Britain would have to make major concessions elsewhere for it to be changed.  May is due formally to agree the withdrawal deal with the EU’s remaining 27 members on Sunday. “Unless we junk this backstop, we will find that Brussels has got us exactly where they want us – a satellite state,” Johnson told the crowd. Britain, he said, risked “economic and political humiliation.” “We need a secretary of state for no-deal or WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms, with real powers across Whitehall (Britain’s civil service) to make things happen,” Johnson told the conference, winning a standing ovation.  “I do not believe that we will exit without a deal – that is totally unnecessary – but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations.” Johnson, one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s fiercest critics since he quit her cabinet in July, has not formally called for her ouster. But he is one of the leaders of a large group of Conservative members of parliament opposing May’s strategy and is regularly touted as a possible contender to replace her as Conservative Party leader should she fall over Brexit. May does not currently have enough support in the British parliament to ratify the deal. She has warned lawmakers they have a simple choice: back her deal or risk ushering in a no deal departure, a delay to Brexit or possibly no Brexit at all. Speaking to the BBC, Johnson said he did not believe a no-deal Brexit was likely, but added: “I don’t think it will be nearly as bad as some people suggest.” Johnson, who is known for his colourful language and at-time outlandish proposals, repeated a call for the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, a project that several experts have dismissed as impractical.  “We need urgently to recover our confidence and our self belief, and to stop treating Brexit as if it were a plague of frogs or a murrain on our cattle or some adverse weather event that had to be managed,” he said.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A former Nissan Motor (7201.T) executive arrested along with ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn has defended Ghosn’s compensation, saying it was discussed with other officials and paid out appropriately, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Saturday. In his first reported comments since his arrest on Monday, Greg Kelly was also quoted by NHK as saying that he had worked for the good of Nissan rather than just following Ghosn’s instructions.  Japanese prosecutors say Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn’s remuneration by about half the 10 billion yen (69.07 million pounds) he earned at Nissan over five years from 2010. The company has also cited other, multiple infractions.   “The former chairman’s compensation was discussed with those in the related department and carried out appropriately. I was not just following the former chairman’s orders, but working for the good of the company,” Kelly said, according to the report.     Nissan’s board voted unanimously on Thursday to remove Ghosn and Kelly from their positions. Both were arrested after a Nissan investigation uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing including under-reporting remuneration and personal use of company assets.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Logitech International SA (LOGN.S), a Swiss manufacturer of keyboards and webcams, is in discussions to acquire Plantronics Inc (PLT.N), a U.S. maker of Bluetooth earpieces and gaming headsets, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.  The deal would be by far Logitech’s largest acquisition and would illustrate the company’s push to diversify its business. It would come as Logitech and Plantronics seek to keep down manufacturing costs following the introduction of tariffs on imports from China into the United States.  Logitech has offered more than $2.2 billion (£1.7 billion) to acquire Plantronics, one of the sources said. As of the end of trading on Friday, Plantronics had a market capitalisation of about $2 billion. If the negotiations prove successful, a deal between Logitech and Plantronics could come as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that it was also possible that no agreement would be reached. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Plantronics declined to comment, while Logitech did not respond to a request for comment. Plantronics shares jumped 5.6 percent to $56.50 on the news in after hours trading in New York on Friday. Logitech’s and Plantronics’ businesses have been under pressure as a result of new offerings being developed, not just from network gear makers such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), but also from major technology companies such as Microsoft Inc (MSFT.O) and Google owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). Founded in 1981, Logitech has been countering declining sales of personal computers by focussing on consumer accessories that are benefiting from the growth of cloud computing, such as gaming, music, smart home connectivity and video conferencing. The Lausanne-based company has a market capitalisation of $5.6 billion. Last year, Logitech acquired ASTRO Gaming for $85 million in cash to expand in the video game sector. Santa Cruz, California-based Plantronics makes unified communications systems, wireless headsets, conferencing systems, and some software, which it sells to businesses and consumers.  Founded in 1961, Plantronics’ first products were lightweight headsets for airline pilots. It later became known for selling headsets to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including the ones worn by Neil Armstrong during his first moonwalk in 1969. A sale of Plantronics would come on the heels of the company’s $2 billion acquisition in July of U.S. video-conferencing equipment maker Polycom Inc.  Private equity firm Siris Capital Group LLC owns 16 percent of Plantronics, making it its largest shareholder. Reuters had reported earlier this month that Plantronics was exploring a sale.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN/BEIJING/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - When G20 world leaders met for the first time in 2008 their mission was a desperate one - to rescue the global economy from the worst financial crisis in more than 70 years. They were successful. Ten years on, that picture of unity in the face of economic calamity is in the rear-view mirror. Leaders of the G20 industrialized nations meeting in Argentina next week are expected to struggle to agree on a joint statement on two of the biggest, and thorniest, global issues on their agenda - trade and climate change. Officials in European and Asian capitals helping to prepare for the meeting said they were cautiously optimistic that a communique would be issued when the two-day meeting ends on Dec. 1.  But many said it would likely be watered down to try to ensure approval from U.S. President Donald Trump, an avowed skeptic of man-made climate change who has adopted protectionist trade policies and a more isolationist foreign policy. Recent history suggests those who draft the communique face a tough challenge when they begin their work in earnest in Buenos Aires on Monday. Last weekend, officials from countries attending a major Asia-Pacific summit failed to agree on a joint communique for the first time as the United States clashed with China over trade and security. In May Trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the G7 industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony, again over tariffs and trade.   “It’s a club that is even more difficult to manage than the G7,” said a French diplomatic source. “Let’s face it. The issues are difficult, the talks have been difficult since last year. It will be the case again this year, maybe even tougher.” It will be the first time the leaders have met since Trump imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports to force concessions from Beijing on greater access to Chinese markets, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft.  China responded with import tariffs on U.S. goods. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned this week that an escalation in the trade war - the U.S. tariff rate on $200 billion in Chinese goods is set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1 - would impede global economic growth.  Officials from some G20 countries, anxious to see a swift end to the U.S.-China trade war, are hopeful but not confident that a meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of G20 may yield at least a partial ceasefire. But in the United States and China there is pessimism. Within the White House there is uncertainty over how hard Trump is prepared to push Xi during their talks on trade and other disputes as the president sorts through sometimes conflicting advice from his own top aides, a senior Trump official said. “Expectations (on the meeting) are low. But keeping the personal relationship going is an extremely high priority,” the U.S. official said, referring to Trump and Xi, who have sought to forge a close working relationship despite the tensions between their countries, the world’s two biggest economies. China’s main goal at the G20 is to get the United States to refrain from raising the tariffs in January, said Chinese economists and academics. But Xi would not be bullied into making a bad deal. “Even if they are able to reach a small agreement, the leaders of China and the United States cannot reach a fundamental agreement, so there would not be a ceasefire in the trade war,” said Shi Yinhong, the head of the Center for American Studies at Beijing’s elite Renmin University who has advised the Chinese government on diplomacy. Trump said on Thursday he was well prepared for his meeting with Xi. “It’s not like, ‘Oh gee, I’m going to sit down and study.’ I know every ingredient. I know every stat. I know it better than anybody knows it. And my gut has always been right. And we’re doing very well. And I will tell you China very much wants to make a deal.” Trump will also meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders have not met face to face since a bilateral summit in July in Helsinki that prompted Trump critics to accuse him of cozying up to the Kremlin.  G20 leaders are also expected to discuss reform of the World Trade Organization, but officials said it was unlikely any agreement would be reached.  The United States is increasingly skeptical of the WTO’s ability to resolve international trade disputes. The European Union is also pushing to reform the body to make it better able to address modern trade problems. European countries are anxious that the final communique refer to the fight against climate change, a senior European Union official said. Trump has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, casting doubt on the science underpinning the agreement. Despite disagreements on key issues and the United States’ growing skepticism about the usefulness of multilateral bodies,  G20 members insist the forum remains an important opportunity for world leaders to meet and exchange views on pressing issues. “Its existence itself helps us gather quickly and discuss key issues on a global level when needed,” said a senior G20 official in Asia. A senior German official involved in G20 preparations said Germany remained committed to G20 as a place for multilateral and bilateral discussions despite the current tensions. “Sometimes you have to be patient. There is no alternative anyway than to try to work together,” the official said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates signalled on Friday a British academic it jailed for life on spying charges could be freed after his family appealed for clemency in a case that has strained ties between the longstanding allies. Matthew Hedges, 31, was sentenced on Wednesday on charges of spying for the British government, in a move described as deeply disappointing by Prime Minister Theresa May. “Mr Hedges’ family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request,” the UAE’s ambassador to London, Sulaiman Hamid Almazroui, said. “We have an extremely close partnership with the UK,” he told reporters. “Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.”  The doctoral student at Durham University has been held since May 5, when he was arrested at Dubai International Airport after a two-week research visit. “We have asked for clemency - we will wait to see what happens,” Hedges’ wife Daniela Tejada told Reuters after the ambassador spoke. She denies he is a spy.  His family have cast him as a talented researcher who fell foul of the UAE’s security and justice system. The UAE cast him as a British spy who was given a fair trial for grave espionage offences. “We hope the UAE now looks favourably on the family’s request for clemency,” a spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office said.  The Gulf state does not dictate verdicts to its courts and there was full and proper legal process in Hedges’ case, the ambassador said. There had not been a “five minute show trial” as he said some media had reported. “This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood and national security must be a top priority,” said Almazroui, adding that everyone had the right to request a pardon. “This was an unusual case: many researchers visit the UAE freely every year without breaking our laws,” he said. Hedges’ family said the evidence presented against him consisted of notes from his dissertation research. “Matt was held in an undisclosed location in solitary confinement for over 5 months, with no charge, no lawyer and very limited consular access,” his wife said.  “The judicial system in the UAE and the UK cannot be compared. I was in the courtroom and the hearing lasted less than 5 minutes,” she added. A life sentence for a non-Emirati entails a maximum of 25 years in jail followed by deportation, according to UAE state-run media. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had warned that the verdict could hurt relations with the UAE.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A 95-year-old Berlin resident has been charged with being an accessory to the murder of over 36,000 people at the Mauthausen death camp in Austria during World War Two, the Berlin prosecutor’s office said. The man, identified only as Hans H. for legal reasons, is alleged to have served in a Nazi SS-company at the largest Nazi death camp in Austria from summer 1944 to spring 1945.  He is accused of having guarded inmates at the camp, about 20 km from the Austrian city of Linz, and during marches to forced labour sites, the office said in a statement. “During the time of the crime, at least 36,223 people were killed at the Mauthausen concentration camp. The killings were mostly carried out through gassing, but also through ‘death bath actions’, injections and shootings, as well as through starvation and freezing,” it said. The suspect was “aware of all the killing methods as well as the disastrous living conditions of the incarcerated people at the camp” the statement said. It said he wanted to “support or at least help make easier the many thousands of deaths carried out by the main perpetrator”. The prosecutor’s office said it was bringing the charges under new laws that allow the prosecution of people involved in the Nazi “machinery of death” even if they did not personally kill anyone. Faced with the advancing age of the suspects, Germany has stepped up prosecutions of lower-ranking individuals since the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, a guard at Sobibor death camp. That case established a new precedent that no proof of a specific crime was needed to convict a defendant. In recent years, some other former SS camp guards have been convicted but died either before the conviction was legally binding or before they had to go behind bars. Another 95-year-old German man who is on trial for assisting in the murder of hundreds of people at the Stutthof camp, near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, this month told the court he had never been a Nazi and was not indifferent to the suffering of inmates.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The days of London house price rises hugely outpacing inflation won’t be returning anytime soon, even if Britain and the EU strike a Brexit deal, the vast majority of economists and analysts polled by Reuters said. Property values in the capital, long a haven for foreign investors, more than tripled in the last 20 years, but demand and turnover have crumbled since the June 2016 vote to leave the European Union and property taxes were raised. According to the Nov 13-22 Reuters poll, London house prices will fall 1.7 percent this year and another 0.3 percent in 2019. Asking prices in London fell 1.7 percent this month from October, according to property website Rightmove. Sterling, the stock market and businesses have had a turbulent few years since Britons narrowly voted to end their 45-year membership of the EU. With just over four months left until Brexit day, Prime Minister Theresa May faces opposition from lawmakers in all parties to her negotiated withdrawal deal, fuelling fears the country may leave without one. As that risk appeared to grow on Nov. 15, shares in housebuilders Persimmon (PSN.L), Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) and Berkeley Group (BKGH.L) fell between 6 and 7 percent in their worst daily performance since the referendum. “Things are starting to look a bit bleak. Uncertainty is about the only thing we can be certain about over the next two years,” said independent buying agent Henry Pryor.  Asked if there would be a return to strong turnover and above-inflation house price growth in London and the South East if a Brexit deal was struck, 14 of 17 respondents said no. Two said it would happen regardless and one said it depended on the deal. But Brexit is not the only factor holding back prices - a sharp increase in Stamp Duty Land Tax, paid when buying a house, has particularly affected the capital where houses are much more expensive than the rest of the country.  “The high rates of SDLT will continue to stifle transaction volumes, especially in expensive price areas like London and the South East,” said Ray Boulger, a senior manager at mortgage broker John Charcol.   After next year’s modest dip London prices will rise 1.5 percent in 2020, the poll found. A separate Reuters survey said overall inflation would be 2.0 percent that year. [ECILT/GB] Graphic on UK and London house prices forecast: tmsnrt.rs/2Q89SKn?eikon=true Graphic on UK house price-to-earnings ratio: tmsnrt.rs/2R1jZgW Graphic on outlook for London's housing market: tmsnrt.rs/2DCgt8Z?eikon=true When asked about the probability of a significant correction in London’s housing market by end-2019 the median forecast was only 20 percent, significantly down from the 29 percent given in August. That may be partly explained by the view that prices are already falling.  But not everyone was gloomy about the capital’s prospects. “London demand is starting to poke its head above the stamp duty-laden parapet again,” said Russell Quirk, chief executive of online estate agent eMoov. “History tells us that you can’t subdue London long term and therefore it’s clear that the current downturn in the capital’s volumes and values is temporary.” Nationally, house prices are forecast to rise 2.0 percent this year, 1.8 percent year and 2.0 percent again in 2020, the poll found. Those moderate gains are below expectations for wage increases and will likely cheer first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the property ladder.  When asked to rate the level of London house prices on a scale of 1 to 10, where one is extremely cheap and 10 extremely expensive, the median response was 8. Nationally they were rated 7, where it has been for a couple of years. While borrowing costs are currently low, the Bank of England is forecast to raise rates again after Brexit. But the new level of Bank Rate will still be historically low at 1.0 percent and it is not expected to rise to 1.25 percent until early 2020.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers launched an inquiry on Friday into computer systems failures at financial services firms, after a number of outages in recent months left millions of customers unable to access their money or make vital payments. The cross-party Treasury Committee of lawmakers said it will examine how financial firms are trying to guard against IT failings and whether regulators have the skills and powers to hold them to account when customers lose out. In the last year and a half financial firms including Equifax, TSB, Visa (V.N), Barclays (BARC.L), Cashplus and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) have experienced IT failures, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Committee, said. “Measly apologies and hollow words from financial services institutions will not suffice when consumers aren’t able to access their own money and face delays in paying bills,” she said. The computer systems failings have come at a particularly sensitive time as banks increasingly nudge customers towards their online channels in a bid to cut costs compared with serving them through physical branches.  The Treasury Committee said it is hiring a specialist advisor to inform the inquiry, which could lead to recommendations to the government on tougher regulations or penalties for IT failings. A botched IT project at TSB, owned by Spain’s Sabadell (SABE.MC), earlier this year led to one of Britain’s worst-ever banking outages and the resignation of TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester in the wake of sustained and bruising questioning by the committee about his handling of the crisis. As part of the lawmakers’ announcement of their probe, they published the responses of banks that have suffered recent outages explaining what went wrong. A glitch that hit thousands of business and personal customers of Barclays on Sept. 20 was caused by “a rare interaction between two software systems” that had been recently tweaked, Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said in a letter to Morgan. An unrelated outage that hit RBS customers the very next day was caused by “incorrect implementation of a network firewall rule update,” RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a letter published by the Treasury Committee. The politicians called at the time for the banks to explain what happened and compensate any customers affected.

China’s commerce ministry said it is deeply concerned by a report issued by the U.S. administration this week, which said China had failed to alter its “unfair” practices.      “The U.S side made new groundless accusations against the Chinese side, and China finds it totally unacceptable,” Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters at a news conference in Beijing. The findings were issued in an update of the U.S. Trade Representative’s “Section 301” investigation, which looks into China’s intellectual property and technology transfer policies and has sparked U.S. tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that later ballooned to $250 billion.  Gao said the report reflects U.S. unilateralism in violation of World Trade Organization rules. “We hope the United States will drop the words and behaviors that damage bilateral economic and trade relations and adopt a constructive attitude,” Gao said. The ministry is also evaluating the potential impact from a separate U.S. proposal this week to increase control over technology exports, and said it would take the necessary steps to uphold Chinese firms’ legitimate interests. Citing security concerns, the U.S. government on Monday proposed stepping up scrutiny over technology exports in 14 key high-tech areas including artificial intelligence and microprocessor technology, a move that many analysts view as directly targeting China.  A 30-day public consultation period on the proposal to include those sectors in its broader export control regime is underway and will end on Dec. 19, according to a document published on the U.S. government’s Federal Register on Monday. “We are evaluating the measures that the United States may take,” Gao said, stressing that Washington’s generalization of the concept on national security would only result in unnecessary barriers and damage trade. “China will pay close attention to the relevant U.S. legislation and take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises as appropriate,” he said. Washington is demanding Beijing to improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap. Trump has imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports to force concessions. The U.S. tariff rate on $200 billion in Chinese goods is set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on Jan. 1. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports - about $267 billion more in goods - if Beijing fails to address U.S. demands.

2019-02-08,"YOKOHAMA, Japan/PARIS (Reuters) - Nissan’s (7201.T) board voted unanimously to oust Chairman Carlos Ghosn over allegations of financial misconduct, after French partner Renault (RENA.PA) backed away from a last-minute demand to postpone the decision on their alliance leader’s fate. The vote - supported by Renault appointees on the Nissan board after a four-hour meeting - may begin to defuse a crisis that threatened to upend the alliance and spark a diplomatic rift between Japan and France, Renault’s main shareholder. It also drew a firm line under Ghosn’s stewardship of the car empire that was his life’s work. Ghosn was arrested in Japan on Monday after a Nissan investigation uncovered evidence of serious wrongdoing including under-reporting of his remuneration and personal use of company assets. “The board acknowledged the significance of the matter and confirmed that the longstanding alliance partnership with Renault remains unchanged,” the Japanese carmaker said. Nissan said its board dismissed Ghosn and fellow representative director Greg Kelly, an alleged co-conspirator, “after reviewing a detailed report of the internal investigation” - the first time Renault had seen key findings. With Ghosn and Kelly still in custody, neither man has been able to defend himself publicly against the allegations. Before the meeting, two Renault board directors had demanded a postponement of the vote to fire Ghosn until the internal probe and legal proceedings were complete, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Failing that, they had warned that the French carmaker would exercise its right under the alliance master agreement to appoint Ghosn’s successor and a fourth Renault nominee to the Nissan board, the sources said. The ultimatum was issued in a strongly worded response to Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa - who had informed Renault in an earlier confidential missive that the Nissan investigation was expanding to include Renault-Nissan finances. Nissan is 43.4 percent-owned by Renault. While almost 60 percent bigger by sales, it remains the junior partner in their shareholding hierarchy with a smaller reciprocal 15 percent non-voting stake in its French parent. Ghosn had been exploring a deeper Renault-Nissan tie-up that was resisted by the Japanese firm - a fact which has fuelled speculation about ulterior motives for his arrest. After the board presentation and its summary of findings, however, the tune in Paris had changed. “The accusations are extreme, certainly, but they are also precise,” said an official at French President Emmanuel Macron’s Elysee Palace office. “We know there’s a flourishing conspiracy theory about all this, but that’s really not our thinking.” After heavy losses earlier in the week, Renault shares were up 0.5 percent at 1615 GMT. Nissan shares closed up 0.8 percent.  The Japanese company did not announce a replacement for Ghosn - confounding reports that Saikawa was to be appointed interim chairman.  Japanese prosecutors say Ghosn and Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn’s remuneration by about half the 10 billion yen ($88 million) he earned at Nissan over five years from 2010. Following an internal probe resulting from a whistleblower alert, Ghosn is also accused of misappropriating Nissan assets and “misrepresenting the purpose” of company investments. A Nissan executive with direct knowledge of the board meeting said Renault’s representatives had initially voiced incomprehension over the accusations. “There was some talk and frustration about an unjust arrest,” he said. “But they suddenly changed when they heard the contents - and understood that this wasn’t some strange conspiracy.” Japanese newspapers have been awash with leaked details of the Tokyo prosecutor’s investigation into Ghosn. Asahi Shimbun reported on Thursday he had emailed Kelly orders to make false statements about his remuneration. The Yomiuri, Japan’s biggest-circulation daily, said Nissan had been paying Ghosn’s elder sister $100,000 a year since 2002 for a non-existent advisory role. She lived in a luxury Rio de Janeiro apartment funded by a Nissan subsidiary, according the report, which cited unidentified sources. Mitsubishi Motors, which joined the alliance in 2016, also plans to oust Ghosn as chairman next week. Renault’s board named interim replacements on Tuesday but kept Ghosn on as chairman and CEO, with government backing. That stance may now change. Even were he cleared, French officials now concede, Ghosn would be an unlikely figure to rebuild the cross-cultural trust of which he once appeared to be the sole guarantor. “It really seemed there was a common vision between Ghosn and Nissan,” the Elysee official said. “But now we realise there was in fact a yawning gap.” Reporting by Sam Nussey in TOKYO, Maki Shiraki in YOKOHAMA and Laurence Frost in PARIS; Additional reporting by Michel Rose, Daniel Leussink, Makiko Yamazaki, Chang Ran Kim, Kiyoshi Takenaka and Gilles Guillaume; Writing by Laurence Frost; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-nissan-ghosn/nissan-ends-ghosns-two-decade-reign-with-last-minute-renault-backing-idUKKCN1NR07S,2019-02-08,,Nissan ends Ghosn's two-decade reign with last-minute Renault backing
2019-02-08,"ROME (Reuters) - Qatar’s foreign minister said on Thursday that “whoever is responsible” for the murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi should be held accountable. Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani also told an international conference in Rome that his country saw no thaw in its bitter dispute with Saudi Arabia and would maintain its ties with Iran after the United States reimposed sanctions on Tehran. “Whoever is responsible for Khashoggi needs to be held accountable, whoever he is,” the Qatari minister said. “We have to wait for the investigation to be concluded.” Saudi Arabia is facing its worst political crisis in decades over the killing of Khashoggi at Riyadh’s consulate in Istanbul early last month, which has damaged the kingdom’s standing and strained its ties with the West. Sheikh Mohammed said the refusal of Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies to end a 17-month political and economic boycott of Qatar was “recklessness” that risked regional security. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty. “We still see them (Saudis and Emiratis)continuing with the same behaviour, continuing not to be responsive to any attempt of the international community” to end the conflict, he said. The United States has increased pressure on Riyadh to end its protracted dispute with Qatar following Khashoggi’s killing to restore Gulf unity, which Washington sees as essential to containing Iranian influence in the region. Shiekh Mohammed said Qatar would continue to deal with Iran, which helped Doha secure supplies when the boycott was first imposed, and was ready to mediate between Washington and Tehran. “There is this dispute between U.S. and Iran, it’s putting us in a situation in which we see a disagreement between our strongest ally and our neighbour, which is not comfortable,” he said.  “There should be a way to find a bridge to mediate this problem, if Qatar can provide this bridge, why not?” Reporting Davide Barbuscia; Writing by Nayera Abdallah and Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-qatar/qatar-asks-for-accountability-in-khashoggi-murder-sees-no-end-to-gulf-row-idUKKCN1NR2AE,2019-02-08,,"Qatar asks for accountability in Khashoggi murder, sees no end to Gulf row"

2019-02-08,"ROME (Reuters) - The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerged as Italy’s predominant political force at March elections, allowing it to enter government for the first time in its short history and take many top ministerial jobs. Five months later, it is discovering that governing is considerably more difficult than being in opposition. While its coalition partner the League has overtaken it in opinion polls, driven forward by its media-savvy leader Matteo Salvini, 5-Star has seen its own support slip. Led by Luigi Di Maio, the party has already had to jettison some campaign pledges, has seen high-profile ministers make gaffe-prone cabinet debuts and has struggled to corral its disparate bloc of parliamentarians. The worries facing 5-Star, coupled with Salvini’s surging popularity, are certain to embolden the far-right League as it pursues its anti-immigrant, Italy-first agenda, confident that if the coalition fell apart it would triumph in a snap election. The setbacks afflicting 5-Star show the problems facing unconventional, populist parties that are sprouting up across Europe as they evolve from raucous protest movements into mature rulers.  But the initial reversals are also likely to harden 5-Star resolve in the government’s showdown with the European Union over next year’s budget as it seeks to show its voters that it has not lost its radical zeal. “Salvini has the wind in his sails and the 5-Star doesn’t any more,” said Sergio Fabbrini, head of the political science department at Rome’s LUISS university.  “The 5-Star based its electoral success on promises that are proving very hard to fulfil and you can see that it is struggling to stay true to itself,” he added. Di Maio, 32, denies his party is in any difficulty and insists it has scored early successes, including curbing parliamentary privileges and bolstering workers’ rights. He has accused the press of being prejudiced against 5-Star, denouncing journalists as “foul jackals”, and alleging that newspapers are intent on stirring trouble between himself and his fellow deputy prime minister, Salvini. “This government enjoys a great consensus in the country and the other parties are trailing far behind us,” he told a group of foreign journalists earlier this month.  But the polls are more comforting for Salvini than Di Maio. While the League won 17 percent of the vote in March against 32 percent for 5-Star, a Nov. 19 survey put Salvini’s party on 32.7 percent against 26.4 percent for 5-Star - a reverse that pollsters SWG said should sound a “red alarm” for Di Maio. Daniela Aiuto, a European parliamentarian who last month quit 5-Star after a disagreement with its leadership, says Salvini’s success is based on his mastery of social media as he pursues his hardline crackdown on immigration. “Luigi (Di Maio) has ability, but the comparison with Salvini is sadly one-sided,” she told Reuters. “What Luigi says might be important, but what Salvini says makes headlines.” Insiders say the two coalition leaders get on relatively well, speaking to each other every day and regularly exchanging messages via WhatsApp. But relationships between the two parties’ ministers, lawmakers and experts are much more fraught. While the League has years of experience of government, at a national and local level, 5-Star was only formed in 2009 and has much less administrative know-how. League lawmakers such as Igor Iezzi say this inexperience can be seen in parliament. “They must learn to work in a coalition. We are not on Facebook, where you read the posts and then change your mind,” Iezzi told Reuters, complaining that 5-Star counterparts were chopping and changing their ideas on amendments. “If you work 10 days on an amendment, you cannot then go back on it ... You need to grow up a bit,” he said. Salvini has found it easier to marshal his parliamentary forces than Di Maio, who is trying to enforce order by threatening to expel anyone who votes down coalition proposals. One such dissenter is Gregorio De Falco, a former coastguard commander viewed as a hero in Italy for his role in rescuing survivors from the stricken Costa Concordia cruise ship in 2012. His decision to stand as a 5-Star candidate in the March ballot was seen as a coup for the party, but he has now voted against the government three times in less than a month, most recently in opposition to a proposed amnesty on illegal building on the earthquake-hit island of Ischia. “5-Star was born as an environmental group and we cannot forget this now we are in government,” De Falco told Reuters. The party has already disappointed its environmentalist wing by reneging on a campaign pledge to halt the construction of the TAP gas pipeline project in the Puglia region. It explained the U-turn by saying Italy could have been hit by fines of 20 billion euro ($23 billion) if it had killed the project and denied knowing this before taking office.  Likewise, it infuriated some supporters by letting steel giant ArcelorMittal buy Italy’s troubled Ilva steelmaker rather than follow through on promises to shut down the firm’s heavily polluting Puglia furnaces. These decisions dictated by realpolitik have put 5-Star on the defensive and made it determined not to cede ground in other battles - most notably over its flagship policy, the so-called “citizen’s wage”, an income support plan for the poor. The proposal helped 5-Star win up to 50 percent of the vote in the underdeveloped south and Di Maio insists it must be introduced it next year at a cost of around 10 billion euros. The League, which draws much support from the wealthy north and is ideologically opposed to major welfare handouts, has agreed to the plan in principle, but warns its implementation will be “complicated”. “This is creating permanent tensions with the League, but it would be a disaster for 5-Star if the plan fails so they will do everything possible to prevent that happening.” said Luiss University professor Fabbrini. When it comes to trying to impose its will on its coalition partner, 5-Star has one important handicap. In a country that has seen some 65 governments since World War Two, coalition parties have regularly threatened to walk out of administrations if they don’t get what they want. But such threats from the 5-Star would ring hollow.  Under party rules, its lawmakers can only serve two mandates, which means Di Maio and most top party officials will not be allowed to stand at the next election. Analysts believe this means they will do everything they can to cling to office. “Di Maio has every interest in keeping the government going, even though it cannot give him everything he needs. This puts him at a distinct disadvantage to Salvini,” said Fabbrini.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nationwide Building Society (POB_p.L), one of Britain’s three biggest mortgage providers, reported a 17 percent drop in first-half profit on Wednesday as it booked a charge for asset write-offs and technology investments. The lender said it took a charge of 135 million pounds for the six-month period, as it invests in technology to improve its services amid rising competition for savings deposits from traditional incumbent players and new upstart digital banks. Nationwide, a bellwether for the British home loan market with its 13 percent mortgage share, said its net interest margin fell to 1.27 percent in April-September, from 1.34 percent in the same period a year ago, amid intense competition among lenders. Banks in Britain have in recent months reported tightening margins, as new players entering the market and contracting demand for home loans have squeezed the rates lenders can charge. Nationwide said its statutory profit was 516 million pounds in the first half of its financial year, down from 628 million in the same period a year ago but in line with expectations. Unlike rival listed banks such as Lloyds and Barclays which have a goal of delivering ever higher profits to their shareholders, Nationwide operates as a society owned by its customers and has said it will be comfortable keeping annual profits at between 0.9 billion and 1.3 billion pounds per year. The lender said fears about the impact of Britain’s exit from the European Union have held back investment. “Consumer confidence and activity in the housing market are more subdued than what you’d expect,” Nationwide Chief Economist Robert Gardner said. Nationwide said it will press ahead with plans to launch a business current account regardless of whether it wins funding for the scheme from a fund set up by Royal Bank of Scotland to fulfil the conditions of its 2008 crisis-era bailout. That represented a change in Nationwide’s previous stance on the topic when it said it would only launch the business account if it succeeds in its application for the funding.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - One of Britain’s biggest pension funds has joined other investors, law firms and trade bodies in raising concerns about plans to give the government more power to scrutinize takeovers and other deals on security grounds, documents seen by Reuters showed. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which owns stakes in Heathrow airport and the company behind utility Thames Water, has said it is worried that politics could influence the way future governments use the proposed powers. Britain announced a sweeping plan in July to give the government more scope to examine deals and investments on the basis of national security, in the biggest overhaul of the rules since the Enterprise Act in 2002. The plan would allow the UK to investigate a wide range of transactions from company takeovers and loans to sales of assets such as land and intellectual property, putting key decisions in the hands of a senior minister. The government has said it is mainly seeking to safeguard infrastructure and technology assets with the new rules. Reuters has reviewed 13 responses submitting during a 12-week consultation by the government. Respondents included the USS, which has 63.6 billion pounds ($81.4 billion) in assets. “We are concerned that the interpretation and implementation of this call-in regime could evolve with the political mood of the nation and corresponding change of government and therefore lead to uncertainty,” the USS said, although it recognised the government’s need to scrutinize infrastructure deals. The British Venture Capital Association said in its submission that it was “concerned that the call-in power might be used for political reasons.” Other respondents to the consultation, which closed last month, said they were worried the plan could deter foreign investment in Britain. The government, which has yet to respond to the consultation, has not said how many submissions it received. “These reforms are aimed solely at ensuring the government’s ability to protect national security,” a government spokesman said. “We remain open for business and welcome foreign investment.” Britain’s move mirrors initiatives in other nations to prevent sensitive assets falling under the control of foreign powers, such as China. Such steps have been taken by Germany, Italy and the United States. But respondents to the consultation said Britain’s proposals were too broad. They also said the government had underestimated how many firms would flag up deals for security screening. Britain has only formally intervened in deals on the grounds of national security in nine instances since 2002, according to Fingleton Associates, a firm set up by John Fingleton who ran Britain’s now-defunct Office of Fair Trading. Under the new rules, the government estimates it would screen about 200 cases a year, of which it expects 100 to face deeper examination and 50 to be blocked or face restrictions. Law firm Herbert Smith Freehills said in its consultation submission it expected the number of reviews and interventions to be “dramatically higher, given the numerous ‘foreign-to-foreign’ acquisitions with assets or business in the UK and also given the regime’s reach on, for example, real property and intellectual property.” Reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-m-a-rules/uk-plans-to-tighten-takeover-rules-face-resistance-from-business-idUKKCN1NQ1YH,2019-02-08,,UK plans to tighten takeover rules face resistance from business

The FTSE 100 .FTSE ended up 1.5 percent, snapping three days of losses and outperforming its euro zone peers. The FTSE 250 .FTMC closed up 1.2 percent. A rally in U.S. equities ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday also lifted spirits, with some analysts considering the markets sufficiently oversold and primed for a bounce. “How far it goes is another matter, but signs of a possible end to the selling are beginning to pile up,” said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp. The U.S. indices have completed another part of the ‘W’ formation that usually accompanies such a big sell-off - a slump, a shortlived bounce and then another drop - before a more sustainable rally, he said.

NMC Health (NMC.L) jumped 8 percent buoyed by a JPMorgan upgrade. Sage Group (SGE.L) managed to claw back from three-year lows to end the day up 2.2 percent as investors sought bargains, shrugging off the British software provider’s warning about slowing growth and a slightly weaker outlook.  “While the news today is bad, there is an element of kitchen sink with a new CEO coming in, the strategy as laid out seems reasonable enough,” said Investec analysts. Kingfisher (KGF.L), Europe’s second largest home improvement retailer, fell 3 percent after reporting weak quarterly sales in France and announcing plans to exit Russia, Spain and Portugal, which raised questions over its plan to increase profit. There was plenty of action on the midcap index. Paragon Banking Group (PARA.L) jumped 8 percent after its results and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) was buoyed by a UBS upgrade. At the bottom of the pack, Indivior (INDV.L) sank another 11 percent as its full-year guidance failed to reassure investors after the company lost a legal battle on Tuesday over its blockbuster film-based opioid addiction treatment. Babcock (BAB.L) hit its lowest in more than seven years before ending the day down 4.7 percent after taking a one-off restructuring charge and warning that income from nuclear decommissioning would fall sharply next year.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Wednesday in a broad-based bounce that saw the battered tech sector recover following a sharp sell-off on worries over iPhone demand and pricey valuations, and Italian banks rise from two-year lows. The STOXX 600  climbed 1.1 percent, snapping a five-day losing streak that had pushed the pan-European benchmark close to the near two-year low hit last month.  Germany's DAX .GDAXI index jumped 1.6 percent, its strongest day since July 26. Indices managed to hold on to opening gains, something they haven’t succeeded to do for several days as a global bear market saps investors’ appetite for stocks. Italian banks .FTIT8300 rose as much as 2.6 percent after a report said Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini might be open to reviewing the government’s 2019 budget, fuelling hopes the country could avert a clash with the European Commission. The index held on to early gains despite Salvini then saying he was not open to negotiations over Italy’s budget deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP. Banks ended the day 2.4 percent higher, having hit a near two-year low on Tuesday. The European Commission took a first step toward disciplining Italy over its expansionary 2019 budget after Rome refused to change it, raising the stakes in a dispute that has alarmed the whole euro zone and could eventually lead to fines. Italian banks have lost around 40 billion euros in market cap from their May peak as worries over Italy’s spending plans lifted government bonds yields to multi-year highs, eroding the value of their large sovereign bond portfolios and raising the risk of possible capital injections for the weaker lenders.  Top gainer among Italian banks was Milan-based Banco BMP (BAMI.MI), which rallied 7.6 percent, while heavyweight lenders Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) rose 2.8 and 1.8 percent respectively.          The broader European banking index .SX7P was among the biggest sectoral gainers, up 1.8 percent, while tech stocks .SX8P jumped 2.2 percent, bouncing back from their lowest level since the end of February. Stocks supplying chips to Apple rebounded sharply. STMicroelectronics (STM.MI) and Infineon (IFXGn.DE) climbed 4.2 to 4.3 percent while Austrian chipmaker AMS (AMS.S) rose 9.1 percent.  While the rebound was broad-based with no sector in the red, investors remained cautious over the outlook for the market due to lingering concerns over slowing economic and earnings growth. Analysts were still cutting their estimates for European earnings as an underwhelming third-quarter results season drew to a close. Company updates triggered sharp share price moves.  Shares in Swedish medical equipment firm Getinge (GETIb.ST) rose 10.8 percent as traders said the company’s capital markets day alleviated some of analysts’ and investors’ concerns. The shares are down 26 percent year-to-date amid profit warnings.  Indivior (INDV.L) sank 11 percent after it warned it could take a hit if the rival drug from Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (REDY.NS) comes to market this year. Johnson Matthey (JMAT.L) led gainers on the STOXX, up 13.7 percent, after the specialty chemicals company, which makes materials used in electric car batteries, raised its full-year guidance.

2019-02-08,"PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan wants more influence in its alliance with France’s Renault following the arrest of group Chairman Carlos Ghosn, arguing the structure does not adequately reflect the Japanese carmaker’s size and global sales. Japan’s No.2 auto manufacturer has long felt like the junior partner in the alliance built by Ghosn over the last 19 years, since he rescued Nissan from near-bankruptcy. The alliance was extended to include Mitsubishi Motors in 2016. But while Nissan is agitating for change, the French and Japanese governments talked up stability on Wednesday, saying they wanted to consolidate the alliance following Ghosn’s shock arrest on suspicion of financial misaccounting.  Nissan has said it will fire Ghosn as chairman on Thursday. “We need to return to the original idea of a win-win relationship,” a long-time Nissan executive told reporters at a briefing in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity. It should be “a more equal relationship than before.”  Nissan, while almost 60 percent bigger than Renault by sales, remains junior in their shareholding structure. While Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan, Nissan has just a 15-percent non-voting stake in Renault. Renault’s biggest shareholder is the French state with 15 percent. The Nissan executive said a reduction of Renault’s stake in Nissan should be one option under consideration. Ghosn, a Brazilian, Lebanese and French citizen, had personally shaped the alliance and pledged to consolidate it with a deeper tie-up, one that not all parties were convinced by. Before his arrest, the 64-year-old was exploring a full Renault-Nissan merger at the French government’s urging.  “We’d asked Carlos Ghosn to reinforce the alliance,” a French official told Reuters, adding that the government was still in the dark about the case against him. “It’s difficult to see what’s behind all this - whether it’s all true, or whether it’s been swiftly brought out to scupper the alliance or take control.” Auto analyst Thomas Besson of Paris brokerage Kepler was less equivocal. Nissan’s planned dismissal of its chairman “appears to be an indirect way of formally refusing a financial merger that Ghosn was advocating”, he said. As well as geography and culture, the ties among the companies are complicated by the role of the French state, which enjoys double-voting rights in Renault.      In Japan there is concern France is ultimately seeking to take control of Nissan and Mitsubishi. In France, there are suspicions Ghosn may have been targeted so as to hinder French influence. Trust has been undermined on both sides. “There is a feeling of crisis at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry that at this rate Nissan and Mitsubishi will be seized by the French government,” said a senior source familiar with Japanese government thinking.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire sought to ease the tensions, saying stability remained critical for both France and Japan. He said he wanted to see the evidence against Ghosn before reaching conclusions, and added that he would meet Japan’s economy and industry minister on Thursday for talks.  “At this stage, we do not have any evidence to support the accusations against Mr Carlos Ghosn,” Le Maire told reporters. “I would like to emphasize the Renault board’s request that Nissan share all the evidence available to it.” Renault on Tuesday tapped its chief operating officer and a senior board member to fill in for Ghosn, but the board refrained from ousting him while waiting for details on the allegations - a decision that could buy more time for an accelerated, permanent succession process. One of the world’s best-known auto industry executives, Ghosn bestrode the alliance, although he often said that his efforts to drive integration were hampered by the French government’s stake in Renault. On Monday, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa portrayed Nissan as a victim of Ghosn’s alleged misdeeds. But Nissan itself faces scrutiny over the financial misconduct case, with the Asahi newspaper reporting on Wednesday that prosecutors were weighing bringing a case against the Japanese automaker. With Ghosn potentially gone from the picture, the future of the alliance is the subject of intense investor speculation. Mitsubishi Motors CEO Osamu Masuko said on Tuesday it may be hard to manage without Ghosn. On Wednesday, Renault shares rose 1.3 percent after falling more than 9 percent this week. Nissan closed up 0.4 percent after falling nearly 6 percent a day earlier. Mitsubishi Motors closed down 1 percent after losing nearly 7 percent on Tuesday.   The success of the alliance, which helps the automakers develop products and control costs, is critical for the members at a time when the industry is buffeted by major changes in consumer tastes and rivals are investing billions in new growth areas like automated and internet-connected vehicles. Given those considerations, the Japanese and French governments have backed stability in the alliance. It “is a symbol of Franco-Japanese industrial success,” the top Japanese government spokesman said, calling for a “stable relationship” among the three automakers. Graphic: Shares in Nissan, Renault, Mitsubishi Motors - tmsnrt.rs/2R08nep Nissan said on Monday an internal investigation triggered by a tip-off from a whistleblower had revealed that Ghosn engaged in wrongdoing including personal use of company money and under-reporting for years how much he was earning. Ghosn was arrested by Japanese prosecutors who said he and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Ghosn’s compensation at Nissan over five years from 2010, saying it was about half the actual 10 billion yen ($89 million). Ghosn and Kelly, who has also been arrested, have not commented on the accusations and Reuters has not been able to reach them. Kyodo News reported on Wednesday that the Tokyo District Court has decided Ghosn and Kelly would be detained for a further 10 days. Japan’s Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday that Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen over a five-year period to March 2015 but that it went unreported in Nissan’s financial statements.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will back an agreement on Sunday on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, and hopes Spain’s objection to wording over the disputed British territory of Gibraltar can be resolved by then, Chancellor Angela Merkel said. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Tuesday his government would vote against the EU’s draft Brexit agreement if the included text on Gibraltar was not changed. Gibraltar is due to leave the European Union along with the United Kingdom in March, although 96 percent of its population voted in the 2016 referendum to remain in the bloc. “We know how difficult the discussions are in Britain, but I can say for Germany that we will agree to this exit agreement,” Merkel told German lawmakers on Wednesday during a budget debate. “We still have an objection in Spain. I can’t say exactly how we solve this issue, but I hope it will be solved by Sunday.” The EU is due to hold a summit to discuss Britain’s draft Brexit deal on that day. Merkel said her government regretted but respected Britain’s decision to leave, adding: “We want - and that is in our fundamental interests - to have a good relationship with Britain in the future too.” On the Irish ‘backstop’, an insurance policy to avoid a return to controls between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU state Ireland, she said this presented a situation that was “very, very difficult to solve.” “I think rightly, we have placed value on Britain not being able to decide unilaterally when it ends the customs union, but rather that Britain together with the EU defines this date and afterwards the future relationship comes into effect,” she said.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey accused the United States on Wednesday of trying to turn a blind eye to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, and dismissed comments from President Donald Trump on the issue as “comic”. Trump vowed on Tuesday to remain a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia, despite saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about the plan to murder to Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist. Of the possibility Prince Mohammed had a hand in the murder, Trump said: “Maybe he did, maybe he didn’t”. His comments contradicted the CIA, which believes Khashoggi’s death was ordered directly by the crown prince, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler. Numan Kurtulmus, the deputy chairman of President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party, dismissed Trump’s assessment. “Yesterday’s statement is a comic statement,” he told state broadcaster TRT Haber. “It is not possible for an intelligence agency such as the CIA, which even knows the colour of the fur on the cat walking around the Saudi consulate’s garden ... to not know who gave this order,” he said. “This is not credible either for U.S. public opinion or the world public opinion.” Since Khashoggi’s killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month, Turkey has repeatedly said the order came from the “highest levels” of the Saudi government, although it has not directly accused Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia has denied that the crown prince ordered the killing. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last week Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when “negotiations” to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. Trump said Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer, was an important business partner and a “great ally” in the fight against Iranian power in the Middle East.  Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara is not entirely satisfied with the level of cooperation it is receiving from Saudi Arabia regarding the case. Cavusoglu said Ankara may seek a formal United Nations inquiry if its liaising with Riyadh comes to an impasse.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kingfisher (KGF.L), Europe’s second largest home improvement retailer, reported weak quarterly sales in France and said it would pull out of Russia, Spain and Portugal, sending its shares lower and raising questions over its plan to increase profit.  The group, which across Europe trails France’s Groupe Adeo, is in the third year of five-year programme to raise annual profit by 500 million pounds from 2021. However, profits are forecast to go backwards in its 2018-19 year. Kingfisher’s shares fell as much as 5.8 percent on Wednesday, taking losses for the year to more than 30 percent, after the group, whose main businesses are B&Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France, reported a fall in underlying sales in its third quarter, with Castorama in continuing to trade particularly poorly and underperform the wider French market. Chief Executive Véronique Laury, who has cut Castorama’s prices and revamped its marketing, warned “there is no quick fix” for that business. “We believe Kingfisher’s transformation plan will not yield the margin benefits it was supposed to, so there will be more calls for a break-up, but in between a margin reset may be necessary,” said RBC Europe analyst Richard Chamberlain, who has a “sector perform” rating on the stock. Kingfisher’s like-for-like sales fell 1.3 percent in the quarter to Oct. 31, reflecting the weak performance at Castorama France, where sales on the same basis slumped 7.3 percent - worse than analysts’ expectations of a fall of about 3 percent.  Laury said the margin outlook in France was uncertain given the difficult trading and the impact of recent national fuel tax protests. “Castorama is likely to be still losing share to Leroy Merlin due to unified products not resonating with customers and a suboptimal digital offer,” said RBC’s Chamberlain. Kingfisher’s plan for the group, costing 800 million pounds over five years, involves unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings. “We are committed to our plan and to building a strong business for the long-term. As part of this commitment, we have taken the decision to exit Russia, Spain and Portugal,” said Laury. “This will allow us to apply our strategy with more focus and efficiency in our main markets where we have, or can reach, a market leading position.” Russia and Iberia account for about 7 percent of Kingfisher’s total sales. The loss-making Russian business trades from 20 stores, while Iberia, which is close to break-even, trades from 31 stores. Britain, France and Poland account for 90 percent of Kingfisher’s sales. Like-for-like sales in Britain and Ireland fell 0.7 percent in the quarter. Prior to Wednesday’s update analysts were on average forecasting a full-year underlying pretax profit of 741 million pounds, down from 797 million pounds made in 2017-18. Analysts said they expected forecasts to be downgraded by about 5 percent. The stock was down 2.5 percent at 240.2 pence at 0923 GMT, valuing the business at 5.1 billion pounds.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 6 percent on Tuesday in heavy trading volume, with U.S. crude diving to its lowest level in more than a year, caught in a broader Wall Street selloff fed by mounting concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended the session down $3.77, or 6.6 percent, at $53.43 per barrel. The contract fell as much as 7.7 percent during the session to touch $52.77 a barrel, the lowest since October 2017.  More than 946,000 front-month WTI contracts changed hands, exceeding the daily average over the last 10 months and the second-highest daily volume since June, according to Refinitiv data.  Brent crude futures fell $4.26, or 6.4 percent, to settle at $62.53 a barrel. The international benchmark fell as much as 7.6 percent to $61.71 during the session, the lowest since December 2017.   Oil’s slide has been largely unimpeded since early October when WTI prices were near four-year peaks. Since then, WTI has fallen more than 30 percent. “For the time being it’s more about risk,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. “When the stock market comes off 8 or 9 percent, it tends to conjure up images of a weak global economy and that feeds into expectations of weaker-than-expected oil demand.”  The S&P 500 index on Tuesday hit a three-week low as weak results and forecasts from big retailers fanned worries about holiday season sales, while tech stocks slid further on concerns about iPhone sales. Global stock markets have slumped in the past two months on worries about corporate earnings, rising borrowing costs, slowing global economic momentum and trade tensions. Traders see further downside risk to oil prices from growing U.S. shale production and a deteriorating economic outlook. Macro-focused funds and commodity trading advisory (CTA) firms have pulled back positions in recent weeks as the selloff has accelerated, market participants said.  According to Credit Suisse, prior to oil’s selloff in early October, macro/discretionary funds and CTAs held a net long position that ranked in the top decile over the past five years. As of Monday, those funds were balanced between long and short positions as traders sold long positions and funds shifted to the sidelines. “This is a risk aversion trade,” said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse.  U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS Prices ticked lower after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States intends to remain a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia even though “it could very well be” that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had knowledge of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month in Turkey. This eased concerns about potential oil supply disruptions amid heightened U.S.-Saudi tensions. “I never really understood the premium behind some kind of friction between U.S. and Saudi Arabia from a policy standpoint ... It really is a too-big-to-fail relationship,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management in Washington. Expectations for a ninth straight week of U.S. crude inventory increases also weighed on prices. Analysts polled ahead of weekly data forecast crude stocks rose about 2.9 million barrels last week. Oil prices pared losses briefly after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed crude inventories fell by 1.5 million barrels last week to 439.2 million.  Official government data is due Wednesday morning.  U.S. crude production has soared almost 25 percent this year, to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd).  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pushing for a supply cut of 1 million bpd to 1.4 million bpd when it meets on Dec. 6.  The OPEC envoy for the United Arab Emirates said it was very likely that the group would reduce output but the exact level had yet to be decided. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned OPEC and other producers of the “negative implications” of supply cuts, with many analysts fearing a spike in crude prices could erode consumption. “We are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty in oil markets,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slumped on Tuesday to its lowest this year, tumbling as much as 10 percent to breach $4,300 and taking losses in the world’s best-known digital coin to 25 percent within a week. Other smaller coins also skidded sharply as a broader cryptocurrency sell-off, said by traders and market makers to be rooted in heavy selling at leveraged Asian exchanges, gathered steam. The fall followed a sudden plunge last week that shook bitcoin out of a period of relative stability, where prices had hovered around the $6,500 mark for several months. Bitcoin sunk as far as $4,327, its lowest since October 2017. By mid-afternoon, it was trading around $4,750 on the Bitstamp exchange.  “We’d been waiting for a break-out,” said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro. “When you have the price moving so steadily you had lots of stop-loss orders building up - and now you are seeing them being liquidated.”  Ripple's XRP XRP=BTSP and Ethereum's ether ETH=BTSP, the second and third-largest coins, fell as much as 14 and 16 percent respectively before clawing back losses in U.S. trading hours.  Tuesday’s falls coincided with broader drops in financial markets. European shares fell as poor retail results and weakness in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) dragged down Wall Street. Bitcoin has plummeted over 75 percent this year from a peak of $20,000 touched in December as retail investors piled into a one of the largest bubbles in history. Traders and market makers blamed bitcoin’s slide on heavy selling at leveraged exchanges in Asia such as Hong Kong-based OKEx and Bitmex. Few exchanges in the West lend bitcoin to traders, making the Asian venues popular with speculators. “The presence of leverage makes day traders attracted to Asian markets,” said Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading in New York, one of the biggest over-the-counter trading desks.  “Folks who are risking 100X type of leverage, it’s really difficult to think of that as an investment – it’s a casino mentality.” Others blamed fears that last week’s “hard fork” in bitcoin cash, where a software upgrade split the fourth-biggest coin into two separate currencies, could destabilize others. The price of bitcoin tends to be sensitive to debates over how its underlying network evolves. Last year the suspension of hard fork planned by major developers and investors proved a major catalyst to its breakneck rise. Mainstream investors have stayed clear of bitcoin, with concerns over scant regulatory oversight and undeveloped market infrastructure compounded by frequent swings in price.  That lack of involvement has seen bitcoin struggle to live up to its billing as something that will revolutionize world finance. Its usage as a payment currency has shriveled this year. At the same time, bitcoin’s plunge in value has calmed the fears of regulators and central bankers that it could one day pose a risk to financial stability. According to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com, the total value of cryptocurrencies is now around $154 billion, down from a peak of around $800 billion in January. Cryptocurrency advocates say bitcoin is still young and price volatility is to be expected. Many predict the need for virtual currencies that operate beyond mainstream banking will outlast any short-term price falls.    By late afternoon, XRP and ether were trading around $0.45 and $142 respectively on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.     “The euphoria has died and prices have consolidated with lower lows and lower highs,” said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at Forex.com. “A lot of people have lost interest.” Reporting by Tom Wilson and Tommy Wilkes,; Editing by Saikat Chatterjee and Ed Osmond",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-crypto-currencies/bitcoin-crashes-to-lowest-this-year-losses-top-25-percent-in-a-week-idUKKCN1NP0TU,2019-02-08,,"Bitcoin crashes to lowest this year, losses top 25 percent in a week"
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration is considering giving U.S. troops on the border with Mexico the authority to carry out medical screening of migrants, U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The proposal, which is still in draft form and circulating within the administration, would involve the military in screenings for things like illness and injury only if U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency personnel were overwhelmed and unable to do so on their own, the officials said. The proposal would expand the mission for the Pentagon, which said previously it did not expect its forces to directly interact with migrants.  The Pentagon declined to comment on internal deliberations. In a statement, it said the operation would cost about $72 million (56.3 million pounds) through Dec. 15, based on current plans. U.S. military duties on the border, including stringing up concertina wire and building temporary housing, have been aimed at supporting CBP personnel.   The U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters about the proposal did so on condition of anonymity because Trump has not yet signed off on the idea. It was unclear if the proposal, if confirmed in the coming days, might prolong the deployment of at least some troops at the border.  The commander of the mission told Reuters last week that the number of troops may have peaked at around 5,800, and he would soon look at whether to begin sending forces home or shifting some to new border positions. Trump, who won the presidency in 2016 after a campaign promising to crack down on illegal immigration, has seized upon migrant caravans headed towards the U.S. border, comparing it to an “invasion.”  Critics have derided his position as a stunt that politicizes the military. About 6,000 Central Americans have reached the Mexican border cities of Tijuana and Mexicali, according to local officials. More bands of migrants are making their way towards Tijuana, with around 10,000 expected.   In Tijuana and other ports of entry, CBP officers are trained to check migrants and travellers for obvious signs of infectious conditions, like fever, bleeding from the eyes or other symptoms of “quarantinable and communicable diseases,” according to a 2015 report by the Congressional Research Service.  One U.S. official said that under the latest proposal, U.S. troops would carry out medical screenings only if other officials, such as from state and local governments or the National Guard, were not available or overwhelmed. “The intent of the authorities is not to bring the troops in closer contact with the migrants but to provide medical assistance if needed,” the official said.  On Monday, Reuters reported that Trump was likely to give U.S. troops authority to protect immigration agents stationed along the U.S. border with Mexico if they come under threat from migrants seeking to cross into the United States.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is due to leave the European Union in just over four months’ time but it still cannot count on a transition period to cushion the shock for its economy. Prime Minister Theresa May last week agreed a draft withdrawal deal with Brussels. But it faces stiff resistance in her Conservative Party, meaning it could fail in parliament. Following is an outline of what a no-deal Brexit might look like:  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says Brexit without a transition would deliver a “large negative shock” to the  economy which could be akin to the 1970s oil crisis. The International Monetary Fund forecasts the economy would shrink without a Brexit deal.  The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, predicts the economy would grow by 0.3 percent in 2019 and 2020 without a deal, compared with 1.9 percent and 1.6 percent if there is one. Barriers to trade would go up, at least in the short term, hurting companies on both sides of the English Channel. British exporters would face EU import tariffs which average 5 percent but are higher for major British exports such as cars which would pay a 10 percent tariff. Manufacturers across the board are also worried about border delays which would hurt their just-in-time production. But Brexit supporters say technology would ease any border delays and exports would flow freely if Britain gets a future EU free trade deal. They also say deals with faster-growing economies such as the United States, India and China would help Britain more than remaining close to the EU. Britain’s budget forecasters say the benefits of these bilateral trade deals are likely to be small. Ports and airports are likely to see the first impact. The government has plans to turn two motorways and an airport in the south of England into lorry parks if needed. France is preparing various measures, notably those dealing with customs controls and checks at ports, in case there is no Brexit deal, according to French transport minister Elisabeth Borne. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply estimates that one in 10 British businesses fear they would go bankrupt if goods were delayed by 10–30 minutes at customs. Many manufacturers are stockpiling parts to keep production lines open in the event of border delays. The British government has asked drugmakers to stockpile medicines for six weeks above normal operations. Chancellor Philip Hammond has built up a fiscal war-chest to spend more in case of a Brexit shock to the economy. But he has also warned that, longer term, a no-deal Brexit would mean a rethink of his promise to end austerity. Brexit supporters say leaving the EU with no deal would help the public finances because it would mean an immediate end to payments by London into the EU budget. The BoE has warned investors not to assume that it would rush to the rescue in the event of a no-deal Brexit shock. A fall in the value of the pound would push up inflation, potentially preventing interest rate cuts. Given the likely economic hit, a no-deal Brexit would probably push the pound down, adding to its losses against the U.S dollar of about 13 percent since the 2016 referendum.  A Reuters poll of market strategists published on Nov. 1 predicted sterling would sink by more than 6 percent if no deal is reached, but could rise about 5.5 percent if one is struck. A weaker pound could push up the share prices of many of the country’s biggest companies which do business around the world such as British American Tobacco and GSK in the FTSE 100, which makes 70 percent of its income overseas. But there could be punishment for the more domestically focussed FTSE 250 companies who make half their money at home. That would make sense if the traditional correlations hold true. Last week, the trend briefly broke down and the FTSE 100 and the pound both fell, moving in rare lockstep as the growing risk of a disorderly divorce spooked investors. The economic shock of a no-deal Brexit would normally encourage investors to seek the safe haven of British government bonds. Gilt yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, fell by the most since 2016 on Thursday. However, a no-deal Brexit would be a major blow to May and could usher in a new national election. The left-wing Labour Party leads some opinion polls and its plans for big increases in public spending would unsettle some investors.

2019-02-08,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Home-renting company Airbnb Inc <AirBnB Inc> said on Monday it would remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move Israel called a “wretched capitulation” to boycotters and Palestinians hailed as a step towards peace. The decision, affecting some 200 listings, would take effect in the coming days, Airbnb said.  Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. Its settlements there are considered illegal by most world powers. Palestinians deem the settlements, and the military presence needed to protect them, to be obstacles to their goal of establishing a state. Israel disputes this.  “We concluded that we should remove listings in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians,” Airbnb said on its website. “Our hope is that someday sooner rather than later, a framework is put in place where the entire global community is aligned so there will be a resolution to this historic conflict and a clear path forward for everybody to follow.”  Palestinians and their supporters had long lobbied Airbnb to delist the settlements. Israel strongly opposes such calls for boycotts, which it considers a biased approach to the conflict. Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called Airbnb’s move “the most wretched of wretched capitulations to the boycott efforts”.   Speaking on Israel’s Channel 13 television, he said Israel was not told of the decision in advance and that it would respond by backing lawsuits by settlement listers against Airbnb in U.S. courts.  Waleed Assraf, head of a Palestinian anti-settlement group run by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation, welcomed Airbnb’s decision. Should other companies follow suit, he told Reuters, “this will contribute to achieving peace”. Oded Revivi, mayor of the West Bank settlement of Efrat and a representative of the umbrella settler council Yesha, said Airbnb’s decision was contrary to the company’s stated mission of helping “to bring people together in as many places as possible around the world”. “When they make such a decision, they get involved with politics, which ... is going to defeat the actual purpose of the enterprise itself,” Revivi told Reuters Human Rights Watch said the Airbnb move came on the eve of its publication of a 65-page report it has carried out into tourist rental listings in settlements, including by Airbnb.  “Airbnb’s decision to end its listings in Israeli settlements is an important recognition that such listings can’t square with its human rights responsibilities,” the group said on Monday. “We urge other companies to follow suit.” The group said its report would be released on Tuesday morning. Some 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that are also home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.  Israel considers the West Bank, the biblical cradle of Judaism, as a security bulwark to the east. Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. U.S.-sponsored peace talks have been stalled since 2014. San Francisco-basked Airbnb is eyeing an IPO next year after announcing in February it would not make a public debut this year.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Sotheby’s held its first auction for watches in Dubai on Monday, fetching a total of $2.6 million with 121 lots. “This region has been growing for the last five to ten years and an increasing number of the world’s biggest collectors are here,” said Sam Hines, worldwide head of watches at Sotheby’s and the night’s auctioneer. Auction house Christie’s held an auction for watches in Dubai in March. Monday night’s top seller was a Chopard wristwatch set in white gold, diamond and sapphire which was sold for more than $200,000. “Prices used to be a bit silly,” said a Dubai-based prospective buyer, noting other auctions suffered from excess hype.

The BoE said the Financial Stability Report (FSR) and the full results of the Bank’s annual stress test of major UK banks would be published on Nov. 28 rather than Dec. 5. The BoE said it would fulfil a request from parliament’s Treasury Committee to provide analysis of how the draft Brexit divorce deal “will affect the Bank’s ability to deliver its statutory remits for monetary and financial stability, including in a ‘no deal, no transition’ scenario.” The committee had requested this analysis be concluded in good time before parliament votes on a deal.

2019-02-08,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that claims, including by the CIA, that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave the order to kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi were false, according to an Arabic-language newspaper interview. News outlets, including Reuters, reported the CIA’s finding over the weekend in a case that has sparked an international outcry against the world’s top oil exporter. This was the most definitive U.S. assessment to date tying Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler directly to the killing and contradicted Saudi government assertions that he was not involved. “We in the kingdom know that such allegations about the crown prince have no basis in truth and we categorically reject them, whether through leaks or not,” Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir was quoted as saying in Saudi-owned Al Sharq Al Awsat newspaper in the first Saudi official comment on the CIA report. “They are leaks that have not been officially announced, and I have noticed that they are based on an assessment, not conclusive evidence,” he added. A source familiar with the CIA’s assessment said it was based largely on circumstantial evidence relating to the prince’s central role in running the Saudi government. Jubeir was also asked about comments by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan that the kill order came from the highest level of the Saudi leadership but probably not King Salman, which has put the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince. “We have already asked the Turkish authorities at the highest level about the meaning of these comments, and they confirmed to us categorically that the crown prince is not meant by these comments,” he said. “The leadership of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques (the king) and the crown prince, is a red line, and we will not permit attempts to harm or undermine them,” he added. Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and one-time royal insider who had been critical of the crown prince recently, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Last week, after offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when “negotiations” to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.

2019-02-08,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The whistleblower who revealed alleged money laundering involving Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) said on Monday that a major European bank helped process up to $150 billion in suspicious payments, or nearly two-thirds of the transactions under scrutiny. Howard Wilkinson, who was head of Danske Bank’s trading unit in the Baltics from 2007 to 2014, did not name the bank, but a source with direct knowledge of the case said he was referring to Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which was one of the lenders clearing dollar transactions for Danske’s Estonian branch. A Deutsche Bank spokesman confirmed in a statement to Reuters the lender acted as a correspondent bank for Danske in Estonia.  “Our role was to process payments for Danske Bank. We terminated the relationship in 2015 after identifying suspicious activity,” the spokesman said.  Wilkinson said two U.S. banks were also involved in handling dollar payments for Danske in Estonia, without identifying them. Alongside Deutsche, JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N) cleared dollar transactions for Danske’s Estonian branch, sources have told Reuters. JPMorgan ended the correspondent banking relationship with Danske in 2013 on grounds that transactions did not comply with anti-money laundering rules, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bank of America declined to comment. Authorities in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States are investigating payments totalling 200 billion euros ($228.5 billion) made through Danske Bank’s tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 in a growing global scandal. “I would guess that $150 billion went through this particular bank (the large European bank) in the U.S.,” the Briton told a Danish parliamentary hearing. “No one really knows where this money went. All we know is that the last people to see it was these three large banks in the U.S. They were the last check, and when that failed, the money was into the global financial system,” Wilkinson said. Interim CEO Jesper Nielsen said the affair had tarnished the reputation of Danske Bank. “We have breached the expectations society had of us. The case and the course of events around it does not reflect the bank we want to be,” Nielsen told the Danish lawmakers after Wilkinson’s testimony. Wilkinson said that he had been offered cash by Danske Bank not to speak out, but had got a waiver last month allowing him to talk to some U.S. authorities, adding that he did not expect investigations into the “dirty money” to bear fruit. “There is no chance in the world ... that any of that money is ever going to be tracked down and that any criminals lose a single cent,” he said.  Danske Bank has acknowledged that its money laundering controls in Estonia were insufficient, but in a report issued in September said its board, chairman and chief executive had not breached their legal obligations. “In April 2014 it became clear that the bank didn’t intend to do anything,” the former Danske Bank employee said, referring to earlier whistleblower reports. “There was a curious lack of interest at senior management level.” Wilkinson said that at the start of January 2014 he had looked at the three most profitable accounts involving British limited liability partnerships (LLPs). “They were all fake. Not just that, they all basically looked the same. And it turned out they all had the same registered office in a suburb in North London ... I passed those on. By April none of the accounts ... had been closed down.”  “I warned them (Danske) that if they didn’t do a proper investigation and make the appropriate report to the police, then I was going to do it myself,” Wilkinson said.  In September this year Danske Bank said the first whistleblower report, which was titled “Whistleblowing disclosure – knowingly dealing with criminals in Estonia Branch”, was sent to its executive board, group compliance and internal auditor at the end of December 2013. However, the bank’s report concluded that no “red flags” were shared with ex-CEO Thomas Borgen when he held ultimate executive responsibility for Estonia from 2009 to 2012.  Borgen stepped down as CEO following the September report, saying that although he was “cleared from a legal point of view” he held “the ultimate responsibility”.  The scandal has emerged at the same time as a major government tax scandal and a fraud case in the Danish ministry for social affairs, undermining confidence in once trusted institutions and sparking calls for action from lawmakers. Wilkinson said that Denmark’s FSA financial regulator, which was not immediately available for comment, did not contact him before issuing a report on the allegations in May 2018 and called for Danish authorities to investigate the FSA’s role. “If Howard Wilkinson is correct in that he can’t talk to the Danish authorities without being prosecuted that must obviously be changed. Authorities should investigate the case thoroughly and they can only do that if they can get the information,” Danish business minister Rasmus Jarlov said on Twitter. The FSA said in May it had not found sufficient basis for launching cases against members of Danske Bank’s management.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has cut production orders in recent weeks for all three iPhone models launched in September, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing sources. A lower-than-expected demand for the new iPhones and Apple's decision to offer more models has made it difficult to anticipate the number of components and handsets the company needs, according to the WSJ report here Apple shocked investors a few weeks ago with a sales forecast for the Christmas quarter below Wall Street expectations, prompting certain suppliers to issue warnings that pointed to weakness in new iPhone sales. Screen maker Japan Display Inc (6740.T) cut its full-year outlook citing weaker smartphone demand, while British chipmaker IQE Plc (IQE.L) said it expects a material reduction in its financial performance in the current year. Lumentum Holdings Inc (LITE.O), AMS AG (AMS.S), companies which supply Apple with software needed for its FaceID technology, also lowered their forecasts. Another supplier Analog Devices Inc (ADI.O) is expected to report fourth-quarter results before markets open on Tuesday. Apple shares were down 3.7 percent at $186.38 on Monday, while Lumentum, Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) and Qorvo Inc (QRVO.O) were down between 2.7 to 6 percent. Forecasts have been particularly problematic for iPhone XR with Apple cutting its production plan by up to a third of the nearly 70 million units some suppliers had been asked to produce between September and February, WSJ reported. As recently as last week, Apple informed several suppliers that it had lowered its production plan again for iPhone XR, the Journal said. The company started selling its latest generation of phones, the iPhone XS and XS Max, in September and the XR model in October. Analysts at Cowen & Co expect a modest hit from iPhone production cuts on memory chipmakers like Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) and Micron Technology Inc (MU.O). The brokerage forecast a 10 cent headwind to Micron and 15 cent headwind to Western Digital in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 on lower iPhone builds. Micron’s shares were down 3.4 percent while Western Digital was down 1.7 percent. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu did not request a U.N. inquiry into the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi when he met with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, a U.N. spokesman said, though they did discuss the case. “They discussed Yemen, Syria, Cyprus, as well as the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. On a possible U.N. inquiry into Khashoggi, he added: “We have not received any formal request from the Turkish side.” Khashoggi, a U.S.-based Washington Post columnist who was a critic of the Saudi government run by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in October at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  As Cavusoglu left the United Nations after meeting Guterres he was asked if he requested an international investigation. “We discussed all the aspects of this,” he said. After offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, Riyadh said last week he had been killed and his body dismembered when “negotiations” to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. The public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five suspects in the case.  The CIA believes the Saudi prince ordered the killing of Khashoggi, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, complicating U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to preserve ties with a key ally. Four prominent western rights groups - Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders - last month urged Turkey to ask the United Nations to investigate the disappearance of Khashoggi. They say a precedent was set for such a move in 2008 when Pakistan asked then U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to establish an international inquiry into the assassination of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  Ban consulted Pakistani officials and members of the U.N. Security Council. He then notified the 15-member council in 2009 of his intention to establish an inquiry and was given informal approval by the body to do so in a letter. “The Secretary General does not have the authority to do it (an investigation) without a mandate given to him by a legislative body,” U.N. spokesman Dujarric said on Friday, citing as examples the Security Council or the Geneva-based U.N. Human Rights Council. Dujarric said that if a country made a formal request for an inquiry into Khashoggi’s death “we would obviously have to study the content of that letter.” Reporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-khashoggi-un/turkey-talks-khashoggi-with-u-n-chief-no-inquiry-request-u-n-idUKKCN1NO23B,2019-02-08,,"Turkey talks Khashoggi with U.N. chief, no inquiry request - U.N."
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK shares eased slightly on Monday but outperformed Europe as relative calm returned after last week’s tumult and Prime Minister Theresa May continued to fight for support for her Brexit deal.   The FTSE 100 .FTSE fell 0.2 percent, giving up opening gains, but strength in the financial and mining sectors helped the index outperform a 0.7 percent slide in Europe STOXX. “Things are a bit calmer and there’s not been anything particularly exciting bearing in mind that end of last week,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. A rout in Renault shares after its chief executive Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Japan on suspicion of under-reporting his salary cast a pall over France’s CAC 40. With the earnings season drawing to a close, UK investors focussed on politics as May vowed to fight on to gather support for her draft European Union divorce deal as dissenters in her own party scrambled to trigger a leadership challenge. “May might have overcome the issue of no confidence vote and that adds an element of certainty and may mean we’re looking at a deal rather than a no deal and businesses like certainty,” said van Dulken. Banking and retail stocks recovered some of the ground lost during last week’s sell-off, with Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) up 2.4 percent and Kingfisher (KGF.L) up 0.9 percent. Miners .FTNMX1770 also provided support, adding 0.6 percent.    But the gains were more than offset by a slump in energy shares as the session drew to a close, as several investors remained cautious over the outlook for Brexit.      “Some of the stocks that were brutalised the most haven’t really bounced, so there’s no big UK relief if you look at what’s happening on the FTSE today,” said Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton. Housebuilders continued to get bulldozed after data from real estate website RightMove showed UK house prices in October fell year on year for the first time since 2011.  Barratt Development (BDEV.L) and Persimmon (PSN.L) were down 2.2 percent and 1 percent respectively.  Last week, the sector was one of the hardest hit by the chaos over Brexit with investors worrying about the impact of a possible second referendum, general election or hard Brexit on the British economy.  Among the midcaps, Diploma (DPLM.L) jumped 4.2 percent to the top of the board as investors cheered better-than-expected full-year results.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bruised by uncertainty about Brexit, British businesses are now more pessimistic about the outlook than at any time since at least 2009, a survey showed on Monday. Plans for hiring and investment across both manufacturing and services firms sagged, according to a quarterly report from data firm IHS Markit, which also compiles the closely watched purchasing managers’ indexes. The survey, conducted over the second half of October, showed firms cited political uncertainty as the biggest factor weighing on confidence. Prime Minister Theresa May last week published a draft divorce deal with the European Union that has drawn the ire of eurosceptics in her party, raising questions about her future as leader and sending the pound sharply lower. The net balance of companies expecting business activity to rise in the next 12 months fell to 32 percent from 39 percent in the previous survey, marking the lowest reading since the IHS Markit Business Outlook Survey started in 2009. “Reports from survey respondents widely indicate that Brexit-related concerns have weighed heavily on business investment and staff hiring plans,” IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said. “Some of the slowdown in capex plans can be attributed to softer global demand patterns, but the latest UK figure is notably weaker than seen elsewhere across Europe and in other developed economies.” Other business surveys have also shown a sharp slowdown in business investment plans ahead of Brexit in March 2019.

2019-02-08,"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s plans to tackle the Rohingya refugee crisis are set to be stalled until the new year with repatriation and relocation programmes only likely be revisited after year-end general elections, a top Bangladeshi official said on Sunday. Abul Kalam, Bangladesh’s refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, told Reuters “a new course of action” needed to be adopted on repatriation that took into account refugees’ key demands. He later clarified these were his own personal views and not those of the government. More than 720,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state in 2017, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to insurgent Rohingya attacks on security forces. Rohingya refugees say soldiers and Buddhist civilians killed families, burned many villages and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused Myanmar’s army of “genocidal intent” and ethnic cleansing. Myanmar has denied almost all the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against “terrorists”. In late October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to begin to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled, but the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and the U.N. refugee agency and aid groups, who fear for the safety of Rohingya in Myanmar.   The repatriation of the first batch of 2,200 refugees was to begin officially on Nov. 15, but it stalled amid protests at the refugee camps. None of those on the list agreed to return if  their demands for justice, citizenship and the ability to go back to their original villages and lands were not met. “I don’t think anyone’s agreeing to go back without these,” said Kalam, who last week called on the international community to pressure Myanmar to accept certain “logical and acceptable” demands in order for any repatriation to take place. Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group and calls them “Bengalis”, suggesting they belong in Bangladesh. It has agreed to take the Rohingya back and said they would need to accept the National Verification Card, which it says would allow Rohingya to apply for citizenship. The Rohingya reject the card, saying it brands them foreigners. Kalam said he believed Myanmar needed to propose a “clearer path” to citizenship for the Rohingya if any returns were to take place, adding he would raise the matter at the next bilateral meeting on repatriation, likely to take place next month. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not reachable on Sunday for comment.  With Bangladesh now set to go to the polls on Dec. 30, any decision either to repatriate people, or relocate refugees from the crowded camps to Bangladesh’s Bhasan Char island will not proceed until 2019, Kalam said, adding later a final decision had not been taken and it would be the government’s call. “Elections are coming up now, so the government will only finalise a future course of action after the elections,” said Kalam.  Bangladesh has vowed not to force anyone to return and has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure those short-listed to return really want to go back. A UNHCR spokesman said it was not clear when repatriations could begin. “At this moment it’s unclear, perhaps we can get clarity in the next few days.” Some Rohingya refugee leaders in Bangladesh said they were relieved Bangladesh had not forced refugees to return and called for the repatriation plan to be revised.  Kalam said construction work on alternative housing on Bhasan Char was “nearly complete.” He said he was hopeful some refugees would agree to move, given the island’s “livelihood opportunities” such as fishing and farming. Aid agencies express caution as the island is prone to flooding.    “The possibility of refugees being relocated to the island until elections are over is slim,” Kalam later added.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp (PCG.N), facing investor concerns over its possible role in the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California, has reported another power-line outage that it experienced on the morning of Nov. 8 when the blaze started. The incident report, which was filed on Friday with the safety division of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), said a line near the area of Concow in Butte County suffered an outage at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8. The information in the report is preliminary, according to a spokesman for PG&E, who said the company was cooperating with any investigations. The utility has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire. The cause of the blaze, which was 60 percent contained on Sunday, is under investigation. In a previous regulatory report, PG&E, which operates in the northern part of California, said it experienced an outage on a transmission line on the morning of Nov. 8 near the town of Pulga, near where the fire is thought to have started. Authorities were still searching for signs of the 1,276 people listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise. The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far in what is considered the state’s deadliest-ever wildfire. A CPUC spokesman confirmed that the agency received the second report on Friday, and said the incident would be incorporated into its investigation “to assess the compliance of electric facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted areas.” Investors are watching for clues about whether California’s government will step in to save PG&E should it eventually be found responsible for the fire and should any potential liability exceed the utility’s resources. CPUC President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. Similar comments from Picker a day earlier caused PG&E’s stock to surge in after-hours trading. The company’s stock had slumped more than 60 percent since the wildfire broke out, on fears that without help from California’s government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Germany’s Alexander Zverev described his ATP Finals title as “astonishing” on Sunday after beating Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in consecutive days without losing a set. Just as against Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer in Saturday’s semi-final, the 21-year-old produced a dashing display of power and guile to stun the in-form Djokovic 6-4 6-3. Not only did he become the youngest winner of the title since Djokovic 10 years ago, and the first German to triumph since Boris Becker in 1995, Zverev also became only the fourth player to beat Federer and Djokovic back-to-back in the semi-final and final of the same tournament. Rafael Nadal has managed it three times, Andy Murray once and David Nalbandian is the other. “Obviously it’s quite astonishing, winning this title, beating two such players back-to-back, Roger and Novak, in semi-finals and finals. (It) Means so much,” Zverev told reporters. “I’m incredibly happy and incredibly proud right now.” Djokovic had schooled Zverev 6-4 6-1 on Wednesday in the round-robin stage, but following his victory over Federer, after which he was booed by fans over a controversial point in the second-set tiebreak, the German was a different proposition. Zverev said the loss to Djokovic had prompted a different approach, following a discussion with coach Ivan Lendl — the eight-times Grand Slam champion who helped Britain’s Murray to multiple major titles. “He obviously analysed the match that I played with him a few days ago, told me a few things I had to do different. I was more aggressive today,” Zverev, who will end the year ranked fourth in the ATP rankings, said. After this statement victory, Zverev’s next task will be to go past the quarter-final of a Grand Slam for the first time. Told that Djokovic had predicted he could surpass his own achievements, including 14 Grand Slam titles, Zverev was quick to urge some perspective. “Oh, Jesus. Oh, my God!” Zverev said. “I mean, I’ve won one of these. He’s won five. He’s won, I don’t know what, 148 titles more than me. Let’s not go there for now.” After a couple of years finding his feet and learning to deal with huge expectation levels, however, Zverev’s Tour-leading 58 match wins this year is proof of a more mature attitude, and a greater level of consistency. “I will do everything I can to get better, to compete with them always. I feel like I’m doing that,” Zverev said. With Russian Karen Khachanov, who beat Djokovic to win the Paris Masters, and Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas also making huge strides, including a win over Djokovic, Zverev believes the new generation are starting to make inroads. “Obviously us young guys, we’re coming through,” he said. “We’ve still got multiple years for all of us ahead.

2019-02-08,"PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - Spin duo Moeen Ali and Jack Leach combined to end England’s 17-year wait for a test series victory in Sri Lanka after bowling the tourists to a 57-run victory in the second test on Sunday. Moeen struck twice in three deliveries and Leach completed his maiden five-wicket haul as the tourists took a little over 30 minutes on the final morning to seal victory and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-test series. Sri Lanka resumed on 226 for seven, needing 75 to keep the series alive after their opening loss in Galle, but were all out for 243 as England completed their first away series win in tests since beating South Africa at the beginning of 2016. The England side led by Nasser Hussain were the last to register a series victory in Sri Lanka in 2001 and Joe Root’s men arrived in the country winless in their last 13 tests away from home. Their last series victory in Asia was in India six years ago and not many would have bet on England to win with a match to spare against Sri Lanka, who defeated South Africa 2-0 at home in July. “We said we are going to come out here and play bold cricket, we were quite courageous at times and everyone’s really bought into that. We are seeing the rewards now,” Root said at the post-match presentation. “We have to keep looking to improve. We have seen this team grow in the last six-eight months. We are not the finished article, we want to get to number one at some point. “We have to be consistent to do that, in all parts of the world and on different surfaces.” For the first time in a test match, spinners claimed 38 wickets with Leach and Moeen sharing 14 between them on a turning track at Pallekele. Sri Lanka’s stand-in captain Lakmal was the only quick to pick up a wicket while the other was a run out. It was also the first time since 1973 in Karachi that no seamer took a wicket in a test for England. When play resumed on Sunday, Sri Lanka’s hopes of squaring the series rested entirely on wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella, who was unbeaten on 27 overnight. The hosts managed to keep the England spinners at bay for 15 minutes while picking up singles to advance towards their target but Moeen broke their resistance by dismissing Dickwella, who was caught at slip by Stokes for 35. The off-spinner then sent back Lakmal for a duck two deliveries later before Malinda Pushpakumara spooned a catch straight back to left-arm spinner Leach. “It was a brilliant test match,” said Root, who was named player of the match for his brilliant 124 in the second innings. “We were very good for the whole game. At times we were under pressure and we responded really well to that. (I) couldn’t be more proud of the guys.” Sri Lanka batted well in both innings but Sam Curran’s counter-attacking 64 in the first innings and Root’s century under pressure in the second made the difference for England. “Sri Lanka played brilliantly in both innings,” added Root, after registering his first away series victory as captain. “At times we lost clusters of wickets but we stayed very calm and managed to find ways to get back in the game and get the control back in our favour.” The third and final test of the series will start on Friday in Colombo.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Thousands of French protesters hit out at higher fuel taxes and President Emmanuel Macron’s economic policies in demonstrations across motorways on Saturday, sparking major logjams and several accidents, including a fatality at one road blockade.  Dozens of people were also injured, as drivers tried to get around stoppages, after protestors in a grassroots protest movement dubbed the “yellow vests” took to motorway sliproads, tunnel entrances or airport access roads.      The demonstrations, coordinated on social media, were born out of a backlash against higher fuel prices, and echo complaints about a perceived squeeze in spending power and mounting dissatisfaction with Macron, who some view as out of touch with ordinary people. At a blockade in the southeastern department of Savoie, a driver panicked when protesters surrounded her car and she accelerated, hitting and killing a female demonstrator, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. At least 227 people were injured across France, including six seriously, according to the interior ministry, which estimated that nearly 283,000 demonstrators took part in Saturday’s protests. A policeman also sustained serious injuries.  By early evening, 73 people had been taken into custody, and some demonstrators were still in place at nightfall.  Police used tear gas to clear the entrance to a tunnel under the Mont-Blanc mountain in the Alps, and to push back demonstrators near the Elysee Palace in Paris and in the centre of Lyon.  Protestors chanted “Macron, resign” and some sported slogans such as “give us back our purchasing power” on the back of the yellow high-visibility vests, which have come to symbolise the movement. “There are just too many taxes in France,” said Veronique Lestrade, a demonstrator on the outskirts of Paris, who said her family was struggling to make ends meet. In 18 months in power, Macron has seen off trade unions and street demonstrations as he loosened labour laws and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator SNCF in a bid to reboot the economy.  Derided by political opponents as “the president of the rich” for measures such as the end of a wealth tax, Macron’s popularity has dwindled to new lows of 21 percent. Tax hikes on fuel and tobacco as well as an increase to a social welfare levy before other tax cuts came into force have left some voters feeling squeezed.  The diesel tax increases, designed to encourage drivers to switch to more environmentally-friendly cars, were approved in late 2017 but began to bite when oil prices surged in October, angering some in the provinces who rely on their cars to get to work.  Ministers announced funds last Wednesday to help motorists on the lowest incomes, even if Macron is standing firm on his fuel policy.    Prices have eased this month, although protestors on Saturday had other complaints too, as Macron’s next test at the ballot box in European parliamentary elections in May 2019 looms.  “I happily voted for Macron in 2017, but he’s really making fun of us,” said Dominique Jouvert, 63, a retired civil servant demonstrating in Lyon. “There’s no discussion to be had with him, no dialogue, he’s arrogant. “What’s certain is that I won’t vote for him again.” Reporting by Sarah White, Caroline Pailliez, Yves Clarisse, Catherine Lagrange, Reuters TV; Editing by Gareth Jones and Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-politics-fuel-blockades/french-protesters-rail-against-macrons-fuel-taxes-with-road-blocks-idUKKCN1NM0B2,2019-02-08,,French protesters rail against Macron's fuel taxes with road blocks
2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran and Iraq could raise their annual bilateral trade to $20 billion from the current $12 billion, President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday, despite concerns over the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions. Rouhani’s remarks, after a meeting with visiting Iraqi President Barham Salih, came two weeks after the United States restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil industry as well as its banking and transportation sectors.  “... through bilateral efforts, we can raise this figure (for bilateral trade) to $20 billion in the near future,” Rouhani said in comments broadcast live on state television. “We held talks on trade in electricity, gas, petroleum products and activities ... in the field of oil exploration and extraction,” Rouhani said.  Baghdad is seeking U.S. approval to allow it to import Iranian gas for its power stations. Iraqi officials say they need more time to find an alternative source than a 45-day waiver granted to it by the United States.   “It will be important to create free trade zones at our shared border and to connect the two countries’ railways,” Salih said. “We will not forget your support for the Iraqi people in the fight against (Iraqi dictator) Saddam (Hussein). Neither do we forget Iran’s stand in the recent fight against terrorism,” added Salih, an Iraqi Kurd. Salih later met Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who called for maintaining unity among ethnic and religious groups in Iraq and resisting foreign interference.  “The only way to counter plots (by Iraq’s enemies) is by strengthening the unity of all Iraqi groups, including Kurds, Arabs, Shi’ite and Sunnis,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to his website. “Some governments in the region and outside of it hold a deep grudge against Islam ... and Iraq, and interfere in Iraq’s internal affairs and they must be strongly resisted,” he said. Iran accuses the United States and its regional rival Saudi Arabia of exploiting divisions among Shi’ite and Sunni Muslims. Washington and Riyadh denounce Iran as fuelling conflicts in countries including Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. “We seek to boost cooperation (with Iran) at all levels ... in order to serve the interests of both countries,” the website quoted Salih as saying.  Iran wields wide influence in Iraq, its smaller neighbor, where its Revolutionary Guards played a key role in training and arming the mainly Shi’ite militias that helped defeat Islamic State.  Iraq imports a wide range of goods from Iran, including food, agricultural products, home appliances, air conditioners and car parts. Iranian goods imports to Iraq were worth about $6 billion in the year ending March 2018, or about 15 percent of Iraq’s total imports for 2017. Iraqi officials told Reuters last week that Iraq had agreed to sell foodstuffs in return for Iranian gas and energy supplies. Iranian trade officials denied that any food-for-gas scheme could be set up as Iran was a net exporter of food to Iraq. “We have exported more than $6 billion to Iraq in the past seven months and we could import goods for that amount but not food items,” Yahya Al-e Eshaq, head of the Iran-Iraq chamber of commerce, was quoted as saying by the ILNA news agency. A spokesman for an association of Iranian gas and petrochemicals exporters said Iraq wanted to pay for the gas imports in its dinar currency, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.

2019-02-08,"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Thousands of people displaced by California’s most destructive wildfire, including hundreds living in tents and cars, face heavy rains next week that could trigger dangerous floods and mudslides, while helping douse the flames. At least 300 people who fled the Camp Fire were sheltering on Friday in the flood-prone parking lot of a Walmart in Chico, about 15 miles (24 km) west of where the blaze consumed the mountain town of Paradise on Nov. 8. More than 1,000 are missing, according to police. The remains of at least 71 people have been identified so far. A rain storm is forecast to hit next week and so authorities are asking people to leave the Walmart lot by Sunday afternoon, said Bryan May, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Hillsides that have been scorched by a wildfire are at risk for mudslides when it rains, experts say. The flames burn away vegetation that holds the soil in place and bake a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking more than a few inches into the ground. Authorities say they have enough shelter space to provide a bed for everyone who wants one, but they acknowledge challenges ahead in finding more long-term housing for the displaced. May said it was not clear exactly how many people are in need of housing, but at the height of the Camp Fire authorities had ordered more than 52,000 people to evacuate. A survey found only 100 housing units available for rent in all of Butte County, where the fire has been burning, May said.  Already, more than 1,100 people are bunking at shelters in the area, according to the Red Cross, and countless more are staying with friends and family. The fire forced caregiver Robin Tompkins, 43, and her family from their home in the town of Magalia, north of Paradise. Friends let them stay for a week, but now the family needs to find other accommodation, she said at an evacuee relief station in the Chico Walmart parking lot.  Her husband Timothy, who works as a cook at a Chico cafe, was frustrated by the lack of information about how long he might be kept from returning to Magalia. “I keep hearing different things: a month, four months, a year. We just want to get home,” he said. Randy Greb, 61, was camping in a tent in the parking lot after his home in Paradise was destroyed. “I lost everything. I’ve got the clothes I got, but people have been nice and really helping us,” Greb said. “Everybody has been doing their best.” The Walmart tent village is the largest of several outdoor encampments of refugees from the Camp Fire. Some displaced people prefer to remain outdoors because they want to stay with their pets, which many shelters say they cannot accept, or are concerned about losing their privacy, May said.  But authorities are encouraging them to camp near a shelter so they can access services for hygiene and other needs, such as free diapers and Clorox wipes. Given the shortage of suitable housing, attention has turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  It has said that it is working with state and local officials to evaluate options, and is considering using travel trailers to house some of the displaced. Last year, after a deadly wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Santa Rosa, FEMA trailers were used to house some of the displaced. Among the thousands who have applied for help from FEMA is Linda Harned, 63, a retired caregiver who lost the home that she shared with her husband and several relatives in Magalia.  “I’m depressed and upset,” Harned said at the relief station outside the Walmart in Chico. “It’s hard. I never knew how much I loved my house.” Reporting by Terray Sylvester; Additional reporting and writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Nick Zieminski",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-california-wildfires-shelter/rain-storms-could-bring-more-misery-for-california-fire-evacuees-idUKKCN1NM0H6,2019-02-08,,Rain storms could bring more misery for California fire evacuees
2019-02-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in Norwegian cities on Saturday against restricting women’s access to abortion, the subject of talks between the ruling minority coalition and a small party seeking to join the government. In Norway’s capital Oslo, the demonstrators, some pushing children in strollers, marched through the city centre carrying banners with slogans such as “My body my right” and “Defend abortion”. “The new law that’s proposed is limiting women’s rights,” said Ine Lund, a 22-year-old criminology student. “I feel it should be up to the woman to choose.”  When the Christian Democrats opened talks on teaming up with the opposition Labour Party to bring down the Conservative-led government, Prime Minister Erna Solberg intervened, offering to discuss tightening abortion rules. The argument helped persuade rank-and-file members of the socially conservative, Lutheran-based party to vote for talks to join the ruling coalition, potentially securing Solberg a majority in parliament until the next election in 2021. The Christian Democrats want further restrictions or an end to terminations after the twelfth week of pregnancy, potentially reining in exemptions for genetic conditions or injuries. The party also wants to make it more difficult, or stop altogether, selective abortions in multi-foetal pregnancies. “It is discriminating to select on the basis of having different skills ... Children with Down syndrome should have the same legal rights as other children,” Kjell Ingolf Ropstad, deputy leader of the Christian Democrats, told public broadcaster NRK earlier this month. Since 1978, a termination after 12 weeks must be authorised by a panel of two hospital doctors. If the panel refuses, the decision can be appealed. In an effort to quell a backlash within her own party, as well as from the opposition, Solberg said any changes to the abortion law would not undermine women’s rights. “In practice this will mean that, in future, women who seek an abortion after the twelfth week of pregnancy will as much as before have the right to have an abortion,” she told parliament on Wednesday. Some 68 percent of Norwegians are against changing the abortion law, while 16 percent are in favour, according to a poll published in daily VG on Nov. 9. The phone survey by Respons Analyse polled 1,000 participants aged 18 and over.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea’s leader witnessed the test of a newly developed high-tech weapon, the country’s state media reported on Friday, while Pyongyang also released a U.S. prisoner, sending conflicting signals at a time of sensitive negotiations. Kim Jong Un’s visit to the test site of what North Korea’s state media called a “tactical weapon” that could protect North Korea like a “steel wall” threatened to sour the diplomatic atmosphere at a time when negotiations between North Korea and the United States appear to have stalled.  However, the U.S. State Department sought to play down the development, suggesting it would not derail efforts to persuade North Korea to give up a nuclear weapons programme that has the potential to threaten the United States. “We remain confident that the promises made by President Trump and Chairman Kim will be fulfilled,” a spokesman for the  U.S. State Department said. At an unprecedented summit in June, U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in Singapore agreed to work toward denuclearisation and peace on the Korean peninsula and establish new relations. But the agreement was short on specifics, and negotiations have made little headway since. North Korea’s KCNA news agency did not identify the weapon tested but called the test a success. The only picture released by state media showed Kim standing on a beach surrounded by officials in military uniforms with no weapons visible. The description of the weapon as “tactical” appeared to rule out larger strategic weapons, such as a ballistic missile or a nuclear bomb, which North Korea demonstrated until last year, raising fears of a new Korean war. But testing of any new weapon threatens to raise tensions with Washington, which has upset Pyongyang by repeatedly stressing that international sanctions must remain in place until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons. A source familiar with U.S. assessments said the United States was still evaluating the test, but was not particularly alarmed. The source said the announcement was low key by North Korean standards, suggesting that Kim did not want to stir things up too much, even while delivering a warning. In an apparently conciliatory gesture, North Korea also announced on Friday it was releasing an American citizen detained since October after he “illegally” entered North Korea from China. Pyongyang identified the man as Bruce Byron Lowrance. The State Department declined to identify the citizen and did not provide details about him. But in a statement on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has led the U.S. negotiating effort with North Korea, thanked North Korea and Sweden for cooperating to secure the release. North Korea has held previous American detainees for longer,  and Washington has accused Pyongyang of using them as bargaining chips. Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists saw the test announcement as a warning to Washington. “They’re trying to signal that they are willing to walk away from talks and restart weapons testing,” he said. “It is the most explicit in a series of escalating statements designed to send this message.” Kim this year declared his nuclear force “complete” and said he would focus on economic development. But North Korea has increasingly expressed frustration at Washington’s refusal to ease sanctions and recently threatened to restart development of its nuclear weapons if more concessions were not made. A meeting in New York planned this month between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and North Korea’s Kim Yong Chol, a senior aide to Kim, was postponed. However, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday said Trump planned to meet Kim again in 2019 and will push for a concrete plan outlining Pyongyang’s moves to end its arms programs.  Choi Kang, of Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said Friday’s announcement was more likely aimed at reassuring the North Korean military rather than trying to torpedo diplomatic talks. “North Korea is trying to show its soldiers that they are becoming high-tech and keeping a certain level of military capability, while trying to eliminate dissatisfaction and worries inside its military,” he said. The test may also have been a response to recent small-scale  military drills by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang said violated recent pacts to halt “all hostile acts.” said Yang Uk of the Korea Defence and Security Forum. Kim said the weapons system tested was one that his father, Kim Jong Il, had taken a special interest in during his life, personally leading its development. International weapons experts noted the officials with Kim included a leader of North Korea’s artillery corps. Kim’s last publicized military inspection was the launch of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile a year ago, though he engaged in at least eight other military related activities this year, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said. While it has conducted no nuclear or missile tests since last year, North Korea has continued to showcase its conventional military capabilities, including at a large military parade in its capital, Pyongyang, on Sept. 9.

2019-02-08,"OXFORD, England (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former political strategist, Steve Bannon, said on Friday that the European Union was trying to thwart Brexit. Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing Breitbart.com website and an architect of Trump’s 2016 election win, has set up a movement to elect right-wing nationalist and populist members in European Parliament elections next May. The EU’s elites, he said, did not want Brexit. “You see what’s happened. They have no intention of letting you guys leave - none. Zero,” Bannon said at the Oxford Union debating society, though he gave no evidence other than saying the EU had made the divorce negotiation difficult. “They’ve made it as hard as possible, they will continue to make it as hard as possible,” Bannon said. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. In the June 23, 2016 EU referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc. EU leaders have repeatedly said they are saddened by the UK’s decision to leave and that they will respect the decision.  British Prime Minister Theresa May struck a divorce deal with the EU this week, though opponents in her divided party are trying to topple her because they think the deal would keep the UK too close to the EU after Brexit. Bannon faced several hundred protesters in Oxford who accused him of being a racist. Police officers eventually escorted the 64-year-old into the Oxford University society’s historic debating chamber through a back entrance.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Rose Farrell was an independent-minded 99-year-old determined to live by herself in Paradise, California. A caregiver checked on her daily and she relied on a walker, but still had her car in her driveway. Since the “Camp Fire” swept rapidly into Paradise, which sits atop a ridge 1,700 feet above a canyon cut by the Feather River, Farrell’s family has been unable to reach her. “The hardest part is just waiting to know what happened,” said Tom Perez, 58, the husband of Farrell’s granddaughter. California’s deadliest wildfire roared into the town of 27,000 last week, speeding seven miles in 90 minutes and leaving residents little time to flee. Some died in their cars in a chaotic evacuation as gridlock snarled up the two exits out of town. Farrell is one of 630 people listed as missing, while the death toll has climbed to 63. The number of those unaccounted for has fluctuated wildly and officials warn it will almost certainly change.  Over the weekend, the Butte County Sheriff’s office initially put the total of missing people at 228, many of whom were later accounted for. But as fresh reports from relatives came in, the list grew from 103 to 130 late Wednesday, jumped to 297 by Thursday morning and soared to 630 as of Thursday night.  In some cases, people may have survived but not yet notified the authorities, or relatives may not yet have reported people missing. Poor cell phone coverage after the fire has exacerbated the problem, in a mountainous region where some areas got little or no phone reception even before the fire. “We still have reports coming in of people being missing and of people being found,” said Miranda Bowersox, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office. “The overall number will go down, but in the short term we expect to see new reports of people missing.” Paradise was home to many retirees, like Donna Duncan-Austin, 90, who used a walker to get around. Her husband Angello Austin, 87, was more physically active and worked as a baker and a handyman, Donna’s niece Andrea Evans told Reuters by phone. “They were deeply, deeply in love,” Evans said.  Donna was heavily involved with her church, but no one there has heard from her, Evans said.  “That’s why I brace myself,” she said. At least 90 percent of those on a list of the missing provided by the Butte County Sheriff’s office on Wednesday were aged over 60. Relatives say some of them are disabled or have limited mobility. Bill Mount, 62, is one of them. His niece Jaime Daugherty said her brother urgently knocked on Mount’s door just after 6 a.m. on the day of the fire and got no response.  Mount’s house burned to the ground. One of the dozen or so coroner’s teams dispatched to the calamity from around California along with cadaver dogs, was supposed to search the site on Thursday, she said. “I called every hospital, every shelter,” Daugherty said, and was told they had no one by that name listed there. Forensic teams have been trying to get DNA from relatives to identify victims. Brian Potter has sought his grandmother, Vernice Regan, 96, at shelters, local hotels and a town hall meeting in the city of Chico to the south of Paradise, for days to no avail. She lived in Paradise for more than six decades, once ran an apple orchard with her late husband, and recently broke her hip on an overseas trip, he said. “I’m starting to think that maybe the worst may have happened,” Potter said. For the those who survived the fire, helping locate friends and relatives has given them a sense of purpose.     Julie Walker and her husband Lane were among many who fled to the Neighborhood Community Church in Chico, which is serving as a Red Cross shelter for about 200 people. When people call the shelter seeking the missing, church staff take down the person’s information and post it on a board outside. Lane and Julie were scanning the list, pen in hand, hoping to cross off names of people they knew were safe. “We could only cross off two names,” said Julie, who retired from the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. “I know quite a few of the names on that list. It’s our whole community.” Additional reporting by Gabriella Borter, Terray Sylvester and Suzannah Gonzales; Writing by Bill Tarrant; Editing by James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-california-wildfires-missing/i-brace-myself-anxious-search-for-the-missing-in-california-fire-idUKKCN1NL2CQ,2019-02-08,,'I brace myself' - anxious search for the missing in California fire
2019-02-08,"BELFAST (Reuters) - At Sandy Row Band Supplies in the heart of Belfast’s pro-British unionist community, it is easy to understand the uncompromising resistance of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Northern Irish allies to her Brexit deal. Here locals who express loyalty to London by lining streets with Britain’s Union Jack flags and painting kerbstones red, white and blue can buy the flutes and drums played during the province’s divisive “marching season”.  “I often say that people in Northern Ireland are probably more British than people in the mainland,” said shop owner David Milleken, 46, who drums in one of the many marching bands that hold annual parades to mark Protestant military victories dating back to the 17th century. “We should be treated exactly the same. We voted as the UK to leave, not as individual nations so I wouldn’t be happy at being treated any differently from someone in England, Scotland or Wales.” Unionists like Milleken fear their culture and identity would be eroded by a provision in the draft deal that could align Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the United Kingdom  The so-called Northern Ireland backstop that aims to keep open the border between the British province and EU member Ireland has provoked ministerial resignations in London, fury among the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who helped May form a  government, and left the divorce deal hanging by a thread.  But elsewhere in Northern Ireland some unionists are being won over by a deal vehemently opposed by the DUP, their only representative party at Westminster. Amid widespread support from business groups, a significant backer emerged on Thursday when the Ulster Farmers Union - a group traditionally close to unionists - said the deal, while not ideal, would protect the livelihoods of its 12,000 members and called on the DUP to vote in favour of it. “Brexit has become overly political and emotive. We are focussed on what is best for the future of family-run farm businesses in Northern Ireland,” said Ivor Ferguson, president of the UFU, which did not take a position during the 2016 referendum on EU membership. “Ultimately, we would like a UK-wide solution – full stop. However, this agreement does provide an insurance policy to prevent a no deal outcome, which would be disastrous for farm businesses and the economy in Northern Ireland.” Northern Ireland voted 56 to 44 percent to remain in the European Union in the referendum, when the United Kingdom as a whole voted by a small margin to leave. Research by Queens University suggested a sharp split between an overwhelming proportion of Catholic Irish nationalists voting to remain and most Protestant unionists, who themselves still make up the majority of the province’s 1.8 million population, opting to leave. Three decades of sectarian bloodshed between nationalists, who want to unite with Ireland, and unionists, who want to remain part of the UK, left 3,600 dead before a 1998 peace deal. Many feel that deal would be threatened by the return of border checks, with customs posts a possible target for small militant nationalist groups. Unionists are more British because of the period known as the “Troubles”, says Milleken, who voted DUP in the 2017 British election that cemented its position as the dominant unionist force and handed its 10 MPs the balance of power in parliament in London.     Not all of those voters share DUP positions such as  opposition to gay marriage and abortion. They back the party because choosing a smaller, more moderate unionist rival would only hand an advantage to nationalist Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA, whose ultimate goal is to unite the island of Ireland. “I’m a protestant, which I am proud of, but I also have gay friends and I also have Catholic friends. I have friends from all sides of the community from different ethnic backgrounds and the DUP don’t want us all to be inclusive,” said Stephen Mooney, a butcher working in the Protestant Shankill Road.  “It’s just the red, white and blue. It’s just a Protestant thing, it’s nothing to do with the DUP’s views, because I don’t agree with them but I vote DUP because of red, white and blue. Who else do you vote for?” “(But) once the DUP gets involved, the DUP will want it their way and they will not sway either way,” he added, in a reference to the party’s opposition to the deal. Still, surveys since the referendum suggest views on Brexit have not changed dramatically over the last two years. An opinion poll in September showed that 50 percent of voters in Northern Ireland want a second Brexit referendum, with 45 percent against and 5 percent undecided. Nationalists were 83 percent in favour, unionists 81 percent opposed. While many unionists fear that keeping the province more aligned with the EU could boost calls for a united Ireland, others point to the divergence that already exists with the UK on social issues like gay marriage and in regulations such as veterinary checks. “We already live with differences here and I think the people on the ground know that,” said Eileen Weir, who swapped membership of a pro-British paramilitary group as a teenager for decades of cross-community relations work in the Shankill area. “We have the (1998) Good Friday Agreement and that’s the only thing that can take us out of the United Kingdom, not a Brexit. The people will decide whether we become part of a united Ireland or stay within the UK and until that day comes, I think it’s a bit of scaremongering (by the DUP).” Writing by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Giles Elgood",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-nireland/mays-brexit-deal-sparks-defiance-and-divisions-in-unionist-belfast-idUKKCN1NL20A,2019-02-08,"At Sandy Row Band Supplies in the heart of Belfast's pro-British unionist community, it is easy to understand the uncompromising resistance of Prime Minister Theresa May's Northern Irish allies to her Brexit deal.",May's Brexit deal sparks defiance and divisions in unionist Belfast

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her draft divorce deal with the European Union on Thursday after the resignation of her Brexit secretary and other ministers put her strategy and her job in peril. Just over 12 hours after May announced that her cabinet had agreed to the terms of the deal, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and work and pensions minister Esther McVey resigned. Eurosceptics in May’s Conservative Party said they had submitted letters calling for a vote of no confidence in her leadership. May called a news conference at her Downing Street residence to underline her determination to stay the course. Asked if she would contest any challenge to her position, she replied: “Am I going to see this through? Yes.” However, hostility from government and opposition MPs raised the risk that the deal would be rejected in parliament, and that Britain could leave the EU on March 29 without a safety net. That prospect pushed the pound down as much as 2 percent to $1.2731, although it recovered slightly after May’s statement.  The main stock index in Ireland, which is highly dependent on trade with Britain, plunged 3.8 percent. The German carmaker BMW, which produces its Mini model in Britain, said that, with the political situation so uncertain, it would continue to prepare for a ‘no-deal’ Brexit.  Two junior ministers, two ministerial aides and the Conservatives’ vice chairman joined Raab and McVey in quitting.  May said she understood their unhappiness, but added: “I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I have set out is the right one for our country and all our people ... “I am going to do my job of getting the best deal for Britain.” By seeking to preserve the closest possible ties with the EU, May has upset her party’s many advocates of a clean break, and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government. Meanwhile, proponents of closer relations with the EU in her own party and the Labour opposition say the deal squanders the advantages of membership for little gain. Both sides say it effectively cedes power to the EU without securing the promised benefits of greater autonomy.  “It is ... mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons. The stark reality is that it was dead on arrival,” said Conservative Brexit-supporting lawmaker Mark Francois. The deal will need the backing of about 320 of parliament’s 650 MPs to pass. The ultimate outcome remains uncertain. Scenarios include May’s deal ultimately winning approval; May losing her job; Britain leaving the bloc with no agreement; or even another referendum. Analysts from U.S. bank Citi said Britain was now likely either to stay in the EU or leave without a deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of a Conservative eurosceptic group in parliament, said the draft was “worse than anticipated”, and he had formally requested a vote of no confidence in May.  At least 14 Conservative MPs openly said they had submitted such letters, although others could have done so secretly. Forty-eight are needed to trigger a challenge.  But May told parliament: “The choice is clear. We can choose to leave with no deal, we can risk no Brexit at all, or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated.” Rees-Mogg told journalists the next prime minister should be someone who believed in Brexit.  But a May ally, former Home Secretary Amber Rudd, told Sky News: “The problem isn’t the prime minister. The problem is the challenges she’s got to deliver in trying to pull together this Brexit. She’s the best person to do it.”  The Labour Party said the government was “falling apart”. In parliament, MPs from all sides spent three hours mostly attacking the draft, agreed with the EU on Tuesday after more than a year of difficult negotiations. “No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,” Raab said in his resignation letter. Others said the so-called “Irish backstop”, to be used if no better way can be found to avoid future checks on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, would tear Britain apart, leaving Northern Ireland all but inside the EU’s single market. It was this arrangement, which sees Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, but Northern Ireland aligned more closely with the EU, that spurred most criticism. The DUP has threatened to pull its support from the minority government if the backstop means the province is treated differently from mainland Britain. EU leaders are ready to meet on Nov. 25 to sign off on the divorce deal, or Withdrawal Agreement, but French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe summed up the uncertainty when he said events in London raised concerns about whether it would be ratified.  “We need to prepare ourselves for a no-deal Brexit,” he said. A group of EU states including France also raised objections to what has been agreed so far on fishing between the EU and UK after Brexit, diplomatic sources said. Raab, 44, was named Brexit secretary in July after the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May’s strategy. At the heart of Raab’s criticism was the belief that the pursuit of a temporary customs union with the EU would be the starting point for talks on the future relationship with the bloc, “severely prejudicing” what Britain could achieve. He said he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement, and that May’s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is seeking the death penalty against five out of 21 people under investigation in connection with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Five senior government officials have also been dismissed. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of Saudi policies, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 after entering to obtain documents for his marriage. Saudi Arabia initially denied knowledge of his fate, then offered contradictory explanations including that he was killed in a rogue operation and that the killing was premeditated. Those varying accounts drew international scepticism. On Thursday, the Saudi public prosecutor said Khashoggi was killed by lethal injection, then dismembered and handed over to an unidentified “local cooperator”. The whereabouts of his remains are still unknown. Turkish security sources say that when Khashoggi entered the consulate, he was seized by 15 Saudi intelligence operatives who had flown in on two jets just hours before. A senior Saudi official confirmed to Reuters they were among those under investigation, and on Thursday the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on all of them under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, along with two other officials. Most of the 15 worked in the Saudi military or security and intelligence services, including at the royal court, according to Saudi and Turkish officials and several sources with ties to the royal court. Turkey’s pro-government Sabah newspaper published what it said were photographs of the men taken from surveillance footage at the airport, two hotels they briefly checked into, the consulate and the consul’s residence. The following profiles of some of those detained or dismissed are based on those photographs, Saudi media reports and information from Saudi officials and sources. SAUD AL-QAHTANI Saud al-Qahtani, seen as the right-hand man to Prince Mohammed, was removed as a royal court adviser and is the highest-profile figure implicated in the incident. He joined the royal court under the late King Abdullah. He rose to prominence as a confidant in Prince Mohammed’s secretive inner circle. He regularly spoke on behalf of the crown prince, known as MbS, and has given direct orders to senior officials including in the security apparatus, the sources with ties to the royal court said. Tasked with countering alleged Qatari influence on social media, Qahtani used Twitter to attack criticism of the kingdom in general and Prince Mohammed in particular. He also ran a WhatsApp group with local newspaper editors, dictating the  court line. Qahtani had tried to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia after he moved to Washington a year ago fearing reprisals for his views, according to people close to the journalist and the government. In an August 2017 Twitter thread asking his 1.35 million followers to flag accounts for a black list for monitoring, Qahtani wrote: “Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the king and my lord the faithful crown prince.” The senior Saudi official said Qahtani had authorised one of his subordinates, Maher Mutreb, to conduct what he said was meant to be a negotiation for Khashoggi’s return to the kingdom. Qahtani also supplied Mutreb with unspecified information based on his earlier conversations with Khashoggi, the official said. The public prosecutor said a travel ban has been imposed on Qahtani while the investigation continues, but four sources based in the Gulf told Reuters this week that he is still at liberty and continues to operate discreetly. He is 40 years old, according to the U.S. Treasury. Qahtani did not respond to questions from Reuters. Reuters was not able to reach Mutreb for comment. General Maher Mutreb, an aide to Qahtani for information security, was the lead negotiator inside the consulate, according to the senior Saudi official. Without naming him, the public prosecutor said the lead negotiator was the person who decided to kill Khashoggi rather than repatriate him. Mutreb is a senior intelligence officer and part of Prince Mohammed’s security team. He appeared in photographs with the crown prince on official visits this year to the United States and Europe. According to the Saudi official, Mutreb was selected for the Istanbul operation because he already knew Khashoggi from their time working together at the Saudi embassy in London. “He knew Jamal very well and he was the best one to convince him to return,” the official said. Mutreb received Khashoggi at the Saudi consul’s office around 1:25pm. He began by urging him to come home and claimed he was wanted by Interpol, the official said. The official said Khashoggi told Mutreb he was violating diplomatic norms and asked whether Mutreb planned to kidnap him. Mutreb said yes, the official said, in an apparent attempt to intimidate Khashoggi. Sabah newspaper published stills from surveillance cameras that appear to show Mutreb entering the consulate three hours before Khashoggi, and later outside the consul’s residence. Britain’s Foreign Office confirmed that Mutreb served as a first secretary at the Saudi embassy in London for a period including 2007. He is 47 years old, according to the U.S. Treasury. Salah Tubaigy is a forensic expert at the Saudi interior ministry’s criminal evidence department, according to a biography posted online by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties. In the Istanbul operation, he was supposed to remove evidence such as fingerprints or proof of the use of force, according to the Saudi official. Tubaigy spent three months in 2015 at Australia’s Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine to observe death investigation procedures and learn about the use of CT scanning for mass fatality incidents, director Noel Woodford told Reuters. Photographs from the institute’s 2015 annual report, which resemble the suspect named by Turkish media, show Tubaigy wearing medical scrubs, a smock and rubber gloves in a laboratory setting, and separately chatting with colleagues. Tubaigy did not respond to an email sent by Reuters. The Saudi Society of Forensic Medicine lists him as a board member. He earned a master’s degree in forensic medicine from the University of Glasgow in 2004, the biography shows. A university spokeswoman declined to comment. Tubaigy is 47 years old, according to the U.S. Treasury. AHMED AL-ASIRI Ahmed al-Asiri, former deputy head of General Intelligence, was among those sacked by King Salman. The public prosecutor said he was the one who ordered the operation to repatriate - but not kill - Khashoggi. Asiri joined the military in 2002, according to Saudi media reports, and was spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition which intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015. He was named deputy chief of foreign intelligence by royal decree in April 2017. U.S. Treasury sanctions announced on Thursday did not include Asiri. Reuters was unable to reach him for comment. MOUSTAFA AL-MADANI Moustafa al-Madani led the intelligence efforts for the 15-man team in Istanbul, the senior Saudi official said. According to that official, Madani donned Khashoggi’s clothes, eyeglasses and Apple watch and left through the back door of the consulate in an attempt to make it look like the journalist had walked out of the building. Madani is a government employee who studied at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, according to a Facebook profile with photographs resembling the suspect identified by Turkish media. He is 56 years old, according to the U.S. Treasury. Reuters was unable to reach Madani for comment. University officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Meshal Saad Albostani is lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force from the Red Sea port of Jeddah, according to a Facebook profile with multiple photographs resembling the suspect identified by Turkish media. The senior Saudi official said he was responsible for the Istanbul team’s logistics. Albostani studied at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, according to Facebook. University officials contacted by Reuters said they could not confirm a graduate of that name. A LinkedIn profile matching his name and photo says he has served in the air force since 2006. He is 31 years old, according to the U.S. Treasury. He could not immediately be reached for comment. MOHAMMAD AL-OTAIBI Mohammad al-Otaibi is the Istanbul Consul General. He gave Reuters a tour of the consulate four days after the murder, opening cupboards, filing cabinets and wooden panels covering air conditioning units in an effort to show that Khashoggi was not on the premises. Otaibi left Istanbul ten days later and has not been heard from since. He was sanctioned on Thursday by the U.S. Treasury, which said he is 51 years old. Abdulaziz Mohammed al-Hawsawi is a member of the security team that travels with the Saudi crown prince, according to a New York Times report that cited a French professional who has worked with the royal family. He is 31, according to the U.S. Treasury. Reuters could not reach him for comment. General Rashad bin Hamed al-Hamadi was removed as director of the general directorate of security and protection in the General Intelligence Presidency. General Abdullah bin Khaleef al-Shaya was removed as assistant head of General Intelligence for human resources. General Mohammed Saleh al-Ramih was removed as assistant head of General Intelligence for intelligence affairs. None of the three generals were affected by U.S. Treasury sanctions announced on Thursday. They could not be reached for comment. The Treasury also named 10 other Saudis.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. senator said on Thursday she will ask Facebook Inc (FB.O) and the Justice Department about a media report that the company hired an outside firm to attack critics, warning that such action could raise campaign finance issues. Senator Amy Klobuchar told the Senate Judiciary Committee she would send a letter seeking details about a New York Times article that named the Minnesota Democrat as a target of an aggressive Facebook lobbying campaign that relied partly on a Republican opposition research firm.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Klobuchar. But Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters that he ended the company’s relationship with the outside firm, Definers Public Affairs, after he became aware of it while reading the New York Times story.  Definers did not respond to a request to comment. The New York Times said Facebook conducted an aggressive campaign to combat critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and fend off new regulations contained in proposed legislation that Klobuchar supports.  “This is a pretty serious matter for those of us on the receiving line,” Klobuchar told the committee.   “I would like to know what was going on with elected officials,” she said. “If they in fact were taking actions against critics, this could be a campaign finance issue... It could also have other legal ramifications.”  If Facebook spent money trying to influence the outcome of an election, it would have been required to disclose that spending to the Federal Election Commission and failure to do so would be a violation of the law. However, recent Supreme Court rulings have given companies leeway, requiring that they directly call for someone to be elected, or lose their office, to trigger the campaign finance laws.  The Times report said Facebook hired the Republican firm to discredit activist protesters and lobbied a Jewish civil rights group to cast some critics of the company as anti-Semitic. Its issue with Klobuchar involved legislation known as the Honest Ads Act, which she has supported along with Democratic Senator Mark Warner and the late Arizona Republican Senator John McCain. The bill would compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose the sponsors of political ads on their websites.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The three candidates competing to succeed German Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU) agreed on Thursday to revive their party’s fortunes by cutting taxes and reducing Germany’s dependence on the United States for defence. In a strikingly good-humoured three-hour debate in the northern city of Luebeck, the first of eight meetings with party grass roots across Germany before a leadership vote on Dec. 7, the rivals barely clashed on broad policy. While there were different nuances on details, the three agreed to work to improve the integration of migrants, focus more on affordable housing, cut subsidies to poorer eastern states and further Merkel’s digitalisation drive. The race for leader of the Christian Democratic Union party has shaped up as a dual between Merkel protege Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, widely seen as the continuity option, and Friedrich Merz, a millionaire who describes himself as “a free-trade man”. Merkel has said she will remain chancellor atop a ‘grand coalition’ with the CDU’s Bavarian sister party and Social Democrats until the end of her term in 2021.  CDU General Secretary Kramp-Karrenbauer, the front-runner, won applause for saying she would continue the process of renewal, by taking into account the views of the party base. Former Merkel rival Merz said he aimed to take the CDU back over the 40 percent mark and halve support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), currently polling at around 16 percent. The CDU is at around 26-27 percent in most surveys. “It is our job to do this,” he said, adding the CDU had to make clear it had not forgotten voters who felt neglected after the influx of some 1.5 million migrants since 2015. Health Minister Jens Spahn, the third candidate and an arch-critic of Merkel’s migrant policy, said CDU policy had in part led to the rise of the AfD, now represented in all of Germany’s 16 states. “We can also get rid of them,” he said. All three candidates promised to work with each other after the leadership election and stressed their mutual respect.  “I will not criticise the others, we will only say good things about each other ... In the end, the party must be the winner,” said Merz.  An opinion poll for broadcaster ARD conducted on Monday and Tuesday showed Kramp-Karrenbauer, known as mini-Merkel, still favourite among CDU voters with 46 percent support. The poll, released on Thursday, showed 31 percent of CDU supporters favoured Friedrich Merz, returning to politics after 10 years in the private sector. Twelve percent backed Spahn.

2019-02-08,"COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON (Reuters) - A plan to begin repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar stalled on Thursday, amid protests by refugees at camps in Bangladesh and recriminations between the officials in both countries.       The delay is a major setback for both nations and it leaves one of the world’s biggest refugee crises unresolved. Officials on both sides blamed each other for the lack of progress on the bilateral plan that had been agreed on in late October. Bangladesh had begun preparations to repatriate an initial batch of 2,200 Rohingya to Myanmar on Thursday, but there have been extensive doubts about the plan. It has been opposed by Rohingya at camps in Bangladesh and the U.N. refugee agency and aid groups, who fear for the safety of the Rohingya in Myanmar. Hundreds of Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh protested on Thursday against any attempt to send them back, and by late afternoon no refugees had returned, Myanmar officials said. Myanmar blamed Bangladesh for failing to bring any returnees but said it remained ready to accept them. “To be honest, Bangladesh is weak in following the physical arrangement,” said Myint Thu, permanent secretary at Myanmar’s foreign affairs ministry, at a media briefing.  “We will accept them according to the agreement signed by the two countries. Whether they come back or not is their own decision,” said Myint Thu.  Unverified images on social media showed officials on the Myanmar side of the border waiting idle at a reception centre. Bangladesh has vowed not to force anyone to return and it has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure those short-listed to return really want to go back. Bangladesh’s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Abul Kalam told Reuters on Thursday that his government had left no stone unturned. “We made all preparations. Everything was ready: the transit camp, buses to carry them to border, medical facilities, rations for three days for the returnees,” said Kalam. “How they can say we are weak in physical arrangements? If Rohingya don’t want to return what can we do? We will not send them forcefully.” Kalam called on the international community to put pressure on Myanmar to accept “some logical and acceptable demands,” in order for any repatriation to take place.  The Rohingya demand that Myanmar recognises their ethnic identity, grants them citizenship and allows them to return to their original homes and lands.  Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group and most are stateless. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call Rohingya “Bengalis”, suggesting they belong in Bangladesh. Earlier on Thursday, Rohingya protesters chanted “No, no, we won’t go,” at the Unchiprang camp in southeast Bangladesh near the Myanmar border. Some also waved placards that said “We want justice” and “We will never return to Myanmar without our citizenship.” More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state last year, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces. The Rohingya refugees say soldiers and Buddhist civilians massacred families, burned hundreds of villages and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of “genocidal intent” and ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies almost all the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against “terrorists.” U.N. rights boss Michelle Bachelet had called on Bangladesh this week to halt the repatriation plan, warning lives would be put at “serious risk”. The U.N. human rights office continued to receive reports of ongoing violations against Rohingya in Myanmar including allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests, Bachelet said.

2019-02-08,"SANAA (Reuters) - Saleh al-Faqeh held the wasted arm of his baby daughter as she took her last breath on Thursday at the malnutrition ward of the  main hospital in Yemen’s capital Sanaa. Four-month-old Hajar al-Faqeh reached the al-Sabeen hospital last week from Saada province, one of thousands of Yemeni children suffering from malnutrition in a country that has been pushed to the brink of famine by more than three years of war. Her body lies in the same ward where another baby boy, Mohammed Hashem, died from severe hunger on the same day. His passing was witnessed by a Reuters photographer. Doctors confirmed both babies had died of malnutrition. “She has spent two months in a hospital in Saada, but we had to bring her to Sanaa,” Hajar’s father said. Saada province is a stronghold of Iran-aligned Houthi rebels who have been fighting a Saudi-backed government for nearly four years in a war that has killed at least 10,000 people.  Meritxell Relano, the UNICEF Representative in Yemen, said in September that more than 11 million children, or about 80 percent of the country’s population under the age of 18, were facing the threat of food shortages, disease, displacement and acute lack of access to basic social services. The Faqeh family braved a dangerous journey along mountain roads where air strikes from the Saudi-led coalition are frequent.  “I worked in construction and I am also a driver.

It would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty, when the British people just want us to get on with it,” May said.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone banks which issued large amounts of loss-absorbing debt under English law could have more time to meet requirements after Britain leaves the European Union, the bloc’s agency responsible to winding down failing lenders said on Thursday. Under EU banking rules, banks must issue special loss-absorbing debt known as MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities) that can be converted into capital if a crisis burns through their core capital buffer. The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has estimated that banks in the euro zone have around 100 billion euros (88.31 billion pounds) of debt issued under English law. If no agreement is found between Britain and the EU on mutual acceptance of these outstanding bonds to absorb losses, euro zone banks will have to issue new bonds to cover likely capital gaps after Britain leaves the EU. In a report released on Thursday, the SRB said that for banks that after Brexit could have a MREL shortfall caused by debt issued under English law, “an extension of transitional periods” to meet their requirements could be considered. This is the first time the agency, which is in charge of setting the MREL for top euro zone banks, is saying it could be more lenient. So far the agency has advised banks to introduce clauses in contracts of bonds issued under English law that would clarify they could be wiped out in case of liquidation under EU rules. The SRB repeated on Thursday this call and also urged banks to consider issuing new debt under the law of one of the remaining EU countries to avoid possible legal uncertainty in the future.  Banks who fail to meet their MREL targets could be forced to sell assets or be subject to other punitive measures. An SRB official also clarified that British or other foreign banks with operations in the euro zone should have sufficient loss-absorbing buffers at their euro zone subsidiaries as if they were stand-alone banks, a requirement that could increase costs for foreign lenders.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Thursday that ongoing political uncertainty in Britain over Brexit raised concerns about whether the agreement struck with Brussels to leave the European Union would end up being ratified. “We need to prepare ourselves for the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” Philippe said during a visit to Dunkirk, a port city in northern France where locals are concerned about the impact of Brexit on business and trade. “It will escape no one that the current political situation in Britain could fuel uncertainty... over the ratification of the accord,” he said, referring to the resignation of several British ministers over the deal. Philippe said the withdrawal agreement, reached between Britain and the European Union after 17 months of negotiation, was a “step forward”, but crucially it now depends on ratification by Britain’s parliament as well as the parliaments of the European Union and the 27 other EU member states.  The concern in Britain is that Prime Minister Theresa May could face a no-confidence vote given the growing opposition to the deal within her Conservative Party. If she were forced out, the risk of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit would greatly increase. Philippe said that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal in March next year, it would cause “very serious problems” for France, especially around trade across the Channel. “We therefore need to prepare ourselves for the eventuality that remains on the table — one that I must say very clearly we do not wish for — that of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union have agreed a deal that will give  London’s financial centre the same basic level of access to the bloc’s markets after Brexit that is already offered to countries including the United States, Japan and Singapore. The deal is based around the EU’s existing system of financial market access known as equivalence. The EU grants foreign financial firms market access if it deems their home rules “equivalent”, or aligned closely enough with its own rules. It means foreign firms such as investment firms and clearing houses can serve EU customers largely from their home base and avoid having to set up a subsidiary in the EU. No. Currently, inside the EU, all financial firms in Britain have unfettered access to its customers, and the City of London had hoped this would continue after Brexit. But not all financial services are covered by equivalence. The EU has no such regime for activities including commercial bank lending and deposit taking, and parts of the insurance sector. Equivalence largely focuses on the wholesale market such as securities trading, leaving out much of the retail sector. That is why many banks and insurers based in Britain have pushed ahead with opening new EU hubs to avoid losing customers. Britain wanted the EU to offer a more accommodative version of equivalence covering a broader range of financial activities, and ensure the EU could not end equivalence-based access at short notice. None of these are included in the Brexit deal. Britain has said it will continue to push for broadening equivalence and the EU has privately conceded the system needs reform. For some financial firms, equivalence is better than no access at all as it could mean shifting fewer jobs and activities to EU hubs, and perhaps continuing to centralise some back office operations such as booking trades at global centres in London. Normally, the EU will not grant equivalence to foreign firms until it has completed lengthy deliberations - about four years in the case of one U.S. derivatives clearing rule. The deal agreed with the EU would effectively fast track equivalence determinations during the transition period that ends in December 2020. Such early notice that it will still have basic access to the EU would help maintain London’s position as a global base for banks. WHAT’S A RULE-TAKER? There could be some political fallout from a deal. Backers of Brexit say leaving the EU gives Britain a golden opportunity to ditch EU financial rules such as curbs on banker bonuses in order to keep the City competitive as a global financial hub. They fear that, under equivalence, Britain will end up as a rule-taker - having, like Norway, to mirror EU regulation without having a say on them. British financial regulators have said they want to stay aligned with EU rules but be granted some flexibility to make changes when it comes to maintaining financial stability. Equivalence will cut both ways. Britain will be asked by EU banks, insurers and investment firms to grant them equivalence. There are several large branches of EU banks operating in London that will want to avoid having to convert themselves into subsidiaries, a costly exercise that involves finding extra capital. DIDN’T BRITAIN SAY EQUIVALENCE IS A NON-STARTER? Yes. Government ministers have said the current equivalence system is opaque and unreliable because all decisions are made unilaterally by Brussels and can be scrapped at 30 days’ notice. The City wanted a broader system of market access known as mutual recognition, whereby Britain and the EU accept each other’s rules across a broad range of wholesale market financial services, but the EU rejected this. Yes, but not in the way Britain wants. Faced with having to continue relying on a foreign financial centre from next March, the bloc - and France in particular - is keen to tighten conditions for granting equivalence in order to keep up the pressure on UK-based firms to shift operations to the EU and help it build up its own capital market. Foreign clearing houses - London dominates clearing of euro-denominated derivatives - will have to grant EU regulators access to their inner workings if they want to serve the bloc’s customers. Foreign investment banks face having to have more operations and capital in the bloc. On the bright side for Britain, the scope of equivalence was substantially increased in January when the EU updated its “MiFID II” securities and investment rules, letting banks and investment firms from outside the bloc undertake a wider range of investment and trading activities.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab resigned on Thursday in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the European Union. May won the backing of her senior ministers for a draft European Union divorce deal on Wednesday, but media reports of the five hour meeting were clear her team were deeply divided over the proposals. “I regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign,” he said in a statement on Twitter. Raab said May’s plan threatened the integrity of the United Kingdom and he could not support an indefinite backstop arrangement where the EU held a veto over Britain’s ability to exit. “No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement,” he said in his resignation letter. Raab said that taking that arrangement as the starting point for negotiating Britain’s future relationship with the EU would “severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK.” The 44-year-old was appointed to the role of Brexit minister in July this year following the resignation of his predecessor David Davis, who also quit in protest at May’s Brexit strategy.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab resigned on Thursday in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for leaving the European Union.  Here is the text of the resignation statement: It has been an honour to serve in your government as Justice Minister, Housing Minister and Brexit Secretary. I regret to say that, following the Cabinet meeting yesterday on the Brexit deal, I must resign. I understand why you have chosen to pursue the deal with the EU on the terms proposed, and I respect the different views held in good faith by all of our colleagues. For my part, I cannot support the proposed deal for two reasons. First, I believe that the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presents a very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom. Second, I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement, where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit. The terms of the backstop amount to a hybrid of the EU Customs Union and Single Market obligations. No democratic nation ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement. That arrangement is now also taken as the starting point for negotiating the Future Economic Partnership. If we accept that, it will severely prejudice the second phase of negotiations against the UK. Above all, I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election. This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.  I appreciate that you disagree with my judgment on these issues. I have weighed very carefully the alternative courses of action which the government could take, on which I have previously advised. Ultimately, you deserve a Brexit Secretary who can make the case for the deal you are pursuing with conviction. I am only sorry, in good conscience, that I cannot.  My respect for you, and the fortitude you have shown in difficult times, remains undimmed.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - London’s low emission traffic zone has modestly reduced residents’ exposure to diesel engine pollution, but the better air quality has not brought improved lung health among the capital’s children, research found on Wednesday. The results suggest that while air pollution levels may be reduced by low emission zones that are now in place in around 200 cities across Europe, extra measures are needed to deliver air clean enough to improve health. The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is linked to 3.7 million premature deaths a year globally. In Europe, where more than half of new cars are diesel-fuelled, nitrogen oxide - which has been linked to asthma and impaired lung development in children - has become a major problem. Low emission zones are seen as a way to tackle traffic pollution and there are now around 200 in operation across Europe. London introduced the world’s largest citywide low emission zone in stages during 2008 and 2012, requiring diesel vehicles entering Greater London to meet certain emission standards or pay daily charges.     This study, published in The Lancet Public Health journal on Wednesday, looked at data from more than 2,000 school children aged 8 and 9 years old living in highly polluted areas of London’s low emission zone.  Between 2009-10 and 2013-2014, the children were given yearly winter health checks that included measuring lung function and size. Parents were asked to complete a medical questionnaire about the children, with information on breathing and allergic symptoms such as asthma, eczema and hay fever. The results found that despite improvements in air quality after the low emission zone was implemented, there was no evidence of a fall in the proportion of children with small lungs or asthma symptoms over the following five years. “In many areas of London, air pollution still remains a major issue,” said Chris Griffiths, a professor at Queen Mary University of London who co-led the research. He said many areas of the city are still breaching EU air pollution standards and “are unlikely to meet them without a substantial tightening of current emission controls.” London is set to introduce an ultra low emission zone early next year - a measure experts say should deliver major improvements in air quality. Ian Mudway, a professor at King’s College London who also worked on the study, said there is an urgent need to improve air quality in congested cities. But he stressed the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of policies, “not only in terms of whether they improve air quality, but more importantly, whether they deliver better health”.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue and profit on Wednesday, as the network gear maker benefited from demand for its routers and switches as well as growth in newer areas of focus such as software. Shares of the company, which also forecast second-quarter revenue largely above expectations, rose 4 percent in extended trading, putting them on track to add to a near 16 percent gain for the year. Cisco pivoted to software and cyber security to cushion the impact from slowing demand for its routers and switches from companies increasingly shifting to cloud services offered by Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc instead of building their own networks. Revenue in its application software businesses rose 18 percent to $1.42 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales in its security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 11 percent to $651 million. That fell short of the IBES estimate of $656.4 million, but beat research firm FactSet’s estimate of $648.1 million. Deals such as the $2.35 billion purchase of cyber security provider Duo Security in August have played an important part in driving growth in Cisco’s newer business. Acquisitions provided an 80-basis-point boost to the company’s first-quarter results compared with a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Revenue in its infrastructure platform unit, which houses the switches and routers business, rose about 9 percent to $7.64 billion, topping expectation of $7.39 billion.  Subscriptions, which provide a more steady revenue flow, accounted for 57 percent of total software revenue in the first quarter, the company said. The preceding quarter’s share was 56 percent. “Cisco is executing on its plan to move its business model to software and subscriptions while benefiting from a strong IT spending environment,” said Mark Cash, an analyst with Morningstar.  Cisco Chief Executive Charles Robbins said in an interview that the company was impacted by the Trump administration’s 10 percent tariffs on imports from China in the first quarter.  “We implemented some price increases, as we said we would, and frankly, we didn’t see any difference in the momentum before we did that and the momentum we saw after that in the quarter,” Robbins told CNBC. “Obviously, we would prefer that the tariffs don’t get increased to 25 percent in January.” Robbins also told CNBC cnb.cx/2K4QUic he is hopeful that a solution could be reached over the U.S.-China trade dispute now that U.S. midterm elections are over. The company said it expects second-quarter revenue growth of between 5 percent and 7 percent from a year earlier. This implies a range of between $12.48 billion and $12.72 billion, while analysts forecast $12.53 billion. For its first quarter ended Oct. 27, the company posted an adjusted profit of 75 cents per share, above the average estimate of 72 cents. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $13.07 billion, topping estimate of $12.87 billion. However, the company said deferred revenue fell 9.4 percent to $16.81 billion.

2019-02-08,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A raft of profit warnings from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) suppliers this week has fuelled investor concerns that iPhone sales, in terms of volume, have hit a wall that could spell trouble for the company’s plans to make services its main pillar of growth. For the past year, investors had largely been willing to overlook stagnating unit sales of the iPhone because average selling prices kept rising. But it now faces fierce competition from mid-priced phones from makers such as Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK). Apple has often stated its plan to increase its revenue from paid services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. That, at least in part, requires a growing base of device owners driven by its  iPhone, which analysts believe accounts for about two-thirds of the 1.3 billion Apple devices in use around the world.   Wall Street analysts have expressed concerns that slower overall smartphone sales will make it harder for Apple to hold smartphone market share as people put off buying its generally more expensive phones. That, in turn, could hurt the growth of Apple’s services revenue, said Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi. Without volume growth in promising overseas markets such as India, Brazil and Russia, the worry among analysts and investors is that Apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it, more than $1,000 (£774.71 pounds) for its top models. Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said phones like the OnePlus 6T are roughly comparable to Apple’s high-end phones for almost half the price. “You can get a lot of phone for a lot less,” he said. “The phone landscape is rapidly changing and I think manufacturers are missing a trick by going the $1,000 route.”  Apple declined to comment on its strategy, or the share moves among its suppliers.  The company’s executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from its large supply chain. Apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone, an argument that sales data suggests Apple made successfully.  The company also has customer satisfaction and loyalty rates that are unparalleled in the mobile phone industry, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies.  Nevertheless, a trio of Chinese smartphone makers - Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018, according to data from research firm IDC, up from just 8.9 percent for all of 2014 and almost 20 percent last year.  With the exception of fiscal 2015, Apple has not increased its market share. It had 13.6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year, down from 14.8 percent for 2014, although its share typically rises with full-year results due to strong sales in December.  The 1.3 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs used around the world serves as the pool of potential customers for Apple’s services - a business that hit $37.1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year. That represented 14 percent of Apple’s overall revenue, up from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iPhone unit sales hit their all-time high. But IDC expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2.4 percent on a compound basis to 1.6 billion units by 2022, indicating a saturated market in which the Cupertino, California-based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer. Xiaomi, in particular, is gaining fans rapidly. In India, where Apple has only a minor presence, Xiaomi has in some quarters beat Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) to become  the country’s top phone seller and is also making headway into European markets like Spain, IDC said in a report.  According to data from IDC, Xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in India in the first and second quarters of 2018, with 30.3 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, of the market for smartphone units there.  “This is the case where it’s much different in other parts of the world,” said Ryan Reith, programme vice president for IDC’s mobile device tracking programme, noting that most U.S. consumers are not familiar with Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo phones.  “Many of those brands don’t play (in the United States), but they’re playing in places where they never played before,” such as India and Europe, he said.  In its latest earnings this month, Apple shocked investors with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping quarter and with its announcement that it would stop reporting unit sales for its hardware products as has been customary for the last 20 years. Underscoring flattening iPhone unit sales, it also said it sold 217.7 million iPhones in its most recent fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231.2 million in fiscal 2015. Its share price, hit at the time of the forecast, has since extended losses after profit warnings from suppliers like Japan Display Inc (6740.T), British chipmaker IQE Plc (IQE.L) and Lumentum Holdings Inc (LITE.O). The stock is now down about 8 percent since its Nov. 1 earnings. Apple’s newest models such as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies. But they range up to $1,449 in price - out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets. Apple’s strategy is to lure those consumers to its eco-system with older models at cheaper prices.   It has also  emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition, expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices. But Chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher-end chips and features like under-the-glass fingerprint sensors that seek to attract consumers who might otherwise give Apple’s phones a look. Those manufacturers are increasingly adopting Qualcomm Inc’s  (QCOM.O) most powerful mobile phone chips, said Cristiano Amon, the head of chip operations at the U.S. chipmaker, which is locked in a bitter court dispute with Apple. Those phones were initially sold in China but “we’ve also seen them gaining share outside China, especially in areas such as India and Europe,” Amon said. On its home turf, too, Apple is facing new challenges from at least one Chinese maker, OnePlus, which is creeping in to the U.S. firm’s traditionally high pricing territory. Though the iPhone 7’s processor chip beats the OnePlus 6T in some speed tests posted by chip tracking firm Geekbench, the OnePlus phone has a contemporary design with thin bezels around the display, similar to newer iPhone models.  After years of being available in the United States only via an online store and developing a following among tech enthusiasts, the OnePlus 6T is being carried by T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) stores. At $549, it sits between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in terms of pricing. Kyle Kiang, the general manager for North America for OnePlus, said first-day sales of the new model were 86 percent higher in the United States than for the previous OnePlus released there, although he did not disclose absolute unit figures. He said sales were higher because of the T-Mobile relationship.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mira Ricardel, the White House deputy national security adviser, was forced out of her job on Wednesday after President Donald Trump’s wife, Melania, said Ricardel did not deserve the honour of working for her husband. Ricardel “will continue to support the president as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Sanders did not elaborate on what Ricardel’s new job would be. Trump, after congressional elections last week in which his Republican Party saw its power eroded, is also preparing to oust Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as part of a post-election Cabinet shakeup, several U.S. officials said. Ricardel is a former Commerce Department official hand-picked by Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, to serve as his deputy. She ran afoul of Melania Trump and her staff in negotiations over the first lady’s trip to Africa in October and the use of government resources for the trip, a senior administration official said. Ricardel has also built a reputation in the White House for berating staff, several sources said. Melania Trump’s office took the extraordinary step of issuing a statement on Tuesday saying that Ricardel should be ousted. While first ladies historically have been known to pressure their husbands over official business, they do not typically issue statements about it. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House,” Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman, had said. Bolton had fought behind the scenes to keep Ricardel from being forced out but ultimately lost the battle, two officials said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union have agreed a draft Brexit text, including a solution to the so-called backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The draft deal says any such backstop arrangement, which would see Britain and the EU establishing a single customs territory, would be temporary and both sides would seek to secure a deal on a future relationship by Dec. 31, 2020, to ensure a backstop would not be necessary.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Leaving the European Union without a transitional trade deal would cost Britain about 6 percent of GDP — roughly four years of economic growth — compared with staying in the bloc, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. The IMF, which warned of the costs of Brexit before Britons voted to leave in June 2016, said securing a trade deal would roughly halve the economic damage from trade barriers and reduced foreign investment and immigration. “Directors emphasised the importance of a timely agreement with the EU, accompanied by an implementation period to avoid a cliff-edge exit in March 2019 and to allow firms and workers time to adjust to the new relationship,” the IMF said. Two months ago, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said she expected the world’s fifth-biggest economy would shrink outright if it left the EU without a deal. The IMF’s estimates — part of a regular review of Britain’s economy — come as Prime Minister Theresa May is attempting to secure her top ministers’ agreement to a transitional deal, which will then need approval by parliament and the EU. Some supporters of Brexit have argued that Britain would be better off leaving without any deal with Brussels if they cannot secure their full demands, trading instead under World Trade Organization rules. The IMF forecast this would carry a cost. “In a scenario in which the UK and EU trade under World Trade Organization rules the level of output is likely to fall by between about 5 and 8 percent relative to a no-Brexit scenario, with an average of about 6 percent,” the IMF said. Britain’s economy has slowed since the Brexit vote. Its annual growth rate fell from the top of the G7 group of nations to near the bottom, as businesses put investment on hold and higher inflation reduced households’ disposable income. Some eurosceptics in May’s Conservative Party say a “no-deal” Brexit would allow Britain to reach trade deals with third countries more easily and determine its own regulations. But May favours a transitional arrangement that she hopes will preserve free trade in goods, though not services, while placing controls on immigration from the EU. The IMF said this type of free trade agreement would reduce British GDP by around 2.5 to 4 percent — probably about 3 percent — over an unspecified long-term period, compared with staying in the EU. May has ruled out staying in. Before the referendum, the IMF estimated Brexit would have a short-run cost of between 1.4 percent and 5.6 percent of GDP, depending on the terms of departure. The effect of Brexit would vary widely between industries, the IMF said. Britain’s financial services, chemicals and automotive industries were likely to suffer most from new regulatory barriers and disrupted supply chains. By contrast, farms, food processors and oil and mining companies might do better. Government programmes would be needed to retrain British workers for these jobs, the IMF added.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The draft Brexit deal agreed between Britain and the European Union won’t stop banks in London pushing ahead with relocation plans because the agreement is far from being ratified, UK financial sector officials said on Wednesday. The deal agreed between Britain and Brussels on Tuesday includes a “business-as-usual” transition period from March to the end of 2020. UK ministers and parliament - or the EU itself - have yet to ratify the deal, whose details are dividing the ruling Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May. “The announcement that a draft Brexit agreement has been reached between the UK and EU is a step forward, but there is still a long way to go before the deal is done,” said Catherine McGuinness, chairman of the City of London financial district. Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain are opening new EU hubs to avoid disruption to cross-border services next March, regardless of whether there will be a transition period. “Our clients are continuing with their planning and execution,” said Joe Cassidy, financial services Brexit lead at consultants KPMG. “Everybody knows we are just at the beginning and not at the end, and a lot could happen in the intervening period.” Other industry source said only a legally binding divorce settlement and transition period would prompt banks to pause relocation plans. “We are not there yet. Until we are, we would expect firms, regulators and governments to continue to prepare for all outcomes, including a no deal scenario,” the source said. McGuinness said EU regulators should in the meantime urgently mirror efforts by UK regulators to address potential no-deal “cliff-edges in markets. The European Commission published on Tuesday its no-Brexit contingency plans that include allowing EU customers to continue clearing derivatives contracts in London. “It’s reassuring to hear increasing acknowledgment that these issues need dealing with but we need firm action, not just words. Firms cannot tackle these issues alone in the time remaining,” McGuinness said. Cassidy said the plans from Brussels lack detail in some areas, a reflection of how negotiations between Britain and the EU continue. “It’s a good direction of travel,” Cassidy said. Swiss bank UBS told CNBC on Wednesday that the next few weeks will be very important for Britain’s financial markets, whose biggest customer is the EU. “We’re prepared for the worst, and we hope for the best,” said Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, which is spending 100 million Swiss francs on moving some of its 5,000 staff in London to Frankfurt. Fund managers in Britain fear they won’t be able to continue managing funds worth trillions of pounds across the EU after Brexit but financial services minister John Glen said the deal would minimise “cliff-edge” risks in markets from Brexit. “The sheer economic weight of our financial services sector is one of the strongest things in our favour. It means we will not retreat to a place of isolation nor blindly run a regulatory race to the bottom,” he told a Managed Funds Association conference. “We have confidence the issue will be resolved and resolved soon,” he said.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The draft accord reached between the EU and Britain envisages a July 2020 decision on what would have to be done to safeguard an open Irish border after the post-Brexit transition runs its course and if a new trade deal is not in place, EU sources said.  Britain would then have two choices. One would be extending the transition period once beyond December 2020, possibly until the end of 2021. The other would be going into a “bare-bones” customs arrangement that would cover all of the United Kingdom but in which its province of Northern Ireland would be aligned more closely with the EU’s customs rules and production standards, three diplomatic sources said in Brussels.  British Prime Minister Theresa May was trying to convince her cabinet on Wednesday to accept the draft EU divorce deal, which her opponents say threatens both her government and the unity of the United Kingdom. Under World Trade Organisation rules, however, Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain would remain part of the same customs area under the draft deal, EU sources stressed, an effort to appease May’s Northern Irish Unionist allies who prop up her minority government in London.      The EU sources said the customs arrangement option included clauses to ensure a “level playing field” by stipulating the UK would have to align itself with EU rules on state aid and competition, environment and labour standards - anathema to hardline Brexiteers in her divided Conservative Party.  For the EU, this measure is crucial as otherwise it fears Britain could gain open access to the bloc’s cherished single market with no tariffs or quotas and without needing to observe the same standards. This could lead to British goods in the EU being offered at prices undercutting the bloc’s own producers. France is spearheading a group of EU countries in demanding guarantees to prevent any such outcome, the sources said. Northern Ireland would remain inside the EU customs union, the sources said, as an emergency fix to keep the Irish border open if a separate deal on future trade relations with the EU has not been reached by the end of the transition period.  They said ways for Britain to exit the customs arrangement were still not finalised and would require more negotiations. The EU wants any such exit to be approved jointly through a common EU-UK arbitration mechanism - the Joint Committee. Under the preferred EU option, should the two sides be unable to agree, they would seek guidance from the bloc’s top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  But May’s government wants to be able to walk away unilaterally. Powerful Brexiteers in her party vow to reject any deal that would keep Britain in an EU customs zone indefinitely, hampering its freedom to pursue independent trade deals. Ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ in Britain was also a central promise of the “Leave” campaign that narrowly won Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership.  The British side has not yet shared any details of the deal. Another open issue is fisheries, according to the sources. The EU wants to maintain the current mutual access to fishing waters, which often means EU countries and companies fishing in UK waters. London wants to take full control of its fisheries. France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark were among those EU states pushing for firm guarantees of access to UK waters.  The three sources, however, said that this issue was left outside the “bare-bones” customs arrangement in the draft Brexit deal. The two sides would only agree to work this out by July 2020, they added.  All in all, EU sources have said they felt like the bloc has given quite some ground to UK demands in the negotiation, though that would not be the way May’s critics see it. May’s cabinet will convene on Wednesday at the same time as  27 national envoys of EU member states in Brussels. They will look at the proposed deal and wait to see if the British cabinet has approved it. Should that happen, the EU’s 27 national ministers for European affairs would meet in Brussels on Monday to start preparing what is expected to be a Nov. 25 EU leaders’ summit to rubber-stamp the deal, sources in Brussels said. If the European Parliament and, much more uncertain, Britain’s House of Commons ratify the deal, it would give Britain a status-quo transition period after Brexit Day on March 29, 2019. It would settle the divorce bill and ensure the rights of some 3 million expatriates in the future, among other things.  But both the EU and UK have also stepped up preparations for the most damaging scenario in which they fail to finalise the deal and Britain crashes out from the bloc with no agreement in place to manage the fallout.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain struck a draft divorce deal with the European Union after more than a year of talks, thrusting Prime Minister Theresa May into a perilous battle over Brexit that could shape her country’s prosperity for generations to come. While Brussels choreographs the first withdrawal of a sovereign state from the EU, May, a far from secure leader hemmed in by opponents in government and her own Conservative party, must now try to get the deal approved by her cabinet and, in the toughest test of all, by parliament. Brexiteers in May’s party accused her of surrendering to the EU and said they would vote the deal down while the Northern Irish party which props up her minority government questioned whether she would be able to get parliamentary approval. “These are momentous days and the decisions being taken will have long-lasting ramifications,” said Arlene Foster, leader of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which keeps the government in power.  “The prime minister must win the support of the cabinet and the House of Commons. Every individual vote will count.” The British cabinet will meet at 1400 GMT on Wednesday to consider the draft withdrawal agreement, a Downing Street spokesman said after Irish and British media were leaked details of the agreement on the text. Sterling, which has seesawed since reaching $1.50 just before Britain’s 2016 referendum that saw a 52-48 percent margin for leaving the EU, surged on news of a deal but then erased some gains as opponents lined up to criticise May. Brexit will pitch the world’s fifth largest economy into the unknown and many fear it will serve to divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.  Supporters of Brexit say that while the divorce might bring some short-term instability, in the longer term it will allow the United Kingdom to thrive and also enable deeper EU integration without such a powerful reluctant member. A senior EU official confirmed that a draft text had been agreed. EU leaders could meet on Nov. 25 for a summit to seal the Brexit deal if May’s cabinet approves the text, diplomatic sources said. The EU and Britain need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world’s biggest trading bloc and the United Kingdom, home to the biggest international financial centre. But May, an initial opponent of Brexit who won the top job in the turmoil that followed the referendum, has struggled to untangle nearly 46 years of EU membership without damaging commerce or upsetting the MPs who will ultimately decide the fate of the divorce accord. By seeking to leave the EU while preserving the closest possible ties, May’s compromise plan has upset Brexiteers, pro-Europeans, Scottish nationalists, the Northern Irish party that props up her government, and some of her own ministers. It is unclear when parliament might vote on a deal. To get the deal approved she needs the votes of about 320 MPs in the 650-seat parliament. She faces a deeply divided government, party, parliament and country.  Prominent Brexiteers such as Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said May had sold out the United Kingdom and that they would oppose it.  “It is a failure of the government’s negotiating position, it is a failure to deliver on Brexit, and it is potentially dividing up the United Kingdom,” Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said.  The opposition Labour Party, which has said it would oppose any agreement that does not retain “the exact same” economic benefits that it now has with the EU, said it was unlikely the announced deal was right for Britain.  “It is vassal state stuff,” Johnson said, adding that he would vote against such an unacceptable accord. “Chuck it out.” Johnson’s brother, Jo, a pro-European, resigned from May’s government on Friday, calling for another referendum to avoid her Brexit plans unleashing Britain’s greatest crisis since World War Two. May formally began Britain’s divorce in March 2017, ushering in tortuous negotiations on everything from space exploration and fishing territories to selling complex financial products and the future of the land border on the island of Ireland. As deadlines passed, officials such as Britain’s Olly Robbins and the Commission’s Sabine Weyand, a German, raced to get a deal in late night sessions at the European Commission’s modernist Berlaymont building in Brussels. With less than five months until Britain leaves the EU, the so-called Northern Irish backstop was the main sticking point. The backstop is an insurance policy to avoid a return to controls on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. The British government supplied no immediate details on the Brexit deal text, which runs to hundreds of pages. Three EU sources said the backstop would come in the form of a UK-wide customs arrangement, with specific provisions for Northern Ireland which go deeper on the issue of customs and alignment with the rules of the EU single market than for the rest of the United Kingdom. It would include a review mechanism to bridge between EU demands that the insurance policy is permanently available and Britain’s request to avoid being held in a customs alliance with the bloc perpetually.  The DUP has ruled out any deal that treats Northern Ireland differently.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain have agreed a draft text of a Brexit withdrawal agreement and Prime Minister Theresa May will present it to her senior ministers on Wednesday. Below is early reaction: “We will look at the details of what has been agreed when they are available. But from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country. “Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy - and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn’t meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it.” “It is vassal state stuff. For the  first time in a thousand years this place, this parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country. It is a quite incredible state of affairs. It means having to accept rules and regulations over which we have no say ourselves. It is utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy.   “For the first time since partition, Dublin under these proposals will have more say in some aspects of the government of Northern Ireland than London. So I don’t see how you can support it.” “The trick will be for Theresa May: can she satisfy everyone? It is going to be a very, very hard sell, I would have thought, but let’s wait and see the actual detail. “The crucial issue is going to be what happens when it comes to cabinet and when it gets to parliament. We haven’t seen any details, we’ll see what happens. People know what our position is very clearly and we will judge whatever comes forward against the positions that have already been outlined.” “The headline stuff ... is really just a regurgitation of the deal which was offered in March of this year which the Prime Minister said no UK Prime Minister could ever sign up to.  “If she does sign up to this ... It will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom, and it will also keep the United Kingdom tied into EU institutions without the ability to decide when we want to break free from them.” JACOB REES-MOGG, LEADER OF HARD-BREXIT FACTION OF CONSERVATIVE MPs “This is the vassal state. It is a failure of the government’s negotiating position, it is a failure to deliver on Brexit, and it is potentially dividing up the United Kingdom. It is very hard to see any reason why the cabinet should support Northern Ireland being ruled from Dublin.” “I hope the cabinet will block it and if not I hope parliament will block it. I think what we know of this deal is deeply unsatisfactory.” “I’m confident we’ll get this through parliament and that we can deliver on what the Prime Minister committed to on delivering Brexit, but making sure that that is in the best interests of companies, businesses and families. “It’s a major document, hundreds of pages, and people will be looking at that carefully but I’m confident that... we’re hopefully on the cusp of beginning to get to the point where we’re delivering on Brexit in a really practical way. “Theresa May has stuck with it through a very very tough year or two, and will be delivering the best interests of Britain.” Asked if the government’s days were numbered, he referred to reports of the deal and said: “If this is the case, the answer is almost certainly, yes, because they’re in real trouble if they bring back something unacceptable to their party.” “If the PM’s ‘deal’ satisfies no-one and can’t command a majority, we mustn’t fall for her spin that the UK crashing out of EU without a deal is then inevitable - instead we should take the opportunity to get better options back on the table.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, Kate Holton and Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-reaction-instantview/instant-view-reaction-after-text-of-brexit-divorce-deal-agreed-idUKKCN1NI2HM,2019-02-08,,Instant View - Reaction after text of Brexit divorce deal agreed

2019-02-08,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Main One Cable Co took responsibility on Tuesday for a glitch that temporarily caused some Google global traffic to be misrouted through China, saying it accidentally caused the problem during a network upgrade. The issue surfaced on Monday afternoon as internet monitoring firms ThousandEyes and BGPmon said some traffic to Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google had been routed through China and Russia, raising concerns that the communications had been intentionally hijacked.  Main One said in an email that it had caused a 74-minute glitch by misconfiguring a border gateway protocol filter used to route traffic across the internet. That resulted in some Google traffic being sent through Main One partner China Telecom, the West African firm said. Google has said little about the matter. It acknowledged  the problem on Monday in a post on its website that said it was investigating the glitch and said it believed the problem originated outside the company. The company did not say how many users were affected or identify specific customers.  Google representatives could not be reached on Tuesday to comment on Main One’s statement.   Even though Main One said it was to blame, some security experts said the incident highlighted concerns about the potential for hackers to conduct espionage or disrupt communications by exploiting known vulnerabilities in the way traffic is routed over the internet.  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, a Washington-based group that advises the U.S. Congress on security issues, plans to look into the issue, said Commissioner Michael Wessel. “We will work to gain more facts about what has happened recently and look at what legal tools or legislation or law enforcement activities can help address this problem,” Wessel said.  Glitches in border gateway protocol filters have caused multiple outages to date, including cases where traffic from U.S. internet and financial services firms was routed through Russia, China and Belarus.  Yuval Shavitt, a network security researcher at Tel Aviv University, said it was possible that Monday’s issue was not an accident.  “You can always claim that this is some kind of configuration error,” said Shavitt, who last month co-authored a paper alleging that the Chinese government had conducted a series of internet hijacks.  Main One, which describes itself as a leading provider of telecom and network services for businesses in West Africa, said that it had investigated the matter and implemented new processes to prevent it from happening again.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stock prices shed earlier gains on Tuesday while oil prices plunged on persistent concerns of weakening global demand. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX turned negative after energy stocks were depressed by falling Brent and U.S. crude futures. Oil prices tumbled 7 percent, with U.S. crude touching its lowest level in a year. Brent and U.S. crude extended their fall from Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on OPEC not to cut supply to prop up prices. Both crude benchmarks have fallen more than 20 percent since peaking at four-year highs in early October. “It’s like a run on the bank,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s getting to the point where it doesn’t seem to be about fundamentals anymore, but a total collapse in price.” U.S. natural gas futures, however, soared to their highest since November 2014 on forecasts for colder weather. Earlier, U.S. stocks had risen after White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow said Washington had resumed trade talks with China and characterized the development as “very positive.” Technology stocks bounced back a day after a rout that led the S&P 500’s nearly 2 percent decline. The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which has steadily climbed as the U.S.-China trade dispute has escalated, dipped 0.2 percent. “To the extent that we get movement in the tariff discussion the market will view that as a positive,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The pound GBP=D3 rose 0.8 percent to $1.2953 after reports that the United Kingdom and the European Union had agreed upon the text of a Brexit agreement and that British Prime Minister Theresa May would hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The euro EUR=EBS also rose from a 16-month low, last up  0.4 to $1.1264, though its gains were capped by concerns over Italy's budget and downbeat German investor sentiment data.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it intended to adopt by the end of December all the legislation necessary to prepare the EU for a British exit without a divorce agreement should it be necessary by Brexit day on March 29.  The EU executive is in charge of negotiating a departure agreement with Britain on behalf of the 27 countries remaining in the EU after Britain leaves. As Britain’s exit date comes closer and negotiations on the withdrawal treaty have not yet been completed, the Commission issued a document on Tuesday on the preparations the EU would have to take in case a divorce agreement could not be reached. “The draft Withdrawal Agreement constitutes the best option for the withdrawal. In the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement, the European Union will act to protect its interests, and should display a united and coordinated approach in all areas,” the Commission said. In London, the BBC said the EU and Britain had agreed a draft Brexit divorce deal text and Prime Minister Theresa May would present the agreement to her senior ministers on Wednesday. Any deal has to be approved by parliament. The Commission said it intended to propose all necessary legislative measures and adopt all the legal acts required for preparing the EU for Britain crashing out without a divorce deal before Dec 31. It said this deadline would give the European Parliament and EU governments the time needed to complete the procedures in time for Brexit day. The Commission said the time needed for these procedure could not be contracted because EU treaties provided for an eight-week period for the consultation of national parliaments while some legal acts were subject to mandatory scrutiny by the European Parliament and governments. It said the risks of financial instability in the event of  a no-deal Brexit have “diminished significantly” due to ongoing contingency preparations, though such a scenario could still pose risks for cleared derivatives. Announcing its latest contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit, the EU’s executive said it was looking at temporary bridging solutions to mitigate disruption in key areas.  On air traffic, the Commission said it would propose extending current rules to allow UK airlines to land in EU territory and take off from its airports, but that this was conditional on Britain applying equivalent measures for carriers from the bloc. For road transport, however, the Commission said its unilateral contingency measures “would allow for considerably less traffic than what currently takes place between the Union and the United Kingdom”.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Trade Secretary Liam Fox said on Tuesday a lot of effort was being put into achieving a Brexit deal with the European Union as no one believed leaving without an agreement was a good outcome. During a question and answer session following a speech in London, Fox, a strong Brexit supporter, said it was impossible to know whether he would like the final deal, which both sides say has almost been agreed, until he knew what it was. “Over the last few days in particular, there has been a lot of effort put in to get to an agreement on the withdrawal agreement itself and I think all you can say is that there is a lot of effort being put into reaching that because none of us believes that no deal is a good outcome,” he said. With less than five months until Britain is due to leave the EU, talks are mired in a disagreement over an Irish “backstop” - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. Local media have reported Fox is among key pro-Brexit ministers who are concerned Britain could end up locked into a customs union with the EU. “I will want to look at the package as a whole,” Fox said when asked at what point he might consider a deal so bad that it would be worse than leaving without a deal. “We need to look at any agreement in the round and we need to make a judgement about is that in the best interests of the United Kingdom and we have to weigh it against the alternatives.” For Britain to be “perpetually” in a customs union would be “a profound impediment to an independent trade policy”, he said.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said recordings related to the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, which Turkey has shared with Western allies, are “appalling” and shocked a Saudi intelligence officer who listened to them, Turkish media reported on Tuesday. Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2 in a hit which Erdogan says was ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government. Six weeks after Khashoggi’s death, Turkey is trying to keep up pressure on Prince Mohammed and has released a stream of evidence that undermined Riyadh’s early denials of involvement. Prince Mohammed won support on Tuesday from U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said he did not think recordings of the killing shared by Turkey implicated the young crown prince. Erdogan told reporters on his plane returning from a weekend visit to France that he discussed the Saudi journalist’s killing with the U.S., French and German leaders there, adding that Turkey had played the recording to at least six countries. “The recordings are really appalling. Indeed when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recordings he was so shocked he said: ‘This one must have taken heroin, only someone who takes heroin would do this’,” he added. Khashoggi’s murder has provoked global outrage but little concrete action by major powers against Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter and a strong proponent of U.S. policy to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East. President Donald Trump has expressed reluctance to punish Saudi Arabia economically, citing its multi-billion-dollar purchases of military equipment and investments in U.S. firms.  Bolton said he did not think that people who heard the recordings concluded that the crown prince was linked to the killing. “And certainly that is not the position of the Saudi government,” he said in Singapore. Asked again if the audio tape provided by Turkey did not link Prince Mohammed to the killing in any way, Bolton said: “I haven’t listened to the tape myself but in the assessment of those who have listened to it, that is right.” Bolton shares with Saudi Arabia a hawkish stance against Riyadh’s biggest Middle East rival Iran, and he championed Washington’s resumption of sanctions on the Islamic Republic. The New York Times, in a report confirmed by a Turkish official, said a member of the Saudi team which was sent to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi told one of his superiors after the killing to “tell your boss” - which the newspaper said was believed to be a reference to Prince Mohammed.  The individual was identified as Maher Mutreb, who reports to an aide to the crown prince, Saud al-Qahtani. Mutreb was also quoted as saying words to the effect that “the deed was done”. In his comments to reporters, Erdogan said it was clear the killing was planned and that the order came from the top level of Saudi authorities, but that he could not think such a thing of King Salman, for whom he has “limitless respect”. “The crown prince says ‘I will clarify the matter, I will do what is necessary’. We are waiting patiently,” Erdogan said, adding that the perpetrators of the killing were among 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia. “It must be revealed who gave them the order to murder.” Last month two separate intelligence sources told Reuters that Qahtani gave orders over Skype to Khashoggi’s killers at the consulate. More recently, a government source familiar with the matter said Qahtani featured prominently throughout the recordings. Saudi state media said King Salman sacked him and other officials over the killing, and a senior Saudi official said last month that Qahtani had been detained. But four sources based in the Gulf told Reuters this week that he was still at liberty and continued to operate discreetly.  “He still has the same influence,” one of the sources said. Qahtani has wielded that influence over the last three years, with his authority growing alongside that of the young prince. He ran social media for Prince Mohammed, masterminded the arrest of hundreds of Saudi Arabia’s elite late last year in a campaign Riyadh said aimed at rooting out corruption, and took a harsh line against neighbouring Qatar when Saudi Arabia imposed an economic boycott of the Gulf state in June 2017. He also supervised the brief detention, humiliation and beating of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri last year. Turkey’s pro-government newspaper Sabah reported on Tuesday that the luggage of the Saudi team that was sent to Istanbul at the time of Khashoggi’s killing contained syringes, large scissors, staple guns, walkie-talkies, electric shock devices and a signal jammer. It published photos of X-rays of bags taken as the Saudis passed through security checks at the airport when they left. Reuters could not immediately verify the Sabah report. Saudi Arabia initially denied any knowledge or involvement in Khashoggi’s killing, but Saudi public prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb later said it was planned in advance. Another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.

2019-02-08,"TAMPA, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday urged Florida election officials to end a recount and declare his fellow Republicans the winners of disputed races in last week’s elections, while Democrats picked up a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona. U.S. Representative Kyrsten Sinema declared victory and Republican opponent Martha McSally conceded after multiple media outlets called the closely contested Arizona race for the Democrat. Sinema will succeed Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, who did not seek-election. The results will not affect Republican control of the 100-member Senate. Republicans have won at least 51 seats and Democrats 47 in the elections, with results in Florida and Mississippi still outstanding.  In Florida, leads by the Republican candidates in the races for a U.S. Senate seat and the governor’s office shrank as more ballots were tallied following last Tuesday’s elections. State law mandates recounts in elections where the margin of victory is within 0.5 percentage point. As Florida officials scrambled to review more than 8 million ballots by Thursday, Trump, without providing evidence, cast doubt on the recount process. Trump called for an end to the recount even though state rules allow election officials to wait 10 days for absentee ballots submitted by registered voters living outside the United States, including active-duty military personnel. A machine recount began over the weekend in the race between outgoing Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott and Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, with another recount under way for the Florida gubernatorial race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum. Republicans are eager to cement victories in a key battleground state after maintaining their control of the U.S. Senate in last week’s congressional midterm elections, while Democrats are eyeing another possible state governorship win. Each party accused the other of trying to subvert democracy. Scott on Sunday asked a Broward County judge to issue an emergency injunction calling for law enforcement to seize all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots when they are not being used until the end of the recount and any related litigation. Broward County Circuit Judge Jack Tuter, who on Monday rejected Scott’s request for the emergency injunction, urged both sides to be restrained in their public statements as the state faces a repeat of its dramatic role in the 2000 U.S. presidential vote recount. “I am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric,” Tuter said. “Wait until these counts are over and there’ll be time to litigate.” Trump repeated his complaints over the Florida races in a Twitter post on Monday.  The president instead called on state authorities to go with the initial vote count totals. Trump alleged voter fraud had taken place, but provided no evidence. “The Florida Election should be called in favour of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!” he wrote.  Studies have found no evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the United States, although courts have found evidence through the nation’s history of policies intended to suppress voting by minorities. “The fact is that there is no evidence of fraud,” said Marc Elias, the lawyer representing Nelson’s campaign in the recount. “Both judges and the state law enforcement officials have said that.” Nelson on Monday called on Scott to recuse himself from playing any role in overseeing the recount. The Florida secretary of state’s office said it had received reports that election officials in Bay County, a Republican-leaning county home to some 183,500 people that was hard hit by Hurricane Michael, allowed some residents to cast ballots by email and fax. State law makes no provision for voting in that way. “Supervisors of elections are independently elected constitutional officers and it is each supervisor’s responsibility to adhere to the law,” state spokeswoman Sarah Revell said in an email. Florida law gives local election officials until the Saturday after an election to submit their first round of unofficial election results. It is common for elections supervisors to process results well after election night. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which has said it will review allegations of criminal fraud, has stated that it had no active investigations. Scott has said he won the Senate race even as the ballots are tallied again, telling Fox News on Monday: “I want to make sure there’s a free and fair election. But there’s laws. Comply with the laws.” Georgia’s gubernatorial race also remains undecided. Several U.S House of Representative races are also still too close to call after Democrats seized control of the House in last week’s elections.

2019-02-08,"GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Palestinian militants on Monday carried out their most intensive shelling of Israel since the 2014 Gaza war in retaliation for a botched cross-border commando raid, drawing Israeli air strikes against Hamas’ television station and other targets.  The flare-up, in which three Palestinian gunmen and a civilian in Israel were killed, threatened to derail efforts by the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar to broker a long-term truce and head off another major conflict in the impoverished enclave. Hamas, Gaza’s dominant Islamist movement, and other armed factions launched more than 300 rockets or mortar bombs across the border after carrying out a surprise guided-missile attack on a bus that wounded an Israeli soldier, the military said. Sirens in southern Israeli towns and the port of Ashkelon sent residents rushing to bomb shelters. Several homes were hit.  Israel responded with dozens of air strikes against Gaza buildings including a Hamas intelligence compound and the Al-Aqsa Television studios, whose employees had received advance warnings from the military to evacuate.   Egypt urged Israel to back down. The United States, whose peace mediation has been stalled since 2014, condemned Hamas. “The escalation in the past 24 hours is EXTREMELY dangerous and reckless,” tweeted Nickolay Mladenov, a U.N. Middle East envoy. “Rockets must STOP, restraint must be shown by all!” Violence has simmered since Palestinians launched weekly border protests on March 30 to demand the easing of a blockade on Gaza and rights to lands lost in the 1948 war of Israel’s founding. Israeli troops have killed more that 220 Palestinians during the confrontations, which have included border breaches. A Qatari cash infusion of $15 million last week appeared to dampen Gazan anger. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped to reach an “arrangement” to avoid another Gaza war and ease Palestinian economic hardship. But hours later, a botched incursion by undercover Israeli troops in Gaza led to fighting that killed a Hamas commander, six other Palestinian militants and an Israeli colonel. “In response to yesterday’s crime, the joint command of Palestinian factions announce the beginning of bombardment of the enemy’s settlements with scores of rockets,” Hamas said in a statement on Monday. In an apparent attempt to defuse tensions, Israel’s military spokesman said the special forces had not been dispatched to assassinate Hamas commanders, a tactic that led to wider conflict in the past and which has largely been abandoned. Israeli media reports suggested the raid was mounted to gather intelligence. Hamas, which is branded a terrorist group in the West, and Israel have fought three wars in the last decade and neither side appeared keen to precipitate another full-on conflict.  On Monday, Palestinian factions placed the onus on Israel to cease fire, saying they were prepared to increase the range of rocket fire for as long as the air barrage on Gaza persisted. But the Israelis, jarred by dozens of civilian casualties in their border communities, appeared set on deterring Hamas.  Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis, Israel’s military spokesman, said Hamas was “leading Gaza to ruin” and that Israeli attacks on it would “intensify to the degree required”.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States is not too concerned by Europe’s idea for a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to get around U.S. sanctions with Iran as companies are already withdrawing from the country in droves, the senior official for financial intelligence said. “I think the bigger news in Europe is that companies are withdrawing from Iran in droves,” Under Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker told reporters in London when asked about the SPV idea.  “I am not concerned by the SPV actually at all,” she said. “I do believe we are going to find additional mechanisms by which we can work together.” The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. In May, Trump exited Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and Washington reimposed a first round of sanctions on Iran in August. Trump’s moves target Iran’s main source of revenue - its oil exports - as well as its financial sector, essentially making 50 Iranian banks and their subsidiaries off limits to foreign banks on pain of losing access to the U.S. financial system. The Islamic Republic, OPEC’s third-largest producer, called the U.S. moves economic warfare, said they would hit ordinary Iranians and vowed defy the sanctions to sell oil to the world. Voicing opposition to U.S. policy on the day Washington announced a new raft of sanctions on Iran, the European Union earlier this month said it was setting up the so-called special purpose vehicle. “I have do doubt that we will be able to find common ground because the threats are real and the threats are here in Europe,” Mandelker said. She said she hoped the United States and the EU could take joint disruptive action against Iran.  The United States, Mandelker said, would strictly enforce its sanctions on Iran. When asked what was next on Iran, she said: “On Iran, you are going to see a lot more from us.” SWIFT, which facilitates the bulk of global cross-border payments, has already cut off the Iranian central bank and other financial institutions, Mandelker said. “We believe SWIFT has made the right decision to disconnect those entities,” Mandelker said. When asked if that included the Iranian central bank, she said: “Yes.” “We are going to strictly enforce our sanctions, and that’s a message we are sending loud and clear all over Europe to the private sector,” she said. “If there are those who decide not to abide by them then they are going to see action from us.” Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey reacted with fury on Monday after French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said President Tayyip Erdogan was playing a political game over sharing intelligence about the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Le Drian had questioned remarks by Erdogan at the weekend in which he said Turkey gave tapes relating to Khashoggi’s killing to the United States, Saudi Arabia, Germany, France and Britain. Le Drian said he was not aware that France had any tapes. Asked if Erdogan was lying, he said: “He has a political game to play in these circumstances”. That prompted a furious response from Ankara, which insisted it had shared evidence with Paris and said Le Drian’s comments were unacceptable. “Our intelligence shared information with them on Oct 24, including the voice recordings,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. “It is very impudent for them to accuse our president of playing political games.” “What’s behind the remarks of the French foreign minister? I wonder if they are trying to cover up the murder,” he added. The furious Turkish remarks towards France were the most direct public expression yet of a concern in Ankara that Western countries with close commercial relations with Riyadh might soft-pedal their response to the Khashoggi killing. Seeking to clarify Le Drian’s comments, a senior French diplomat later said the minister never commented on intelligence shared between countries and that he was neither confirming or denying French officials having listened to recordings. “What counts for us is to establish the complete truth ... whatever one may think of the recordings the entire truth can’t be based on the Turkish recordings. We are still waiting for elements from the Saudis,” the diplomat said.  The dispute between Ankara and Paris may hinge on Erdogan’s account that Turkey “gave” recordings to the other countries.  Turkish officials said instead that France had been allowed to hear a recording, and blamed France for the misunderstanding. “If there is miscommunication between the French government’s various agencies, it is up to the French authorities – not Turkey — to take care of that problem,” Erdogan’s communications director Fahrettin Altun said. Khashoggi, a critic of de facto Saudi ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate last month in what Erdogan calls a murder ordered at the “highest levels” of the Saudi government. Saudi authorities have acknowledged that the killing was premeditated. CIA director Gina Haspel heard an audio recording of Khashoggi’s death when she visited Istanbul, two sources told Reuters last month. U.S. President Donald Trump and Erdogan have discussed how to respond to the killing. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday Canadian intelligence officers have also listened to recordings of what happened to Khashoggi.  “We are in discussions with our like-minded allies as to the next steps with regard to Saudi Arabia,” Trudeau said. Khashoggi’s murder provoked international outrage but so far little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia.

2019-02-08,"YANGON (Reuters) - Amnesty International has withdrawn its most prestigious human rights prize from Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing the Myanmar leader of perpetuating human rights abuses by not speaking out about violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Once hailed as a champion in the fight for democracy, Suu Kyi has been stripped of a series of international honours over a Rohingya exodus that began in August 2017. More than 700,000 members of the mostly stateless group fled across Myanmar’s western border into Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched a crackdown in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on the security forces. U.N.-mandated investigators have accused the military of unleashing a campaign of killings, rape and arson with “genocidal intent”.  Suu Kyi’s administration rejected the findings as one-sided, and said the military action was engaged in a legitimate counterinsurgency operation. The international human rights group named Suu Kyi as its 2009 Ambassador of Conscience Award recipient when she was still under house arrest for her opposition to Myanmar’s oppressive military junta. In the eight years since she was released, Suu Kyi led her party to election victory in 2015 and set up a government the following year, but she has to share power with generals and has no oversight over the security forces. Amnesty International said in a statement on Tuesday she had failed to speak out and had “shielded the security forces from accountability” for the violence against the Rohingya, calling it a “shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for”. The global advocacy organisation’s secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, wrote to Suu Kyi on Sunday saying the group was withdrawing the award because it was “profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defence of human rights”. Zaw Htay, the Myanmar government’s main spokesman, did not pick up Reuters calls seeking comment on Monday.  In March, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum rescinded its top award from Suu Kyi and she has had other honours withdrawn, including the freedom of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England, over the Rohingya crisis.  In September, Canada’s parliament voted to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship. Critics have called for her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to be withdrawn but the foundation that oversees the award said it would not do so. Amnesty International also said Suu Kyi had not condemned military abuses in conflicts between the army and ethnic minority guerrillas in northern Myanmar and her government had imposed restrictions on access by humanitarian groups. Her government had also failed to stop attacks on freedom of speech, it said.

2019-02-08,"GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Sunday in air strikes and an undercover raid that Hamas said targeted one of its commanders and the Israeli military said left one of its officers dead. The Israeli incursion and air attacks drew rocket fire from the Hamas-controlled enclave, with sirens sounding in Israeli communities along the border. The military said its defences intercepted two of the launches. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage on the Israeli side of the frontier. The violence prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short a visit to Paris, where he had been gathering with world leaders for a World War One commemoration. Hamas said the incident began when assailants in a passing car opened fire on a group of its armed men, killing one of its commanders. Hamas gunmen gave chase as the car sped back towards the border with Israel, Hamas said in a statement. During the pursuit, Israeli aircraft fired more than 40 missiles in the area, according to witnesses. Medics and Hamas officials said at least seven people were killed, four of them militants, including Hamas commander Nour Baraka. It was unclear if the other fatalities included gunmen. The Israeli military said in a statement that: “During an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) Special Forces operational activity in the Gaza Strip, an exchange of fire evolved.” One officer was killed and a second was wounded, it said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.T) will hold an investor vote on its $62 billion acquisition of Shire SHP.L next month and aims to close the deal on Jan. 8, signaling its confidence in securing the required support. Shares in London-listed Shire rose 3 percent on the news, hitting their highest level since Takeda first disclosed its interest in buying the rare diseases specialist in March.   The deal would be the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company - but it needs two-thirds support from shareholders, some of whom are worried about the enlarged company’s resulting debt burden. Takeda said on Monday it would hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders to vote on the transaction on Dec. 5. Previously, Takeda had said it hoped to hold the EGM early in 2019, leaving uncertain the level of backing for the deal, which has been opposed by some members of the founding Takeda family. “With the date of our extraordinary general meeting of shareholders now set, we are looking forward to continue our dialogue with shareholders regarding the compelling strategic and financial benefits of this transaction,” Chief Executive Christophe Weber said. Weber — a Frenchman and the first non-Japanese CEO of the company — believes that buying Shire will accelerate Takeda’s growth and increase its international reach, boosting earnings. The transaction is still awaiting approval from European regulators, although two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Takeda was set to win conditional EU antitrust approval. Takeda has offered to divest Shire’s experimental drug SHP647 to address concerns about overlap in inflammatory bowel disease treatments.   The takeover has already secured clearance from regulators in the United States, Japan, China and Brazil. Weber said last week he was confident of securing investor backing for the purchase of Shire, but until now it has not been clear when exactly Takeda would call its EGM. Takeda, which has a market value of around $32 billion, has secured a $30.9 billion bridge loan to help finance the Shire acquisition and some investors are concerned as to how well it will cope with debt repayments. The Japanese company struck its agreement to take over Shire in May, in a deal that will propel it into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers by sales. However, the enlarged group faces significant challenges, particularly in hemophilia, where a new drug from Roche (ROG.S) and the prospect of new gene therapies now in development threaten a key part of Shire’s existing business.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The leader of the German Social Democrats’ youth wing said on Monday that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition with the SPD will not survive the next year.  The awkward alliance has been marred by disputes about immigration and the fate of the domestic spy chief since it took office in March, coming close to collapse twice. Voters punished both Merkel’s conservatives and the SPD in two recent regional elections. SPD youth wing leader Kevin Kuehnert, who campaigned against the conservative-SPD tie-up from the outset, said the SPD would be closely watching what happens when Merkel steps down as leader of her Christian Democrats (CDU) in December. “Next year is full of (regional) elections and political developments that will have a big impact,” Kuehnert told Deutschlandfunk radio. “I can hardly imagine us sticking together for the year. We have to use our time to prepare for the ‘D-Day’ of snap elections.” Kuehnert said he hardly knew anyone who believed the coalition would survive to the end of this parliament in 2021. SPD leader Andrea Nahles has said that the SPD leadership, under pressure from a restive membership over flagging polls and disastrous regional election showings, did not discuss quitting the coalition at a meeting last Monday. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, the leader of Merkel’s Bavarian allies and a critic of her liberal asylum policies, told members of his Christian Social Union (CSU) that he wants to resign as party chief, party sources told Reuters on Sunday. Seehofer has been a thorn in Merkel’s side for much of the past three years, taking a hard line on immigration. Senior CSU member Manfred Weber told the newspaper Bild that Seehofer had said on Sunday that 2019 would be a year of renewal and the CSU leader would announce further details this week.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May cannot expect the opposition Labour Party to save her in a parliamentary vote on any Brexit deal, Emily Thornberry, Labour’s foreign affairs policy chief, said on Sunday. “What we’ve said is that you cannot simply come to the House of Commons with a bit of nonsense ... you cannot expect the Labour Party to save you from your own backbenchers,” Thornberry told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, saying Labour would vote against any deal that did not meet its tests. “If May loses the vote in parliament, Thornberry said: “First stage is we demand a general election ... if we don’t get a general election, then what we have said is all options remain on the table.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/may-cannot-expect-labour-to-save-her-brexit-vote-thornberry-idUKKCN1NG0C4,2019-02-08,"British Prime Minister Theresa May cannot expect the opposition Labour Party to save her in a parliamentary vote on any Brexit deal, Emily Thornberry, Labour's foreign affairs policy chief, said on Sunday.",May cannot expect Labour to save her Brexit vote - Thornberry
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May was under growing pressure on Sunday to change her plan for Britain to leave the European Union to avoid defeat in a parliamentary vote. With both Britain and the EU suggesting an agreement is close, eurosceptic lawmakers and a leading member of a small Northern Irish party that props up her Conservative government made new threats to vote against the terms of the deal she is working on with Brussels.  The vote in parliament, most likely to come later this year, is gearing up to be the biggest showdown in the lengthy negotiations to leave the EU, Britain’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years. May, who was attending a ceremony to mark 100 years since the end of World War One, found some support from ministers in her cabinet, but it would be hard for her to ignore the growing calls to change tack after a minister resigned and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party threatened to rebel. “If the government makes the historic mistake of prioritising placating the EU over establishing an independent and whole UK, then regrettably we must vote against the deal,” Steve Baker, a leading eurosceptic and former minister, wrote alongside the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. The main battleground is over a so-called backstop to prevent the return of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland, something that would only come into force if a deal on future ties cannot guarantee the type of frictionless trade needed to keep it open. Fears that proposals would mean keeping Britain inside the EU’s customs union indefinitely or that Northern Ireland would have to accept different rules and regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom have focused opposition to May’s deal. Eurosceptics have long criticised May’s proposals, but it was the resignation of Jo Johnson, the remain-voting younger brother to Brexit campaign leader Boris Johnson, that highlighted the depth of anger over her plans. Many say May’s desire to prioritise free flowing trade of goods with the rest of Europe will make Britain little more than a “rule taker”, unable to break free of Brussels’ decisions. Comments by Education Minister Damian Hinds will also do little to temper those concerns. He told the BBC Britain could not push for a deal giving London the sole right to say when it was ready to leave any backstop arrangement. “The prime minister has to negotiate something which is negotiable with the other side as well as working for people here,” Hinds said. But May did find some support. Both he, and the eurosceptic leader of the lower house of parliament, Andrea Leadsom, said they supported the prime minister. “I mean to support the prime minister to get a Brexit that works for the United Kingdom and the EU, keeps our country together and delivers on the referendum,” said Leadsom, who some media reported was considering quitting her post. She said she did not expect further resignations, adding: “I do urge colleagues to support the prime minister. We are at a very difficult stage ... but it is a negotiation, so what we have to do is to hold our nerve and keep negotiating.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-critics/change-tack-or-face-defeat-brexit-critics-tell-may-idUKKCN1NG0FH,2019-02-08,,"Change tack or face defeat, Brexit critics tell May"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Less than five months before Britain leaves the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May’s parliamentary enforcers are on the prowl. For now, the government “whips” whose job it is to ensure parliament backs whatever Brexit deal May agrees with Brussels are taking a softly-softly approach. But Chief Whip Julian Smith and his team have a powerful armoury at their disposal to force politicians into line.   With an agreement most likely to go before lawmakers later this year, May’s team and the whips she appointed are quietly sounding out who might vote against it, several politicians told Reuters. Lacking a parliamentary majority, May is hostage not only to her bitterly divided Conservative Party over Brexit but also to the Northern Irish party that props up her government. It was never going to be easy, but is looking even more  difficult after the resignation on Friday of Jo Johnson, a transport minister and brother to leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson. There are also suggestions that others in government may follow and that there could be a rebellion by the Democratic Unionist Party. So far, the whips’ tactics show no sign of success.  To persuade them to support the government, some eurosceptic Conservatives have been wined and dined, including at May’s Downing Street office. Others, including some members of the opposition Labour Party, have been invited to private meetings at which they have been asked their opinions and subjected to painstaking explanations of the prime minister’s position. “I am not going to change my mind, no matter how nice a dinner might be,” said one Conservative lawmaker on condition of anonymity, explaining that he had refused three invitations to Downing Street for such a meal. “Clearly they are trying to pick off people who they think might be malleable ... but frankly first of all, before they get to that point, they should be able to explain what the government is going to do, and at the moment no one has a clue.” Government and opposition parties each have their own whips — a term with its roots in fox-hunting that dates back to 1742 and refers to the “whipping” of lawmakers to get them to attend votes and support the party line.      They also act as tellers for parliamentary votes and manage the pairing system with rival parties that ensures genuine absences do not skew votes in parliament.  Smith outraged lawmakers in July when he told some Conservatives to break a pairing arrangement, in what May said was “an honest mistake”. One then voted with the government at a key Brexit vote even though his Liberal Democrat “pair” was away as she had just given birth. Tactics used by whips in the past are the stuff of parliamentary legend. A series of votes on the Maastricht Treaty on deeper EU integration in the early 1990s brought reports of blackmail, threats to expose lawmakers’ indiscretions and even physical “manhandling” to win support. One former Conservative Chief Whip, Gavin Williamson, kept a pet tarantula on his desk — named Cronus after the Greek god who ate his own children. He once said that while he preferred the carrot to the stick, “it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot”.  Such practices have inspired television shows such as the British and U.S. versions of House of Cards. But for many in parliament now, such behaviour bears little resemblance to the reality of everyday political life. The strongest coercion so far over the Brexit vote, lawmakers say, has been the promise of budget sweeteners to curry favour. “They can make your life difficult,” said one lawmaker,  recounting how the whips once refused him permission to be absent from parliament for a family celebration because he would have missed a vote.  The whips can also threaten to put wavering lawmakers on “boring procedural committees” or block any career promotion, another member of parliament said. Defying a strict “three-line” whip can lead to a lawmaker’s temporary expulsion from their party in parliament.   The whips themselves must support the party line or quit. May has promised to give parliament a say over Brexit, Britain’s biggest foreign and trade policy shift in decades. If lawmakers vote down the deal she agrees, Britain could leave the EU without clarity on the terms of its departure, causing uncertainty for businesses and trade and making a challenge to May’s leadership or an early election more likely. May says the agreement with Brussels is 95 percent complete, although how to prevent a return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland remains a sticking point in talks and within her cabinet.  And while even winning the backing of her top ministers for any deal is a struggle, her main challenge will be securing the support of parliament, where divisions opened by Britain’s 2016 referendum to leave the EU have become deeply entrenched. In the 650-member lower chamber, May has a working majority of 13 only with the support of Northern Ireland’s DUP. Their “confidence and supply” deal was negotiated by the two parties’ whips after a June 2017 election produced a hung parliament.  More than 50 Conservative lawmakers have said they reject May’s so-called Chequers plan and at the weekend, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party could not support her proposals as they now stand. The prime minister may have to break with tradition and rely on support from the Labour Party. With “the ink drying” on a deal, as one eurosceptic lawmaker described it, minds are increasingly focussed. “I couldn’t support the Chequers proposals, and they have been further diluted through negotiations with the European Union, so I will not be able to vote for the final deal,” said Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative lawmaker and Brexit supporter. He told Reuters the deal that is taking shape would not allow Britain to do full trade deals including goods and failed to hand back power to parliament from “unelected eurocrats”. The whips, whose work is largely behind the scenes and who do not give interviews, will need to crush similar dissent to get the vote passed. For now, they are not indicating how they will do this.  Asked whether he would change his mind if the whips applied pressure, Bridgen said: “I don’t think the whips will bother trying to turn nasty on me. They know from experience that it won’t work.” But other lawmakers say the heat will only be turned up when a deal is done. “I think their conversations with colleagues are a bit premature anyway,” said one. “But once we do know what the (government is) going to do, by and large people will have pretty fixed positions.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-whips/softly-softly-for-now-mays-enforcers-gear-up-for-big-brexit-vote-idUKKCN1NG067,2019-02-08,,"Softly, softly for now, May's enforcers gear up for big Brexit vote"
2019-02-08,"BAGHDAD/ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iraq’s oilfields in the disputed Kirkuk region have taken on new significance after the United States restored oil sanctions against neighboring Iran. Washington is pressuring Baghdad to resume exports that stopped last year. Iraq aims to raise its export capacity to 8.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the coming years from less than 5 million bpd currently, 1 million of which could come via Kirkuk. But that resumption is not just a question of turning the tap back on.  Volume and revenue. The halting of exports from Kirkuk stopped nearly 300,000 bpd flowing out of Iraq towards Turkey and international markets - causing a net revenue loss of some $8 billion since the stoppage last year. Most of Iraq’s exports come from southern fields, but Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The United States also sees Kirkuk as an option to help offset global shortfall in oil supply caused by its sanctions on Iran, which forbid purchasing Iranian oil. Washington has pressured Baghdad to suspend all shipments of oil to Iran and resume flows from Kirkuk to Turkey, industry sources say. Exports have been on hold since October 2017 when Iraqi government forces took control of Kirkuk from the semi-autonomous Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq, in response to a referendum calling for Kurdish independence. The Kurds had controlled Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces in turn ejected the militants. Resumption of exports from Kirkuk depends on negotiations between Baghdad and the Kurds. The pipeline Baghdad once used for exports via Turkey was wrecked by Islamic State - leaving only one working pipeline, built and controlled by the Kurds. Iraq’s government must use that, or build a new pipeline. It is considering both options. On paper, Baghdad. But if Iraq decides to use the Kurdish pipeline to export oil, it needs to negotiate. The Kurds will likely seek a greater share of Iraqi state oil revenue in return. Baghdad might also have to contend with Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), which bought the Kurdish section of the pipeline last year. As soon as Baghdad and the Kurds reach an agreement - hence U.S. pressure to do so. If no deal is reached, Iraq will have to build the new pipeline, which could take around two years. The Rosneft pipeline has been upgraded to a capacity of 1 million bpd, which could accommodate a current 400,000 bpd coming from other oilfields in Kurdistan, plus the 300,000 bpd that would come from Kirkuk, Kurdish authorities say. Iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries - where Kirkuk’s current output is being diverted - so even if exports from Kirkuk resume, they won’t exceed 100,000 bpd at first, meaning total exports via Kurdistan would be only 500,000 bpd. That would be smaller than peak Kurdish exports of 700,000 bpd before the failed referendum and not enough to help Turkey cut its reliance on Iranian oil.   Iraq and Iran were exchanging only small volumes of oil before the new sanctions - around 30,000 bpd in each direction, including from Kirkuk - but Iraq’s economy as a whole is highly dependent on trade with Iran. Iranian gas supplies feed Iraqi power stations, for example.  Washington has given Iraq a waiver for Iranian gas as well as food items, but says this is only temporary, causing uncertainty in Baghdad.

2019-02-08,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - The charred remains of 14 more people have been found in and around a Northern California town overrun by flames from a massive wildfire, officials said on Saturday, raising the death toll to at least 23. The bodies were recovered in and around Paradise, a mountain community some 90 miles (145 km) north of Sacramento that has been left devastated by the Camp Fire, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott Maclean said.  Maclean said no details were immediately available about the circumstances of the deaths and that the victims’ badly burned condition would make identification difficult.  The Camp Fire burned down more than 6,700 homes and businesses in Paradise, more structures than any other California wildfire on record, and the death toll, which could still rise, also makes it one of the deadliest. Only the Griffith Park Fire in 1933 and Tunnel Fire in 1991 have claimed more lives. Several of the bodies discovered earlier this week were found in or near burned out cars, police have said. The flames descended on Paradise so fast that many people were forced to abandon their vehicles and run for their lives down the sole road through the mountain town.  An additional 35 people have been reported missing and three firefighters have been injured. It was not immediately clear if any of the missing were among those found dead.  As of Saturday afternoon, the Camp Fire had blackened more than 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) at the edge of the Plumas National Forest. Crews had cut containment lines around about 20 percent of the blaze. About 500 miles (800 km) to the south, the Woolsey Fire burning in the foothills above Malibu doubled in size over Friday night into Saturday, threatening thousands of homes after triggering mandatory evacuation orders for a quarter million people in the upscale beach city as well as other communities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.  The fire has destroyed at least 177 homes and other structures with a full count still under way, and has now charred more than 83,000 acres as of late Saturday, officials said in a release. “Our firefighters have been facing some extreme, tough fire conditions that they said that they’ve never seen in their lives,” said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby. He said crews hoped to take advantage of a lull on Saturday in the fierce Santa Ana winds driving the flames, but that gusts could return on Sunday.    All 13,000 residents of Malibu, which is 30 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, were told to get out on Friday.   Two bodies were discovered in the community on Saturday but it was too early to determine if they died from the Woolsey fire or another cause, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department officials said.  Firefighters took advantage of a lull in winds on Saturday to build containment lines around five percent of the conflagration but warned that gusts were expected to pick up again on Sunday.  The Woolsey Fire broke out on Thursday in Ventura County near Los Angeles and quickly jumped the 101 Freeway, a major north-south artery, in several places. On Friday, it crossed the Santa Monica Mountains towards Malibu, where flames driven by wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) raced down hillsides and through canyons towards multi-million dollar homes.  Early on Saturday, flames approached Malibu’s Pepperdine University, a private residential college with 7,700 students, where many remained sheltered on the main campus.  School officials told the students that they have been assured by fire officials that the university’s buildings were built to withstand fire.  Among those forced to flee the Malibu area were celebrities including Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian, who said on Twitter that flames had damaged the home she shares in nearby Calabasas with Kanye West. In Ventura County, most of the town of Thousand Oaks was ordered evacuated, adding to the anguish days after a gunman killed 12 people in a shooting rampage at a bar. President Donald Trump, weighing in on the emergency during a trip to France, said early on Saturday that “gross mismanagement of forests” was to blame. “There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,” he wrote in a Twitter post. Trump, a Republican, has previously blamed California officials for fires and threatened to withhold funding, saying the state should do more to remove rotten trees and other debris that fuel blazes. State officials have blamed climate change and say many of the burn areas have been in federally-managed lands. “Our focus is on the Californians impacted by these fires and the first responders and firefighters working around the clock to save lives and property - not on the President’s inane and uninformed tweets,”  said Evan Westrub, a spokesman for California Governor Jerry Brown.

Asked what he meant when he tweeted that he felt insulted by Macron’s comments that Europe should reduce its dependence on the United States for security, Trump said: “We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now the burden sharing has been largely on the United States.”   Macron said he shared Trump’s view that Europe needed to finance a greater share of the NATO military alliance’s costs. “That’s why I do believe my proposals for European defence are fully consistent with that,” he said, speaking in English.   The two leaders would discuss issues including Iran, the conflicts in Syria and Yemen, climate change and trade during an hour-long meeting, Macron said.

2019-02-08,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the gunman who killed  12 people in a crowded South California bar this week was a “very, very sick guy,” as investigators tried to determine what could have motivated the 28-year-old Marine combat veteran. Even as Thousand Oaks, a suburb 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, mourned the dead, the city faced a fresh threat on Friday as wildfires raged in the area, forcing thousands of people from their homes. Victims of Wednesday night’s rampage in the city of Thousand Oaks included an 18-year-old freshman student at Pepperdine University, a security guard at the bar, a graduate of California Lutheran University and a Marine Corps veteran. Ian David Long, who served with the Marines in Afghanistan, walked into the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was packed with dancing college students, and opened fire, fatally shooting 12 people before apparently killing himself, law enforcement officials said. CNN reported that Long had written on Facebook around the time of the massacre: “I hope people call me insane ... wouldn’t that just be a big ball of irony?” He added, “Yeah.. I’m insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is ‘hopes and prayers’.. and wonder why these keep happening.” Long’s Facebook page appears to have since been deleted. “He is a very sick puppy,” Trump said of the gunman, speaking at the White House before leaving on a trip to Paris. The FBI was seeking a motive for the country’s latest mass shooting. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told reporters on Thursday that Long may have suffered from PTSD. “He was a Marine, he was in the war, he served time, he saw some pretty bad things,” Trump said. “And a lot of people say he had PTSD and it’s a tough deal.” Richard Berge, who lived near Long and looked after his mother’s dogs, told Reuters she had told him earlier this year she worried her son might take his own life but did not fear he would hurt her. The Thousand Oaks massacre took place less than two weeks after a man shot dead 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, fueling the debate over gun ownership in America.  One of the dead, Telemachus Orfanos, had survived the mass shooting at a country music concert in October 2017 in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, the worst such incident in modern U.S. history, ABC News said, citing a friend. It was time for politicians to act, Orfanos’ mother, Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, told ABC News. “I don’t want prayers. I don’t want thoughts,” she said. “I want gun control and I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers.” The shooting came a day after the election of a Democratic governor who has pushed for tighter gun control in a state that already has some of the strictest firearms laws in the country. The wildfire that started on Thursday has destroyed some homes on the outskirts of Thousand Oaks and forced the mandatory evacuations of 75,000 people, as well as closing some highways. A large plume of smoke grew on the horizon to the northeast of the city on Friday. Andrea Campbell Conant, a public relations executive who grew up in Thousand Oaks, said even as she drove to one of the vigils for the 12 people killed on Wednesday night roads had begun to close. “It’s almost like we haven’t had enough time to process how we feel,” she said in a telephone interview as she described a head-spinning shift from a tear-filled vigil to her and her friends getting calls from relatives who needed help after getting evacuation orders.  Although mass shootings have become commonplace in modern American life, Wednesday’s carnage still came as a shock to the 127,000 residents of Thousand Oaks, which was named the third safest city in the United States for 2018 by the Niche research company. Heather Wynalda, 47, in Conejo Valley, a few miles west of Thousand Oaks, said her brother’s home had burned but he and his family were safe. “It’s just devastating,” she said via Facebook messenger. “This community pulled together so beautifully in the midst of yesterday’s shooting ... and today, it is being frantically scattered in an effort to escape the fires.” Evacuation centers have been set up in Thousand Oaks, including a teen center where frantic parents awaited news of their children after Wednesday’s shooting. Pepperdine University, which held a prayer service in Malibu following the shooting, said Friday it was closing its Malibu and Calabasas campuses due to the wildfires.

2019-02-08,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - This week’s fatal shooting of 12 people in a California bar by a Marine combat veteran came the day after the election of a new Democratic governor who has pushed for tighter gun control in the state, which already has some of the strictest firearms laws in the country. Ian David Long, 28, used a .45 caliber Glock handgun equipped with a high-capacity magazine to mow down patrons late on Wednesday in the bar and dance hall filled with college students, authorities said. The shooting raised questions about the efficacy of existing gun safety laws as Gavin Newsom, a two-term lieutenant governor closely aligned with gun control advocates, prepares to take the helm in the most populous U.S. state following his election victory on Tuesday. “He’s been such a champion on this issue so we expect to see more innovation from the legislators and approved by Gavin Newsom,” said Laura Cutilletta, legal director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By “champion” she was referring to the former San Francisco mayor’s avid support of gun safety regulations,  Two years ago, Newsom co-authored a gun control ballot initiative that sought to extend the state’s ban on the sale and transfer of high-capacity magazines to include those owned before the original legislation, passed in 1999, went into effect. Those magazines were “grandfathered” into the law.  Newsom’s measure was challenged in a lawsuit supported by the National Rifle Association, and the courts put on hold the provision relating to high-capacity magazines. Newsom on Thursday vowed to push for even stricter laws.  Though he provided no specifics, he signalled a shift from  outgoing Governor Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, who vetoed numerous gun control measures, including a bill to tighten the state’s law against assault weapons. “The response is not just prayers,” the governor-elect said at a news conference on Thursday, referring to the shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, 40 miles (64 km) northwest of Los Angeles. “The response cannot just be excuses. The response sure as hell cannot be more guns.” High-capacity magazines allow shooters to unleash prolonged torrents of bullets and reduce the need to re-load. Gun rights advocates have argued that such magazines help people defend their homes from intruders. But gun safety supporters say banning them would force perpetrators of mass shootings to pause and reload, creating an opening for law enforcement to respond. It was not immediately clear how or when Long obtained his gun and magazine. He was a small child when California banned the sale of high-capacity magazines and would not have been able to legally own a gun or ammunition, said Chuck Michel, a lawyer representing gun owners challenging California’s ban. Long, he said, could have easily gone to another state to purchase a high-capacity magazine for his Glock. He also could have stolen one. Numerous other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., ban the sale of high-capacity magazines, according to the Giffords website. California requires background checks for gun purchasers, keeps records of transactions, and in January is set to begin background checks for purchasers of ammunition. Earlier this year, officers went to Long’s home to answer a disturbance call and found him agitated, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Mental health specialists talked with Long and determined that no further action was necessary. Still, Dean told reporters on Thursday that Long, who apparently killed himself in the bar, may have suffered from PTSD. While Newsom on Thursday did not say what additional gun control measures he wanted to pursue, many gun rights advocates are bracing for an onslaught of new regulations under the incoming governor. “Gavin Newsom has never met a gun ban he didn’t like,” Michel said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - It is a moment many Californians have come to dread: Seeing smoke from one of the state’s increasingly devastating wildfires approaching and knowing they may soon be forced to leave their homes, perhaps forever.  For residents of the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, that moment came at the end of a gut-wrenching week in which a combat veteran entered a local bar and killed a dozen people in the kind of mass shooting that has become increasingly commonplace in the United States. Andrea Campbell Conant, a public relations executive who grew up in Thousand Oaks, said on Friday that roads had begun to close as a precaution, even as she drove to one of the vigils for victims of Wednesday night’s shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill. “It’s almost like we haven’t had enough time to process how we feel,” she said in a phone interview, describing a head-spinning shift from a tear-filled vigil to fielding calls from friends and relatives in need of help after receiving evacuation orders. Authorities have ordered some 75,000 homes near Thousand Oaks evacuated as the 14,000-acre (5,700-hectare) Woolsey Fire approached. The blaze broke out on Thursday northeast of the town located about 40 miles (64 km) north of downtown Los Angeles. Conant’s father, Jesse Campbell, was among those ordered to leave his home, just four blocks from the Borderline, where an ex-Marine walked in on Wednesday night and opened fire before turning the gun on himself, according to authorities. “We had to wake up in the middle of the night and leave,” Campbell, a retired cook and party planner, said in a phone interview, referring to the wildfire evacuation. He and his wife, who have lived in Thousand Oaks for 34 years, took refuge in a nearby shopping centre before returning to their home later on Friday. As the inferno approached in the hours after the attack, Campbell recalled seeing people with blank faces wherever he turned - at the gym, at the gas station, all over town. “A lot of people didn’t really know what to do,” he said. Heather Wynalda, 47, said her brother and his family lost their home to the fire, only a day or so after her niece and nephew heard the screams and gunshots from the Borderline Bar while visiting their mother’s house nearby. “It’s just devastating,” she wrote in a message to Reuters. “This community pulled together so beautifully in the midst of yesterday’s shooting.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - With less than five months left before Britain and the European Union officially part ways, there remains a one-in-four chance the sides fail to reach a deal on the terms of departure, according to economists polled by Reuters this week. The EU would have to see a breakthrough on Brexit within a week if its leaders are to endorse any deal with Britain this month, several official and diplomatic sources in Brussels told Reuters on Wednesday. Britain’s land border with Ireland has proved a major stumbling block between the two sides and with time running out to reach a resolution, the chance of no deal being agreed by March 29 - when the two sides are due to divorce - has held steady at October’s 25 percent. It has been between 20 and 30 percent since Reuters began asking in July 2017. Forecasts in the latest poll ranged from 5 to 75 percent. “Both sides have every incentive to ensure that the UK does not leave the EU in a disorderly fashion in March,” said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.  If Prime Minister Theresa May fails to reach agreement with Brussels - or parliament votes it down - then Britain faces leaving the EU without a divorce deal and thus without a transition period, leading to economic disruption. Britain and the EU are in the closing stages of talks, British interior minister Sajid Javid said on Thursday but Ireland’s foreign minister tried to dampen expectations a Brexit deal might be imminent. “The risk of a disorderly Brexit is rising. It looks to be Theresa May’s strategy to postpone decisions until everyone has its back against the wall,” said Stefan Koopman at Rabobank. “This is a very risky approach, as the complex dynamics in the UK parliament make ratification particularly uncertain.” Still, the most likely eventual relationship is they settle for a free trade agreement, as has been predicted since Reuters first began polling on this two years ago. In second place was leaving without an agreement and trading under basic World Trade Organization rules. Holding in third was Britain being a member of the European Economic Area, paying into the EU budget to maintain access to the EU’s single market. Again, least likely was Brexit being cancelled. No respondent pegged this as most likely. While the anticipated post-referendum recession never materialised, economic growth has slowed and is predicted to be 1.3 percent this year, the poll of 70 economists found.  Incorporating their expectations for Brexit, economists’ consensus forecast is for growth to accelerate to 1.5 percent next year and hold there in 2020, still slower than where it was running up to the 2016 referendum to leave the EU. 2019 growth forecasts ranged from 0.5 to 2.2 percent. “The economy fared better than expected in 2018, after a very weak first quarter, but momentum was slowed by weak investment amid Brexit-related uncertainty,” noted economists at UBS.  “Assuming the UK and EU can strike a Withdrawal Agreement and that Parliament ratifies it in advance of the end-March 2019 deadline, that uncertainty will be alleviated for a time. As a result, we expect GDP to accelerate.” When asked about the chance of a recession in the coming year, economists have a median response of 23 percent - barely changed from last month. When asked about one within the next two years they said 30 percent. Inflation jumped in the wake of the June 2016 referendum - mostly driven by a fall in sterling - and is expected to hold above the Bank of England’s 2 percent target until late 2019. Yet as a deal has not been made respondents mostly said the central bank would wait until at least April before raising borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 1.0 percent. Policymakers won’t then increase them again until early 2020, when they will add another 25 basis points, the poll said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - A police veteran, college students and the niece of an actress were among the victims of a deadly shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, a suburb 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. A gunman identified as Ian David Long fatally shot 12 people before he apparently killed himself, law enforcement officials said. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department had not released an official list of all victims as of Friday but family members, friends and local media outlets have identified them. Ron Helus Helus, a Ventura County Sheriff’s Office sergeant and 29-year police veteran, was among the first officers to arrive at the bar to confront the gunman. Police officials said he was planning to retire within the next couple of years. Helus, 54, was an avid fisher, according to photos on his Facebook profile. The sheriff’s office said he left behind a wife and son. Daniel Manrique Manrique, 33, a Marine Corps veteran like the shooter, worked to help other veterans reacclimate to civilian life as head of his local chapter of Team Red, White and Blue, a national veterans community organisation. “I have no doubt that he died a hero, shielding others from gunshots,” a relative, Gladys Manrique Koscak, said on Facebook. “He will forever be our hero, son, brother, and the best uncle anybody could ever ask for.”    Telemachus Orfanos Orfanos, of Thousand Oaks, had survived the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017 in which 58 people died, said his friend, Carl Edgar, 24, of Los Angeles.  “Tel was charismatic, funny, always putting a smile on people’s faces, always protecting everyone, making sure that everyone was taken care of,” Edgar said. His mother, Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, told ABC News on Friday that she wants gun control legislation now. “I don’t want prayers. I don’t want thoughts,” she said. “I want gun control and I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers.” Cody Coffman  Jason Coffman told reporters on Thursday that his 22-year-old son, Cody, was among the dead, adding that his son was outgoing, outspoken and the kind of man who would act heroically.  “I cannot believe it’s happened to my family, Jason Coffman said. “I’m speechless and heartbroken.”  Noel Sparks Sparks was identified as one of the victims by United Methodist Church Westlake Village, where she had been a part of their congregation. One of her friends, Sarah Penrose, wrote online that Sparks left behind a “legacy of selfless-servitude.” “She was always so joyful to help others and fill needs,” Penrose said. “Wishing I could have spent more time with her before this happened.” Alaina Housley  Pepperdine University student Housley, 18, niece of actress and talk show host Tamera Mowry-Housley, was kind, smart, beautiful and respectful, her parents said in a statement. “She would have enjoyed the public debate that is certain to happen after this tragedy,” the statement said. “But she would have insisted that it be respectful with an eye toward solving these senseless shootings.”  Sean Adler Adler was a security guard at the Borderline Bar and the owner of Rivalry Roasters, a coffee shop that opened in last year in nearby Simi Valley, according to one of his close friends, Karen Cormier, on Facebook.  “We’re devastated,” Cormier said.  Marky Meza Meza, 20, grew up in Santa Barbara and Carpinteria, northwest of Thousand Oaks, according to local television station KEYT. “Marky was a loving and wonderful young man who was full of life and ambition,” his family said in a statement to the station. It added that Meza was just about to turn 21. Justin Meek A California Lutheran University graduate, Meek had “heroically saved lives” before being gunned down in the incident, according to reports by NBC News, citing university officials. Meek enjoyed Borderline because he loved line dancing and even founded Cal Lutheran’s line dancing club. “He was a phenomenal singer, a phenomenal dancer and a phenomenal friend,” said Carl Edgar, who was friends with Meek. Kristina Morisette Morisette worked as the cashier at the Borderline, ABC13 reported.  “Kristina was just a ball of life,” said her friend Alexis Tait, 23. “If you were upset or in a bad mood, she was the person that would cheer you up even if she was upset. She would always put other people before herself.” Blake Dingman Dingman had played baseball at the Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks, according to the school’s website.  “We were really proud of him,” his aunt, Janet Dingman, told local media. “He was a really fun, energetic and loving nephew.” Jake Dunham Dunham, 21, of Newbury Park, California, was a close friend of Dingman’s, ABC News reported, citing family.  “Rest In Peace Jake. You were such a cool person. I wish you didn’t have to go it’s not fair at all,” Aaron Letulier wrote on Twitter on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Reuters) - Alicia Wagner says she moved her family six years ago from the affluent Los Angeles-area enclave of Pacific Palisades to the sleepier and more distant Thousand Oaks, in the Santa Monica Mountains, away from urban hustle and bustle. “We wanted a quieter, more peaceful lifestyle,” said Wagner 46, a photo archivist who shares a spacious, two-story home with her husband, Steve Vincent, 55, a Walt Disney Co executive, their five children and two large dogs in the Westlake Village community. Thousand Oaks, known to locals as “T.O.” and named for the abundance of trees that dot the sprawling city of 127,000 people in the foothills of the Conejo Valley, has long been touted as one of the lowest-crime municipalities of its size in America. It was named the third-safest city in the United States this year by Niche, a real estate research firm that ranks communities by school quality, income, crime and other factors. That reputation was shattered late Wednesday night when a gunman identified by authorities as a Marine combat veteran opened fire in a crowded nightclub, the Borderline Bar and Grill, killing 12 people. He was later found dead inside, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “This is not a place anyone would ever expect anything like this to ever happen,” Wagner told Reuters.  That was echoed by Ari Alexenburg, 39, who was waiting for word on the fate of his friend and fellow security guard, who he said was believed to have been working at the Borderline at the time of the shooting. “You’re in the safest neighbourhood in America,” Alexenburg said. “Nothing, I mean nothing, ever happens in T.O.” Located about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks occupies about 55 square miles of rolling hills on the opposite side of the Santa Monica Mountains from Malibu, including more than 15,000 acres of publicly owned parks and open space. The largely residential area consists of quaint, bedroom communities, golf courses, winding, tree-lined roads and upscale shopping strips. For motorists who travel Highway 101 between Los Angeles and points north, Thousand Oaks is a pass-through community of little note. But the mountain and foothill landscapes surrounding the Conejo Valley offer plenty of space for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, as well as scenic vistas that have served as backdrops for various Hollywood movies over the years. Originally inhabited by the Chumash Native Americans who dwelled in the Conejo Valley, the area was first settled by the Spanish in the early 1800s, with pioneers migrating into the area throughout the 19th century.  The first post office in the area was built in 1875, and a small outpost there became a stop on the stagecoach route between Los Angeles and San Francisco, according to the city of Thousand Oaks’ website. Chicken ranches, dairy farms and apricot orchards that dotted the valley into the early 20th century gave way to greater development after the city was incorporated in the 1960s. Wednesday night’s bloodshed marked a tragic new chapter in the city’s history that has upended any notion that its residents are somehow immune from senseless violence, City Councilman Rob McCoy said at a news conference. “It can happen anywhere,” he said. “This was just an awful event. The citizens of our community are devastated. We’re heartbroken.” Reporting by Dana Feldman; Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-california-shooting-community/california-mass-shooting-shatters-americas-safest-neighbourhood-idUKKCN1ND3A2,2019-02-08,"Alicia Wagner says she moved her family six years ago from the affluent Los Angeles-area enclave of Pacific Palisades to the sleepier and more distant Thousand Oaks, in the Santa Monica Mountains, away from urban hustle and bustle.",California mass shooting shatters America's 'safest neighbourhood'
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The trade landscape in the U.S. House of Representatives will shift significantly next year following Democrats’ seizure of control in Tuesday’s elections. In the Senate, the Republicans strengthened their majority. Here is a look at key congressional trade players to watch:   House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has announced her intention to return as House speaker and so far has no challengers. As speaker, Pelosi, who has been has been skeptical of trade deals in recent years, will be responsible for bringing to the House floor a vote on the recent deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement next year. While she voted for the original NAFTA in 1993 and a U.S.-South Korea trade deal in 2011, she opposed the 2015 Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. She has pledged to “closely scrutinize” the new  U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Pelosi also has applauded Trump’s initial round of tariffs against China, citing the need to combat China’s “brazenly unfair trade policies”     Richard Neal of Massachusetts is expected to become chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful trade posts in Congress. A 30-year House veteran with 25 years on the panel, Neal opposed the original NAFTA. He has said that the “bar for supporting a new NAFTA will be high,” and that he will insist on stronger enforcement of labor and environmental provisions. He also has pledged that Ways and Means Democrats  will more often question Trump administration officials on their trade strategies, including how best to deal with China’s trade practices.  Representative Bill Pascrell, of New Jersey, a more traditional pro-labor Democrat, is seeking to head the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, where he now serves as the ranking Democrat. However, two other Democrats on the panel, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Ron Kind of Wisconsin, are weighing whether to seek the post, according to House Democratic aides. All three have expressed concerns about Trump’s China tariff strategy while acknowledging the need to take a tougher line to halt intellectual property theft. “I fear a chaotic and seemingly ad hoc trade policy will be ineffective in confronting China,” Pascrell said in June. Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa farmer and fixture in the chamber, has yet to announce his decision whether to return to chair the tax-and-trade-focused Senate Finance Committee or keep the gavel of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A return to Finance to replace the retiring Orrin Hatch would bring a stronger voice advocating on behalf of farmers and ranchers who are being hurt by Trump’s tariffs against China and on steel and aluminum. Grassley has said Trump’s tariffs are “very, very detrimental” to his home state, but has also been highly critical of China’s trade practices, expressing hope that Trump’s trade strategy works. As a corn and soybean farmer, Grassley has applied for a piece of the $12 billion in federal aid for farmers, while criticizing the program for allowing Chinese-owned Virginia-based pork producer Smithfield Foods to take part. If Grassley decides to remain chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho would be next in line to head Senate Finance, trading in the gavel of the Senate Banking Committee. Crapo was one of only 11 Republicans to vote against a non-binding measure that sought to limit Trump’s tariff powers. As Banking Committee chair, he shaped a bipartisan law this year to strengthen national security reviews of U.S. acquisitions by foreign companies, aimed at thwarting China’s purchases of sensitive technologies — a key complaint in the U.S. trade dispute with China. Crapo also has advocated for trade rules favoring Idaho’s potato, lumber, dairy and sugar interests. The House Ways and Means Committee will undergo significant changes as several key Republicans depart due to retirements, election losses and a governorship. Republicans leaving are Dave Reichert of Washington state, Sam Johnson of Texas, Peter Roskam of Illinois, Lynn Jenkins of Kansas, Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Diane Black of Tennessee, Carlos Curbelo of Florida, Mike Bishop of Michigan and Jim Renacci of Ohio. Kevin Brady of Texas, the current Republican chairman, is expected to stay on as ranking member. Two Democrats are also departing, Sander Levin of Michigan, who is retiring, and Joe Crowley of New York, who lost a primary race. Replacements will be determined by Republican and Democratic leadership in the House, with seniority playing a role in selections.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Thursday it would change the way it handles sexual harassment claims, a week after 20,000 of its workers around the world walked off their jobs to protest its response to such issues. Arbitration will become optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims, Google said, enabling lawsuits on those matters. It also said employees who fail to complete mandatory sexual harassment training will be docked in performance reviews. ""We recognise that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that,"" Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in a note here addressed to employees. ""It's clear we need to make some changes."" Pichai’s actions respond to a couple of the five major requests made by employees during last week’s protests. They had called on Alphabet to add an employee to its board and share gender-related pay data, neither of which Pichai addressed.  Walkout organizers applauded the progress on sexual harassment but said they would not let up on the other issues. “They all have the same root cause, which is a concentration of power and a lack of accountability at the top,” organizer and Google employee Stephanie Parker said in a press release.  “We demand a truly equitable culture,” Parker said. Google noted its chief diversity officer would continue to lead monthly discussions with Pichai on topics of diversity and equity. The company also said it would publicly release its harassment, discrimination and retaliation policies.  Employees who organized last week’s demonstrations estimated that 20,000 workers participated across Alphabet offices in five continents. A New York Times report spurred the protests after it revealed that Google gave a $90 million exit package to a top executive in 2014 after he was accused of sexual harassment. Pichai said on Thursday that Google would provide more details about the outcome of sexual harassment investigations, as well as improve handling of cases by allowing victims to be accompanied by a support person. Google will investigate complaints made by its contractors against employees and require that suppliers investigate complaints against contractors, the company said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Spoof billboards celebrating Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “contribution” to Brexit have been put up in London by a satirical group which says it wants to secure recognition for the role Russian military intelligence played in the referendum. Britain has said it found no evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 Brexit vote and Moscow has repeatedly denied even trying, though opponents of Brexit have repeatedly questioned whether the Kremlin played a role.   In the referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 51.9 percent, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million, or 48.1 percent, backed staying. Britain is due to leave on March 29.  The posters in London showed a picture of Kremlin chief Putin winking and holding the Russian flag beside the slogan: “Lets celebrate a Red, White and Blue Brexit.” The “r” of Brexit was reversed to give it the look of a Cyrillic letter. In a statement, the people claiming to be behind the campaign said they were a group of Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who wanted their true role in the Brexit vote to be recognised. “The group hopes to counter recent unwarranted negative publicity about the GRU by putting up advertisements highlighting their part in Britain’s imminent liberation from the EU,” said the group, which calls itself Proud Bear. Britain accuses the GRU of trying to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March. A video posted by the @Pr0ud_Bear group showed Putin riding a bulldog with the face of Brexit campaigner Arron Banks. “People of tiny island - it is time to celebrate,” the video said. It asked for funding to celebrate the GRU’s role in Brexit by hiring a digital billboard at Waterloo station and extolled the economic possibilities of post-Brexit trade with Russia including a booming trade in vodka. When contacted by Reuters, a representative of the group said in a statement in Russian that it was concerned by the health of Russian democracy and opposed the authoritarian tendencies of Moscow. The group expressed solidarity with Russian journalists but the representative declined to say who was behind the stunt. The Russian embassy did not immediately comment.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s government cannot stop a case seeking to determine whether the country can unilaterally reverse Brexit - due to be considered by Europe’s top court on Nov. 27 - Scotland’s Court of Session ruled on Thursday.  Scottish politicians opposed to Britain leaving the European Union had successfully asked for a ruling to clarify whether Britain could withdraw its notification to leave without permission from the bloc’s other members. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, struggling to deliver Brexit, had argued that whether or not Britain could reverse the decision was immaterial, since the government had no intention of doing so. The government had asked for permission to appeal the case at Britain’s Supreme Court. “The application for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court was refused,” a spokesman for the Court of Session said.  Scotland’s highest civil court agreed on Oct. 4 there was a case to be heard before the European Court of Justice (CJEU). The anti-Brexit petitioners aim to show that Britain has a legal unilateral option of staying in the world’s biggest trading bloc once the outcome of Brexit negotiations is known. It is not clear when the ECJ might give its ruling to clarify the interpretation of Article 50 of the EU treaty, under which London last year gave two years’ notice of its departure. A court official said that typically, under the court’s “expedited procedure” for urgent matters, a ruling would be made three to six months after such a hearing.  “The government has made submissions to the CJEU,” a spokesman for Britain’s Brexit department said. “In any event, the government will not be revoking Article 50.” Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Michael Holden",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-article50/british-government-cannot-stop-brexit-case-going-to-ecj-scottish-court-says-idUKKCN1ND1O5,2019-02-08,,"British government cannot stop Brexit case going to ECJ, Scottish court says"

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he hopes he can work with Congress on immigration to fund his border wall, as well as possibly addressing the thousands of young immigrants living in the United States without legal status. Speaking to reporters at the White House after Tuesday’s congressional elections, he said he wanted to see U.S. lawmakers provide enough money to build his long-promised wall along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. But he said he would not necessarily force a government shutdown over the issue. “We need the money to build the wall, the whole wall, not pieces of it,” Trump told reporters at a news conference at the White House following Tuesday’s midterm elections. “We need the wall, many Democrats know we need the wall, and we’re just going to have to see what happens.” The Republican president also said he saw potential to work with Democrats - who won control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the elections and will take over in January - over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program but would have to see how the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the issue. The programme has shielded from deportation immigrants dubbed “Dreamers” and given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Trump’s administration on Monday asked the nation’s top court to allow it to end the programme. “I think we could really do something having to do with DACA,” Trump told reporters. “We’ll see how it works out at the Supreme Court.”  Reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Susan Heavey; editing by Jonathan Oatis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-immigration-trump/trump-says-wants-border-wall-funding-sees-possible-daca-idUKKCN1NC2FL,2019-02-08,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he hopes he can work with Congress on immigration to fund his border wall, as well as possibly addressing the thousands of young immigrants living in the United States without legal status.","Trump says wants border wall funding, sees possible DACA"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government must show MPs the full legal advice it has received on the so-called Irish backstop before they are asked to vote on any Brexit agreement, the opposition Labour Party said on Wednesday. Disagreements over the backstop, an insurance policy to avoid a hard border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland, remain the key stumbling block to reaching an exit deal with the European Union. London wants the backstop to have a clear end date or exit mechanism, to ensure it is not tied to the EU’s customs union indefinitely, but Ireland has said Britain cannot be allowed to withdraw from any agreement unilaterally.     Local media have reported Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has drawn up advice, at the request of Prime Minister Theresa May, on the various options available for a potential backstop. Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, who is in Brussels  to meet representatives from EU institutions, said any agreement on the backstop must be “robust and credible”. “It’s essential MPs (members of parliament) are given the opportunity to scrutinise the Attorney General’s legal advice before voting on the final deal,” he said in a statement.  “At this crucial stage, parliament should not be kept in the dark nor should the government try to bounce MPs into an agreement without all the facts.” Prominent Brexiteer and environment minister Michael Gove asked May at a meeting of her top team on ministers on Tuesday whether they could be shown the full legal advice, rather than just being shown a summary, according to media reports. May’s spokesman said the government does not comment on legal advice. Earlier on Wednesday, a senior lawmaker in the Northern Irish party that props up May’s Conservatives in parliament said it would be in the public interest for the government to publish its legal advice on the backstop. Former Brexit minister David Davis, who resigned in July over the government’s Brexit plans, has also called on the government to make the advice public. “We need the cards laid on the table so we can form a judgement. Is the future of the union at stake?,” he wrote in the Sunday Times. “Does ‘temporary’ actually mean ‘eternal’ when it comes to the backstop?” Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-labour/uk-government-must-show-mps-legal-advice-on-irish-backstop-labour-idUKKCN1NC1XI,2019-02-08,,UK government must show MPs legal advice on Irish backstop - Labour
2019-02-08,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman has embarked on a domestic tour this week with his favourite son, demonstrating his support for his chosen heir despite the crisis spawned by the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Roads were lined with Saudi flags and images of the king and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, when they arrived in the central region of Qassim late on Tuesday. Distinguished figures greeted them and children offered flowers.  The tour is the latest public outreach by the 82-year-old monarch, apparently intended to shore up the power of Prince Mohammed, known as MbS, who has taken over day-to-day rule but whose international reputation was battered in the month since Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. State media said the king laid the foundation for new or planned projects worth $1.12 billion and ordered the release of some people from debtors’ prison in Qassim, a conservative province in the heart of the Arabian peninsula.  “There is a lot of tension, fear and apprehension among Saudis in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair. So it’s a trip that reassures the various regions that the king is still in his place and he’s the highest authority,” said Madawi al-Rasheed, a London-based Saudi author critical of the Al Saud. Turkish officials have accused MbS of ordering Khashoggi’s murder. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the crown prince as de facto ruler. Saudi Arabia, which offered numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, now says the U.S.-based Washington Post columnist was killed in a rogue operation. MbS broke weeks of silence on Oct. 25 to vow justice would prevail. King Salman stepped in to defuse the situation. He sent a trusted aide to Turkey last month, then fired five senior officials, including his son’s most trusted adviser. After weeks of lying low, the prince has now returned to the public stage. He visited troops near the border with Yemen, where Riyadh is involved in a 3-1/2-year war, appearing in an online video on Monday with a soldier he called a hero. In a ceremony at a Riyadh university, he laid the foundation stone for a planned nuclear research reactor. Greg Gause, a Gulf expert at Texas A&M University, said the domestic tour with his father did not indicate that the royal family is in the clear yet, only that “the king is confident that nothing is afoot right now.” The 33-year-old crown prince is on course to become the first Saudi monarch from a new generation in 65 years, following a succession of six brothers drawn from among at least 45 sons of state founder Abdulaziz ibn Saud, who died in 1953. But MbS’s rise has upended the system of rule in place for decades, in which successive kings sought family consensus and allocated powerful posts to their brothers and nephews. MbS consolidated his rule by stripping some of his most powerful cousins from positions of authority and locking some under house arrest. Others were caught up in an anti-corruption crackdown and confined inside a luxury hotel for months. There have been signs since last week that some princes are being rehabilitated to foster family unity in the wake of the Khashoggi killing. Last week, one of the king’s surviving younger brothers, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, returned from 2-1/2 months abroad where he had appeared to criticise the leadership. Two of the king’s nephews, detained last year, appear to have been released recently, with pictures circulating of them reuniting with family. Diplomats say the ruling family is “circling the wagons”. But there is no indication King Salman is considering elevating another prince, either to replace his son or balance his authority by serving as his deputy. “MbS is not going anywhere. The family is meeting and they will unite stronger behind him,” said a senior Arab diplomat. “There is no way back” after the king cleared MbS’s path to the throne by sidelining potential rivals last year. The king’s decision to put MbS in charge of restructuring the intelligence apparatus - a move aimed at addressing a purported cause of the Khashoggi crisis - indicates that the crown prince remains “untouchable”, the diplomat added. On Tuesday evening, as King Salman and MbS arrived in Qassim, north of Riyadh, to a stadium of cheering residents, online photos emerged showing Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd with his brothers and daughters in a residential setting. The images were the first of the prince, the son of a former king, since his detention, which the government never acknowledged. It was not made clear whether he had reached a settlement with the state like other detainees who were subsequently released, or if his freedom is still restricted. Over the weekend, another of the king’s nephews, a brother of billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, was photographed at his ailing father’s bedside after being held for months over online criticism of the anti-corruption purge ordered late last year by MbS.  The next day Alwaleed, who was among scores of top royals, businessmen and government officials held at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel as part of the sweep, went on Fox News to defend MbS in the Khashoggi crisis and the anti-corruption campaign. “I believe the Saudi crown prince will be 100 percent vindicated and exonerated,” Alwaleed said of his cousin. Alwaleed’s own detention was “forgiven and forgotten,” he said.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - When Han Siyuan first decided to apply for a job as a pilot cadet in 2008, she was up against 400 female classmates in China on tests measuring everything from their command of English to the length of their legs. Eventually, she became the only woman from her university that Shanghai-based Spring Airlines (601021.SS) picked for training that year. She is now a captain for the Chinese budget carrier, but it has not become much easier for the women who have come after her.  Han is one of just 713 women in China who, at the end of 2017, held a license to fly civilian aircraft, compared with 55,052 men. Of Spring Airlines’ 800 pilots, only six are women. “I’ve gotten used to living in a man’s world,” she said.  China’s proportion of female pilots – at 1.3 percent - is one of the world’s lowest, which analysts and pilots attribute to social perceptions and male-centric hiring practices by Chinese airlines.    But Chinese airlines are struggling with an acute pilot shortage amid surging travel demand, and female pilots are drawing attention to the gender imbalance.  Chinese carriers will need 128,000 new pilots over the next two decades, according to forecasts by planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N), and the shortfall has so far prompted airlines to aggressively hire foreign captains and Chinese regulators to relax physical entry requirements for cadets. “The mission is to start cutting down the thorns that cover this road, to make it easier for those who come after us,” said Chen Jingxian, a Shanghai-based lawyer who learned to fly in the United States and is among those urging change.  Such issues are not confined to China; the proportion of female pilots in South Korea and Japan, where such jobs do not conform to widespread gender stereotypes, is also less than 3 percent. But it is a sharp contrast to the situation in India, which, like China, has a fast-growing aviation market. But thanks to aggressive recruiting and support such as day care, India has the world’s highest proportion of female commercial pilots, at 12 percent. China’s airlines only hire cadets directly from universities or the military. They often limit recruitment drives to male applicants and very rarely take in female cohorts.  In addition, unlike in other markets, such as the United States, China does not allow people to convert private flying licenses to commercial certificates for flying airliners.  Li Haipeng, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China’s general aviation department, said many airlines were also dissuaded to hire women by generous maternity leave policies. That has been further aggravated by Beijing’s move in 2015 to change the one-child policy, he added.  “Male pilots do not have the issue of not being able to fly for two years after giving birth, and after the introduction of the second-child policy, airlines are not willing to recruit and train a pilot only to have her not being able to fly for about five years,” he said. He said Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines had all made some effort to recruit female pilots, adding “nearly all other companies do not.” China Eastern (600115.SS) (0670.HK) and China Southern (600029.SS) (1055.HK) declined to comment while Air China (601111.SS) (0753.HK) did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Pilots said that hiring decisions were usually left to individual airlines and did not appear to be driven by the country’s regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, whose recruitment requirements do not mention gender.    Xiamen Airlines, a China Southern subsidiary, told Reuters it offers up to 540 days of maternity leave. It started recruiting female pilots in 2008, and paused for a few years in between before resuming last year. Out of its 2,700 pilots, 18 are women while another 18 are in training. “Allowing more women to become pilots is undoubtedly a good way to supplement (an airline’s) flying capability,” a spokesman for the carrier said. The strongest calls for change are coming mostly from Chinese female pilots, thanks to a slew of returnees who learned how to fly while living abroad in countries like the United States.  In March, the China Airline Pilots Association (ChALPA) established a female branch at an event attended by pilots from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force and local airlines, according to media reports.  Chen, the lawyer who also serves as a vice-president of the ChALPA’s women’s branch, said she and others have been trying to spread the word by speaking about the issue at air shows in China. Eventually, she said, the organisation hopes to persuade Chinese airlines to adjust their recruitment and maternity policies.  Another key obstacle to tackle, she added, was the inability of general aviation pilots to shift to the commercial sector. “It’s a systemic issue,” she said. “We hope that change can happen in three to five years, but this is not something that is up to us.”  Others like Han, who in recent months has appeared in Spring Airlines promotional videos, said she hoped the growing publicity would help to raise awareness. “I can’t personally give people opportunities,” she said. “But I hope that (the publicity) can slowly help open the door for companies or for girls with dreams to fly.” Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional Reporting by Heekyong Yang in Seoul, Ritsuko Ando in Tokyo, Jamie Freed in Singapore and the SHANGHAI Newsroom; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-airshow-women-pilots/in-china-female-pilots-strain-to-hold-up-half-the-sky-idUKKCN1NA2SH,2019-02-08,,"In China, female pilots strain to hold up half the sky"
2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia authorities extended on Wednesday a search for victims of a plane crash last week, when all 189 on board a Lion Air flight were killed, and for the aircraft’s second black box, the cockpit voice recorder. The nearly new Boeing Co. 737 MAX passenger plane slammed into the sea on Oct. 29, only minutes after takeoff from Jakarta en route to Bangka island near Sumatra. “We have extended the operation for three more days,” Muhammad Syaugi, the head of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas), told Reuters. It was the second time the search has been extended. But he said search teams from the military, police and others would stand down, leaving just his agency to press on. “This operation has been running for 10 days and the results from combing the sea surface and the sea bed are declining, therefore the resources of Basarnas should be sufficient,” Syaugi told a news conference. Basarnas had 220 personnel, including 60 divers, as well as four ships involved in the search and were focussing on an area with a radius of 250 metres (273 yards), he said.    A police official said 186 body bags containing human remains had been retrieved and 44 victims identified after forensic examination. Authorities have downloaded data from one of the black boxes found last week, the flight data recorder, but are still looking for the cockpit voice recorder  A “ping” has been detected from the second black box but the signal was very weak, possibly because it was encased in mud,” said Nurcahyo Utomo, an air accident official at the transportation safety committee (KNKT).  A vessel capable of sucking up mud was likely to be brought in to help, he told a news conference.  Boeing said on Wednesday it had issued a safety bulletin reminding pilots how to handle erroneous data from a sensor in the wake of the Lion Air crash. The U.S. planemaker said investigators looking into the Lion Air crash had found that one of the “angle of attack” sensors on the aircraft had provided erroneous data. Experts say the angle of attack is a crucial parameter that helps the aircraft’s systems understand whether its nose is too high relative to the current of air - a phenomenon that can throw the plane into an aerodynamic stall and make it fall. KNKT said that there was a problem with the sensor on the last flight taken by the doomed plane, from the island of Bali to Jakarta, even though one sensor had been replaced in Bali. The KNKT has interviewed crew and technicians on duty for two previous flights, while also retrieving the faulty sensor from Bali for inspection. KNKT is planning to simulate a flight to assess the impact of sensor damage at Boeing’s engineering simulator facility in Seattle.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Smaller British manufacturers expect their output to dip for the first time in seven years during the next three months, hurt by sagging order books ahead of Brexit, an industry survey showed on Wednesday. Domestic orders flatlined and manufacturers reined in their investment plans, the quarterly survey of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed. The report adds to a string of downbeat signals from manufacturers ahead of Brexit, now due in less than five months. Prime Minister Theresa May faces opposition to her Brexit plan from within her own Conservative Party, and has also failed so far to reach agreement with other EU leaders, raising fears that Britain could leave the EU without a transition deal. “SME manufacturers are clearly feeling the pressure: both from softer global economic momentum, reflected in a tailing-off of exports orders, and Brexit uncertainty biting hard on investment plans,” CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said. Optimism about export prospects for the year ahead waned to the weakest level since April 2009, during Britain’s last recession. “(A) significant scaling back of planned capital spending is further proof that Brexit uncertainty is taking a real bite out of firms’ plans to grow and innovate,” Paleja said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - When soccer’s governing body in Europe began to get tough on the sport’s finances from 2009 onwards, the British club Manchester City came up with a two-pronged counter-attack, a trove of documents relating to soccer shows. One Man City plan was to get more money from sponsors; another was to offload some costs relating to players’ image rights. In both cases, the owner of Man City, an Abu Dhabi royal, would foot some of the bill, according to “Football Leaks” documents obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters in partnership with European Investigative Collaborations, a consortium of media organisations. In 2009, the executive committee of sport’s governing body in Europe, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), approved introducing Financial Fair Play rules to prevent clubs piling up too much debt and super-rich owners dominating the game. The rules were implemented from 2010 onwards. Under those rules, sponsors, suppliers or other commercial partners related to the owner of a club must pay only a market rate in transactions with that club. Related parties cannot simply funnel in unlimited money on behalf of the owner. Breach of the rules can lead to clubs being banned from UEFA competitions. On Nov. 2, Reuters reported how UEFA’s regulatory arm, the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB), took the view that some Abu Dhabi sponsors of Man City were related parties and their deals with the club were above market rates. The club disputed that view, and UEFA’s control body ultimately allowed Man City to record the sponsorship deals at favourable levels that boosted its income. Today Reuters details new information from emails and other documents relating to further arrangements involving Man City, which was bought by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, half-brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, in 2008. Those arrangements boosted the club’s finances by tens of  millions of pounds, helping it to buy star players. Manchester City said in a statement responding to questions last month: “We will not be providing any comment on out of context materials purported to have been hacked or stolen from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel and associated people. The attempt to damage the Club’s reputation is organised and clear.” The club did not respond to further questions put this month. The club said in an April 2014 response to UEFA investigators about sponsorship that it had complied with the rules and “adopted a good faith and correct interpretation of the regulations.” UEFA said in an emailed response to Reuters that it could not comment on specific cases due to confidentiality obligations. The UEFA control body chairman declined to comment, citing confidentiality obligations. In an overall statement about the Financial Fair Play rules, UEFA said the rules were there to help clubs become financially sustainable and it was “very satisfied” with how they had been applied and the results achieved, noting an improvement in the finances of European soccer clubs. “No system is perfect but on the whole FFP (the Financial Fair Play regime) has increasingly protected European football from financial difficulty since its introduction in 2010,” UEFA said. The documents provide insight into the nature of the huge sums flowing through Man City and could supercharge one of the biggest controversies in soccer. Some rivals have alleged that Man City has benefited unfairly from the financial firepower of its Gulf owner. The club has rejected those claims. The issue is of interest to millions of fans who pay to support soccer teams. Man City’s arrangements for boosting income from sponsors and offloading some costs formed part of a programme termed ‘Project Longbow’ by executives, according to club presentations and emails between managers. It is unclear from the emails reviewed by Reuters whether Sheikh Mansour was aware of the arrangements. Nor do the documents show Man City had an intention to deceive UEFA or its investigators about the state of the club’s finances. And nor do documents reviewed by Reuters show UEFA or its control body accusing the club of deception. The arrangements were as follows, according to the documents. In early 2010, Man City negotiated a three-and-a-half year sponsorship contract with Aabar, a state-controlled investment fund in Abu Dhabi, worth about 15 million pounds a year. But correspondence between the club and Aabar said some of the money would come from other sources. In early 2010, Man City director Simon Pearce emailed Aabar’s then chief executive, Mohamed Badawy Al-Husseiny, saying: “The annual direct obligation for Aabar is GBP 3 million. The remaining 12 million GBP requirement will come from alternative sources provided by His Highness.” That appears to refer to Sheikh Mansour. A spokesman for Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi government referred questions to the club. Man City director Pearce did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Aabar, the investment fund, said he could not comment on “any information that came from what appears to be hacked or stolen emails.” The club did not make any comment on specific questions beyond its statement above. Other emails discuss the flow of funds from Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) - the company through which the Sheikh owns Man City’s parent company - through sponsors to the club. In an August 2013 email, Jorge Chumillas, then chief financial officer at City Football Group, the company through which Sheikh Mansour controls Manchester City Football Club (MCFC), asked Pearce about the arrangement by which money flowed through Etihad, an airline owned by the Abu Dhabi government. “I need to understand the mechanism by which additional sponsorship flows through ADUG. Ii [sic] it ADUG Shareholder->ADUG->Etihad->MCFC? Or is it rather ADUG Shareholder->Etihad->MCFC?,” Chumillas wrote. ADUG is “a private investment and development company belonging to His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan,” according to the Man City website. Chumillas could not be reached through Man City, and did not respond to requests for comment sent to City Football Group and via LinkedIn. Other emails describe funds being “routed” through sponsors. An email sent to Pearce in December 2012 by Man City’s head of finance, Andrew Widdowson, said: “In summary we need the following: £27m to be funded via Etihad, £15m to be funded via Etisalat, £42m in Total. Can I ask that the relevant amounts be routed through the partners.” Reuters was unable to verify whether the payments were made. Corporate governance and accounting experts said the sponsors and other counterparties in the transactions with Man City in all likelihood did not break any rules because their shareholders were not disadvantaged by the arrangements and because the amounts were likely not material enough to require detailed disclosure to investors or the public. A spokesperson for Etihad Airways said in a statement: “The airline’s financial obligations, associated with the partnership of the club and the broader City Football Group, have always been, and remain, the sole liability and responsibility of Etihad Airways.” The spokesperson added: “Our partnership with Manchester City and the broader City Football Group continues to deliver important ongoing and accumulative returns on our investments.” Etisalat is a state-controlled telecoms company headquartered in Abu Dhabi. A spokesman for the company said in a statement that football had become a highly competitive market for sponsors and that “we believe that Etisalat has delivered excellent returns from its investments in this area.” He added: “As a publicly listed company Etisalat is driven to create returns for its shareholders in all of its investments, including our commercial partnerships.” Tobias Troeger, a professor of law at Goethe University, Frankfurt, said the directors of sponsoring companies would not be breaking their fiduciary duty to their shareholders if they paid over the odds for a sponsorship contract providing the overpayment was covered by another party and the directors believed the overall transaction was in the best interests of the company and its investors. In other words, if the payments from Sheikh Mansour’s ADUG  were covering any potential overvaluation of Man City’s sponsorship deals, there would be no loss to the sponsors’ shareholders. “All the jurisdictions we’re talking about have a ‘business judgement rule’ so executives can essentially determine, without being held liable, how they want to pursue the corporate interest, if it’s a reasonable judgement they make with sound information,” Troeger said. Provided all the payments were recorded correctly in the accounts, there would likely be no breaches of corporate reporting rules, he added. Luca Enriques, Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Oxford, said that while a football club might be bound by UEFA’s rules, the club’s sponsors or business partners would not have any legal obligation to follow the governing body’s rules. “I don’t see how you can put third parties under the domain of football rules,” he said. Widdowson, Man City’s head of finance, did not respond to requests for comment on what was meant by funds being routed through sponsors. Another strand of Project Longbow focused on a quirk in how top players are paid, known as “image rights.” Leading clubs in Britain and some other European countries often declare that around 15 percent of what they pay players is for the right to use their images for marketing. Man City decided to sell those rights to a new company it created, receiving 24.5 million pounds and shifting costs of around 10 million pounds a year off its books. The manoeuvre would have the double benefit of boosting the club’s income and reducing its expenses. So, on May 13, 2013, Man City sold its top players’ image rights to its new company, called Manchester City Football Club (Image Rights) Ltd and known as MIR. On the same day, the club then sold MIR to Fordham Sports Management Ltd., according to the documents. Fordham Sports Management is ultimately owned by David Rowland, a British financier based in Guernsey, according to publicly available financial filings. Rowland did not respond to requests for comment. MIR had agreed to pay Man City 24.5 million pounds and to take on costs of over 10 million pounds a year. In return it received the right to sell the players’ images, but only under restricted terms. Existing sponsorship contracts between marketers and players were excluded, and MIR did not receive the right to use the players’ images in association with club logos or colours. Also, in some cases, MIR’s contracts required it to share any revenue it generated with the players. In the following years, MIR began to rack up large losses - more than 70 million pounds up to the end of 2017, publicly available accounts show. But its new owner, Fordham, had a safety net. Emails and other documents indicate that Abu Dhabi agreed to cover expenses Fordham incurred in relation to MIR. A Man City presentation from April 2013, attached to emails between executives, outlined how the arrangement could work, stating: “AD commitment to cover the balance of MIR cash deficit at the end of every season.” AD appears to refer to Abu Dhabi. Other Man City presentation slides contained in an email folder from 2012, before the MIR deal was concluded, sketched diagrammatically how the safety net arrangement could work. They show an arrow annotated with the words “Funding of losses” pointing from Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), Sheikh Mansour’s company, to the image-rights purchaser, which is not identified in the slide. The spokesman for Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi government referred questions to Man City. Man City did not address specific questions on this issue. Other emails suggest the arrangements for ADUG to cover the losses of the image-rights purchaser went ahead as planned. A June 2013 email from Man City director Pearce to David Rowland’s son, Jonathan, discussed “the next scheduled payment re: Fordham” and said that 8 million pounds had been paid to date to cover costs incurred by MIR in paying Man City for the image rights and for payments to players. Jonathan Rowland did not respond to requests for comment. In an email on Sept. 4, 2013, Chumillas, the City Football Group finance chief, asked Pearce to arrange an additional payment of 10.7 million pounds to cover Fordham’s costs for the second half of 2013. According to a Sept. 12 email, Pearce agreed the payment should be made. It is unclear from the emails reviewed by Reuters whether the transaction was completed. Accounting experts said that providing all transactions were recorded properly in the accounts of the companies involved, there would be nothing unlawful about the arrangements. Man City declined to answer questions about the motivation for the transactions. UEFA investigators, tasked with making sure clubs complied with Financial Fair Play rules, examined the image rights arrangement. In June 2015, UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body told Man City in a letter that the club could not offload costs via the MIR deal. The control body required the club to take back into its accounts more than 10 million pounds in image rights payments a year. The evidence submitted by the club “did not provide the necessary comfort … about the economic rationale of the transactions,” the letter said. UEFA’s control body did not say in the letter that Man City had intended to evade its Financial Fair Play rules or deceive it. UEFA’s control body ultimately did allow the club to retain the benefit of the 24.5 million pounds it received for selling the rights. UEFA’s control body did not disclose the reasons for that decision. The 24.5 million boost to its income helped the club comply with UEFA rules limiting the amount of losses clubs can incur. According to letters and emails between UEFA’s control body and the club, and correspondence between club executives, UEFA investigators also challenged some of Man City’s accounting of sponsorship income, questioning whether the arrangements conformed with the rules on Financial Fair Play, as Reuters outlined on Nov. 2. Documents reported here show UEFA investigators said that two Abu Dhabi sponsors – state investment firm Aabar and state-controlled telecom firm Etisalat - were parties related to Man City’s owners. Under Financial Fair Play rules, such sponsorship deals had to be recorded at fair market value when calculating whether the club had broken even or not. But independent experts hired by UEFA said the contracts were at above-market rates. UEFA investigators said the Aabar contract had a “fair value” of 6.1 million euros (£5.3 million), according to a preliminary view report; but the sponsor was paying 19.2 million euros.  The Etisalat sponsorship rights were estimated to have a “fair value” of 6.7 million euros a year; but the sponsor was paying 20.1 million euros a year. UEFA investigators, in the May 2014 preliminary view report, also noted that they had found no evidence of a commercial negotiation over the deals, “leading to the conclusion that this was not an arm’s length transaction between unrelated parties.” Etisalat said it strove to create returns from all its investments. UEFA did not respond directly to questions about individual sponsorship deals, but said one of its aims was to “encourage clubs to operate on the basis of their own revenues.” UEFA’s control body declined to comment for reasons of confidentiality. Under the final 2014 settlement, UEFA’s control body required adjustments to the club’s 2011-12 and 2012-13 financial reports. However, for 2014 and the following two years, UEFA’s control body did allow the club to recognise the sponsorship contracts at values that independent experts had said were above market rates, according to the settlement documents. In other words, in those years the sport’s European governing body allowed Man City to count far more income from sponsors under Financial Fair Play rules than UEFA’s external experts thought was appropriate.

2019-02-08,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Washington’s decision to cut off U.S. supplies to a Chinese chip-maker spotlights mounting tensions over China’s drive to be a global player in computer chips and the ways in which Taiwan companies are helping it get there. Shut out of major global semiconductor deals in recent years, China has been quietly strengthening cooperation with Taiwan chip firms by encouraging the transfer of chip-making expertise into the mainland.  Taiwan chip giant United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) (2303.TW) last week halted research and development activities with its Chinese state-backed partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd, following the U.S. move.  Taiwan firms such as UMC have helped supply China with a steady pipeline of chip expertise in exchange for access to the fast-growing chip market there.     China has faced a shortage of integrated circuit (IC) chips for years. In 2017, it imported $270 billion worth of semiconductors, more than its imports of crude oil. 　 At least 10 joint ventures or technology partnerships have been set up in the last few years between Chinese and Taiwanese firms, according to industry experts, luring Taiwanese talent with hefty salaries and generous perks. “Such companies will need to also take care to ensure no patent or IP infringement is involved as the U.S. has export control means to restrict support of critical technology,” said Randy Abrams, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Taipei.  Among the most valuable cross-strait partnerships for China would be ones that strengthen its foundry services and memory chip production. Those two sectors require much-needed help from overseas firms due to the complexity of the manufacturing technologies and intense capital requirements, analysts have said.  But the technology transfer between China and self-ruled Taiwan has raised concerns amid the Sino-U.S. trade war and escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.  China has aggressively used “market-distorting subsidies” and “forced technology transfers” to capture traditional and emerging technology industries, Brent Christensen, the director of America’s de facto embassy in Taipei, told a business gathering in late September. “These actions are harming the United States’ economy, Taiwan’s economy, and other economies.” Taiwan is one of the largest exporters of IC globally and many worry the island could lose a key economic engine to its political foe. Taiwan’s government views the island’s chipmakers’ cooperation with China cautiously and has implemented policies to ensure Taiwan’s most advanced technology is not transferred. “When businesses go to the mainland to invest in wafer production, they must accept controls including one that requires the manufacturing technology to be a generation behind,” the economics ministry’s industrial development bureau said in a statement to Reuters.  Cooperation between UMC and Fujian Jinhua came under scrutiny last month, when the U.S. government put the Chinese company on a list of entities that cannot buy components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms amid allegations it stole intellectual property from U.S.-based Micron Technology. Fujian Jinhua denied the allegations.   Fujian Jinhua now faces big challenges to reach commercial high volume production as expected in 2020, industry observers say.  Last week, both UMC and Fujian Jinhua, which was only founded in 2016, were charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron in a U.S. Justice Department indictment. “Taiwanese tech companies need to carefully re-evaluate their positions and supply chain arrangements as the tension between the two super powers escalates,” Bernstein analyst Mark Li said. While China will need at least six years before it can catch up in chip manufacturing, according to some estimates, the scale of its chip-making abilities is already seen as a threat in other parts of the chip supply chain. Barely 2-1/2 years after breaking ground on a 12-inch wafer plant in China, Nexchip, a joint venture between the Chinese city of Hefei and Taiwan DRAM maker Powerchip, started producing 8,000 wafers a month. Wafers are thin pieces of material, usually consisting of silicon, used to make semiconductor chips.      Nexchip’s main goal is to produce liquid crystal display driver ICs for flat-panel makers.  Using Powerchip’s resources and Taiwanese talent, which make up a quarter of its 1,200 employees, Nexchip is helping reduce China’s reliance on foreign chip suppliers.  With an aim to become “the world’s No.1 chipmaker for display drivers,” Nexchip plans to build three more 12-inch wafer plants and ramp up its monthly production to 20,000 wafers by 2019, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. After visiting Nexchip late last year, researchers from Taiwan’s chip hub, Hsinchu Science Park, said progress at the Hefei plant was a “breakthrough”. “This will likely increase Taiwan firms’ needs to invest in the China market, and it will be a test for the (Taiwan) government’s industrial policy.” Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Yimou Lee in Taipei",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-semiconductors-taiwan-analysis/chinas-ties-with-taiwan-chip-firms-under-scrutiny-as-u-s-trade-war-heats-up-idUKKCN1NB2WN,2019-02-08,,China's ties with Taiwan chip firms under scrutiny as U.S. trade war heats up
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British police arrested six men after a video was posted on the internet that showed men mocking the deadly Grenfell Tower blaze by burning an effigy of the building as part of Guy Fawkes’ Night celebrations. They were released on Tuesday, but remain under investigation, according to a police statement issued late in the day. The video, which appeared on social media, showed a cardboard model of the tower with cut outs of residents in the windows being set alight on a bonfire while those watching laughed and made jokes. Grenfell Tower, a social housing block that was home to a close-knit, ethnically diverse community, was engulfed by flames in the middle of the night of June 14, 2017, killing 71 people in the country’s deadliest domestic fire since World War Two. “To disrespect those who lost their lives at Grenfell Tower, as well as their families and loved ones, is utterly unacceptable,” Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter. Police said the men, whose ages range from 55 to 19, had been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence after handing themselves into a police station in south London. Across Britain in early November, towns and villages hold annual firework parties and burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, the Roman Catholic plotter who tried to blow up parliament in 1605.    Larger celebrations often burn celebrity figures with effigies of flamboyant ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson being torched at a number of events this year while previous targets have included U.S. President Donald Trump.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin has experienced one of its worst annual price performances of its short 10-year-old life but also appears to have become more stable in the process.    Volatility of the original and biggest cryptocurrency has sunk to its lowest for nearly two years, with price swings falling lower than increasingly edgy U.S. stocks for more than two weeks in a row. Measured on a weekly basis, bitcoin volatility is set to fall to its lowest since the end of 2016, when the digital coin was still a niche asset yet to muscle its way into global focus. (Interactive graphics on 'Bitcoin volatility sinks to near two-year low' -  tmsnrt.rs/2PcdKdr) Volatility has been a major characteristic of the digital currency, which turned 10-years-old last week, throwing up major hurdles to its emergence as a mainstream asset class. Most mainstream institutional investors, sceptical about its ability to store value in any predictable way, have also stayed clear. At the same time, regulators across the globe have emphasised price instability when issuing warnings to retail investors dabbling in the cryptocurrency.  Volatility has also prevented the spread of bitcoin as a method of payments, its intended purpose.      Traders and investors are waiting for clarity on how regulators will treat bitcoin products such as exchange-traded funds, leading to them holding off on major purchases or sales. A fall in trading volumes over the last three months is also a key factor, said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a cryptocurrency prime broker.  In contrast to bitcoin, volatility in the S&P 500 .SPX, has since late September climbed to near seven-month highs. Investors in U.S. stocks are worried over rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and global trade and protectionism.  (Interactive graphics on 'Bitcoin becomes more stable than U.S. stocks' - tmsnrt.rs/2Pb8HKi)   Bitcoin soared over 1,300 percent last year to a record high of almost $20,000 in December.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s information watchdog has asked Facebook’s (FB.O) lead European regulator to investigate how the company targets, monitors and shows adverts to users, saying it was concerned about some practices at the world’s biggest social network.  Britain’s Information Commissioner has been investigating the use of data analytics to influence politics after consultancy Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users from a researcher.  The British watchdog said on Tuesday as part of that inquiry it had also found broader issues at Facebook, which it had referred to Ireland’s data regulator, the lead supervisor for the social network in the European Union.  A spokeswoman for the British watchdog said it had been made aware of fake political adverts on the network.  Facebook said it looked forward to discussing the matter. “We regularly engage with regulators regarding our advertising tools, which we believe fully comply with EU data protection laws,” a spokeswoman said. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) said it would assess the information and decide what steps were required.  Under the EU’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a firm found to have broken data processing and handling rules can be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue of the prior financial year, or 20 million euros (17.6 million pounds), whichever is higher. Facebook had total revenue in 2017 of $40.7 billion.  The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the role that personal data plays both for marketers and political groups in the internet age.   The political consultancy was able to harvest the data of 87 million people after a researcher created an app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own but also their friends’ personal data.  Cambridge Analytica worked on Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential campaign in 2016.  “Citizens can only make truly informed choices about who to vote for if they are sure that those decisions have not been unduly influenced,” Britain’s Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a report to lawmakers published on Tuesday. “We have uncovered a disturbing disregard for voters’ personal privacy,” Denham said. “Social media platforms, political parties, data brokers and credit reference agencies have started to question their own processes – sending ripples through the big data eco-system.”         The Commissioner has also launched audits into the role of credit reference agencies such as Experian and sent assessment notices to data brokers including Acxiom as it seeks to understand the market for buying and selling personal data. Acxiom said in a statement that it would cooperate fully with the Information Commissioner and that in Britain it does not host, offer or process any “special category” data, as defined by the GDPR, that includes political data.   “Staff must undertake yearly training and exams and as part of ensuring compliance with applicable data protection law, Acxiom underwent and passed an independent data protection audit by the Direct Marketing Association in May this year,” it said. The GDPR was brought in by the EU in May to protect personal information and has forced the different online players to make sure they have permission from users to handle their data. The British Commissioner has already slapped the highest possible fine of 500,000 pounds ($653,800) on Facebook for the misuse of data, but said on Tuesday it was referring other outstanding issues to Ireland. “We have referred our ongoing concerns about Facebook’s targeting functions and techniques that are used to monitor individuals’ browsing habits, interactions and behaviour across the internet and different devices to the to the Irish Data Protection Commission,” the British watchdog said.     The BBC in October reported that a fake political advert had been posted to Facebook. Facebook had said earlier in October that advertisers that mentioned political figures, material or parties would be obliged to provide evidence of their identity and location and state on Facebook who was paying for the ad.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - British gambling firm William Hill (WMH.L) cut full-year profit expectations on Tuesday, blaming tougher regulations and higher taxes, and warned of more losses in the United States as it steps up expansion. Shares in the company fell as much as 9 percent.  European gambling companies have been looking to expand across the Atlantic as Britain introduces tighter regulations - particularly on lucrative fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) - and as U.S. states ease curbs on betting. “In three years time, we should clearly see the U.S. being profitable,” Chief Executive Philip Bowcock told Reuters, adding higher advertising costs for the company’s mobile platform would hit earnings for 2-3 years. William Hill has earmarked about 120-130 million pounds for 2019 to fund its U.S. expansion. However, the business there is expected to make a loss of up to 20 million for the same period. The company is also preparing for a hit from the UK government’s plan to cut the maximum stake on FOBTs to just two pounds from 100 pounds from October next year. The terminals allow players to bet on simulated events such as roulette, blackjack, bingo, and horse races, but have been criticised by social campaigners for being addictive.  William Hill reiterated its expectation to shut about 900 UK shops, which could result in loss of about 4,500 jobs. The company said it would look to provide other gaming options, such as sports betting terminals, and added it was in talks with landlords to lower rents.  William Hill, which was founded in 1934 as a postal and telephone betting service and operates in eight countries, said it expected regulations and taxes would reduce profit at its online business by 20 million pounds this year. It forecast a total operating profit of 225-245 million pounds for 2018, down from 291.3 million pounds in 2017. Analysts had on average forecast a profit of 242.6 million pounds, according to a company-compiled consensus. At 0900 GMT, William Hill shares were down 5.3 percent at 202.2 pence, the biggest fall on the UK mid-cap index .FTMC. In a separate statement, Bowcock said he was aiming to turn the company from a mainly UK-focused business to one that is “digitally led, internationally diverse and sustainable”, adding he aimed to at least double profits between 2018 and 2023. Credit Suisse analysts described that target as “very punchy,” and said the near-term forecast for the U.S. business was slightly disappointing.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Small and medium-sized British factories are braced for the worst profits outlook in at least nine years, according to a survey on Tuesday that showed companies putting investment plans on ice ahead of Brexit. Fifty-two percent of manufacturers expect Brexit to be detrimental to their business, the quarterly National Manufacturing Barometer from consultancies SWMAS and Economic Growth Solutions showed. Out of this, 17 percent said they thought leaving the European Union could challenge their own survival. The survey is the second report in the space of a few days to show the outlook for manufacturing souring ahead of Brexit in March next year. Prime Minister Theresa May faces opposition to her Brexit plan from within her own Conservative Party while and has also failed so far to reach agreement with other EU leaders, raising fears that Britain could leave the EU without a transition deal. Tuesday’s survey showed only 39 percent of manufacturers expect profits to increase over the next six months and 24 percent forecast an outright drop — the weakest outlook since the National Manufacturing Barometer started in 2009. “What we are clearly witnessing is manufacturers putting the brakes on new investments and recruitment whilst some enter survival mode caused by ongoing Brexit uncertainties,” Simon Howes, managing director of SWMAS, said.  The survey showed smaller manufacturers had started to stockpile raw materials, as well as finished goods to a lesser extent. Twenty-three percent of manufacturers said they were cautiously optimistic about the impact of Brexit on their business, while 13 percent said they were confident. Plans to deal with Brexit were slanted more towards reducing risks than seizing opportunities, the survey showed. More than 400 manufacturing executives participated in the National Manufacturing Barometer during October.

2019-02-08,"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - For many Americans, Tuesday’s congressional midterm elections are a referendum on Republican President Donald Trump’s divisive persona, hard-line policies and pugnacious politics. But on the eve of the election, in a packed airport hangar in Cleveland and at other Trump rallies across the nation, the stakes are different: a vote to protect a leader they see as under siege, whose inflammatory rhetoric is a necessary price for a norm-shattering era of change. “You think we’re letting that caravan come into this country?” Trump asked the crowd on Monday, referring to a group of Central American migrants moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border. “No!” his supporters shouted. At rallies overflowing with red-hatted, mostly white supporters in conservative pockets of the country, those backing Trump say they hope to make his ideas the dominant force in American political life for decades to come. They face strong headwinds. Nationally, about 52 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s performance. More people say they would vote for a Democratic candidate than a Republican in Tuesday’s congressional elections, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. But pro-Trump Republicans are eager to defy expectations, just as the president did with his 2016 victory. In Grand Rapids, Michigan, pro-Trump activist Ben Hirschmann, 23, sees Tuesday’s elections as decisive for Trump’s vision of America. “Trump’s not on the ballot, but he is on the ballot,” he said at a phone-bank event to get out the vote at the local Republican headquarters. “Everything we voted for in 2016 is on the line in 2018.” Trump embarked on a three-state tour in the Midwest on Monday, holding rallies in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. He has a clear strategy: drive Republican turnout by painting a dark, apocalyptic vision of life in America under Democrats, while fanning fears over illegal immigration. He casts his rivals as an angry, liberal and dangerous “mob” and plays up gains in the economy. “Democrats produce mobs. Republicans produce jobs,” Trump said in Cleveland, repeating a familiar line from his rallies. But as the frequency of his speeches and rallies increases, so too have his distortions and falsehoods, according to the Washington Post’s “Fact Checker” database. In the seven weeks before Tuesday’s elections, Trump averaged 30 false or misleading claims a day, up from an average of five a day during his first nine months in office. Trump frequently denies that he misleads the public and instead blames the media for what he describes as distortions of his words.  It is unclear whether Trump’s campaign strategy will work.  Republicans are expected to keep control of the Senate. But Democrats are widely favoured to win the 23 seats they need to assume control of the House of Representatives. The Republican Party is defending dozens of seats in largely suburban districts where Trump’s popularity has languished and Democrats have performed well in presidential races. Trump’s rallies have focussed mostly on Senate and gubernatorial battles in states he won in the 2016 White House race – from Florida and Missouri to West Virginia and Ohio. A Trump adviser, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters: “These are places where data and polling information tells us that the president is of best use.” At a rally in Johnson City, Tennessee, in early October, Jessica Lotz, 33, and her fiance, Chad Lavery, 49, said Trump’s  immigration policies resonated with them. During the 2008 economic downturn, Lotz and Lavery said they saw construction, landscaping and house-painting jobs go to illegal immigrants while they struggled financially. As the economy rebounded, so, too, did their fortunes.  “Now we’re living good,” Lavery said, crediting their ability to find work and better wages to Trump, who inherited an economy that was already in one of its longest recoveries and gave it an additional boost with tax cuts. After a Trump rally in September in Springfield, Missouri, pro-Trump activist Brenda Webb, 64, sat for a late dinner at a restaurant with five friends who had driven to the rally from the St. Louis suburbs. Webb and her friends had joined protests against Democratic then-President Barack Obama in St. Louis in 2009 that were part of a broader conservative”Tea Party” movement centred on calls for smaller government, lower taxes and fewer regulations. But the energy fizzled, she said. The group became animated talking about how Trump had given new focus to those early Tea Party goals of reclaiming government for ordinary citizens, not just the “elites” in Washington. “We feel like he’s working to resolve all the problems that we are so frustrated by,” Webb said. At the Springfield rally, Brian Whorton, who drove a few hours to see the president, said he voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 before becoming a Republican. “I was not politically aware and awake. I thought, ‘Oh he’s cool and he’s a good speaker and an African-American guy,’” said Whorton, who is white. Trump’s policies, he said, were making a difference for him: He said his manager at an aluminium electrical wire factory had credited Trump tariffs with raising their profits. “He is putting people back to work,” said retired postal worker Barbara Peacock, 58, as she leafed through Trump 2020 re-election merchandise at his rally in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday. “He is telling it like it is.” In Ohio, Republican National Committee spokeswoman Mandi Merritt referred to pro-Trump enthusiasts as a “grassroots army” that could be harnessed and dispatched to boost Republican voter turnout. On a sunny day in October, Trump supporter Kimmy Kolkovich, 46, joined a friend on the sidewalk at a busy intersection near the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus to urge people to register and vote. “Even if I’m registering people who are going to vote for the other party, they’re seeing us out here in our hats, and that’s what’s important, all the little interactions and conversations we’re having,” Kolkovich said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday downplayed concerns that its U.S. tax liabilities could increase by billions of dollars and that a decision by British tax authorities could saddle the company with an additional $1 billion tax bill. “Based on current law and guidance, we believe our current accrual is a reasonable estimate for the enactment of tax reform,” Todd Ernst, GE’s vice president of investor communications, said in an unusually detailed email to investors on Monday, referring to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the bill passed by Congress that significantly reduced corporate tax rates. Ernst said GE had disclosed the risk of $1 billion in additional British tax with third-quarter earnings, but considers it unlikely. “We expect to successfully contest the assessment, if made, and not owe any additional taxes to the U.K.,” Ernst said. The payments would come after GE reported a $22.8 billion quarterly loss last week, and has seen its cash income plummet as it has taken more than $40 billion in writedowns and charges in less than a year from its power division, long-term care insurance portfolio, the tax law and other issues.  Ernst’s comments came after analyst John Inch at research firm Gordon Haskett, said years of booking “inexplicably low tax rates” could land GE with billions of dollars of additional cash tax payments in the United States.  GE likely owed up to $9 billion in taxes under the 2017 corporate tax cuts, but took only a $3.3 billion charge while saying “offsets” would reduce cash tax costs in the future.  “The taxman knocks,” said Inch in the note, published on  Friday. “If even some of these ‘offsets’ are disallowed the company could wind up owing a large tax bill near term.” Inch also said GE’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liabilities could exceed $100 billion. Paying would be difficult as GE is trying to turn around troubled businesses. Ernst said GE expects U.S. tax authorities to provide more clarity, possibly in the fourth quarter, and GE would then disclose an “increase or decrease in liability.” Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru and Alwyn Scott in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ge-liability/ge-dismisses-talk-that-it-may-owe-billions-of-dollars-in-taxes-idUKKCN1NA2NZ,2019-02-08,,GE dismisses talk that it may owe billions of dollars in taxes

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - If British Prime Minister Theresa May is able to strike a Brexit deal with the European Union in the coming days or weeks, she will face a crucial vote in parliament when she asks lawmakers to approve it. How will the vote in parliament work? If a deal is agreed, May has to publish in parliament a copy of the withdrawal agreement and an outline agreement of Britain’s future relationship with the EU. Ministers must then arrange a debate. In the directly elected lower house of parliament this will culminate in a vote to determine whether parliament has approved the deal. This is the big vote. The government can move very quickly to organise the vote once a deal is reached, but any debate is expected to last several days. The format of the debate and vote is yet to be decided and currently subject to fierce disagreement. This is because it could have a crucial role in determining whether the government wins the vote. Ministers argue that any decision by parliament must be unambiguous in endorsing the deal as it is presented by the government. If not, they say the vote might not meet the legal criteria necessary for ratification of the withdrawal agreement.     But, opponents of May’s strategy instead want to use the debate to demonstrate that there is majority support for an alternative exit strategy, such as a second referendum, or remaining inside the EU’s customs union. The way in which they are able to do this will depend on the format. There could be multiple votes which, although not legally binding, would be politically hard to ignore if they show support for an alternative exit arrangement. A final decision on the format will be made closer to the time by parliamentary officials, based on recommendations from lawmakers. Legislation only stipulates ministers should try to hold a debate before the European Parliament has its own vote.  The unelected upper house of parliament, the House of Lords, will also debate the deal, but will only be asked to “take note” of it. The Lords will not get a straight “approve” or “reject” vote, and will not have the power to block the deal. The legislation defining the procedure for parliamentary approval does not specify how quickly after a deal is announced the vote will happen.  Lawmakers will be voting on whether to approve a package consisting of: 1) The withdrawal agreement - a legal text setting out issues such as citizens’ rights, the financial settlement, a backstop for the Irish border, and the terms of an implementation period designed to smooth the exit process. 2) The future relationship framework - a non-legal document defining how Britain and the EU will work together in the long term on issues such as trade and security.  These two documents define the deal May and her team have been negotiating with the European Commission since June 2017. There are 650 elected lawmakers in Britain’s House of Commons. Excluding non-voting members such as the speaker and others who never take up their seats, around 320 votes are needed to be certain of winning a vote. The actual number needed for victory depends on abstentions and absences on the day. The vote is decided by a simple majority. Whichever side has more votes wins.     At the end of the debate, the speaker will typically ask for those in favour of the motion to shout “aye”, and then those against to say “no”. As long as some lawmakers shout “no”, the speaker will call for a formal vote, known as a division. Votes are registered by lawmakers walking through different doorways, out of sight of television cameras and onlookers. Once the headcount is complete - which can take up to 15 minutes - lawmakers return to the debating chamber. Four appointed tellers will assemble in front of the speaker, and one will read the result out loud.  The ruling Conservative Party has 315 lawmakers. It governs with a working majority of 13 thanks to a deal with the 10 lawmakers of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). But May’s party is not united behind her current plan. Eurosceptics think it leaves Britain too tied to EU rules, and pro-EU lawmakers say the ties are not close enough. Both groups are potentially large enough to inflict defeat. The support of the 10 DUP lawmakers is dependent on the solution agreed on the Irish border. They have said they will not support any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the country. The opposition Labour Party has 257 lawmakers. Led by Jeremy Corbyn, the party has pledged to vote down any deal that does not meet its criteria. The plans currently under discussion are unlikely to do this, so most Labour lawmakers can be expected to vote against May. However, some who disagree with Corbyn’s stance could rebel and vote with the government in order to avoid the risk of leaving without a deal. Media reports have said May is courting these Labour “moderates”. The Scottish National Party’s 35 lawmakers are expected to vote against the government deal, as are the 12 Liberal Democrats. No. Although the vote is the focal point for resistance to the deal, the government is also required to pass separate legislation to implement the withdrawal agreement and complete the ratification process. This legislation will be known as the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. It will be subject to full scrutiny in parliament, involving multiple rounds of possible amending and voting. It has to be passed before March 29, 2019. This process is unlikely to be used to unpick the deal as the legislation will be implementing what has already been approved by parliament. However, if parliament feels as if May has ignored its wishes and is forcing the deal through, it could use the bill to stall the exit process. This would be a politically explosive outcome that could topple May and her government. There are legislative guidelines on what happens next, but they could be overtaken by events. By law, if the government motion is rejected, ministers have 21 days to set out in a statement how they intend to proceed. The government has said that if their deal is rejected, Britain will leave the EU without a deal. It then has to call a fresh debate in parliament that could give lawmakers another chance to set out amendments - effectively giving parliament a vote on an alternative path. These amendments would not be binding, but if approved May would again find them hard to ignore. However, it is also technically possible that the government could call a second vote in the commons and ask lawmakers for their approval again on either the same, or amended terms.

2019-02-08,"TASHKENT (Reuters) - When Uzbek authorities detained several online activists in September, blogger Davronbek Tojialiyev packed some clothes in a bag and waited for the knock on his door. The police never came, and Tojialiyev, one of a handful of bloggers breaking taboos by criticising state policies and officials, writes on. The 34-year-old’s experience suggests the new government in Tashkent is willing to make concessions as it vows to ease restrictions that made Uzbeks wary of speaking freely for the past 25 years. The detention of the bloggers, however, shows the change has limits, even as Uzbekistan tries to project a more liberal image to foreign investors whose help it needs to revive the economy after years of stagnation. The government is still sensitive to challenges to its authority, including in the sphere of religion. The country was rocked by bombings in the late 1990s and early 2000s that were blamed on Islamist extremists, and by an armed uprising in 2005 in which hundreds of people were killed. Tojialiyev says that mixed messages from the state on freedom of expression are unlikely to stop people like him from pushing the boundaries. “I was not afraid (of arrest) but I was ready for it,” he said with a smile. Public criticism of the government was unthinkable under former president Islam Karimov, who ran the majority Muslim former Soviet republic from 1989 until his death in 2016. Critics such as journalist Yusuf Ruzimuradov spent years in prison on charges related to public security and inciting rebellion. Ruzimuradov was released last March after 19 years behind bars. “During Karimov’s time bloggers could write only about small issues, mostly social,” said Tojialiyev, whose day job is running Ziyouz.uz, a catalogue of Uzbek literature. “It was not possible to talk about serious and political subjects.”  Karimov’s successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has proclaimed a new era of openness and freedom of the press, and moved to curb the powers of the security forces. “I regard as real journalists the ones who expose ... bureaucracy, indifference, extortion, corruption,” he said in remarks published by his office last year. “There needs to be plurality of opinions in the national media space,” he said. The foreign ministry, which answers all queries from the international media including to the police, did not reply to a request for comment on this story. Mirziyoyev’s approach has improved Uzbekistan’s image abroad and helped it start rebuilding ties with institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which had in effect withdrawn from the country under Karimov. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross praised “the successful political and democratic reforms that are underway in Uzbekistan” on a visit to Tashkent last week. “...the types of reforms the President has embraced here are essential to establishing the certitude that companies need to open operations in the local economy,” he told an American-Uzbek Chamber of Commerce Business Forum. Bordering Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the country of 33 million produces gold, natural gas and oil. One of its selling points to foreign investors is as a stepping stone between Russia and China. Some of the government’s steps have been clumsy, however. Journalists from Russia who visited Tashkent this month as members of President Vladimir Putin’s media pool, including a Reuters reporter, were instructed not to leave their hotels without official minders “for their own safety”. The Uzbek blogosphere has expanded since the election in December 2016 of Mirziyoyev, who was prime minister under Karimov.  Bloggers, writing mostly on Facebook, question policies they see as excessively strict or unnecessary. Mirziyoyev himself has a Facebook page, as do many senior officials, although less than 3 percent of Uzbeks regularly visit Facebook. One story that went viral was that of a young teacher killed by a truck while cleaning up a highway ahead of a presidential visit last March, part of a mass mobilisation of public sector workers by provincial authorities. Mirziyoyev quickly responded to the outcry, telling reporters he felt responsible for the woman’s death and ordering his subordinates to stop what he called “window-dressing”. “Bloggers have become the moving force, not only in social networks but in society as well,” Tojialiyev said. “If they raise certain issues the government is forced to address them.” In several cases, authorities have punished low-level officials after bloggers helped spread news of abuse of power, such as a district mayor filmed beating headmasters for failing to bring enough people to a national holiday event. On Monday, Mirziyoyev sacked a deputy PM who was criticised on social media after a photo showed his subordinates standing knee-deep in a ditch full of water as a punishment. The announcement did not mention the photo but it follows an online outcry. It was successes like these that emboldened about a dozen young male bloggers, mainly focused on religious issues, to criticise a draft of school uniform regulations in June that disallowed hijabs, headscarves prescribed in Islam for girls and women. After the government enacted the regulations in August, bloggers cried foul and some called for protests. They were joined by Fazliddin Parpiyev, imam of one of Tashkent’s mosques. The pushback was swift. Police arrested at least eight bloggers and the imam was dismissed. Parpiyev told Reuters he remains out of work after refusing to apologise. One of the detained bloggers, Adham Olimov, told Reuters a court sentenced him to 15 days of administrative arrest on charges of disobeying police orders. He and others were out of jail by mid-September. “Things have improved ... Under Karimov, we would have been sent to prison for 15-20 years,” said another blogger who asked not to be named so as to avoid further problems. “(But) I am now avoiding sensitive issues. I have a family ... Blogging is not worth going to jail for.”     Tojialiyev said he would continue to write about the school uniform issue, however, and criticised the response as going against the spirit of liberal reforms. “There was no official explanation or response from the government on what was going on,” he said. “We live in a democratic society or we claim to have one, but what happened was not in line with our claim - for example, arresting bloggers on trumped-up charges, not informing relatives about the whereabouts of the detainees and so on.” Tojialiyev said he has not experienced any pressure or intimidation from the authorities, but friends have tried to persuade him to be more careful about sensitive issues. “We can no longer see the bravery and fury which used to be there (in the blogosphere) months ago,” he says. “Bloggers have once again started writing about minor and old matters.” While Tojialiyev’s optimism may have wavered, his determination has not. “I know that what I am doing is not a crime and perhaps that’s why I am not afraid. Also, public and international pressure is a factor now. Maybe this gives me some confidence.” Additional reporting by Polina Nikolskaya; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-uzbekistan-blogging-insight/uzbek-bloggers-test-and-hit-the-limits-of-new-found-freedom-idUKKCN1N50NS,2019-02-08,"When Uzbek authorities detained several online activists in September, blogger Davronbek Tojialiyev packed some clothes in a bag and waited for the knock on his door.",Uzbek bloggers test - and hit - the limits of new-found freedom
2019-02-08," (This Nov. 4 story adds “anti-European Union” in paragraph 3) By Geert De Clercq PARIS (Reuters) - France’s far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party has moved ahead of President Emmanuel Macron’s Republique En Marche (LREM) party for the first time in a poll of voting intentions for the May 2019 European Parliament elections. An Ifop poll published on Sunday showed Macron’s centrist movement with 19 percent of voting intentions compared to 20 percent in the last poll at the end of August, while far-right leader Marine Le Pen’s RN — formerly the National Front — rose to 21 percent from 17 percent previously. Together with the seven percent score of sovereignist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan and one percent each for “Frexit” parties led by former Le Pen associate Florian Philippot and Francois Asselineau, far-right and anti-European Union parties won a combined 30 percent of voting intentions, up from 25 percent at the end of August.  The poll, conducted on Oct. 30-31, asked nearly 1,000 French people who they would vote for if the European Parliament elections were to be held the next Sunday.  The conservative Les Republicains party led by Laurent Wauquiez slipped two percentage points to 13 percent, while the far-left France Insoumise led by Jean-Luc Melenchon fell from 14 to 11 percent.  Melenchon was widely criticised and mocked after yelling at police officers during a raid of his party offices as part of an anti-corruption inquiry.  In an Odoxa-Dentsu poll released mid-September, Macron and Le Pen’s parties were neck-and-neck at around 21 percent, while the conservative Les Republicains came third with 14 percent and Melenchon’s France Insoumise fourth with 12.5 percent. In an Ifop poll in May, the LREM was seen winning 27 percent of the EU parliament vote, well ahead of the far right’s 17 percent and more than Macron’s 24 percent in the first round of France’s April 2017 presidential elections. The European elections are shaping up to be a major battle between centrist, pro-EU parties like Macron’s LREM and far-right formations that want to stop immigration and globalisation. The European Parliament elections determine who leads the major EU institutions, including the European Commission, the bloc’s civil service, and are also important as a bellwether of sentiment among the EU’s 500 million people. In a YouGov poll published last week, Macron’s popularity fell to its lowest level since his 2017 election, with only 21 percent of those polled saying they were satisfied with him. Macron’s reputation has been hit by the brusque departure of two high-profile ministers and a summer scandal over his bodyguard, while stubbornly high unemployment, high taxes and rising fuel prices add to a general feeling of discontent.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity in Britain’s dominant services sector slowed to a seven-month low last month and firms’ expectations for the coming year are the gloomiest since just after the 2016 Brexit vote, a major survey showed on Monday. The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 52.2 in October from 53.9 in September, its lowest since a patch of unusually icy weather in March and a bigger fall than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll. Britain’s economy has slowed since the June 2016 referendum, and Monday’s data added to signs that a patch of solid consumer-led growth over the summer months is now fading as firms focus on risks from Brexit and warning signs about the global economy. “With autumn upon us, consumers are tightening their belts. And with the prospect of any greater certainty seemingly as distant as ever, businesses ... are struggling to maintain their confident outlook,” said Chris Sood-Nicholls, a managing director at Lloyds Bank’s commercial lending unit. Businesses’ expectations for stronger activity over the next 12 months were the weakest since July 2016, when they briefly hit a post-financial crisis low following the vote to leave the European Union. Sterling briefly dipped to a day’s low against the U.S. dollar after the data, but market reaction was muted overall. Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to agree a withdrawal deal with the EU to ensure goods, services and workers will continue to be able to cross borders easily after Britain leaves the bloc on March 29 next year. Businesses also reported headwinds from a slowing global economy, trade tensions, and financial market turbulence. “It therefore remains unclear as to the extent to which Brexit worries are exacerbating or obfuscating a more broad-based slowing of the economy,” IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said. Last week the Bank of England forecast Britain’s rate of economic growth would halve to 0.3 percent in the final three months of 2018 from an estimated 0.6 percent in the third quarter of the year, when good weather lifted consumer spending.   But Governor Mark Carney said the central bank would look beyond what it expects to be short-term growth volatility, and might need to raise interest rates faster than markets expect if Brexit ends up going relatively smoothly. The weak services data follows the softest manufacturing PMI since the Brexit vote. The two PMIs, combined with more robust construction data, are jointly the weakest since March and point to quarterly growth of 0.2 percent if things do not improve, IHS Markit said. Businesses said new orders were coming in at the slowest rate since July 2016, and their costs were rising at the fastest rate since June due to higher fuel bills and rising wages. However, they expected orders to pick up if the Brexit talks were concluded successfully. The services PMI in Britain does not include the public sector or retailers, who enjoyed strong consumer spending over the summer but face longer-term challenges from online sales. Consumer-facing firms such as hotels, restaurants and leisure companies reported the weakest PMI performance.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Hispanics are more interested in voting this year than in the last U.S. congressional midterm elections in 2014 and their enthusiasm outpaces that of all U.S. adults, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Sunday. The poll also found likely Hispanic voters nearly twice as inclined to support Democrats for the House of Representatives as Republicans in Tuesday’s elections. Voter registration groups are using Republican President Donald Trump’s nationalist, anti-immigrant rhetoric as an opportunity to drive up Latino enthusiasm. In an illustration of their passion, one group that is part of an alliance that has reached out to more than 1 million potential voters in Arizona took its name from the Spanish word for “fight.” Most opinion polls and political handicappers expect Democrats to win the 23 seats they need to assume control of the House. Republicans are favoured to keep control of the Senate.  Latinos could play a crucial role in several races, from tight Senate battles in Arizona and Texas to Florida’s close Senate and governor’s races. In California, the flourishing Latino population has helped put in play some Republican-controlled House districts Democrats hope to flip. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken Sept. 1 to Oct. 29, found that 36 percent of Hispanic voters said they were “certain” to vote, up from 27 percent in 2014. That increase is nearly double the five percentage point rise in voter enthusiasm among all Americans over the same period, the poll showed. Enthusiasm appears especially high among Hispanic Democrats.  Forty-two percent of Hispanic Democrats said they were “certain” to vote, up from 29 percent in 2014. Among likely Hispanic voters, 60 percent said they will vote for a Democratic candidate for the House, and 32 percent would back a Republican. Hispanics are a politically diverse group, with 55 percent of likely voters identifying as Democrats, 31 percent as Republicans and 12 percent as independent, the poll showed. Just over half, 53 percent, of likely Hispanic voters said they were “very motivated” to pick a candidate for Congress who opposes Trump, compared with 43 percent of all likely voters, 75 percent of likely Democratic voters and 9 percent of likely Republican voters. For candidates in border states with large Hispanic populations such as Arizona, a fundamental question is whether Latino voters will turn up in large numbers on Tuesday.  The voting bloc has long held potential for the Democratic Party but often disappoints. Record-low Hispanic turnout in 2014 was a warning sign for both parties. Bea Nevarez hopes to turn that around, registering 800 people to vote this year. In the final days before the elections, she went door-to-door to encourage people to vote in Tucson. Nevarez, 18, works for a group called “Lucha,” a Spanish word meaning “struggle” or “fight.” It is a partisan affiliate of One Arizona, a broad alliance that says it has knocked on 1.5 million doors in the state this year, part of a broad grassroots effort to reverse declining Latino participation. One Arizona says it has registered 200,000 voters this year. “I’m out here trying to get your voice heard,” Nevarez tells reluctant voters. Her persistence paid off when she knocked on the door of Jose Alberto and Norma Moreno, Mexican immigrants who are now U.S. citizens. Sitting at his kitchen table, Jose Alberto Moreno, 62, at first told Nevarez he had no intention of voting. “I don’t believe in any of that. All politicians are liars,” said Moreno, who works at a furniture warehouse. But Nevarez insisted, engaging him in a conversation that eventually turned to healthcare, Moreno’s main concern. After a few minutes, he agreed to vote. “I’m going to do it now. She convinced me,” Moreno said. The Republican National Committee said it has also reached out to voters in Arizona this year, as part of a drive in 11 states. America’s 29 million Latinos account for nearly 13 percent of eligible voters this year, but their turnout rate has declined since 2006, according to the Pew Research Centre. Only 27 percent of eligible Latinos voted in the last midterm elections in 2014, and only 16 percent of those aged 18 to 35, Pew said. Some activists said they were motivated by watching Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff whose anti-immigrant policies brought his office multi-million-dollar penalties for racial profiling and eventually a contempt of court conviction. He maintained that the prosecution was political, aimed at helping oust him from office. Trump later pardoned him. “We have seen an igniting of fear, division and violence under this (Trump) administration, but that’s not new to Arizona,” said Alejandra Gomez, a co-executive director of Lucha. “We had the original Trump here under Arpaio.” Reporting by Chris Kahn in New York and Daniel Trotta in Tuscon, Arizona; Editing by Jason Szep and Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-latinos/ready-for-a-fight-voter-enthusiasm-surges-among-u-s-hispanics-idUKKCN1N90AE,2019-02-08,"Hispanics are more interested in voting this year than in the last U.S. congressional midterm elections in 2014 and their enthusiasm outpaces that of all U.S. adults, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll released on Sunday.",Ready for a fight: Voter enthusiasm surges among U.S. Hispanics
2019-02-08,"PALMDALE, Calif. (Reuters) - Wendy Burke has had enough. Campaign advertisements bombard her favourite TV shows. Dozens of election pamphlets fill her mailbox. Every day, she gets several political calls on her cell phone and more on her landline. Strangers knock at her door seeking her vote. “It’s ridiculous,” Burke, 47, said outside a shopping centre in Palmdale, California. “I’ve had to block my calls.”  Welcome to the most expensive race in the hard-fought battle between Republicans and Democrats for control of the U.S. House of Representatives, which will be decided in Tuesday’s elections.  The blizzard of spending in California’s 25th district, a region stretching north and east of Los Angeles into the high desert of the Antelope Valley, stands out even during the most expensive congressional elections in U.S. history.  Most of the money is funnelled into non-stop advertising - on TV, radio, social media, yard signs, automated robocalls to cell phones and land lines, bumper stickers and a deluge of pamphlets stuffed into mailboxes. “The mailers go in the trash,” she said. “I can’t wait until this whole thing is over.”The contest, a top Democratic target, has drawn more than $26 million in spending by candidates and outside groups since January 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of Federal Election Commission (FEC) data. It leads the 10 priciest House races, where a total of $238 million has been spent. tmsnrt.rs/2qrstCG Democrats - aiming to pick up the 23 House seats and two in the Senate needed to control Congress and block much of Republican President Donald Trump’s agenda and increase oversight of his administration - have far outpaced their opponents in spending. Democrats and their allies in the 10 costliest House races spent $142 million to Republicans’ $96 million, Reuters’ analysis found. The fight for the Senate is even costlier. In Florida, Republican Rick Scott’s contest against incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson is the most expensive Senate race. The candidates and their allies have spent nearly $160 million. Nelson’s campaign spent about $25 million while outside groups splashed out $45 million supporting him or opposing Scott, who spent nearly $67 million. Outside groups spent $22 million supporting him and opposing Nelson. Missouri’s Senate race between Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley is second most expensive at roughly $108 million. Texas is third at about $100 million. All up, it is a record for a congressional midterm cycle.  Candidates, political parties and outside groups are set to spend more than $5.2 billion on House and Senate contests combined, according to the non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics.  The Democratic share of spending for the House swelled to 60 percent this year, from 44 percent in 2014, the previous midterm elections, said Sheila Krumholz, the centre’s executive director. One reason for the big spending: Trump. “This is in no small part a referendum on the 2016 election, and it’s been bolstered by the role of women, the #MeToo Movement, the Brett Kavanaugh nomination, and the fact that so many women are running,” Krumholz said.  Republicans are seeking re-election in nine of the 10 most expensive House races. The tenth is an open Republican seat. Each recorded spending of more than $20 million. Four of the costliest races are in California. Contests in Washington, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Florida, New York and Minnesota round out the list. California’s 25th district is one of the most competitive. Republicans have held the seat since 1992. But the past decade has seen an influx of newcomers priced out of the Los Angeles housing market, and now nearly 40 percent of the district’s 720,000 residents are Hispanic. Democrats set their sights on taking the district after 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won it by seven points and a Republican, Representative Steve Knight, clinched another term by six points. This year, Knight, 51, has been outraised and outspent by Democratic challenger Katie Hill, who previously ran a non-profit for the homeless and is seeking office for the first time. Hill, 31, raised $7.3 million by mid-October, compared to the $2.4 million raised by Knight, according to FEC data. Hill has out-spent Knight $5.9 million to $2 million, with nearly three quarters of her money going to advertising.  With money from outside groups factored in, more than $18 million has been spent on Hill’s behalf, compared to about $8 million for Knight, Reuters found. Independence USA PAC, almost entirely funded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, has spent more than $4.5 million in ads supporting Hill. The money helped the political newcomer blanket the district with her liberal message supporting a path to universal healthcare, an assault weapons ban and gay-and-lesbian rights. That could prove a double-edged sword. District voter Burke said she had leaned toward Knight. Then the avalanche of Hill ads and mailers annoyed Burke so much it cemented her decision to cast her ballot for him.

2019-02-08,"SEWICKLEY, Pa. (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s stunning 2016 White House win got a major boost from sagging Democratic enthusiasm in Pennsylvania, but now the party is poised for big wins on Tuesday in congressional races in the state that could signal which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives. A court-ordered overhaul of Pennsylvania voting districts and stubbornly low approval ratings for Trump in the state have placed Democrats within striking distance of claiming at least half of Pennsylvania’s 18 congressional seats in a test of the party’s ability to win back working-class voters. Republicans are scrambling. Take Republican incumbent Keith Rothfus. He won election in 2012 in Pennsylvania’s current 12th district outside Pittsburgh, which includes some staunch Republican strongholds. The 56-year-old attorney was reelected twice by constituents who favoured Trump by over 20 percentage points in 2016. But redistricting has forced Rothfus into a new 17th district, where only 36 percent of voters are Republicans and nearly half are Democrats. Opinion polls now show Rothfus trailing moderate Democrat Conor Lamb, a 34-year-old former Marine who gained political stardom by winning a special House election in a solidly Republican district last spring. Lamb has support from more than half of likely voters.  The change in Democratic fortunes increases the party’s hopes of making the net gain of 23 seats it needs to control the House and stall much of Trump’s agenda. Republicans are favoured to hold the Senate. “Pennsylvania is going to be the bellwether. It is ground zero if you’re looking at who’s going to control the House,” said Mike DeVanney, a Pittsburgh-based Republican strategist. Democrats, who currently hold six of Pennsylvania’s House seats, could win at least nine, according to the University of Virginia Centre for Politics, which tracks House and Senate races. “Anything more than that probably would reflect an outcome in which Democrats won significantly more than the 23 net seats they need,” said Centre analyst Kyle Kondik.  All told, at least seven House Republican seats once considered safe are now in play as a result of the redrawn map in Pennsylvania.  “We were having elections that did not have two candidates running in them in many of these districts. That doesn’t give people a real choice,” Lamb told Reuters in an interview. “A citizen deserves to have a competitive election.” Rothfus, who was not available for an interview, has campaigned largely on economic issues, a position that won him an endorsement on Friday from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “The healthy economy we’re seeing is a result of a combination of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the deregulation of small businesses,” Rothfus said last month on Twitter. “That’s what is putting hard-working Americans to work, and that’s what is putting more money in their pockets.” Republicans and Democrats have both tried to use district lines to maximize their power.  The last redistricting wave began eight years ago when the conservative Tea Party movement, driven by opposition to Democratic former President Barack Obama, gave Republicans control of the U.S. House and 10 new governorships. The dynamics underlying this year’s House races in Pennsylvania, including anger among Democratic and independent voters over Trump, could give Democrats a shot at exceeding their state sweep in 2006, which was a banner year nationally for the party. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered the state’s new district map earlier this year in a ruling that later survived a Republican challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the new map, two Republican-held House seats outside Philadelphia where Republican incumbents are stepping down are seen as likely Democratic or safe Democratic wins, according to a Reuters analysis of a trio of political forecasting groups: Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and the University of Virginia’s Centre for Politics. A third Republican seat with a retiring incumbent, near the eastern city of Allentown, is rated as leaning Democratic.  Meanwhile, Trump’s political style looks to be becoming a liability. A Franklin & Marshall College survey of likely Pennsylvania voters conducted Oct. 22-28 found that 52 percent preferred Democratic House candidates. Two out of three viewed that choice as a vote against Trump, who has a 36 percent approval rate in the state. At least three other House Republican incumbents - Mike Kelly, Scott Perry and Brian Fitzpatrick - are in tight reelection battles. Democrat George Scott needs Republican support to defeat Perry in a district including the state capital, Harrisburg. On Thursday, he was able to showcase Republican backing by appearing with about a dozen Republicans, including a former state senator, a former state representative and a staffer to a former Republican governor. Several said Perry had become too partisan in Washington, where he joined the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus. Perry, whose campaign declined an interview request, has defended membership in that group.  “It is not a right-wing organization. We take anybody that comes,” Perry said in a debate last month, according to local media. The critics expressed concern over Perry’s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act - Obama’s signature healthcare program - and its insurance protections for people with preexisting medical conditions. Former state Representative Steve Nickol told Reuters that he supported Perry during his first run for Congress but was dismayed to see him become “radically partisan” in Washington. “I’ve talked to even some elected (Republican) officials who are kind of upset with the way things are and feel that Scott (Perry) is a little too extreme in some of his positions,” Nickol said. “They’re not about to come out and endorse George, even though they’ve told me in private that they’ll vote for him.” Full U.S. election coverage: here Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Frances Kerry",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-pennsylvania/democrats-road-to-controlling-u-s-house-runs-through-pennsylvania-idUKKCN1N90AQ,2019-02-08,,Democrats' road to controlling U.S. House runs through Pennsylvania
2019-02-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi Foreign Ministry rejected on Saturday what it called U.S. interference in its affairs after the U.S. embassy issued a statement telling neighbouring Iran to respect Iraq’s sovereignty allow demobilisation of Shi’ite militias. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad had posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday saying Tehran must “respect the sovereignty of the Iraqi government and permit the disarming, demobilization, and reintegration” of Shi’ite militias. It was one of several statements issued on the embassy’s Twitter account outlining U.S. demands before new U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil and financial sector take effect on Nov. 4. The sanctions worry Iraq as it imports crucial supplies from Iran. Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement it “rejects interference in Iraq’s internal affairs, especially domestic security reform” and demanded the Twitter post be removed. Washington and Tehran have competed for influence in Iraq since the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iraq’s Shi’ite militias, which took part in a U.S.-backed campaign to defeat Islamic State, were formally included in the security forces this year. Some militias are backed by Iran, a majority Shi’ite nation. Washington wants them disarmed.

2019-02-08,"MILAN (Reuters) - Heavy rain and gales devastating parts of Italy have claimed two more lives, taking the overall death toll to at least 17, and laid waste to vast swathes of forest. A German tourist died on Friday when hit by lightning on the island of Sardinia while another person struck by lightning several days ago died in hospital, Italy’s Civil Protection Agency said on Saturday. A spokeswoman said 17 deaths related to the severe weather had been reported to the Agency so far. Many of the victims to date have been killed by falling trees. Coldiretti, the association of Italian agricultural companies, said in a statement that gales had destroyed around 14 million trees, many in the far north. Areas from the far northeast to Sicily in the southwest have been affected by the storms, with the worst damage in the northern regions of Trentino and Veneto - the region around Venice - where villages and roads have been cut off by landslides. In the Alps near Belluno, 100 km (60 miles) north of Venice, pine trees and red spruces were snapped wholesale like matchsticks. The surface of the Comelico Superiore dam, farther north near the Austrian border, was covered with the trunks of trees that had fallen into the Piave river.   “We’ll need at least a century to return to normality,” Coldiretti said. Many of the squares and walkways of Venice itself have been submerged in the highest floods the canal city has seen in a decade. The governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said the region’s storm damage amounted to at least a billion euros (877.73 million pounds).  Angelo Borrelli, head of the Civil Protection agency, said Veneto had seen winds of up to 180 kph (112 mph), and that the situation there was “apocalyptic”.

2019-02-08,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Pakistani lawyer who helped a Christian woman overturn her death sentence for blasphemy said on Saturday he had left the country in fear of his life after her acquittal earlier this week sparked street protests by Islamists. Leaders of the ultra-Islamist Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) group blocked main roads in Pakistan’s biggest cites for three days, calling for the murder of the Supreme Court judges who acquitted Asia Bibi on Wednesday — urging their cooks and servants to kill them.   Saiful Mulook had kept a low profile during the years he represented Bibi, a mother-of-five who has been on death row since 2010, due to the highly sensitive nature of the case. Two politicians who had tried to help her have been assassinated. Mulook told Reuters in a WhatsApp message he had gone abroad “just to save (my) life from angry mob” and because of fears for the safety of his family.  “I consulted and everybody is of this opinion (that I should leave),” he said, adding that he would return to the country to continue his work on the case if he was given protection by security forces. The TLP called off the protests late on Friday after striking a deal with the government that would see authorities seek to put Bibi on an ‘exit control list’ barring her from leaving the country. Bibi’s whereabouts are unknown, but Islamists have warned the authorities against taking her out of the country.  “There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,” TLP leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi said after the deal was reached. Earlier in the week one of Rizvi’s deputies called for Pakistan’s Chief Justice Saqib Nisar and two other judges who ruled in the case to be murdered. “Whoever, who has got any access to them, kill them before the evening,” TLP co-founder Muhammad Afzal Qadri told supporters. The TLP was founded out of a movement supporting a bodyguard who assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he spoke in Bibi’s defence in 2011. Federal minister for minorities Shahbaz Bhatti was also killed after calling for her release. Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam after neighbours objected to her drinking water from their glass because she was not Muslim. She always denied having committed blasphemy. The case has outraged Christians worldwide and been a source of division within Pakistan, where Islamist parties such as the TLP have framed Bibi’s release as Pakistan’s government caving into Western demands. Bibi’s acquittal is being reviewed, though it is extremely rare for a review to overturn a Supreme Court ruling.

2019-02-08,"SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (Reuters) - In rally after rally, President Donald Trump exhorts throngs of red-hatted supporters to treat next week’s congressional elections as a referendum on Trumpism and the grass-roots movement that swept him to power. “You’re voting for me in 2018,” Trump told a raucous crowd in a late September appearance for Republican candidates in Missouri. “You’re voting for me.” The plea speaks to the challenge facing the president and his supporters: With Democrats threatening to take over the House of Representatives and key governors’ offices, the success of his legislative agenda over the next two years hinges on whether he can energise his backers around candidates who are not named Trump. This year’s election is the first real test of whether the coalition behind Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan can evolve from a diffuse, personality-driven following to an organised political force able to boost candidates outside his electoral strongholds. Reuters surveyed officials from 18 Republican campaigns, analysed data from polling partner Ipsos and interviewed dozens of candidates, strategists and Trump supporters to assess the reach and influence of the president’s self-styled “MAGA Movement” ahead of the elections. United behind Trump’s “America First” agenda of tighter borders, protectionist economic policies and unilateralist diplomacy, the MAGA coalition swept up 2016 voters who felt ignored by Washington and welcomed Trump’s vows to upend its institutions. Today, it attracts Tea Party conservatives, evangelical Christians, gun rights advocates, and working-class voters drawn to Trump’s outsider persona. Trump’s populist base is firmly established in the mostly southern and western parts of the country where he’s most popular. MAGA supporters turn out in force for Trump-backed candidates in those areas, boosting them in opinion polls and volunteering for their campaigns. In some cases, they have taken control of state party machines, harnessing their infrastructure and money for candidates in Trump’s mould. But outside of Trump’s strongholds, the influence of MAGA supporters is more pocketed, especially in Rust Belt states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the upper Midwest. So, while Trump loyalists can tip the scales in specific U.S. House districts in those areas, they have done less to boost Trump-backed candidates in statewide contests for governor and U.S. Senate. With no central organisation and little regard for Republican hierarchies, MAGA enthusiasts agitate largely through social media and Internet forums, such as Facebook and Reddit, the social networking site. In dozens of interviews, Reuters found their willingness to back local campaigns often has less to do with party loyalty than with helping Trump. “The 2018 elections will be a test of how popular Trump is, how popular his policies are, did we organise well or do we need to do better and improve things for 2020,” said Scott Presler, a MAGA activist in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Among the 18 Trump-endorsed Republicans running for Senate or governor in states where Trump won the presidential race by more than 10 percentage points in 2016, more than 80 percent are ahead in opinion polls, based on data aggregated by RealClearPolitics and 538.com, non-partisan websites that gather polling from multiple sources.  Yet among the 16 Trump-backed candidates for Senate or governor in states where he won by fewer than 10 points, just four –  a quarter – are polling ahead. The challenge is starkest where Trump-backed candidates are trying to flip governors’ offices and Senate seats held by Democrats, Reuters found. In states where Trump won by double digits in 2016, two of the five candidates he has endorsed in races for Democrat-held Senate and governors’ seats are leading in the polls, and two others are within a few points. But in states where Trump won by less than 10 points, all six candidates he has endorsed in races for Democratic seats are behind in recent polls, five of them by at least 10 points. Through much of the campaign season, Trump supporters in many places were “leaning on their shovels,” because they were over-confident of victory, Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser and campaign strategist, told Reuters. MAGA loyalists have grown more energized in recent weeks, realizing Trump’s agenda “would come grinding to a halt” if Democrats capture the U.S. House, Bannon added. “You’ve seen the establishment and the hardcore anti-establishment in the Trump base all come together.” The president remains enormously popular with that base - Reuters/Ipsos polling gives him an 84 percent approval rate among Republicans - and more than two-thirds of those who voted for him in 2016 say they identify with MAGA ideals. Yet their views diverge on what MAGA means: while more than half equate it with strengthening the economy and tightening borders, upwards of a quarter say MAGA simply means “Donald Trump.” (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2RuhKTv) That raises questions about the future of MAGA once Trump leaves office. On Oct. 1, Trump whipped up a crowd of nearly 10,000 at a rally supporting Marsha Blackburn’s U.S. Senate campaign in Tennessee, where Trump won in 2016 by 26 points. “A vote for Marsha is really a vote for me and everything that we stand for,” he told the audience. Soon after, opinion polls showed Blackburn, a U.S. House member, pulling ahead of her Democratic opponent, former two-term governor Phil Bredesen. “We knew President Trump would be an extraordinary surrogate in East Tennessee,” Republican Party spokesman Garren Shipley told Reuters. Bredesen’s campaign dismissed the polls: “The only poll that matters is on election day,” said spokeswoman Alyssa Hansen.  On Oct. 10, the president held another rally 500 miles (800 km) away with a similar message for Lou Barletta’s U.S. Senate campaign in Pennsylvania, where Trump eked out a one-point victory in 2016. “I need you,” Trump told the crowd. “Vote for Lou!” It was Trump’s second rally with Barletta since August. But Barletta, also a U.S. House member, trails incumbent Democratic Senator Bob Casey, and has remained behind by more than 10 points in polls. The divergent fortunes of Blackburn and Barletta reflect the challenge in harnessing Trump’s MAGA coalition. Following Trump’s victory in 2016, Tennessee’s Republican establishment embraced his agenda and welcomed his supporters. Many are volunteering now for Blackburn and other Trump-backed candidates, helping with phone banks, neighbourhood canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts. The state party leaders who didn’t support Trump initially have “figured out they have to help him,” says Todd Fowler, who heads the local party in Johnson City, Tennessee, and serves on the state party’s executive committee. “Tennessee likes what he’s doing.” In Pennsylvania, where Trump’s 2016 win was razor-thin, his support is mostly concentrated in rural and working-class areas. Polls show Trump’s pick for governor, Scott Wagner, running well behind incumbent Democratic Governor Tom Wolf. Trump is drawing people to congressional campaigns in Pennsylvania, but they are coming “very tentatively,” says Eugene Sorrentino, 76, a retired power company technician and member of the local Republican committee in Erie, Pennsylvania. Sorrentino recently staffed a welcome tent set up by the party at a county fair and “all I heard was requests for Trump paraphernalia,” he said. The congressional races “weren’t on their agenda,” he added. In Trump’s strongholds, his ability to help candidates goes beyond a bounce in the polls. Nearly all the Trump-backed campaigns contacted by Reuters reported a surge of volunteer activism – a “Trump bump” – after the president’s endorsement. In Western Pennsylvania, a corner where Trump is enormously popular, U.S. Representative Mike Kelly says his campaign relies heavily on MAGA volunteers. Kelly’s district, redrawn this year, includes counties where Trump won by as much as 20 points in 2016, according to PlanScore.org, a nonpartisan group. Trump provides “that shot of adrenaline you need from time to time,” Kelly told Reuters as he prepared to join the president for an Oct. 10 rally in Erie. One engine for turning out Trump’s base in his stronghold regions is America First Action, a “Super PAC” allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections.  The group has spent more than $26 million on phone messaging and advertising in five battleground Senate races – Arizona, Montana, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota – and across 11 congressional districts in Texas, Minnesota, Maine, Michigan, West Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina. It is run by Trump loyalists and relies on big donations from Republican Party stalwarts, including casino magnates Sheldon Adelson and Steve Wynn and mining engineer and businessman Robert Murray. In an Oct. 1 memo, White House political director Bill Stepian advised congressional campaigns that the best way to capture MAGA support is to align “closely, clearly and boldly” with Trump. The president, he wrote, is “ready, willing and able to put the power and force of his coalition to work for the candidates with whom he stands, and who stand with him.” At the national level, Republican Party officials have fallen in line and embraced the president, routinely echoing Trump’s nationalist campaign themes. But for candidates in areas where the president doesn’t dominate the electorate, embracing Trump has mixed success. In Florida, where Trump prevailed by one point in 2016, he endorsed Republican gubernatorial candidate and die-hard supporter Ron DeSantis before the party primary. But now, in a state that hasn’t elected a Democratic governor in 20 years, DeSantis is polling slightly behind in the general election contest against Andrew Gillum, the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee. Some Republican candidates in areas with moderate voters who view Trump less favourably have steered clear of the president, a Reuters analysis found last month. MAGA supporters have become a force in many state party offices, including some states outside the president’s established southern and western strongholds. In Ohio, a swing state where Trump won by eight points in 2016, the state Republican Party selected Jane Timken, a Trump friend and loyalist, to take over as chairwoman in the wake of the election. In Nevada, where Democrat Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential vote, the state Republican Party has launched weekly events, such as MAGA Mondays and Trump Tuesdays, to attract the president’s supporters. Rochelle Swanson, 30, a MAGA activist in Reno who began posting pro-Trump articles and interviewing local Republican candidates on social media, was asked by a party official in July to help with voter outreach. She now aligns her social media and canvassing with the party’s messaging, she says, and “there is good unity happening.” Yet even as MAGA supporters have become woven into the fabric of the Republican Party, many acknowledge it will be a challenge to preserve their coalition and continue shaping U.S. politics once Trump leaves office. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll earlier this month, more than a quarter of Trump voters said they did not know who would carry Trump’s vision if he leaves politics. “I don’t think anybody could take Trump’s spot,” said Jeremy Messina, a MAGA activist in upstate New York who runs a political advertising media company. “I don’t see it.” (The story was refiled to correct the name to Jeremy Messina, not Jimmy Messina in the last paragraph) Reporting by Julia Harte, Ned Parker and Peter Eisler; Additional reporting by Chris Kahn, Jason Lange and Nathan Layne; Editing by Ross Colvin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-trump-maga-insight/trump-supporters-election-test-a-movement-or-a-moment-idUKKCN1N711B,2019-02-08,"In rally after rally, President Donald Trump exhorts throngs of red-hatted supporters to treat next week’s congressional elections as a referendum on Trumpism and the grass-roots movement that swept him to power.",Trump supporters’ election test: a movement or a moment
2019-02-08,"BELFAST/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Senior Irish and British ministers and the leader of the Northern Irish unionist party propping up the minority British government all expressed confidence on Friday that a Brexit deal could be reached in the coming weeks. With just five months until Britain is due to exit the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a divorce deal, with negotiators stuck on how to keep open the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland. Britain’s Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, May’s de facto deputy, said he “hoped and expected” that Brexit negotiators will secure a final agreement in the coming weeks, a view shared on Friday by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney after the pair met in Dublin. Coveney said he thought it was possible to secure a deal this month. However, he added that this would require some movement by the British side to find a legal wording that can be sold politically on both sides of the Irish Sea, and that negotiators were not there yet. Both ministers said the two sides were “very close” to resolving differences on the border issue. In Belfast, Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, whose party supports May’s minority government in the British parliament, said she hoped the United Kingdom and the EU were close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland.  “Goodness, we have been here on a number of occasions and I hope we are close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland, that is what we want,” she told reporters after meeting with Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab. Raab, who was in Northern Ireland to meet with the province’s political parties, added to the optimism by saying he was confident of reaching a deal that was good for all corners of the United Kingdom. Foster said she made it very clear to Raab that it was very important not to have any regulatory barriers as well as no customs barriers between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland post-Brexit, a key sticking point in the talks. However she also stressed that it was significant that Raab visited ports in Northern Ireland to see the infrastructure there and noted that veterinary checks already take place there between Britain and Northern Ireland.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and China are not close to a deal to resolve their trade differences, the White House’s top economic adviser said on Friday, adding that he was less optimistic than previously that such an agreement would come together. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said on CNBC television that U.S. President Donald Trump, contrary to a report by Bloomberg, has not asked his cabinet to draw up terms of a China trade deal as he prepares to meet at the end of this month with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kudlow said the meeting between Trump and Xi, at the G20 summit in Argentina, was “definite” and would include discussions on trade. He added that Trump “could pull the trigger” on additional tariffs on Chinese imports, depending on how talks go. “There’s no mass movement, there’s no huge thing. We’re not on the cusp of a deal,” Kudlow told CNBC. He added that the administration had not seen any new offer from China. Asked if Trump had told his cabinet to draw up a deal with China, Kudlow said, “no, not specifically,” adding that the Trump administration had already made its demands known to Beijing. Preparations for the Trump-Xi meeting in Buenos Aires were “a normal, routine run-through of things that we’ve already put together,” he added. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to comment on the Bloomberg report, while the Treasury Department did not respond to queries about it.  Hopes that the world’s two largest economies would begin to resolve their bitter trade fight lifted global stock markets on Thursday after Trump and Xi spoke by telephone that day and expressed optimism about their forthcoming meeting. U.S. stocks were down about 1 percent on Friday afternoon after rising earlier, pulled into negative territory by Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) disappointing profit forecast, with Kudlow’s comments extending declines. Trump administration officials have said U.S.-China trade talks cannot resume until Beijing outlines specific actions it would take to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to policies on technology transfers, industrial subsidies and market access. The two countries have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods and Trump has threatened to extend the tariffs to the remainder of China’s $500 billion-plus (£385.8 billion-plus) exports to the United States if the disputes cannot be resolved.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - For Hyundai, the South Korean conglomerate, North Korea has been a story of lost opportunities – and tragedy. In 2003, months before Hyundai was set to open an industrial complex in North Korea, the executive behind the project committed suicide amid accusations his company had made a secret $500 million payment to the North.  Five years later, a Hyundai-run resort in the North was closed after a North Korean soldier shot a South Korean tourist. Both projects have long been shuttered, symbolizing the difficulties South Korean companies have had doing business across the border. But, emboldened by a thawing of relations on the Korean peninsula and attracted by its promise of cheap labor and untapped growth, Hyundai is again preparing to return to North Korea. Hyundai executives and investors are encouraged by a pledge by Seoul and Pyongyang to re-open the Kaesong industrial park  and the Mt. Kumgang resort as part of a warming in ties between the neighbors. International sanctions over the North’s nuclear weapons program make it unclear how quickly investments can resume. But executives and investors are betting Hyundai stands to benefit the most from any peace dividend on the Korean peninsula. “We have invested a lot for a long time, and have a solid and wide network and business rights there,” said Baek Cheon-ho, a senior executive at Hyundai Asan, the subsidiary that managed the Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang projects. “Combining all that, Hyundai will eventually be better off in North Korea.”  For Korea Inc, struggling with high labor costs and slowing growth, North Korea’s cheap labor, vast resources and huge growth potential represent an unmissable opportunity, Baek and several business executives told Reuters. For Hyundai and its ruling family, North Korea also has symbolic importance. Founder Chung Ju-yung was born to a peasant family in Asan, North Korea and named the subsidiary to handle the group’s enterprises after his birthplace. “We’re doing this not only for Hyundai, but for the greater good of all South Korean companies,” Baek said. “If we restart our North Korea businesses, there will be many new jobs for us, but also for a number of other firms working with us.”  Hyundai’s ebb and flow in North Korea also illustrate how it could again become one of the biggest casualties from any setback in international efforts to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program.  Other South Korean conglomerates such as Samsung and Lotte have made smaller bets on North Korea and will need to start from scratch if economic ties resume. Both have set up taskforces in recent months to explore opportunities. Shares of unlisted Hyundai Asan have nearly quadrupled to a record high in over-the-counter trading this year.  Other companies such as train maker Hyundai Rotem (064350.KS), builder Hyundai Engineering & Construction (000720.KS) and Hyundai Elevator (017800.KS), have also surged as the two Koreas work toward officially ending their 1950-53 conflict. “Stocks like Hyundai Elevator are now going up and down driven by anticipation and headline news, rather than fundamentals,” said Lee Gun-min, a fund manager BNK Asset Management. “But we think there is a better chance and visibility about economic cooperation than in the past since the two Koreas are now talking about ending the war.”  Lee manages a “Unification Fund” for his investment firm, targeting stocks with potential exposure to North Korea, mostly Hyundai companies such as Hyundai Elevator but also banks and logistics firms.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has pushed for rapprochement with the North since his election last year, calls the Kaesong industrial park a “lifeline” for South Korea. Asia’s fourth-biggest economy is being squeezed globally between high-end, innovative manufacturers and low-cost producers in China and elsewhere. Before the 2016 closure of Kaesong, some 120 South Korean companies employed 55,000 North Korean workers there, making everything from clothes and kitchen utensils to electronic components. The North Korean workers were well qualified, hard working and cost just a fraction of what workers in the South were paid, factory owners said. Almost all small and medium enterprises which used to operate in Kaesong said they would like to go back, according to an April survey.  Seven out of 10 South Korean companies would prefer to use North Korean workers instead of foreign migrants due to language barriers and high costs associated with hiring foreign labor, a separate survey by the Korea Federation of SMEs found. Hyundai Asan has the most riding on the prospect of a peaceful peninsula.  It paid $1.2 billion to buy exclusive rights for Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang, and has interests in railroads and infrastructure projects including reconnecting inter-Korean railways.   Hyundai Asan’s rights to land the size of Manhattan in Kaesong last for 50 years, and it has a plan to build an even bigger factory town if the complex reopens, accommodating 2,000 companies and 350,000 North Korean workers.  Less than 5 percent of the total property in Kaesong has been developed currently, Hyundai told Reuters.  Officials say Hyundai has also agreed with the North to run tours in the coastal city of Wonsan, which North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to build into a hotspot for tourism and foreign investment, as well as Mt. Paektu, the mythical homeland of both Koreas. Hyundai’s Baek said the company is also in talks with Seoul and state-run corporations about projects to reconnect railroads between the North and South. “The government respects Hyundai’s business rights it signed with the North,” said a spokeswoman at South Korea’s Unification Ministry, who did not respond to a question about its discussions with Hyundai.    South Korean government officials and business executives say the biggest hurdle is opposition from Washington, which wants to maintain sanctions until Pyongyang completely denuclearizes. In July, Mark Lambert, director for Korean affairs at the U.S. State Department, called about 10 South Korean businessmen for a meeting at the U.S. embassy in Seoul to deliver a stern message: No resumption of any businesses until denuclearization. “The mood in the room was bleak,” said SJTech Chairman Yoo Chang-geun, who used to operate a factory at Kaesong and attended the meeting.     Baek, who was also present, unsuccessfully argued Kaesong and Mt. Kumgang should be waived from sanctions “to show our goodwill to North Korea”. A spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department declined to comment on details of “private diplomatic conversations”. Hyundai’s relationship with North Korea goes back a long way.       Hyundai founder Chung drove 500 head of cattle across the border to the North in 1998 to aid reconciliation on the divided peninsula.  Kim Jong Il, the late father of Kim Jong Un, was quoted as saying: “Our first love is Hyundai when it comes to North-South relations, a way earlier than with (South Korean) authorities,” according to a North Korean book titled “Patriots Who Left Their Names On Path To Unification”. But the suspension of its North Korea projects left Hyundai Asan with combined losses of $367 million in the past decade. Hyundai admitted it paid North Korean authorities $500 million in 2000 to secure business rights there.  Two days after being questioned by prosecutors over the scandal, Chung Ju-yung’s son and successor, Chung Mong-hun fell to his death from Hyundai headquarters. Indictments against him were dropped after his death.  The Supreme Court gave Hyundai Asan’s then chief executive a suspended jail term for violating foreign money transfer rules, but he was later pardoned. The widow of the younger Chung now heads Hyundai Asan’s parent group and visited Pyongyang in September as part of a South Korean delegation for a summit between Moon and Kim.  “There are many hurdles to be overcome, but I feel there is hope ahead of us,” Hyun Jeong-eun said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration planned to require immigrants seeking asylum in the United States to come into the country through a legal port of entry, pushing a hard line on immigration ahead of elections next week. The president’s remarks, five days before U.S. voters determine which party will control Congress and state governorships across the country, drew immediate criticism as an effort to generate fear and energise his political base. “Migrants seeking asylum will have to present themselves lawfully at a port of entry,” Trump told reporters at the White House, painting a caravan of migrants travelling from Central America toward the United States as a dangerous threat. “Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our country,” he said. It was not clear whether the plan would pass legal muster, although Trump, who sought to use immigration as an issue to motivate Republican voters in the 2016 presidential race and now ahead of the Nov. 6 elections, said it would. He added that an executive order was in the process of being finalised, but provided few details.   Federal law provides that any immigrant in the United States may apply for asylum, regardless of whether he or she enters the country through a designated port of entry. Trump has ramped up his tough stance on illegal immigration in recent days. He deemed the group of migrants from Central America a threat to Americans. It is made up of people who have left poverty and violence at home and are heading slowly through Mexico toward the U.S. border. Trump referred to the movement as an “invasion.” Mexico on Wednesday put the size of the caravan that left Honduras in mid-October at 2,800 to 3,000 people. Other caravans have since followed. The president, who has ordered U.S. troops to the border with Mexico, also suggested rock-throwing by migrants would be treated as equivalent to gun usage. “They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We’re going to consider, and I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military police, I say: Consider it a rifle,” Trump said. A Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, declined to discuss specifics on the military’s potential use of force, but said that U.S. troops “always have the inherent right of self-defence.” Critics said the president was stoking fear ahead of the elections, in which Trump’s Republicans are battling to keep their congressional majorities. “President Trump’s attempt to paint peaceful families seeking asylum as a national security threat is as absurd as it is cruel,” said advocacy group Human Rights First in a statement. “The president is fear mongering to score political points ahead of a contentious election at the expense of people’s lives.” The American Civil Liberties Union said: “If he plans at some point to prohibit people from applying for asylum between the ports of entry, that plan is illegal.” Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, an ally of the president and head of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a  letter to the secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department that his office had received information that several members of the caravan had “significant criminal histories.”  Trump said on Wednesday the United States could send as many as 15,000 troops to the border to confront the migrant caravan, more than twice the number previously disclosed by defence officials. A U.S. defence official said about 100 active-duty troops arrived on the border at McAllen, Texas, on Thursday. Republican lawmakers and other Trump supporters have applauded the deployment. But critics argue Trump has manufactured a crisis for the U.S. military to address. Trump also said this week he would seek to scrap the constitutional right of citizenship for U.S.-born children of noncitizens and illegal immigrants. Such an action would face a likely legal challenge.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Barclays Plc (BARC.L) said on Thursday that Nigel Higgins, the deputy chairman of Rothschild & Co (ROTH.PA), would succeed John McFarlane as chairman on May 2 next year when he retires after serving his four-year term. Higgins will join the Barclays Board as a Non-Executive Director on March 1, 2019 and take over as chairman in May after the AGM, the bank said in a statement. “In Nigel Higgins we have found an ideal candidate. He is a hugely respected banker, a strategic thinker, someone with extensive international experience, and he has a strong positive leadership style,” said Crawford Gillies, who led the process to appoint a successor to McFarlane. Barclays, one of Britain’s biggest banks, has been subject to radical transformation in recent years and has faced uncertainty over its leadership, mainly due to regulatory scrutiny of chief executive Jes Staley’s treatment of a whistleblower. Since taking over as CEO in December 2015, Staley has pushed an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson.  Bramson’s Sherborne Investors (SIGC.L) holds a 5.4 percent stake in the bank and was in talks with Barclays earlier this year about replacing McFarlane as part of an overhaul. Sherborne told 2018’s AGM in May “you are not getting rid of me yet.” When he retires next year he will have served his full four-year term. “Succeeding John McFarlane, who has done such a sterling job during a period of great change at Barclays, is a huge honour.... I am totally committed to helping Barclays and its people continue to develop and progress,” Higgins said. Barclays said in its statement Higgins has extensive experience of banking and financial services, gained through a 36-year career at Rothschild. It added he had a strong track record as a strategic adviser to multiple major corporations and governments, a wealth of experience in building teams and culture on an international scale, and in growing businesses. Sherborne is a specialist “turnaround” fund that wants Barclays to improve its financial strength and competitive position. The bank last week reported third quarter profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.07 billion), excluding litigation and conduct costs, above the 1.33 billion pounds expected by analysts polled by the bank. The profit excluded costs from litigation and fines for misconduct, which have blighted Barclays in recent years as it paid out for misdeeds during and after the financial crisis. Barclays shares closed at 175.54 pence on Thursday. They are down nearly 14 percent so far this year.

2019-02-08,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (Reuters) - Thousands of Google employees around the world briefly walked off their jobs on Thursday to protest the company’s response to sexual harassment and demand that the world’s largest search engine address rising concerns about workplace inequality. The protests took place in waves, beginning in Asia and then streaming across Europe and North America, with the final wave occurring at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. The protests, which drew Google contract workers as well as employees, followed a New York Times report last week that Google in 2014 gave a $90 million (£69.2 million) exit package to a senior vice president, Andy Rubin, after he was accused of sexual harassment.  “This was the $90 million straw that broke the camel’s back,” Celie O’Neil-Hart, one of the protest organizers and who works on YouTube marketing, told reporters as she joined hundreds of other employees in the courtyard of Google’s Mountain View headquarters. “But there are so many stories that we’ve heard for so long, and it’s time for action and change,” said O’Neil-Hart as she teared up. Rubin denied the allegation in the New York Times story, which he said contained “wild exaggerations” about his compensation. Google did not dispute the report.  Organizers said about 60 percent of Google’s offices participated, including Dublin, the company’s largest site outside the United States, as well as London, Zurich, Berlin and Singapore. They shared photographs on social media of hundreds leaving offices. Many employees at the Mountain View walkout chanted “Women’s rights are workers rights,” and some wore blue ribbons in support of sexual harassment victims. Seven U.S. employees who organised the demonstrations called on Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to make harassment investigations fairer for accusers, share pay-equity data with workers and add an employee representative to its board. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, speaking an hour later at a New York Times conference in New York, said he was taking note of the “concrete steps” workers presented to improve the company’s culture and human resources processes. “I want to make sure Google sets the bar,” he said, noting that a lack of gender and racial diversity was part of the issue. “We’re grappling with it, as with many places.” Organizers and other employees said Google executives, like leaders at the dozens of companies affected by the #metoo movement, have been slow to address numerous structural issues such as unchecked power of male executives. They want Google to publicly report its sexual harassment statistics and end forced arbitration in harassment cases. They also have asked that the chief diversity officer be able to directly advise the board. Rana Abdelhamid, who works in Google Cloud’s marketing division in San Francisco, told reporters that the walkout was “about safety of women in the workplace,” adding that Google’s historical support for women’s causes caused her to be shocked when she learned of the multi-million-dollar payout. “The numbers and facts don’t match with the intentions” of Google on equality and safety for underrepresented groups, she told Reuters. “We need to reprioritise energy and really focus on these issues.” Since its founding two decades ago, Google has been known for its motto “don’t be evil,” a dictum preserved in its worker code of conduct, and its transparency with employees about corporate strategy. But employees have internally organised for months to increase diversity and improve treatment of women and minorities. Those issues have been top of mind since the 2016 election of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, stunned Silicon Valley, where liberal and libertarian policies are popular.  Tech workers have become more vocal to protest both the president’s and their companies’ stances on immigration, defence and discrimination. Workers have said that they are driven by the sense that their technology pioneer employers should also be standard bearers on socioeconomic issues. “We all know that the status quo is unacceptable and if there is any company who can solve this, it is Google,” said Thomas Kneeland, a Google software engineer in New York. The dissatisfaction among Alphabet’s 94,000 employees and tens of thousands contractors has not noticeably affected the company’s share price. But employees, who warned they would demonstrate again if needed, expect Alphabet to face recruiting and retention challenges if their concerns go unaddressed. Alphabet shares closed down 0.4 percent to $1,085.98 on Thursday. Around the world, Google workers walked out carrying signs reading “Time’s up Tech,” “Happy to quit for $90M - no sexual harassment required” and “Not OK Google,” a reference to the “OK Google” phrase used to activate Google’s voice-operated Assistant.  Cathay Bi, a Google product manager, speaking through a megaphone before hundreds gathered in a bustling pedestrian plaza in San Francisco’s financial district, talked about the engines of change.  “This is what it means to be ‘Googley,’” she urged the crowd to chant, invoking a widely used term for the company’s culture. “People don’t change because of law and policies. Laws and policies change because of people.” Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco and Jane Lanhan Lee in Mountain View; Additional reporting by Padraic Halpin and Graham Fahy in Dublin, Angela Moon in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-alphabet-google-harassment/googles-metoo-moment-workers-walk-out-over-womens-rights-idUKKCN1N644Q,2019-02-08,,Google's '#metoo' moment: Workers walk out over women's rights
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European Union negotiators have floated a tentative Brexit plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and to give Britain stronger guarantees that a customs border would not be needed along the Irish Sea, the Financial Times said on Thursday. As Reuters reported last month, EU negotiators offered to include a plan in the withdrawal agreement to keep mainland Britain in a customs union after Brexit in order to avoid a hard border. The deal offered was bending EU “red lines”, which have included refusing to give assurances on future EU-UK trade relations in the Brexit treaty. Accounts of how British and EU negotiators came close to a deal on Oct. 13 focus on how Prime Minister Theresa May balked at an EU demand for a “backstop” clause. The FT said EU Brexit negotiators were now considering a new proposal to compromise on an Irish “backstop” which would be an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return of customs checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. The biggest obstacle to a Brexit deal has been Britain’s wish to keep the border of its province of Northern Ireland with Ireland open, preserving frictionless trade and a 1998 peace deal that ended sectarian violence while leaving the EU’s single market and customs union to forge its own trade deals. With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU talks have stalled over the issue. EU diplomats familiar with the latest briefing by negotiators this week said that the EU proposals did not appear to have changed significantly from that October offer. Northern Ireland would remain in a deep customs union with the bloc, applying the union’s full “customs code” and following single market regulations for goods and agri-food products, the FT reported. Meanwhile, the UK would be in a more “bare-bones” customs arrangement with the EU, in which it would apply a common external tariff on imports from outside the union and rules of origin, the FT reported, saying the plan had been presented to EU ambassadors on Wednesday and floated with UK officials. The paper said May’s negotiating team would give an indication next week on whether Britain was open to the compromise which would be a crucial decision on whether the EU will hold a special summit to discuss a potential deal this month. Such a compromise plan is likely to face opposition from Brexit supporters in May’s government and party who do not want Britain to be tied into an open-ended customs union with the bloc until a UK-EU trade deal was agreed. The FT said the plan contained many proposals which London had rejected last month. “The same fundamental problems are there,” the FT quoted one EU diplomat briefed on the plan. “They’ve played around with the ingredients to the deal.”  However, sterling rose against the U.S. dollar and euro following the report, adding to earlier gains after officials said Britain and the EU had made progress on a deal to give London’s dominant financial centre basic access to the bloc’s markets after Brexit.

2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities said they would immediately begin examining a damaged black box retrieved on Thursday from the sunken wreckage of a Lion Air jet that crashed off Jakarta this week, killing all 189 people on board. Indonesia’s second-deadliest air disaster since 1997 has prompted renewed concern about its patchy safety record, and the government has said Lion Air will be regulated more closely. The investigation of the first crash of a Boeing Co 737 MAX, introduced into commercial service last year, will also be scrutinised by the global aviation industry. “Tonight we will move as quickly as possible to download what is in this black box,” Haryo Satmiko, deputy chief of Indonesia’s transportation safety committee (KNKT), told a news conference.  The extent of damage to the device showed the “extraordinary impact” of the crash, he said. Despite initial reports, authorities did not know for certain whether the “crash survivable memory unit” was from the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder, as portions of it were missing, Satmiko said. Searchers have yet to detect a location signal from the second of the two black boxes, housed at opposite ends of the aircraft. Although the seafloor is only about 30 metres down, strong currents and energy pipelines in the area have hampered search efforts. The data it holds should provide clues to what went wrong. The plane, which had only been in service since August, went silent 13 minutes after taking off on Monday from Jakarta, heading for the tin-mining town of Pangkal Pinang. The pilot had already received permission to return to base. A navy diver on board a search vessel told the broadcaster Metro TV that his team found the orange cylinder containing the recorder among debris on the muddy sea floor. Under normal conditions, the data should only take two hours to download, said Satmiko, although analysing it could take several weeks.  The results from a preliminary investigation will be made public after 30 days, another KNKT official said. Hopes are fading of finding a large section of fuselage intact, with easily retrievable bodies inside. “What is important for us is to get more information about the victims because having their remains back is important for us so we can bury them properly,” said Ade Inyo, whose brother-in-law was on the flight. Only one of the flight’s passengers has been identified from the partial remains retrieved so far. The investigation will be carried out with help from Boeing, General Electric and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, officials have said. It will also focus on four Lion Air staff, including its technical director, who the transport ministry said it has suspended on Wednesday, amid speculation that aircraft had not been airworthy. The privately owned budget carrier was founded in 1999. Its aircraft have been involved in at least 15 safety incidents and it has been placed under tougher international safety restrictions than other Indonesian airlines.  It will now be subjected to more intensive “on ramp” inspections than other airlines, authorities said. President Joko Widodo has also ordered a review of all regulations relating to flight safety. Indonesia is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets. Its transport safety committee investigated 137 serious aviation incidents from 2012 to 2017. Lion Air said the aircraft that crashed had been airworthy and the pilot and co-pilot had 11,000 hours of flying time between them. But according to the transport safety committee, the plane had technical problems on its previous flight on Sunday, from the resort island of Bali, including an issue concerning “unreliable airspeed”. Lion Air chief executive Edward Sirait has acknowledged reports of technical problems with the aircraft, but said maintenance had been carried out “according to procedure” before it was cleared to fly again. Lion Air’s only other fatal accident was in 2004, when an MD-82 crashed upon landing at Solo City, killing 25 of the 163 people on board, according to the Flight Safety Foundation’s Aviation Safety Network. In April, the airline announced a firm order to buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets, with a list price of $6.24 billion. It is one of the U.S. planemaker’s largest customers, and was the first carrier anywhere to take delivery of the narrow-body jet.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Smartphone sales and cost savings helped BT beat market expectations for first-half earnings on Thursday, with its departing chief executive saying his recovery plan was working. Gavin Patterson, who is being replaced as CEO by Worldpay’s Philip Jansen in February, said BT was improving customer service, accelerating the roll-out of full-fibre networks and transforming its operating model. Shares in the British leader in both broadband and mobile rose by more than 10 percent after it nudged its guidance for the full year higher and first-half earnings rose 2 percent. “Despite increasingly competitive fixed, mobile and networking markets and continued declines in legacy products there is no change in our overall outlook for the full year,” Patterson said, adding that based on current trading the company expected earnings to be in the upper half of its range. Citi analysts, who have a “neutral” rating on BT shares, highlighted “steady improvements in the underlying trends”. Patterson, who has run BT for more than five years, announced a shake-up in May to address a damaging accounting scandal and a poor customer service record. However, a lukewarm reaction to the strategy, which involved 13,000 job cuts, led chairman Jan du Plessis to decide a leadership change was needed. Patterson said the plan was working and he intended to maintain momentum as he prepared his departure. “We were confident of our strategy when we set it out in May and the strategy had a three-to-five year horizon,” he said. BT posted adjusted half-year core earnings of 3.68 billion pounds ($4.74 billion) and said it expected earnings for the year to be at the upper end of its 7.3-7.4 billion pound range. Adjusted revenue slipped 1 percent to 11.62 billion pounds as regulated price reductions in its broadband network, which serves other operators as well as BT, and declines in its enterprise businesses offset growth in consumer. BT’s shares rose to 266 pence, their highest since January, but are well off a high of 5 pounds during Patterson’s tenure and trade on only around a nine times forward earnings multiple. BT’s consumer unit, its biggest by revenue, reported a 6 percent rise in second-quarter earnings, well ahead of forecasts, due to demand for new devices like iPhones. Monthly churn, the number of customers leaving, in fixed and mobile rose slightly to 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent. Superfast broadband competition heated up in September when some of BT’s biggest competitors, including Sky and TalkTalk, gained access to volume discounts on some fibre products provided by its networks arm Openreach. Patterson said this was “was exactly around the range of outcomes that we saw potentially opening up in the marketplace.” BT said BT Plus, its first high-end converged consumer product, now had around half a million subscribers, up from more than 100,000 at the end of June. Activist investor Greenlight Capital has suggested BT’s new management could unlock value by spinning off Openreach, but    Patterson said no major shareholder was pushing for this.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s central bank is expected to keep interest rates steady on Thursday, after a Halloween policy meeting which economists said would leave long-term plans to raise borrowing costs in “suspended animation”. Rather than zombie companies or supernatural forces, it is the more familiar bogeyman of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit which is almost certain to keep the Bank of England on hold after its last interest rate rise three months ago. “Until a deal is done - or not - we suspect the BoE is in suspended animation,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Robert Wood wrote in a note to clients. A year ago the BoE raised interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis and followed this with a further rise in borrowing costs to 0.75 percent in August. Economists polled by Reuters expect the nine members of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee to have voted unanimously to keep rates on hold this month, and on average do not see a further rate rise until May. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29 next year, but Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to secure a transitional deal that will ensure goods and people can continue to move freely between Britain and the EU the day after. The pound’s fall against the dollar and the euro after June 2016’s Brexit vote pushed inflation to a near six-year high of 3.1 percent last year. The effects of this are now fading, and inflation dropped to 2.4 percent in September. But some BoE policymakers are concerned that a pick-up in wage growth this year will delay inflation’s return to its 2 percent target. Stripping out volatile bonuses, annual pay growth in the three months to August rose to 3.1 percent, its biggest rise since January 2009, prompting BoE chief economist Andy Haldane to talk of a “new dawn” for pay growth. Other officials, such as deputy governor Jon Cunliffe, are more sceptical, and recent consumer data has shown slower spending after a summer splurge which was driven by unusually warm weather. The BoE will update its growth and inflation forecasts on Thursday. Some economists expect the inflation forecast to come in a fraction closer to 2 percent than in August, as a stronger currency and higher global interest rates offset the inflationary potential of higher wages. Growth for this year was forecast at a lacklustre 1.4 percent in August - due to heavy snow hitting the economy at the start of the year, and the BoE is likely to stick with predictions of a pick-up in 2019, assuming Brexit goes smoothly. BoE Governor Mark Carney said in August that market expectations of about one 25 basis point rate rise a year was a good rule of thumb for households, and economists see no shift from this broad approach on Thursday. “As we approach the endgame for (Brexit transition) talks, we do not expect the BoE to make changes to its guidance,” Bank of America’s Wood said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling will rise around 5.5 percent against the dollar if Britain and the European Union agree a divorce deal, a Reuters poll found, but will sink more than 6 percent if no agreement is reached. As predicted in numerous Reuters FX polls ahead of the June 2016 referendum, when Britons shocked markets by voting to part ways with the EU, cable is down about 7 percent since then and was trading around $1.28 on Wednesday. With less than five months until the marriage is due to end, the two sides have yet to finalise a divorce settlement and if none is made by the end of March sterling will fall to $1.20, the poll found. However, economists polled by Reuters last month said there was only a one-in-four chance of a disorderly Brexit, where no deal is reached, and Thursday’s poll of foreign exchange strategists said the pound would bounce to $1.35 if a deal is made.  “Our central forecasts are based on the expectation that there is a deal,” said Ryan Djajasaputra at Investec. “If you look at sterling there is a significant Brexit risk premium embedded within the currency and should you get a deal you see that effectively unwind.”  However, traders hold a more negative view on the outlook for the pound than at any time since shortly after the Brexit referendum, according to options markets, as fears grow that Britain is headed for a disruptive exit from the EU. Medians in the wider Oct 29-31 poll of 56 strategists pegged sterling at $1.29 in a month, $1.34 at the end of April - a month after Britain leaves the EU - and $1.38 in a year. Those forecasts are little changed from an October poll but the 12-month horizon range is slightly wider, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty among speculators ahead of the divorce date. Adding to near-term downward pressure on the pound, the Bank of England is not expected to raise interest rates again until after Brexit. In contrast, the United States Federal Reserve is expected to raise borrowing costs again in December and follow that up with three more increases next year.  While the European Central Bank is expected to end its asset purchases programme in December, it won’t start tinkering with record low interest rates until after June 2019.  So against the euro the pound is expected to move little. It was around 88.5 pence on Wednesday and will be at 89.0p in a month, the poll said. In six months, the pound will have strengthened marginally to 87.9p and be at 88.0p in a year, according to the poll.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday set out plans to “reinvigorate and expand” British diplomacy after years of budget cuts as the country looks to boost its influence around the world after Brexit. With just five months until Britain leaves the European Union, its biggest foreign policy shift in more than 40 years, Hunt said Britain plans to hire nearly 1,000 more diplomatic staff, open new embassies and boost language training. “This country is at a pivotal historic moment, the global balance of power is shifting once more and post-Brexit our place within it changes as well,” Hunt said in a speech at the Policy Exchange think tank. “At the same time our democratic values are arguably under greater threat than at any time since the fall of the Berlin Wall ... we can use our influence, our reach and power to defend our values by becoming an invisible chain that links the world’s democracies.” Since Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU, the government has repeatedly flagged its ambition for a ‘Global Britain’, but MPs and foreign policy experts have accused it of lacking a strategy or resources to deliver on that goal.  Hunt said Britain needed to redouble its efforts to defend the international rules-based order and support reform of international institutions including the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and the Commonwealth. The Foreign Office has faced budget cuts under successive governments which have seen it reduce embassy jobs and sell off exotic properties overseas. At the same time its remit has shrunk, with key policy areas including foreign aid, trade and the relationship with the EU moved to other departments. The Foreign Office’s operating expenditure fell by 21.6 percent between 2010 and 2015 and was then frozen in real terms, spending watchdog the National Audit Office said last year. “There is a mismatch between the rhetoric and ambition around a Global Britain and actually what we invest in the diplomatic service itself,” said Tom Raines, head of the Europe Programme at global affairs think-tank Chatham House. The mismatch, he added, was “quite obvious to others”. In his speech, entitled “Britain’s role in the world after Brexit”, Hunt said the new jobs would be in place by the end of 2020 and would include 335 diplomatic positions overseas, 328 in London and 329 new local staff around the world.  According to the National Audit Office, the Foreign Office employed 12,865 staff globally in 2016-17. “We have to reinvigorate and expand British diplomacy. In the past you may have heard of retrenchment and retreat, not anymore,” Hunt said, adding that he would also open up “one or two” ambassador posts a year to those outside the civil service, particularly business people. The government said it would create 12 new embassies or missions, many of them in Commonwealth countries as it looks to revitalise links with former colonies. The Foreign Office also plans to boost language training, doubling the number of diplomats who speak the local language and increasing the number of languages taught at the department to 70 from 50, including the addition of Kazakh and Gujarati. “There is a perception in many places that Brexit is an isolationist or backwards step for the UK, which has generally been seen as internationalist and open... so there is a big job for the UK to correct that narrative,” said Raines.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - His political enemies may well like to see him disappear in a puff of smoke and now a small town in England plans to grant them their wish by burning a comic effigy of Boris Johnson as part of their annual bonfire night celebrations. The flamboyant ex-Foreign Secretary and leading light of the  2016 campaign for Britain to leave the European Union - running shorts, cycle helmet and all - will be torched on Saturday in Edenbridge, Kent. Dozens of towns and villages in Britain hold firework parties and burn effigies in November of Guy Fawkes, the Roman Catholic plotter who tried to blow up parliament in 1605. Several have started to burn celebrity effigies in recent years: past Edenbridge victims have included Donald Trump and former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. “Boris Johnson has been near the top of the list for the last few years running,” said Laura Lawrence of the Edenbridge Bonfire Society. “He does have a tendency to put his foot in it and I think perhaps this year he might have put his foot in it one too many times and that’s why he’s been chosen as our celebrity effigy for 2018.” The 11-metre (36-feet) high effigy took artist Andrea Deans six days to make. He wears a “90” rosette to mark the bonfire society’s 90th anniversary and is portrayed as having his EU cake and eating it. “I wanted him to come across scruffy because that’s what he appears most of the time, wearing his suit and a helmet at the same time and you can see him running in really peculiar shorts, that’s why we put those on,” she told Reuters.  “Because he appears like that sort of character and also I think, Boris being Boris, he’ll probably see the funny side of it and I’m hoping that he will even come along on Saturday and maybe bring a cake.”    Reporting by Stephen Addison; editing by Andrew MacAskill",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-bonfire/boris-johnson-to-go-up-in-smoke-as-bonfire-night-effigy-idUKKCN1N5262,2019-02-08,,Boris Johnson to go up in smoke as bonfire night effigy
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer morale slid to a three-month low in October, dragged down by worries about the economic outlook in the run-up to Brexit, a survey showed on Wednesday. The headline consumer confidence index from market research firm GfK fell to -10 in October, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists, from -9 in September. The index is not seasonally adjusted and has a tendency to fall every October. Nonetheless, details within the survey showed that Britons’ worries about how the economy will fare over the next 12 months had risen to the highest since December. With Britain scheduled to leave the EU in March, Brexit talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish “backstop”, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time. “The prospect of a no-deal/hard-deal Brexit must surely be weighing heavily on people’s minds, injecting a mood of despondency as to how people view their future personal finances and the longer-term economic outlook for the UK,” Joe Staton, director of client strategy at GfK, said. He also highlighted a drop in the major purchases index — something that could spell trouble for retailers ahead of the crucial Black Friday and Christmas selling periods. A Confederation of British Industry survey on Tuesday showed retail sales had grown much more slowly than forecast in October. The figures are likely to interest Bank of England officials who are preparing their latest quarterly outlook for Britain’s economy, due to be released at 1100 GMT on Thursday. Other surveys of consumers from IHS Markit and Thomson Reuters/IPSOS have also pointed to rising worries among households about the financial and economic outlook ahead of Brexit.

2019-02-08,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan bestowed names on Wednesday to two newly-hatched young of New Zealand’s national bird, the kiwi, in the northeastern town of Rotorua, on the final day of their two-week tour of the Pacific. The couple visited a breeding programme for the endangered species and admired two three-day old chicks, whom they named Koha, meaning “gift”, and Tihei, derived from a phrase that means “sneeze of life” in the indigenous Te Reo Maori language. Earlier, Harry led a group at a Maori meeting ground in singing “Te Aroha”, a traditional song, whose name means “Love” in Te Reo. The couple were welcomed at Te Papaiouru Marae, visited by Harry’s grandmother Queen Elizabeth in her coronation year of 1953, in Rotorua, a town famed for its geothermal activity and described by its mayor as the ‘heartland of Maori culture’.  Meghan, who wore a navy Stella McCartney dress and a carved greenstone necklace gifted by the country’s governor general and Harry, in a grey suit, were both adorned with feathered cloaks gifted by local Maori. Harry began his speech in the Te Reo language and ended it with a Maori proverb, drawing applause from the crowd with his strong pronunciation. Then he led the song. His enthusiasm for the Maori language was welcomed by Rotorua Mayor Steve Chadwick, who said, “As our confidence as a bilingual district grows, so does our confidence in our people and our future.” The use of Te Reo Maori language is experiencing a revival in New Zealand, after years of decline when policy makers cracked down on its use, particularly in schools.  Free Maori language courses often report being booked out and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said her infant daughter Neve Te Aroha will learn it alongside English. Later, with Meghan wearing black puffa jacket, black trousers and flat shoes and Harry in a black shirt and beige chinos, they visited a tree-top canopy in a redwood tree forest, followed by a walkabout meeting with some of the public. A group of children gave an impromptu haka, a traditional war dance made famous by New Zealand’s All Blacks rugby team. A toddler wandered towards Harry through the metal barricades holding back the crowds, but the prince quickly sought out his family and directed him back.  The couple, who are expecting their first child in the northern spring, were set to leave New Zealand for London on Thursday, after a 16-day tour that also covered Australia, Fiji and Tonga.

2019-02-08,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s transport minister removed on Wednesday the technical director of the Lion Air airline and several of its technicians after the crash of one of its jets with 189 people on board, the Antara news agency reported on Wednesday. “Today we dismiss (the director) from his position and his duty,” Budi Karya Sumadi said, citing the accident on Monday as the reason. He said technicians were also dismissed. It was not clear whether the removal was permanent or temporary.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCA) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and promised to pay 2 billion euros (£1.8 billion) in special dividends, but a lower net cash forecast and its over-reliance on the North American market weighed on its shares.  Milan-listed shares in FCA (FCHA.MI) closed down 3.2 percent on Tuesday.  The Italian-American carmaker confirmed its revenue and profit forecasts for this year, but cut its net cash estimate to between 1.5 and 2.0 billion euros from around 3 billion euros, citing production adjustments and pension contributions.  It promised the special dividend after agreeing last week to sell parts unit Magneti Marelli to Japan’s Calsonic Kansei for 6.2 billion euros. The sale was the first big deal since Mike Manley took over in July after long-time chief Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died following complications from surgery. Manley said the Magneti Marelli sale put FCA in the strongest position since its formation in 2014, and made its liquidity position comparable to peers. The deal also reaffirmed his commitment to deliver on FCA’s strategy to 2022 as an independent company, Manley added.  “Closing this transaction puts us in a much stronger position ... our aim is to complete that five-year plan, deliver on our commitments as an independent (company),” he said on a call with analysts, when asked about any future merger plans.  The special dividend comes on top of ordinary dividends of 20 percent of earnings that the company has already pledged to pay starting early next year. Both still need to be approved by the board and shareholders.  The world’s seventh-largest carmaker said adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the July-September period rose 13 percent to 1.995 billion euros, compared with 1.87 billion euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. Sales rose 9 percent, above expectations, helped by higher shipments of the new Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee models and the new RAM 1500 pick-up truck. North America accounted for 97 percent of profit in the quarter and operating profit margins in the region rose to 10.2 percent from 8.0 percent last year as a shift to sell more trucks and SUVs continued to pay off.  However, the over-reliance on one region worried some.  “This is now a one region story, unless one believes other parts are ripe for a turnaround,” Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said. “While the U.S. delivered spectacularly, the news from elsewhere is not encouraging.” Both Europe and Asia reported an operating loss.  FCA’s operations in Europe were hit by the transition towards tougher emissions tests which became mandatory from the start of September.  Chinese market weakness weighed on FCA’s performance in Asia and hit sales of luxury brand Maserati. The brand’s margins fell to 2.4 percent from 13.8 percent last year.  Manley said he saw significant upside for Europe in future.  He also expects progress at Maserati in the second half of next year, adding the product remained competitive but was plagued by issues related to how it was positioned and managed. FCA expects to take a hit of around 850 million euros from higher steel and aluminium prices this year, and a similar impact in 2019. Group net profit in the quarter was down 38 percent as FCA set aside 713 million euros to cover potential costs related to talks with U.S. authorities over suspected diesel emissions violations - which FCA denies. The charge does not represent an agreed settlement, nor is an admission of liability, FCA added. “(This provision) sits someway below most expectations of a figure in excess of 1 billion euros,” Evercore ISI analyst George Galliers said in a note.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) at a congress in December. Merkel, 64, also ruled out running for a fifth term as chancellor in 2021. [L8N1XA2I3] Several CDU politicians have announced bids to succeed Merkel as party leader. Here are some facts about the candidates who could step into her shoes: THE MINI-MERKEL Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was named by Merkel herself in February as CDU secretary general - a move seen as the first step in a succession plan. Dubbed a “mini-Merkel” by German media due to their sober political styles, Kramp-Karrenbauer was premier of the tiny state of Saarland on the French border from 2011 to 2018. Her Catholic, western German background contrasts with Merkel’s Protestant, eastern roots. While socially conservative and known for opposing gay marriage, Kramp-Karrenbauer is also a strong supporter of the minimum wage and workers’ rights. In an attempt to distance herself from Merkel and her leadership style, Kramp-Karrenbauer has said the CDU will need to regain some passion if it wants to attract younger voters. Sometimes known as AKK, she is the daughter of a teacher for mentally handicapped children, and is married to a mining engineer, with whom she has three children. About 19 percent of Germans view Kramp-Karrenbauer as a good successor for Merkel, according to a poll conducted for Spiegel Online by the Civey institute.  Jens Spahn, 38, has become one of Merkel’s most outspoken critics within the CDU since her decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million refugees, mostly Muslims from war zones in the Middle East. He positions himself as a politician from Germany’s rural northwest who is sceptical of urban liberals and the globalist elite. In an attempt to rein Spahn in, Merkel this year named him health minister - a thorny portfolio that brings a lot of work and few headlines. A member of the lower house of parliament since 2002, Spahn has been praised as a rising star for years by senior conservatives such as former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. However, his anti-immigration rhetoric at the height of the refugee crisis cost him sympathy among Merkel allies. His public friendship with Richard Grenell, U.S. President Donald Trump’s ambassador to Berlin, has also alienated some conservatives who dislike Trump’s populist style. Like Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn is a Catholic but, despite the church’s opposition to gay partnerships, he is married to Daniel Funke, a senior journalist at the glossy magazine Bunte. The Civey poll showed Spahn with just six percent support. The most popular candidate, according to polls, is Friedrich Merz, 62, who was the first to throw his hat into the ring on Monday after news leaked that Merkel would not run again as CDU leader. He confirmed his plans officially on Tuesday. Merz, a member of the CDU’s conservative wing, has coined the idea of a German “Leitkultur” (lead culture), with which he called on Muslim immigrants to assimilate and to adopt German values and traditions. Thirty-four percent of Germans view Merz as the best successor for Merkel, the Civey poll showed. He also is known for his proposal to simplify the annual tax return so that it could be written on a beer mat. Merz is among the many conservative men who have seen their political fortunes dwindle under Merkel. In 2002, Merkel pushed him out of his position as CDU parliamentary leader to cement her grip on the party, on her way to becoming chancellor in 2005. A trained lawyer and ex-member of the European Parliament, Merz served in the German parliament from 1994-2009, and now holds numerous non-executive company board positions, including chairman of the German arm of the U.S. hedge fund BlackRock. He is married to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has three children.

2019-02-08,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan threw rubber gumboots on Tuesday as children cheered in a competition in New Zealand’s largest city of Auckland, though Harry’s team ended up losing to his wife’s side.  A 6.1 magnitude earthquake felt by thousands of people in New Zealand did not disrupt the schedule of the couple, who are on the final leg of a Pacific tour that has included Australia, Fiji and Tonga.  “There wasn’t too much of a rivalry,” Isabella Iti, 10, said after the gumboot toss. “I think she was thinking that there was no chance that she would win. But she did.” The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were visiting a conservation area north of Auckland that had been set aside as part of a Commonwealth initiative to honour Queen Elizabeth’s 66 years on the British throne.  There, the couple split off and each led a team of cheering children in a competition to see who could throw a rubber rainboot - known locally as a ‘gumboot’ - the farthest. Meghan, wearing black J Crew jeans and a Karen Walker blazer, led her team to victory after tossing a blue boot about a metre (3.2 feet) further than Harry’s red one. Gumboot throwing is famously associated with the rural town of Taihape, around 420 km (260 miles) south of Auckland, which hosts an annual gumboot festival.  Mike Jebsen, chief executive of the QEII National Trust, said the mayor of Taihape gave his blessing to hold the gumboot competition.  “We wanted to give the royal couple a taste of rural New Zealand, and there’s nothing more quintessentially Kiwi than a gumboot throw!” he said. In the afternoon, Meghan and Harry travelled to South Auckland to visit the head office of Pillars, a charity that mentors the children of prisoners.  For their wedding in May, Meghan and Harry had asked for charitable donations in lieu of gifts. The New Zealand government gave NZ$5,000 ($3,271) to Pillars in recognition of couple’s interest in programmes that support vulnerable children.

2019-02-08,"SINGAPORE/JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet that crashed in Indonesia on Monday flew erratically the previous evening and its airspeed readings were unreliable, according to an accident investigator and a flight tracking website. According to data from FlightRadar24, the jet displayed unusual variations in altitude and airspeed in the first several minutes of flight after taking off from Denpasar on the holiday island of Bali on Sunday evening, - including an 875-foot drop over 27 seconds when it would normally be ascending - before stabilising and flying on to Jakarta.  However, the pilots kept the plane at a maximum altitude of 28,000 feet compared with 36,000 feet on the same route earlier in the week. Lion Air CEO Edward Sirait told reporters on Monday a technical problem had occurred on the Denpasar-Jakarta flight but it had been resolved “according to procedure”.  National Transport Safety Committee (NSTC) deputy chief Haryo Satmiko told reporters on Tuesday there were technical problems on that flight, including unreliable airspeed readings. “The suspected cause of the accident is still being investigated and it is making us all curious what could have caused it,” he said. Satmiko gave no further details. Two passengers on Sunday’s flight posted on Instagram, reporting that they had been concerned about problems with the air conditioning system and cabin lighting before the plane departed nearly three hours late. “I was angry because as a passenger who had paid her ticket, we have every right to question the aircraft’s safety,” said one of them, TV presenter Conchita Caroline. She added there was a “weird” engine noise upon take-off that continued during flight. It was not clear if the cabin problems were in any way related to the technical trouble mentioned by the airline’s CEO. The Denpasar-Jakarta flight landed at 10:55 p.m. local time on Sunday, giving engineers six-and-a-half hours at most for checks before it was dispatched for the fatal Jakarta-Pangkal Pinang flight at 6:20 a.m. on Monday. The plane plunged into the sea minutes after taking off from Jakarta and all 189 people on board are believed dead. FlightRadar24 also reported unusual air speeds and altitudes in the few minutes that Flight JT610 was in the air on Monday. Photos of alleged technical and maintenance logs following the Sunday flight have been circulating online, but to date they have not been verified as accurate by the airline or investigators. Sirait declined to detail the maintenance procedures taken, and on Tuesday he told Reuters the airline had provided the relevant aircraft flight and maintenance logs to NTSC. NTSC Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said there was a similarity between the maintenance log circulating online and the one received from Lion Air but he had not checked the exact details. Satmiko said the agency had not yet met with the technician who handled the maintenance of the aircraft between the two flights. Safety experts say the crash investigation is at a very preliminary stage and it is too early to speculate about the cause. But pilot and engineering sources told Reuters the FlightRadar24 data for both flights, while not conclusive, could be a potential indicator of something wrong with the pitot static systems. Those are pressure-sensitive instruments that feed airspeed and altitude information to an avionics computer. “Certainly the big changes in climb/descent very early on in the flight is what makes me think unreliable speed,” said a pilot at another airline, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media. The data from FlightRadar24 shows the first sign that something was amiss on Monday’s fated flight came about two minutes after take-off when the plane had reached 2,000 feet. At that point, it descended more than 500 feet and veered to the left before climbing again to 5,000 feet, where it stayed during most of the rest of the flight. It began gaining speed in the final moments and reached 345 knots (397 mph) before data was lost when it was at 3,650 feet. “They were going way faster than you would normally expect,” said a second pilot at another airline. Two fishermen who saw the crash from their boat out at sea told Reuters that the plane swayed slightly but made no noise as it fell, almost horizontal with its nose slightly down. There was an explosive sound as it plunged nose-first into the sea, and then there was a column of smoke.  The weather was clear at the time of the crash at 6:33 a.m. on Monday, according to the head of Indonesia’s transport safety committee, who said the pilots had requested a turnback to Jakarta. A safe visual landing should have been possible even with faulty indicators and a lack of autopilot systems, the pilot sources said. In July, a Malaysia Airlines flight took off from Brisbane, Australia without removing covers on the pitot tubes. The pilots landed the Airbus SE A330 safely after obtaining groundspeed information from air traffic control and using the jet’s radar altimeter, according to a preliminary report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. There were no reported injuries. In 2009, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after icing that blocked the pitot tubes caused unreliable airspeed data and the confused pilots entered a high-altitude stall and ignored cockpit alarms, according to a report from France’s BEA. All 228 people on board died.

2019-02-08,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Air Force Staff Sergeant Jiang Pin-shiuan’s pitch to freshmen at Taipei’s Tamkang University seemed compelling: join the island’s armed forces and get a state-sponsored degree, 110 days of leave each year and annual savings of T$312,500 ($10,200).  But many listening students showed little interest, arguing national service was a “waste of time” and prospects of the self-ruled island standing up economically or militarily to an increasingly aggressive China were slim.  “China could simply crush Taiwan with its economic power. There’s no need for a war, which wastes money,” said 18-year-old Chen Fang-yi, an engineering major. “I do not have much confidence and expectation for the national army.” From lectures in universities and high schools across the island, life-size dancing dolls to a flash mob performance by a special forces unit, Taiwan’s military is working hard to recruit soldiers as it moves to a fully volunteer force after decades of conscription.  Taiwan vowed in 2011 to phase out conscription to cut costs and boost the professionalism of its forces as it tries to better deter the Chinese threat through enhanced cyber warfare capabilities and other high-tech weapons.  The island’s defence ministry said it will be able to reach a target of enlisting 81 percent of the estimated 188,000 volunteer troops needed to defend against any attack by Beijing by year-end. It hopes to raise that to 90 percent by 2020.          Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it to heel. But military experts and government auditors say recruitment is proving challenging and the growth in voluntary recruitment isn’t fast enough to catch up with a worsening military imbalance across the strait. China, whose official defence budget grew to roughly 15 times that of Taiwan’s last year, has alarmed Taipei by flying bombers around the island and luring away members of its dwindling band of diplomatic allies. In a report from December, three government auditors warned the growth of voluntary recruits had been slow, raising concerns about Taiwan’s combat power.  “The government needs to think whether it’s necessary to bring conscription back if they think national security matters,” said Lin Yu-fang, a convener for the Taipei-based National Policy Foundation and former head of Taiwan’s congressional defence and foreign committee.  “We will pay a heavy price for the move...We won’t be able to find enough soldiers.”  The island’s defence ministry told Reuters it will continue to raise the quantity and quality of its armed forces and has made all necessary plans for possible military actions from China. It also urged the public to give “support and encouragement” to the transition.   Convincing more young people to join the armed forces is made more difficult by Taiwan’s past as a military dictatorship. The death of a young conscript in 2013 after being punished for misconduct, which triggered large protests, also dealt a blow to the army.  The service is so unpopular that more than 1,000 reservists were charged in the last three years for dodging mandatory retraining. “It raises a very difficult question about national morale. If there ever is a conflict, what are people going to do?” said William Stanton, professor at National Taiwan University and former head of the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei.   Taiwan last year spent nearly 47 percent of its defence budget of T$319.3 billion on manpower-related costs. Military experts said that squeezed the budget for weapon acquisitions.    The island’s goal to move to an all volunteer force by 2019 will be “costlier than anticipated”, diverting funds from defence acquisition and readiness, the U.S. Defense Department said in a report to Congress in May.           Taiwan has shortened its mandatory service to a four-month training, from three years, a move analysts said was made to placate young voters who prioritise personal liberty over civil obligations. But for some, even the reduced training is seen as an exercise in futility. “We won’t win a war with China anyway,” said 20-year-old  graduate Hsu Kai-wen, a reluctant conscript who was recently assigned a four-month service in the navy after drawing lots. “Why do I need to waste my time in the army?” Additional reporting by Judy Peng and Fabian Hamacher; Editing by Lincoln Feast.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-taiwan-military/for-taiwan-youth-military-service-is-a-hard-sell-despite-china-tension-idUKKCN1N20UY,2019-02-08,,"For Taiwan youth, military service is a hard sell despite China tension"
2019-02-08,"Manchester City returned to the Premier League summit on goal difference as they dug out a 1-0 victory over fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur courtesy of an early goal by Riyad Mahrez at a subdued Wembley Stadium on Monday. It was not the free-flowing City of late and Tottenham will rue missing some good chances to salvage something from a disjointed affair on a patchwork pitch at a half-empty Wembley. Mahrez caught Tottenham cold in the sixth minute after a defensive mistake but despite City’s dominance they were missing their clinical edge on a surface that looked more suitable for American football after an NFL fixture a day earlier. David Silva and Mahrez both could have put the game beyond Tottenham but the hosts, who were on a four-match winning run in the league and could have gone above City into second with a victory, always posed a threat. Dele Alli returned from a hamstring injury for Tottenham and his arrival as a substitute sparked some late pressure in which Erik Lamela spurned a glorious chance to equalise. City held firm for a sixth consecutive Premier League clean sheet to knock Liverpool off top spot. They both have 26 points while Tottenham have 21. After the tragic events of Saturday, in which Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died alongside four other people in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium, it was fitting that Mahrez, a Leicester hero during their 2016 title success, proved the matchwinner. The game was only six minutes old when City goalkeeper Ederson launched the ball forward and Spurs right back Kieran Trippier made a mess of his clearing header. That let in Raheem Sterling, who squared for Mahrez to fire home past Hugo Lloris. The Algerian celebrated in poignant fashion by raising both arms towards the heavens. “I am very, very sad. That is why when I scored I put my hands in the sky for him,” Mahrez, who was voted PFA Player of the Year after Leicester’s stunning 2016 title, said of Vichai’s death. “He did a lot for me and Leicester and it is difficult to speak about. It is very sad.” City coach Pep Guardiola said there was never any chance he would leave Mahrez out.  “Sometimes to play in a big game helps,” he said. “He did really good, he was focused and did a great job.” Spurs appeared to lack confidence in the opening stages and City threatened every time they went forward. Mahrez had another shot turned onto the post by Lloris while Silva fired straight at the French keeper. City’s defending was sloppy at times though and Tottenham striker Harry Kane whizzed one shot narrowly over and then his touch let him down as he was played through by Lamela after a mistake by Aymeric Laporte. The halftime interval featured a message for ailing Spurs maestro Glenn Hoddle, who suffered a heart attack on Saturday, and Mauricio Pochettino’s side could have used some of Hoddle’s flair as they toiled way. City should have buried the hosts in the 55th minute when Bernardo Silva played in namesake David but the Spaniard inexplicably opted not to shoot with the goal gaping, leaving Guardiola angrily kicking the air. Sterling was also guilty of a miss but Tottenham grew in belief and when Alli rolled the ball across the area for an unmarked Lamela, the Argentine looked set to equalise but lifted his left-foot shot over the crossbar.

2019-02-08,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former Army captain who won Brazil’s presidential weekend election, said on Monday he would press ahead with loosening gun laws this year and planned to visit Washington D.C. after a friendly call with U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro, who early in his legislative career declared he was “in favour” of dictatorships and demanded that Congress be disbanded, has vowed to adhere to democratic principles while holding up a copy of the country’s constitution. Trump said he had an “excellent call” congratulating Bolsonaro and tweeted about their plans to “work closely together on trade, military and everything else!” Investors were quick to cheer Bolsonaro’s victory, sending Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index to an all-time high in early trading before stock prices fell as traders booked profits following a sharp rally this month. Markets had surged on Bolsonaro’s ascent in opinion polls, as he pledged to quickly close Brazil’s gaping budget deficit and privatise state firms. Investors said further gains will hinge on clearer signs he can deliver on a market-friendly agenda. His election alarmed critics around the globe, however, given his defence of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, vows to sweep away leftist political opponents, and a track record of denigrating comments about gays, women and minorities. Bolsonaro’s victory brings Brazil’s military back into the political limelight after it spent three decades in the barracks following the country’s return to civilian rule. Several retired generals will serve as ministers and close advisers. “You are all my witnesses that this government will defend the constitution, of liberty and of God,” Bolsonaro said in a Facebook live video in his first comments after his victory. The president-elect’s future chief of staff told Reuters his first international trip would be to Chile, another South American nation that swung to the political right in recent elections, and soon after that he hoped to visit the United States. An outspoken Trump admirer, Bolsonaro also vowed to realign Brazil with more advanced economies, such as the United States, overhauling diplomatic priorities after nearly a decade and a half of leftist party rule. Bolsonaro won the presidential race handily despite scarce campaign resources and no support from major parties as he tapped into Brazilians’ anger over corruption and crime. In a Monday night interview with TV Record, Bolsonaro offered some of his first concrete measures on both fronts.     Bolsonaro said he would press Brazil’s Congress to loosen the country’s restrictive gun laws this year, before he even takes office on January 1. He reiterated that more widespread gun ownership would limit crime, although critics worry it could add to Brazil’s tally of nearly 64,000 homicides last year, the highest in the world. Bolsonaro also said he wants to nominate the crusading anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro to be his justice minister or the newest member of the Supreme Court.  Moro, who has overseen the “Car Wash” trials that sent scores of powerful politicians and businessmen to jail including former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former paratrooper, joins a list of populist, right-wing figures to win elections in recent years that include  Trump, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.             Trump’s friendly call augurs closer political ties between the two largest economies in the Americas, both now led by conservative populists promising to overturn the political establishment. In a telephone call on Monday with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Bolsonaro discussed collaboration on priority foreign policy issues, including Venezuela, tackling transnational crime and ways to strengthen economic ties.   Bolsonaro has vowed to increase pressure on Venezuela’s authoritarian leftist government to hold free elections that could stem the flow of refugees into neighbouring Brazil and Colombia, also governed by a conservative president. Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist with Rio de Janeiro State University, said he was concerned that Brazil would not soon dispel the tense and occasionally violent atmosphere that enveloped the polarizing campaign.  “It’s possible that even with his win, we could see a further wave of violence among Bolsonaro’s supporters against those who backed his opponent,” Santoro said. Bolsonaro supporters carried out physical attacks and organised campaigns of online harassment in the run-up to Sunday’s vote, targeting journalists in particular, according to a tally kept by Abraji, an investigative journalism group.  Bolsonaro himself was stabbed in the abdomen at a rally last month and will need to undergo surgery in mid-December to remove a colostomy bag before he can travel to Santiago and Washington. Bolsonaro won 55 percent of votes in a run-off election against left-wing hopeful Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party (PT), who got 45 percent, according to electoral authority TSE. The controversial lawmaker’s rise has been propelled by rejection of the leftist PT that ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years and was ousted two years ago in the midst of a deep recession and political graft scandal. Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters cheered and set off fireworks outside his home in Rio de Janeiro’s beachfront Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood as his victory was announced. “I don’t idolize Bolsonaro and I don’t know if he will govern well, but we are hopeful. People want the PT out, they can’t take any more corruption,” said Tatiana Cunha, a 39-year-old systems analyst during the noisy celebrations. Investors have been hopeful that Bolsonaro would carry out fiscal reforms proposed by his orthodox economic guru, Paulo Guedes. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index rose as much as 3.0 percent to an all-time high in opening trade, led higher by shares of state-owned firms and blue-chips, before retreating and closing 2.2 percent down.  Brazil’s currency, the real, has gained around 10 percent against the U.S. dollar this month as Bolsonaro’s prospects improved.  Investors have been particularly heartened by Bolsonaro’s choice of Guedes, a Chicago University-trained economist and investment banker, as future economy minister. Guedes, who wants to privatise an array of state firms, said on Sunday the new government will try to erase Brazil’s budget  deficit within a year, simplify and reduce taxes, and create 10 million jobs by cutting payroll taxes. New rules will boost investment in infrastructure, he told reporters. Still, Fitch Ratings on Monday highlighted the “deep fiscal challenges” confronting Bolsonaro’s team, as weak economic growth and a huge budget deficit leave little room to manoeuvre. “The exact details of how his administration plans to achieve (its) objectives are limited,” wrote Fitch analysts led by Shelly Shetty. “The lack of fiscal space, a high unemployment rate and a sluggish economic recovery will also likely limit economic policy options.”  Onyx Lorenzoni, a fellow congressman whom Bolsonaro has tapped as chief of staff, told journalists that Guedes would be responsible for structuring the government’s relationship with an independent, autonomous central bank with targets. Asked about Brazil’s currency, Lorenzoni said Bolsonaro would offer businesses more predictability, but ruled out an exchange rate target. Lorenzoni reiterated his view that efforts to reform Brazil’s pension system should wait until next year. In a separate interview with Reuters, he said the president-elect would meet with Guedes and other members of his team on Tuesday. He will oversee the transition from Rio this week and fly to the capital Brasilia next week, Lorenzoni added. Retired General Augusto Heleno, slated to become defence minister, told reporters that Bolsonaro has a positive view of a planned $4.75 billion (£3.7 billion) joint venture between Boeing Co and  Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA. He said the Temer government may approve the deal before leaving.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - IBM Corp’s (IBM.N) $34 billion (26.55 billion pounds) deal to buy Red Hat Inc (RHT.N) drove shares in the small but fast-growing software maker about 50 percent higher on Monday, reflecting the huge premium IBM is paying to ward off any potential challenger bids. At $172, shares of Red Hat were still trading around $18 short of the $190 price agreed by the two companies in Sunday’s announcement, and analysts said that pointed to some remaining nerves among investors over the chances of the deal closing.  The breakup fee for the deal, which would be among the largest on record in the tech sector, has yet to be announced and a high fee would also deter Red Hat from entertaining other buyers.  IBM’s stock was down 2 percent on news of the deal, a hint that investors were concerned that, at 10 times 2019 projected sales, it had overpaid for the deal.  The company’s Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty told CNBC in an interview aired early on Monday that she felt the deal was done at the right price.  “This is a very fair price...(Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst) has built a great company, and unlike others, high growth, high profit and cash and so this is why I think really those are important things for our investors,” Rometty said. One brokerage, Stifel, raised the prospect of a competing offer from one of the other major players in cloud computing for whom the deal represents the emergence of a more substantial rival. “Google, Amazon, and Microsoft (and potentially Oracle) have the strategic motivations and financial resources to consummate such a transaction and would not be surprised if we were to see one of them make a competing bid,” analysts from Stifel said in a note. Rometty told Reuters on Sunday that the increasing use of cloud services from multiple providers was the driving force behind the deal along with the rise of the so-called hybrid cloud, in which companies run some of their software in their own data centres and other elements of it in data centres run by IBM, Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, among others.  Red Hat has been investing heavily in tech tools such as so-called “containers,” which make it easier for businesses to split up their computing work among a mix of data centres. “They want choice and we are going to give it to them,” Rometty said. “Multi-cloud is a fact of life.” In buying Red Hat, IBM will have assembled a cloud that includes physical servers, its own operating system and applications like human resources software.  But the combined entity will also sell software that runs on its customers own hardware and other clouds. That will put it in direct competition with firms like Microsoft, which has a similar mix of software and cloud services. “We are going to both compete and partner with those other clouds,” Rometty said. “The thing about IBM is, we’ve been around long enough to know this is a multi-cloud world.” Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, said the use of multiple clouds has been an advantage for Red Hat. Cloud providers such as Amazon often offer a house-made version of the Linux operating system for free or at little cost. But that version of Linux is available only on Amazon, and if the business wants to run software on another cloud they would have to ensure it works with a different version of Linux there. Red Hat offers a standard version of Linux that runs on commonly available clouds as well as a business’s own data centres, and Whitehurst said Red Hat customers were increasingly running its operating system on public clouds. “We are growing faster on the public clouds than the public clouds are growing,” Whitehurst said in an interview. “Yeah, you pay us a little extra versus a free cloud offering, but you get the benefit of a standard operating environment.” Analysts had raised concerns that the purchase may alienate customers worrying that IBM will infringe on the neutrality of Red Hat, which is dubbed as “Switzerland of the IT stack.” IBM reiterated on a conference call on Monday that Red Hat would continue to be led by Whitehurst and Red Hat’s current management team. It also intends to maintain Red Hat’s headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.

2019-02-08,"HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) posted a higher-than-expected 28 percent rise in quarterly profit on Monday, showing progress in its battle to control costs and shaking off fears that rising global political tensions could hurt its business. Europe’s biggest bank by assets has reaped the benefits of a thorough restructuring after the global financial crisis, but investors have lately worried about rising costs as new CEO John Flint steps up investments. The profit growth cheered investors in the London-headquartered lender and boosted the wider European bank sector, starved of good news in 2018 amid fears about bad loans, Brexit, and weak revenues. HSBC’s shares rose as much as 5 percent in London on Monday morning and were up 4.2 percent by 0820 GMT. That left Britain’s FTSE 350 banks index .FTNMX8350 up 2.8 percent and on track for its best daily performance since January. HSBC veteran Flint, who began in the role in February, has outlined plans to spend as much as $17 billion in three years on technology and in China, including hiring more people to boost growth in investment banking and private banking where it has lagged rivals. HSBC makes more than three quarters of its profits in Asia, especially from its highly profitable Hong Kong retail banking operation. Analysts have said HSBC’s share price will be capped until it can show revenues rising above costs, in a trend known as ‘positive jaws’ in industry parlance. While HSBC reported the metric in negative territory for the third quarter, Flint said the bank is on track for it to swing to positive by the end of the year. “We’re absolutely in line with our plans, so we still expect to get positive jaws for the full year,” Flint told Reuters in a phone interview. “The real driver is that we have got control over cost base and we got some revenue momentum.” The cost reduction came as HSBC nears the end of a decade of expensive restructuring following the 2008 crisis. In the three months ended Sept.30, the bank reported pretax profit of $5.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion in the same period a year earlier. HSBC said its expenses in the third quarter fell 2.4 percent from the preceding three months, reversing the trend of the last couple of quarters. Quarterly reported revenue grew 6.3 percent from the year-ago period to $13.8 billion. The bank’s number of full-time employees as of the end of  September showed an increase of 5,044 from December to 233,731, it said, reversing the trend of shrinking headcount in recent years as the bank slashed jobs following the 2008 crisis. HSBC has hired senior investment bankers from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in recent months after losing a number of high-profile dealmakers this year. Despite cuts to its network in recent years, HSBC’s global reach sees it exposed to a range of geopolitical risks worldwide as trade tensions mount. Flint said he had not yet seen any signs of distress among corporate and individual customers’ financial health as Britain approaches the crunch period in its exit talks with the European Union, amid rising concerns of a no-deal Brexit. “We are hoping that progress can be made in the coming weeks,” he said. Flint in an interview with Reuters played down the likely impact on foreign trade and investment in Saudi Arabia following the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The CEO was also calm about the near-term impact of the escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions on corporate activity. “It’s a real issue to be clear, but it’s not yet manifesting itself in business activities in a meaningful way,” he said. Flint did sound a note of caution in the bank’s second home market and key profit engine of Hong Kong, however, saying rates of loan growth will moderate a little in the coming months as interest rates rise and the economy slows. Reported pretax profit of HSBC’s Asia operations, which accounted for 75 percent of the bank’s overall profits in the September quarter, rose 10.7 percent during the third quarter to $4.5 billion. HSBC is set to be the first company to issue Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDR), through a link between the London and Shanghai stock exchanges which will begin by year end, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. Flint said the bank was looking at the CDR option, but declined to comment further.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will levy a new tax on those who make or import plastic packaging with less than 30 percent recycled material, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Monday. The measure, to be introduced in April 2022 subject to consultation, is an attempt to reduce waste and help tackle climate change.  “We will introduce a new tax on the manufacture and import of plastic packaging which contains less than 30 percent recycled plastic transforming the economics of sustainable packaging,” Hammond announced as part of his annual budget. “The tax will provide a clear economic incentive for businesses to use recycled material in the production of packaging which in turn will create greater demand for this material,” the Treasury said, following Hammond’s announcement. Rupert Haworth, marketing director at Recycling Technologies, which converts waste plastic back into an oil to remake into plastic, said the move would encourage recycling.  “This (...) should stimulate new investment in plastic recycling innovation and capacity here in the UK and provide recycled plastic feedstock to the industry.”  Hammond added that he would continue to study the use of single-use plastic in takeaway cups but had concluded that a tax would not be effective in encouraging widespread reuse.

2019-02-08,"PAKISJAYA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Fishermen Budi and Gauk left home an hour before dawn on Monday and, with prawn nets stowed on their shallow teak boat, they headed out in a becalmed sea off the coast northeast of Jakarta in clear weather.  About the same time, on the other side of the Indonesian capital, passengers were checking in for Lion Air flight JT610. Then, shortly after 6:30 a.m. (2330 GMT Sunday), their lives collided.  The Boeing 737 MAX 8 literally fell out of the sky near where the two men were fishing about 15 km (9 miles) off the coast, silently at first and then with a deafening crash as it smacked into the sea. “You could feel the explosion from the shockwave in the water,” said Gauk, who goes by only one name, telling the pair’s story from the beach in Karawang regency.  Police busied themselves with rubber dinghies and ambulances were lined up on the shoreline, but no one pretended that any of the 189 people on board flight JT610 would be found alive. Yusuf Latief, spokesman of national search and rescue agency, said there were likely no survivors. There was no word on any probable cause for the accident. Air travel is crucial in Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands that stretches about 5,100 km (3,170 miles) from east to west, almost the distance between New York and London. Although it is one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, it has been plagued by air disasters. Lion Air, a low-cost airline that dominates the domestic air travel market, has had more than a dozen accidents in its nearly 20-year history, but none with fatalities since 2004. The captain of Monday’s flight JT610 from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang, the main town on Bangka, a beach-fringed island off Sumatra, was Bhavye Suneja, a 31-year-old Indian citizen   originally from New Delhi. He and an Italian passenger were the only known foreigners on board.  According to his Linkedin account, Suneja had worked for Lion Air since 2011, clocking up some 6,000 flight hours. On  Facebook there are photos of him in his Lion Air uniform, smiling. Minutes after take-off at 6:20 a.m., Suneja reported technical difficulties and obtained permission from ground officials to turn back. Data from FlightRadar24 shows the first sign of something amiss was around two minutes into the flight, when the plane had reached 2,000 feet (610 metres).  The plane dropped more than 500 feet (152 metres), veered to the left and then started climbing again to 5,000 feet (1,524 metres). It gained speed in the final moments before data was lost when it was at an altitude of 3,650 feet (1,113 metres). The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is the most recent model of Boeing’s famous 737, the U.S. company’s best-selling plane, and is a popular choice among budget airlines around the world. Lion Air’s plane was almost brand new. It was flown for the first time on Aug. 15, and the airline said it had been certified as airworthy before Monday’s flight by an engineer who is a specialist in Boeing models. Lion Air Chief Executive Edward Sirait said on Monday that the plane had encountered an unspecified “technical issue” on its previous flight, which was from the resort island of Bali to Jakarta, but this had been “resolved according to procedure”. “We don’t dare to say what the facts are, or are not, yet,” he told reporters. “We are also confused about the why, since it was a new plane.” At Jakarta airport, tearful passengers waited for news: a mother urged her toddler son to “wait and be brave”, another told her crying girl, “be patient, pray the best for Papa.” The only news that came, though, was of body parts and debris found floating in the water around the crash site. Photos published by the search and rescue agency showed pictures of articles belonging to passengers, including ID cards, a driving licence, and a pair of children’s shoes. One of the passengers was 22-year-old Deryl Fida Febrianto, who was married just two weeks ago and was on his way to Pangkal Pinang to work on a cruise ship.  His wife, Lutfinani Eka Putri, 23, said that her husband messaged her from the aircraft at 6:12 a.m., sending her a photo from the plane, and at 6:15 a.m. he stopped replying to her messages. They had grown up together, she told reporters, showing a picture of the smiling couple on their wedding day. “When I saw the news, I matched the flight number with the ticket photo Deryl had sent,” she said. “I immediately started crying.” Additional reporting by Fanny Potkin; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-crash-flight/indonesian-aircraft-was-new-fell-out-of-a-clear-sky-minutes-after-take-off-idUKKCN1N31Y3,2019-02-08,,"Indonesian aircraft was new, fell out of a clear sky minutes after take-off"
2019-02-08,"PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - The rabbis of the Pittsburgh synagogue where a gunman massacred 11 worshipers during Sabbath prayers urged mourners at an interfaith memorial service on Sunday to embrace tolerance and unity, while the mayor vowed to “defeat hate with love.” Themes of inclusion and compassion dominated the speeches delivered to an overflow crowd of some 2,500 at the University of Pittsburgh’s Soldiers and Sailors Hall, as speakers decried the rise of toxic political discourse widely seen as creating an atmosphere conducive to violence. Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers elicited shouts of “vote” from the audience as he called on political leaders, starting with “those in the room,” to help put an end to hate speech.  “My words are not intended as political,” he said from the stage. “My mother always taught me that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it.” The “Stronger Together” service opened with a performance by a Baptist gospel choir and included remarks by Christian and Muslim clergy, but it was largely led by Meyers and two fellow rabbis representing the three Jewish congregations who used the synagogue targeted in Saturday’s carnage. “What happened yesterday will not break us. It will not ruin us. We will continue to thrive and sing and worship and learn together and continue our historic legacy in the city with the friendliest people that I know,” said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman, choking back tears. Three members of his congregation were among those killed when a man armed with an assault rifle and three handguns on Saturday stormed the Tree of Life temple in the city’s heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighbourhood yelling “All Jews must die” as he opened fire on worshipers. In addition to the 11 mostly elderly victims who were killed, six people, including four police officers, were wounded before the suspect was arrested. Two of the surviving victims remained hospitalized in critical condition. The massacre marked the deadliest attack ever on America’s Jewish community, according to the Anti-Defamation League and Jewish Council for Public Affairs. Robert Bowers, 46, who has a history of posting anti-Semitic messages online, has been charged under federal hate crime statutes and could face the death penalty if convicted. “This is the darkest hour in our city’s history,” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto declared during Sunday’s service.  “But here’s another thing about Pittsburgh. We are resilient. We will work together as one. We will defeat hate with love. We will be a city of compassion and we will be welcoming to all people,” he said to cheers. The names of the dead were released hours earlier. They included David Rosenthal, 54; his brother Cecil Rosenthal, 59; Sylvan Simon, 86, and his wife Bernice Simon, 84; Joyce Fienberg, 75; Richard Gottfried, 65; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Daniel Stein, 71; Melvin Wax, 88; and Irving Younger, 69. The eldest victim was Rose Mallinger, 97. Rabinowitz was a family physician who initially escaped the attack only to be killed when he returned to render aid to the wounded, according to a Wall Street Journal op-ed column by Pittsburgh carpet salesman Lou Weiss, who knew five victims personally.  Five of the dead lived in Squirrel Hill, a quiet, leafy district with a large Jewish population. The community also was home to the late Fred Rogers, whose long-running children’s television show “Mr. Rogers’ Neighbourhood” featured lessons on friendship and kindness.  The remaining victims were from other parts of Pittsburgh, the second-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia. The mass shooting sparked security alerts at houses of worship around the country and condemnation from politicians and religious leaders.  Some complained that the confrontational, nationalistic rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged right-wing extremists and fed a surge in activity by hate groups. Trump, who quickly branded Saturday’s shooting an act of pure evil and called on Americans to rise above hatred, was already facing similar criticism ahead of Nov. 6 congressional elections following pipe bombs mailed last week to some of his most prominent critics. The targets, mostly Democrats, included former U.S. President Barack Obama.  “Honestly I think this president’s whole modus operandi is to divide us. He gets up in the morning with new and inventive ways to divide us,” U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is Jewish, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” broadcast on Sunday. Trump told reporters the killings might have been prevented if there had been an armed guard. Synagogue officials said police would only normally have been present for security on high holidays. The mayor said on Sunday that keeping guns out of the hands of irrational people was a better way to prevent violence. FBI Special Agent Robert Jones told a news conference he did not know why Bowers had targeted the Tree of Life synagogue. Authorities believe he entered the synagogue, opened fire on worshipers and was fleeing when he encountered a police officer, Jones said. The two exchanged gunfire, he said, and Bowers reentered the building before a police tactical squad arrived.  Bowers surrendered and was taken to a hospital where he was listed in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds.  Federal prosecutors charged Bowers late on Saturday with 29 criminal counts including violating U.S. civil rights laws. Bowers’ virulent anti-Semitic views were evident in prolific online postings. In one early on Saturday, he wrote that a Jewish refugee group, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”    He is due to make his first court appearance on Monday afternoon before a federal judge in Pittsburgh.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Britain’s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), which represents funds that own a combined 1 percent of Ryanair, on Sunday said it planned to file resolutions at the company’s next annual general meeting to replace Chairman David Bonderman. The group, which opposed Bonderman’s re-election at last month’s AGM, said it would lobby fellow shareholders to join it to secure the 3 percent of shares required to file a shareholder resolution at the next meeting, due in September 2019.  The group also plans to file a resolution demanding that succession plans for Chief Executive Michael O’Leary be set out.  “On the day of Ryanair’s first-half results (Oct. 22) Mr O’Leary said Mr Bonderman intends to remain in place for one or two more years and that the company would set out succession plans for Mr O’Leary in the next two or three years,” the LAPFF said in a statement.  “Shareholders have made it clear they expect action quicker than this.” The group said it believed recent staffing and industrial relations issues at Ryanair might have been handled better with a more independent board.  It said its concerns had been heightened by a profit warning on Oct. 1. when Ryanair cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent citing damage to bookings from strikes.    The LAPFF was one of several shareholders to voice concerns at Ryanair’s AGM in September, when Bonderman, was re-elected with 70.5 percent of votes, a significant fall from the 89 percent he received the previous year.  “Ryanair shareholders recently passed all AGM resolutions by a large majority, including the nomination of directors and chairman,” a Ryanair spokesman said when asked to comment on the LAPFF’s plan. “They appreciate how fortunate we are to have an outstanding Chairman like David Bonderman guide the board and the airline.”  Bonderman, the founder of private equity firm TPG Capital who has chaired Ryanair since 1996, resigned from the board of Uber in 2017 after an ill-judged joke that more women on the board means “more talking”.

2019-02-08,"BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s presidential election on Sunday, promising to clean up politics, shrink the state and crack down on crime, in a dramatic swing away from the left in the world’s fourth-largest democracy. The former army captain has alarmed many with vows to sweep political opponents off the map and comments denigrating women, gays and racial minorities.  He will be the first president with a background in the armed forces since the end of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, which he has publicly praised. He has tapped retired generals to serve as his vice president and run key ministries. In his first public comments after his landslide victory, he pledged to respect democratic principles, but said he wanted to change the country’s direction. “We cannot continue flirting with socialism, communism, populism and leftist extremism ... We are going to change the destiny of Brazil,” Bolsonaro said in an acceptance address, promising to root out graft and stem a tide of violent crime.     An outspoken admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bolsonaro also pledged to realign Brazil with more advanced economies rather than regional allies, overhauling diplomatic priorities after nearly a decade and a half of leftist rule. Trump called Bolsonaro to wish him good luck soon after his electoral victory, auguring closer political ties between the two largest nations in the Americas — both now led by conservative populists promising to overturn the political establishment.  Bolsonaro won 55.2 percent of votes in the run-off election against left-wing hopeful Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party (PT)’s 44.8 percent, according to electoral authority TSE. The 63-year-old congressman’s rise has been propelled by rejection of the leftist PT that ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years. The party was ousted from power in 2016 in the midst of a deep recession and political graft scandal. Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters cheered and set off fireworks outside his home in Rio de Janeiro’s luxurious beachfront Barra de Tijuca neighbourhood as his victory was announced. In Brazil’s commercial capital of Sao Paulo, Bolsonaro’s win was greeted with fireworks and the honking of car horns. Investors have also cheered Bolsonaro’s ascent, relieved that he could keep the PT out of power and hopeful that he would carry out fiscal reforms proposed by his orthodox economic guru. Tokyo-listed Brazilian stock exchange traded funds (ETFs) (1325.T) jumped more than 12 percent when Japanese markets opened following Bolsonaro’s win.  “I don’t idolize Bolsonaro and I don’t know if he will govern well, but we are hopeful. People want the PT out, they can’t take any more corruption,” said Tatiana Cunha, a 39-year-old systems analyst in the midst of the noisy celebrations in Rio. Many Brazilians are concerned that Bolsonaro, an admirer of the dictatorship and a defender of its use of torture on leftist opponents, will trample on human rights, curtail civil liberties and muzzle freedom of speech. Human Rights Watch called on Brazilian judges, prosecutors, media and civil society to stand up against any attempt by Bolsonaro to “erode the democratic rights and institutions Brazil has painstakingly built in the last three decades.” In his acceptance speech, Bolsonaro promised to govern according to the Bible and the country’s constitution. The live broadcast of Bolsonaro’s words was preceded by a prayer led by lawmaker, pastor and gospel singer Magno Malta, underscoring Bolsonaro’s ties to evangelical churches that backed him for supporting their conservative social agenda. Brazil’s rapidly expanding evangelical congregations have created a conservative political force, which Bolsonaro tapped into by decrying sex education in schools and pushing back against gay rights. He has vowed to crack down on crime in Brazil’s cities and farm belt by granting police more autonomy to shoot suspected criminals. He also wants to let more Brazilians buy weapons to fight crime. He himself was stabbed at a rally last month and will need to undergo surgery in mid-December to remove a colostomy bag, the head of his right-wing Social Liberal Party Gustavo Bebianno told reporters. Bolsonaro said he would “unite Brazil” by cutting bureaucracy and red tape for businesses. He said he was committed to fiscal discipline and called for the early elimination of the federal government’s budget deficit. “We are going to think in terms of more Brazil and less Brasilia,” he said, referring to the nation’s capital where he will take office on Jan. 1. Financial markets are expected to rally on Monday on Bolsonaro’s victory. The real currency BRL= has gained about 10 percent against the dollar in the last month as Bolsonaro's prospects of winning increased. Sao Paulo's benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP has risen 13.5 percent since mid-September. Investors are particularly heartened by his choice of Paulo Guedes, a Chicago University-trained economist and investment banker, as his economic guru and future economy minister. Guedes said the new government will try to erase Brazil’s unsustainable budget within a year, simplify and reduce taxes, and create 10 million jobs by cutting payroll taxes. New rules will boost investment in infrastructure, he told reporters. Guedes is keen to privatise an array of state enterprises,  including units of oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) (PETR4.SA) and power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (Eletrobras) (ELET6.SA).  However, his free-market ideas have clashed with the views of the retired army generals who are helping Bolsonaro flesh out his government programme. On Sunday, Guedes said Brazil would seek to improve trade relations outside the restrictions of the Mercosur bloc founded with neighbouring Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. Bolsonaro’s rise follows conservative electoral victories in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru, pushing the continent to the right and undermining support for the authoritarian socialist regime in Venezuela. Several hundred PT demonstrators protested Bolsonaro’s victory on Sao Paulo’s main Paulista Avenue before police dispersed them using tear gas. But voting was calm and orderly across the country, said Laura Chinchilla, the former president of Costa Rica who is head of the Organization of American States’ Electoral Observation Mission.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond will use his annual  budget speech on Monday to urge his divided Conservative Party to get behind the government’s push for a Brexit deal, or put at risk a long-awaited easing of austerity. Hammond, who routinely angers many Conservative lawmakers by calling for close ties with the European Union after Brexit, will offer a glimpse of higher spending after nearly a decade of cuts to many public services. But he will also say that an easing of the spending squeeze will hinge on London reaching an agreement with Brussels to smooth Britain’s exit from the EU in five months’ time. “If we don’t get a deal ... we would need to take a different approach to the future of Britain’s economy,” Hammond told Sky News television on Sunday. “We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we’d need to have a new budget that set out a different strategy for the future.”  Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to rally the Conservatives behind her Brexit strategy, raising concerns that Britain could leave the EU in March without a transition deal. Hammond could soften an immediate shock to the economy by spending some of the reserves he has built up within the limits of his fiscal rules.  But a no-deal Brexit would probably cut Britain’s annual growth rate to just 0.3 percent next year and in 2020 and push up borrowing, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, said last week. Britain’s economy has slowed since the 2016 Brexit referendum but not as much as many economists feared, allowing Hammond to announce on Monday a further improvement in the budget deficit. Still, Britain’s debt levels remain high, limiting how much Hammond can relax his spending squeeze. He said on Sunday that the biggest increase in spending in his budget had already been announced when May said four months ago that more money would go to the health service. He is set to announce other measures including more spending on roads, a tax cut for small retailers hammered by online competition and more spending on broadband. Hammond hinted on Sunday that he would soften the impact of changes to the welfare system and said he wanted a timetable for progress on getting giant tech firms to pay more tax. For now, however, he is expected to shy away from talking about a broader push for higher taxes that fiscal experts say Britain will need in order to meet the costs of an ageing population. Last year, Hammond was forced into a U-turn on his plan to raise more tax from self-employed people after an uproar within the Conservative Party, which has since have lost its majority in parliament.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - In the 1960s, when I was growing up in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill district, we used to take the trolley up cobble-stoned Murray Avenue heading downtown, passing through a tableau of European-American Jewish life. There were Silverman’s and Rosenbloom’s, the two bakeries  where we bought our dark rye bread. There were kosher butcher shops, delicatessens, synagogues and a Hillel academy, small jewellery shops and clothing stores.  Back then, the synagogues and Hebrew schools bore signs that read “Save Soviet Jewry”. We were all acutely aware that Pittsburgh, then the steel capital of the world, would most likely be hit by one of the first Russian nuclear missiles should World War Three erupt. But the plight of Soviet Jews worried my neighbours almost as much.  It was no surprise the Soviet Jewry movement resonated in Squirrel Hill. We were, after all, a neighbourhood of refugees, though most of us didn’t come through formal programs. My neighbours’ families had fled pogroms in Eastern Europe, or genocide in Germany, or, in my family’s case, poverty in Ireland. We understood in our DNA the need to seek refuge.  The man accused of slaughtering 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill on Saturday, Robert Bowers, appears from social media postings to have had a very different view of refugees. Hours before Saturday’s attack, he accused one prominent refugee group, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, of liking “to bring invaders in that kill our people.” Social media postings attributed to him display a particular animus for Jews.   The non-Jewish minority in Squirrel Hill were mainly Catholics, Italian and Irish whose parents and grandparents were also immigrants seeking a better life.  The cultural diversity enriched us all, sometimes literally. We went to each other’s birthday parties, Bar Mitzvahs and confirmations - which meant more envelopes containing money at the end of the night. Almost all the families on Mt. Royal Road, where we lived, were Jewish. We had the great fortune to live across the street from the Sterns, whose father George owned the Manor theatre on Murray Avenue. We saw “Flubber” and “101 Dalmatians” at the Sterns’ house before they opened in theatres. Down the street were the Alperns, who had a men’s store. The family gave me and my brothers hand-me-down sport coats, ties and slacks, much better than the stuff we used to get at Claber’s, the local Wal-Mart equivalent of those days. The Friedman’s next door were very close family friends. The mother, Sylvia, was a nurse who had emigrated from South Africa. She was in our kitchen every day after school having tea with my mother. Her daughter, Linda, practically raised my two younger sisters. We never felt like a minority in predominantly Jewish Squirrel Hill. Indeed, the exotic shops, the men in black hats and sidelocks, the clanging street cars, provided a much more vibrant American lesson in multiculturalism than the one we studied in civics class at school.

2019-02-08,"LEICESTER, England (Reuters) - A helicopter belonging to Leicester City football club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha crashed in a ball of flames in the club’s car park on Saturday after a Premier League match, British media said. It was not known whether Vichai, a father of four and the founder of duty-free giant King Power International, was in the helicopter when it spiralled out of control and crashed just yards from the pitch, around an hour after the game had ended.  According to eyewitnesses, the helicopter just cleared the top of the stadium before it started to spin. It then plummeted to the ground and burst into flames.  A spokesman for the Midlands club said: “We are assisting Leicestershire Police and the emergency services in dealing with a major incident at King Power Stadium.” Police and the ambulance services urged people to stay away.  John Butcher, who was near the stadium at the time of the crash, told the BBC his nephew saw the helicopter spiral out of control apparently due to a faulty rear propeller.  “Within a second it dropped like a stone to the floor...Luckily it did spiral for a little while and everybody sort of ran, sort of scattered. As far as we are aware nobody around the car park was caught up in this problem.” In Thailand, officials at King Power said they could not yet comment on the crash or say whether Vichai had been aboard. Vichai is a huge favourite with the fans after he bought the unfancied side from central England in 2010 and they went on to stun the soccer world by winning the league title in 2016. According to Forbes magazine he is the fifth richest person in Thailand with an estimated net worth of $4.9 billion.  Leicestershire Police said a team from the Department for Transport’s Air Accidents Investigations Branch had taken charge of the investigation into the cause of the crash. After pumping millions of pounds into the club, he helped steer them back into the top flight in 2014 before they stunned the sport by beating the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea to become champions of England. Leading players in the side, including Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire, sent messages of support on Twitter while rival clubs including Manchester City also voiced their concern.  Freelance photographer Ryan Brown was covering the game and saw the helicopter clear the stadium before it crashed, the BBC reported. “Literally the engine stopped and I turned around, and it made a bit of a whirring noise,” Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live. “It turned silent, blades started spinning and then there was a big bang.” Leicester had played a league match at home against West Ham United earlier on Saturday, drawing 1-1. The self-made businessman Vichai founded Thai duty-free giant King Power in 1989. The duty-free business got a big boost in 2006 when it was granted an airport monopoly under the government of then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, and it continued to prosper even after Thaksin’s ouster in a coup that year. The family’s empire also includes Belgian football club, Oud-Heverlee Leuven.

2019-02-08,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chances of Brazil’s leftist presidential candidate Fernando Haddad narrowing the lead of right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro took a hit when he failed to win a crucial endorsement on Saturday, a day before the two face off in a runoff election.  However, polls published late Saturday from Brazil’s two biggest surveying firms showed momentum shifting toward Haddad, though he still trails Bolsonaro by a solid margin.  Former centre-left candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video on social media that he would not take sides in the election campaign, withholding support for Haddad of the Workers Party (PT). Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in the northeast, is influential in Brazil’s poorest region. His endorsement could have given Haddad a big lift in the South American country’s most polarized election in a generation. But Rodrigo Janot, Brazil’s influential former prosecutor general under whose watch the country’s unprecedented investigations and prosecutions of endemic political graft took place, tweeted late Saturday that he would vote for Haddad. That was a blow to Bolsonaro’s work positioning himself as the only anti-corruption candidate. “I think we are at the brink of a process that could push our democracy beyond its limits,” Janot told Reuters late Saturday. “Freedom, equality and fraternity - always and at any cost.”  Haddad narrowed Bolsonaro’s lead to 8 percentage points in an Ibope poll released late Saturday, a survey that gave him 46 percent compared with Bolsonaro’s 54 percent.  As only two candidates remain and those figures discard voters who say they will annul their votes, that in practice means Haddad needs to win 5 percentage points to overtake the right-winger.  In a Datafolha poll also released late Saturday, Bolsonaro had 55 percent of voter backing, compared with 45 percent for Haddad.  While Haddad failed to get Gomes to endorse him, he won the backing on Saturday not just of Janot but of Brazil’s most popular YouTube host, Felipe Neto, who has 27.7 million followers on his channel. A popular anti-corruption judge, Joaquim Barbosa, who jailed several top PT leaders for corruption, also came out for Haddad. Gomes finished third in the Oct. 7 first round vote with 12 percent of the vote, behind Bolsonaro’s 46 percent and Haddad’s 29 percent. Gomes had hoped to be the standard bearer of the left but was outmanoeuvred by jailed PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption and anointed Haddad as his stand-in. Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, is poised to become Brazil’s first far-right president since the end of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship. The 63-year-old seven-term congressman has promised to crack down on crime and corruption, pitching himself as the anti-establishment candidate for voters fed up with political graft and violent crime. Bolsonaro’s sudden rise comes as Brazil finds itself in its worst recession and embroiled in its biggest corruption scandal after the leftist PT ran the government for 13 of the last 15 years. Until his presidential run, Bolsonaro was best known for defending the former military regime and its use of torture. He has faced charges for misogynist, racist and homophobic rants.  The Supreme Court rejected the racism charge, but has not ruled on a charge of inciting to rape in a case in which he told a fellow lawmaker she was not pretty enough to rape. He called the case political persecution. A week ago, Bolsonaro vowed to run all the “red” leftists out of Brazil or put them in jail, harsh words that probably contributed to the narrowing of his lead. YouTuber Neto said he had been neutral until that point. “Everything changed when (Bolsonaro) said he will sweep opponents out of the country or into jail. In 16 years of PT I have been robbed, but never threatened,” Neto said by Twitter. In the final two days of campaigning, Bolsonaro has sounded more moderate in his statements, backing down on a plan to follow U.S. President Donald Trump’s example and pull Brazil out of the Paris climate change accord. On Friday he told Xingú tribes people they had a right to charge royalties for mining and hydro electric power generation on their reservations, a proposal welcomed by some natives but rejected by anthropologists and environmentalists who see the tribes as the last guardians of the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity. “You are as Brazilian as any of us,” he said in a video posted on social media. “I want you to have the right to use your land and exploit its biodiversity and mineral riches.” In his final hours of campaigning in Sao Paulo, Haddad accused the Bolsonaro camp of “sweetening” their candidate to make him appear what he is not. “He is a truculent and dangerous person, and that’s how he should be presented to the nation,” he said.

2019-02-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A major meeting of Catholic bishops ended on Saturday with a call for women to play a greater role in Church decision making as a “duty of justice”, but appeared to water down language that would have been more welcoming to gays. The role of women took centre stage at the synod, which was focussed on reaching out to young people but has been overshadowed by the scandal over sex abuse in the Church and acrimony between social conservatives and reformers. In a sign of the divisions, the synod used what appeared to be compromise language on the topic of homosexuality, saying people could not be identified solely by sexual orientation. A working paper for the gathering, which began on Oct. 3, had used the acronym LGBT, but this did not appear in the 60-page final document. The document also called for stricter measures to combat sexual abuse, including more transparency in Church structures, and denounced a culture of elitism among some Church leaders which it said can facilitate cover-up and corruption. All three issues were among the subjects debated at the gathering, officially titled “Young People, Faith and Discernment of Vocation” and attended by some 300 bishops, priests, nuns and lay participants. Only “synod fathers”, including bishops and some other male representatives, were allowed to vote on the final document. It will be sent to the pope, who will take it into consideration when he writes his own document. Attention was drawn to the issue of women’s rights by the synod’s own rules, under which two non-ordained monks who lead religious orders were permitted to vote, while a nun with a similar role was not. [L8N1X366M] The Catholic Church restricts the priesthood to men, but allows people of both sexes who are not priests to hold positions of authority in other areas. However, none of the Vatican’s 60 departments is headed by a women and only six women hold decision making roles in the Vatican bureaucracy. Young people, the document said, believed the Church still lagged in attempts to give women “space in decision making processes” in jobs not restricted to priests. “The synod recommends making everyone (in the Church) aware of the urgency of an unavoidable change ...,” the document says. It called for “a female presence in church roles at all levels, even in positions of responsibility,” which it described as a “duty of justice”. The three sections on sexuality in the document were not as strong or as inclusive as some young people had wanted, although it renewed the Church’s “commitment against all sexually-based discrimination and violence”. The acronym LGBT appeared for the first time in a Vatican document in the working paper for synod issued in May. That working paper said: “Some LGBT youths wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church.” But conservative bishops, including those from Africa and at least one from the United States, opposed the mention.  “There is no such thing as an ‘LGBTQ Catholic’ or a ‘transgender Catholic’ or a ‘heterosexual Catholic,’ as if our sexual appetites defined who we are ...,” Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said in his address to the synod. The Church teaches that having homosexual urges is not sinful but people must not act on them. In its sections on sexual abuse scandals that have scarred the Church in a number of countries, the document called for “strong preventive measures to prevent any repeat” and supported calls for a stricter selection of men who want to be priests.

2019-02-08,"MANAMA (Reuters) - Oman described Israel as an accepted Middle East state on Saturday, a day after hosting a surprise visit by its prime minister that Washington said could help regional peace efforts. Oman is offering ideas to help Israel and the Palestinians to come together but is not acting as mediator, Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the sultanate’s minister responsible for foreign affairs, told a security summit in Bahrain. “Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this,” bin Alawi said. “The world is also aware of this fact. Maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as others states] and also bear the same obligations.” His comments followed a rare visit to Oman by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which came days after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas paid a three-day visit to the Gulf country. Both leaders met with Oman’s Sultan Qaboos.  “We are not saying that the road is now easy and paved with flowers, but our priority is to put an end to the conflict and move to a new world,” bin Alawi told the summit. Oman is relying on the United States and efforts by President Donald Trump in working towards the “deal of the century” (Middle East peace), he added. Bahrain’s foreign minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa voiced support for Oman over the sultanate’s role in trying to secure Israeli-Palestinian peace, while Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said the kingdom believes the key to normalising relations with Israel was the peace process.  The three-day summit was attended by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and his counterparts in Italy and Germany also participated, but Jordan’s King Abdullah cancelled his appearance after a flood that hit the Dead Sea region killed 21 people. Trump’s Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt welcomed the “warming ties & growing cooperation between our regional friends” in a tweet late on Friday. “This is a helpful step for our peace efforts & essential to create an atmosphere of stability, security & prosperity between Israelis, Palestinians & their neighbours. Looking forward to seeing more meetings like this!” Greenblatt said. Israel and some Gulf states share an interest in curbing Iran’s influence in the region. Oman has long been to the Middle East what neutral Switzerland is to global diplomacy. The country helped to mediate secret U.S.-Iran talks in 2013 that led to the historic nuclear deal signed in Geneva two years later. Earlier this year, bin Alawi visited Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque and Netanyahu has on several occasions hinted at warmer ties with Gulf states.  He told Israel’s parliament last week that due to fears of a nuclear threat from Iran, “Israel and other Arab countries are closer than they ever were before.” Though uncommon, Israeli leaders have previously visited the Gulf state.  In 1996, the late Shimon Peres went to Oman and Qatar when he was prime minister and opened Israel trade representative offices in both Gulf countries.  His predecessor, the late Yitzhak Rabin, made the first trip to Oman in 1994. On his visit on Friday, Netanyahu was accompanied by senior officials, including the head of the Mossad intelligence agency and his national security adviser.

2019-02-08,"PLANTATION, Fla. (Reuters) - Long before Cesar Sayoc was arrested on Friday for allegedly sending pipe bombs to critics of U.S. President Donald Trump, the 56-year-old former stripper with a long arrest record  threatened to bomb a power company and posted angry rants. “He was like a 14-year-old in an adult’s body and the kind of arrests he had were reflective of that,” Ron Lowy, his former attorney and now lawyer for Sayoc’s family, told CNN in an interview on Friday.   Sayoc was arrested Friday morning in Plantation, Fla. at a car parts store and charged with sending package bombs to former President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other public figures Trump has frequently derided..  Hours after federal authorities arrested him in Plantation, Florida, his social media posts and extraordinary work history began to offer the first sketch of a man whose rudimentary bombs launched a nationwide manhunt. Sayoc has worked as a male stripper, a professional wrestler, a store manager and a club promoter, according to public records, social media profiles and interviews with people who interacted with him.  His white van, which authorities seized, had numerous pro-Trump signs in the windows, including a drawing depicting the president standing on top of a tank emblazoned with “Trump.” The van also had photos of Clinton and other Democrats with bulls eyes superimposed on their faces. It was not immediately clear where Sayoc has been living or working most recently. David Cypkin, 39, a documentary filmmaker, recalled seeing the van parked outside a shopping center near his home for more than a year and as recently as this summer. “It often had an open door or an open window, which led me to believe there was somebody inside,” Cypkin said in a phone interview. “It stayed overnight. I saw it dozens of times.” Sayoc’s social media accounts are filled with anti-Democrat sentiments and racist diatribes. But Lowy, his lawyer back in 2002, said his political awakening seemed to be recent. Records show he was a registered Republican. “His mother confirmed to me he had never voted ...He never had an interest in any type of political issues. His interest was more body building, night-time, nightclub events.” According to bankruptcy records in 2012, he had been living with his mother with no furniture then.   Lowy said Sayoc may have been attracted to Trump’s appeal to outsiders. “People who don’t fit in, people who are angry at America, telling them that they have a place at the table, telling them that it’s OK to get angry.” Lowy became Sayoc’s lawyer when he was charged in 2002 with threatening to bomb a power utility for trying to shut off the lights of a Laundromat he owned at the time, telling a company representative it would be “worse than September 11th,” according to a Miami police report.  Over the years, he was arrested for domestic violence, theft and fraud. While Sayoc in his social media posts appears to identify with the Seminole nation, Lowy said his father was from the Philippines who left the family when the boy was young, and his mother was of Italian ancestry from Brooklyn.  “And he adopted this claim to being a Seminole because he was trying to create an identity,” Lowy said.  In 2015, Sayoc reported that $7,150 worth of Donald Trump-related clothing was stolen from his car while he worked out at a gym, along with a laptop and other items, according to Broward County Sheriff’s Office records. There was not enough evidence to identify a suspect, according to the records. He delivered pizzas at the New River Pizza & Fresh Kitchen in Fort Lauderdale working only nights because of the politically charged images on his van, said his former boss Debra Gureghian, 59, who described herself as a “proud lesbian”. When Sayoc learnt that Gureghian was a lesbian, he told her if he had control, “I would be on an island with the blacks, the Jews, the gays, the lesbians, the transgenders, and that he would nuke the island,” she said. He was otherwise a “fabulous” worker, Gureghian said. “On time. Diligent. Articulate. Never had any complaints with any customers. I wish I had more of him.”  Federal officials said on Friday they were unsure of the motive behind his rudimentary package bombs, but he made no secret of his political grievances. Two weeks ago, Sayoc threatened a former Democratic congressional spokeswoman on Twitter after her appearance on Fox News. The tweet warned her to “hug your loved ones real close every time you leave” home. The woman, Rochelle Ritchie, reported him to Twitter, but the company initially found he had not violated any conduct rules. Twitter issued a statement on Friday saying it had made a  mistake. “The Tweet clearly violated our rules and should have been removed. We are deeply sorry for that error.” A Facebook profile that appeared to belong to Sayoc featured videos and photos of him at multiple Trump rallies. Several posts contained anti-Muslim statements. Sayoc attended Brevard College in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and played soccer for both schools, though he did not graduate either one, according to school representatives. His working life was mercurial. From 1996 to 2002, he worked as a male exotic dancer for Gold Productions Inc, according to a company employee before leaving to become a professional wrestler.  He is a promoter, booking agent and “live entertainment owner,” according to his LinkedIn profile, which also said he was studying veterinary medicine at High Point University in North Carolina. A school spokesman said he did not attend the school. Gureghian, his former boss, said her employee was always changing the images pasted on his van - including ones of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and hangman nooses. “He would continuously put on new ones. Whatever aroused his mind.”  (This story has been refiled to add byline) Reporting by Joseph Ax and Bernie Woodall; additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault, Gina Cherelus, Peter Szekely and Daniel Trotta in New York; Alex Dobuzinkis in Los Angeles; Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; and Sarah N.

Hours after a Trump supporter, Cesar Sayoc, was arrested in Florida in the bomb case, Trump told a political rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, that political violence must never be tolerated. “I will do all I can to stop it,” he said. But any major attempt to heal political divisions was quickly set aside as Trump renewed attacks on his usual targets: the news media and his Democratic opponents. “We have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party,” Trump said. Trump appeared to be commenting on cable news blanket coverage of the bomb case and how the people targeted are frequently criticized by the president. Trump was in Charlotte campaigning for Republican candidates ahead of the hotly contested Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, with Republicans are trying to hang on to control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Some in the crowd on Friday quickly chimed in with a cry that is a familiar one at Trump’s political rallies: “CNN sucks.” Trump paused while the CNN chant continued, then added: “And they do have a major role to play as far as tone. The media’s constant unfair coverage ... and negative attacks only serve to drive people apart and to undermine healthy debate.” When Trump criticized Democrats, the crowd chanted “lock her up,” a refrain from the Republican president’s 2016 campaign when he called Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton “Crooked Hillary.” Trump again referred to Clinton as “Crooked Hillary” on Friday night when he listed Democrats who supposedly had supported building a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Clinton was the target of one of the bombs sent this week, which was intercepted during a routine off-site mail screening. “They’re gonna be reporting about you tonight,” Trump told the crowd in North Carolina. Trump said Republicans did not try to seek political gain over the Democrats when a supporter of democratic socialist Bernie Sanders opened fire on congressional Republicans at a baseball field last year and severely wounded Representative Steve Scalise. “We did not use that heinous attempt at mass murder for political gain because that would have been wrong. ... Nor do we blame the Democrat party every time radical leftists seize and destroy public property and unleash violence and mayhem,” he said. Trump made similar comments on Thursday, blaming the news media for stirring up anger and hateful political rhetoric as two more suspicious packages were discovered. In a post on Twitter he referred to “purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media.” Trump hinted earlier on Friday in a tweet that the news media’s coverage of the bomb case was taking attention away from the midterm elections at a time when Republicans may be hitting their stride. “Republicans all over the country, we’re hot,” Trump said in Charlotte. “We’re hot and I don’t think they’re going to cool us off. They try so hard. But I don’t think that’s going to happen.” Reporting by Steve Holland in Charlotte, North Carlina; Additional reporting by Mohammad Zargham in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-packages-trump-rally/trump-says-media-uses-bomb-case-to-score-political-points-against-him-idUKKCN1N02XW,2019-02-08,,Trump says media uses bomb case to score political points against him
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s budget announcement on Monday and a “Super Thursday” at the Bank of England would normally be key moments for the world’s fifth-biggest economy, but this time they are likely to be overshadowed by the drama of Brexit. Finance minister Philip Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney have little option but to sit on the fence as they wait to see whether a no-deal exit from the European Union, which they warn would harm the economy, can be averted. Both men have other business they want to get on with. Hammond is under pressure from Prime Minister Theresa May to end a decade of austerity to see off a rise in popularity of the opposition Labour Party. At the BoE — where an interest rate decision and economic forecasts are due to be announced on Thursday — Carney and his fellow policymakers want to progress with their plan to raise borrowing costs gradually over the coming years. That would allow the British central bank to follow the lead of other central banks, especially in the United States and Canada, which are dismantling 10 years of massive stimulus. Expectations of another rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve in December are likely to grow if the monthly payrolls report on Nov. 2 shows further jobs growth and rising pay. In the euro zone, data on economic growth and inflation on Tuesday and Wednesday will show whether the recovery in the single currency area has kept pace.  But in Britain, with Brexit just five months away, things are much less clear cut. There is no sign of a Brexit breakthrough with Brussels, in large part because May’s Conservative Party is riven over how close Britain should remain to the European Union after it leaves the bloc. “The budget is likely to be something of a holding exercise until the Brexit fog clears and the MPC is likely to remain in a state of inertia until there is a bit more clarity on the state of the Brexit negotiations,” Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, a research firm, said. When he stands up in parliament on Monday afternoon, Hammond is expected to use his high-profile budget speech to try to cool the Conservative rebels by dangling the prospect of higher spending in the future, as long as a Brexit deal is done. Britain’s economy has slowed since the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU. But it has not suffered as badly as many forecasters expected, giving Hammond some fiscal wiggle room to fund higher health spending already promised by May. Hammond might get further help if Britain’s budget forecasters scale back their estimates of future deficits, as they have suggested they will. But his ability to ramp up spending in other areas depends most on avoiding a new shock to the economy. A no-deal Brexit would slash economic growth to just 0.3 percent a year in 2019 and 2020 compared with 1.9 and 1.6 percent if there is a deal, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated on Friday. Britain’s budget deficit would stop falling and would rise under a no-deal scenario, according to its forecasts. Looking further ahead, Hammond has suggested he will need to raise taxes to help fund higher public spending. But the prospect of getting controversial measures passed in parliament, where the Conservatives have no outright majority, is probably too daunting at a time of heightened Brexit tensions. For the BoE, the Brexit stakes are high too. It has begun raising interest rates from their crisis-era levels and its chief economist has said he sees signs of a “new dawn” for British workers’ pay, long the missing link in the country’s recovery from the financial crisis. But most economists think it will wait until May to raise rates again, assuming Britain leaves the EU with a deal. “In any other situation, we suspect the Bank of England would be looking to increase interest rates pretty soon,” ING economists said in a note to clients on Friday.  “But inevitably, Brexit remains policymakers’ number one consideration, and given that there may still be some time before we know for sure whether a deal will be in place before the UK formally leaves the EU, there is a risk growth slows as businesses and consumers grow more cautious.” Writing by William Schomberg, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-global-economy/uk-budget-and-bank-of-england-take-back-seat-to-brexit-drama-idUKKCN1N01PJ,2019-02-08,,UK budget and Bank of England take back seat to Brexit drama
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares were on course for their worst month since 2015 on Friday after a spreading global sell-off hit regional equity markets and missed results expectations sapped risk appetite.  The leading index of euro zone stocks .STOXX50E fell 1.4 percent with Germany's DAX .GDAXI down 0.9 percent and France's CAC 40 .FCHI down 1.3 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 lost 1.2 percent and is down about 8 percent so far in October, a size of fall not seen since August 2015.  Overall the third-quarter earnings season has been marred by rolling sell-offs across global markets.  Wary analysts were downgrading their earnings estimates for the MSCI Europe index .dMIEU00000PUS at their fastest pace since Feb 2016 and disappointments over results caused sharp share falls.  Shares in French auto parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) sank more than 21 percent after its second profit warning in three months flagged disruption from tougher European emissions tests and a sharp sales downturn in China. Peer Faurecia (EPED.PA) also tumbled 5.7 percent after it agreed to buy Japanese car navigation system maker Clarion from Hitachi. The autos & parts sector index .SXAP fell 1.6 percent.  Swedish appliances maker Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) fell 4.4 percent after it trimmed its market demand expectations and forecast higher costs due to increasing raw material prices and tariffs. Shares in French household appliances maker SEB (SEBF.PA) fell 11 percent for their worst day since 2012 after the company cut revenue guidance due to a “difficult environment” with FX and raw material costs rising. Also posting its worst ever daily fall after disappointing results was Spanish sausage casings producer Viscofan (VIS.MC). Its shares fell 19.4 percent after it warned it would miss full-year profit guidance. Kepler Cheuvreux analysts downgraded the stock to “reduce” from “hold”. Altran (ALTT.PA) shares were a bright spot, surging 15.3 percent after the engineering and tech consultancy reported strong third-quarter results thanks to good growth in Germany and the Americas. Results from banks were more mixed after encouraging results from UBS boosted its shares in the previous session. Spain’s Banco Sabadell (SABE.MC) topped the IBEX with a 5.1 percent gain after third-quarter profit beat expectations.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shares slumped to a near two-year low on Friday on growing concerns about slowing earnings growth, with investors punishing Rolls Royce and RBS. The FTSE 100 .FTSE, on track for its biggest monthly drop in a decade, closed down 1.4 percent as selling accelerated after a weak start on Wall Street where grim earnings from Amazon and Alphabet shook confidence. Financials led the UK pack lower with a 21-point drop, followed by the energy sector, which was hit by weaker oil prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar after better-than-expected U.S. GDP data. Only 10 stocks were in positive territory, with Randgold Resources RRS.L rising 3.6 percent as investors sought shelter in safe-haven gold assets and defensive sectors. Bullion hit three-month highs. [GOL/] Notching up a fifth straight weekly loss, the Midcap FTSE 250 was down 1.2 percent. Pan European stocks  were set for their biggest monthly drop since August 2011. A slew of downbeat corporate outlooks with warnings of higher raw material costs, damage from tariffs and waning Chinese demand underscored worries about corporate growth.  Analysts have been downgrading their forecasts for European earnings at their fastest pace since 2016, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “There aren’t many more lifelines for FTSE heavyweight sectors, with base metals down on China-growth worries and oil still in the doldrums on perceived weak demand,” Mike van Dulken and Artjom Hatsaturjants at Accendo Markets said in a note. RBS (RBS.L) fell 5 percent, touching its lowest since February 2017, after the UK bank warned of economic uncertainty and its profit lagged forecasts. The lender said it had taken a 100 million pound ($128 million) impairment provision to account for greater uncertainty.  “The latest results are a bit of a curate’s egg,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “The headline numbers are ahead of expectations, but this is largely a matter of one-off items toppling onto the right side of the scales. “The core business is looking pretty stagnant, at best, and the bank’s interest margin is heading in the wrong direction, despite rising rates,” Khalaf added.     Rolls Royce (RR.L) was rocked by news it will produce fewer engines for Airbus’ (AIR.PA) new A330neo jet than expected, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent to 1-1/2 year lows. It recovered some ground to close down 3.5 percent. Calls for Europe to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi added pressure to the defence sector.        Mining, metals and oil companies were also among the biggest losers, with Evraz (EVRE.L) topping the loser board with a 6.3-percent drop and oil major BP (BP.L) down 1.4 percent, tracking broader commodity prices lower. Among midcaps, Travis Perkins (TPK.L) and Babcock (BAB.L) were hit after LafargeHolcim’s (LHN.S), the world’s largest cement maker, became the latest building materials company to warn of higher costs. Pensions provider Just Group (JUSTJ.L) jumped 8 percent, extending recent gains, after UK regulators on Thursday delayed the introduction of new rules on equity release mortgages.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A High Court judge has denied a Serious Fraud Office application to charge Barclays (BARC.L) over its 2008 capital raising, potentially ending the biggest remaining legal headache facing the British bank over its conduct during the financial crisis. A British court dismissed the charges against the bank last May in a decision that the SFO, which prosecutes financial crimes, said it would seek to reverse by applying to the High Court to reinstate them. “The High Court has today denied the SFO’s application to reinstate in respect of all of the charges. As a result, all of the charges remain dismissed,” Barclays said in a statement. The SFO said on Friday it could not comment on the decision, citing reporting restrictions on other cases related to the 2008 fundraising which are set to continue. Barclays denied the SFO’s allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped it avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis. Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as “financial assistance”. The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions represents a major setback for the SFO, which has long faced criticism from British politicians. And the verdict deals a decisive blow to the unprecedented, criminal prosecution of a major bank over events which took place at the height of the credit crisis. The SFO’s attempt to try and reinstate the charges, once they were knocked back by a court, was an unusual strategy and some lawyers said they were not surprised it had failed. Sam Tate, a partner at RPC in London, said he did not think it unreasonable of the SFO to have attempted the move and noted it was now for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other authorities to continue their parallel investigations. “I wouldn’t describe this as a huge setback. It reaffirms a decision already made by a lower court and it was an unusual process,” Tate said. Separately, four former Barclays bankers face a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, in a trial due to start in January. Barclays still faces other legal and regulatory problems related to the 2008 fundraising. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the case. British businesswoman Amanda Staveley has a separate $1 billion civil lawsuit against Barclays over the same fundraising.

2019-02-08,"WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Meghan Markle’s couture wedding dress goes on display at Windsor Castle on Friday in a new exhibition about her May nuptials to Britain’s Prince Harry. The white, sleek long-sleeved gown with a boat neck was designed by Clare Waight Keller, the British artistic director of French fashion house Givenchy for the May 19 wedding in Windsor, an event watched by millions around the world. Markle, now known as the Duchess of Sussex, also wore a five-meter (16 ft) veil decorated with hand-embroidered flowers which paid tribute to the 53 countries of the Commonwealth, as well as a diamond tiara borrowed from Queen Elizabeth for her big day. The full outfit, including Meghan’s shoes, has been put on display in a large glass box alongside an identical version of Prince Harry’s wedding attire, a frockcoat uniform of the Household Cavalry, inside Windsor Castle’s Grand Reception Room - one of the rooms used for the wedding celebrations. “This is a unique opportunity to see these outfits...worn on such a special day and actually in the surroundings where they were worn here at Windsor Castle,” Caroline de Guitaut, senior curator of decorative arts at the Royal Collection Trust, said. Visitors can see the veil’s intricate embroidery up close as well as listen to the couple talk about preparing for their wedding day through an audio device, which also has a recording of Waight Keller describing her work on the bride’s dress.  “Their Royal Highnesses have been very involved in the preparation for this exhibition,” de Guitaut said. “They...wanted to be interviewed...so that they could tell the visitors all about the planning that went into their day.” Also on display are the bridesmaid and pageboy outfits worn by Harry’s niece and nephew, Princess Charlotte and Prince George. Charlotte’s dress was also designed by Waight Keller while George’s outfit is a miniature replica of Harry’s uniform.  “A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex” opens on Friday and runs at Windsor Castle until January.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) on Friday posted an unexpected profit increase as strong demand in Europe helped shield it from rising fuel prices that have hit the industry. IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, beat consensus expectations of a fall in profits even as jet fuel prices increased beyond what the airline group had planned for. “The fuel price is certainly higher than we had expected ... (but) the general trading environment is good,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh said, noting Europe had been especially strong without saying what destinations had been in particular demand. “We’ve seen high oil prices before, and we know what to do.” Shares IAG rose 2.2 percent to 600.56 pence by 0807 GMT, making them the top gainers in the FTSE 100 .FTSE and extending a rebound from Tuesday's 18-month low of 547p. “Not only is the group adding more flights, it’s managing to fill more seats on its planes while also getting a benefit from pricing,” said George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  “Take out the impact of higher fuel prices and unfavourable currency moves, and it becomes clear IAG is doing some pretty impressive work on underlying operating improvements,” Salmon added. IAG said profit for 2018 would increase by 200 million euros (178 million pounds), having previously said it would show an increase for the year without giving a figure. Third-quarter operating profit before exceptional items reached 1.46 billion euros, ahead of a company-compiled consensus of 1.43 billion and up from 1.45 billion last year. Fuel unit costs for the three months to Sept. 30 rose 15 percent at constant currency rates, IAG said, echoing comments on Thursday by budget airline Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), which rebuffed a bid from IAG earlier in the year. Norwegian, which competes with British Airways on transatlantic routes, posted results which lagged estimates due to the higher fuel price. Fellow Nordic airline Primera Air went bust earlier this month and Walsh said it was no surprise that smaller airlines which can’t hedge their fuel costs had gone out of business. “I would expect to see more of this during the remaining part of this year and going into the early part of next year, given the fuel price where it is,” Walsh said. He said there was nothing new to say in relation to IAG’s interest in Norwegian. In August he said IAG remained interested in buying Norwegian but there were no active discussions. Walsh also declined comment when asked to estimate the cost of a theft of customer data at BA after IAG said on Thursday hackers may have stolen the personal information of a further 185,000 customers, taking the total number of payment cards potentially affected by the hack to 429,000. 8 Reporting by Alistair Smout; Additional reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Paul Sandle and David Holmes",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iag-results/ba-owner-iag-withstands-fuel-price-pressures-to-beat-profit-forecasts-idUKKCN1N00LU,2019-02-08,,BA owner IAG withstands fuel price pressures to beat profit forecasts

The king assured Putin that the Saudi government was determined to hold the guilty parties accountable and to make sure “they receive their punishment”. The death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has sparked global outrage and mushroomed into a crisis for the world’s top oil exporter and strategic ally of the West. The Kremlin said in its statement on Thursday that Putin and king Salman had addressed the situation related to the “Khashoggi case” during their phone conversation.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed back on Thursday after a massive sell-off the day previous, with strong earnings encouraging investors to venture into risky bets again, while the dollar gained on the euro. Oil prices were bolstered by the rebound in equities markets and as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister signaled major producers may need to intervene in crude markets to support prices. The euro fell to a two month low after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi reaffirmed that the bank’s 2.6-trillion euro ($2.97 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, even though the economic outlook has darkened and political turmoil looms in Italy. While equity investors were reassured by positive earnings from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and strong advertising revenues from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) they also voiced some caution about whether the broader pullback was over. “You can’t look at it blindly and say earnings are turning the market around and we’re all clear. A lot of people are skeptical of any kind of action in the market right now, especially to the upside. That’s why volume is light today,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Even the most optimistic investors were cautious. “Quarterly reports are providing better-than-expected earnings, revenue and guidance. That triple play is instilling confidence in investors,” said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC. But, he added, “We need other drivers to provide stability to the market after this meaningful sell-off we’ve seen in the last five weeks.” Investors are looking for further strong results for the remaining two thirds of S&P 500 companies that are yet to report, as well as a resumption of share buybacks by companies that have already reported.  They are also awaiting third-quarter U.S. GDP data that is due out on Friday. If the reading is lower than expectations investors will worry about economic growth but if it is much higher they will fear a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes, Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 401.13 points, or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.55, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 49.47 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.57 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co’s third-quarter net profit plunged by a shocking two-thirds, hit by a $440 million (342.01 million pounds) one-off charge related to U.S. recalls and sending its shares tumbling to near nine-year-lows on Thursday.  The unexpected costs relating to Hyundai’s engine recalls came on the heels of mounting U.S. pressure to respond to reports of vehicles catching fires.  The recall headache adds to a plethora of issues at Hyundai, which had counted on new SUVs to engineer a recovery following five straight years of annual profit declines stemming from weak sales in its key U.S. and Chinese markets.  Quarterly net profit slid to 269 billion won (183.92 million pounds), the lowest in more than seven years and well below a SmartEstimate of 831 billion won, according to Refinitiv data. SmartEstimates give more weight to recent estimates by analysts who are more consistently accurate. Operating profit slumped 76 percent while sales rose 1 percent to 24.4 trillion won.     Shares in the automaker finished down 6 percent, their lowest closing level since March 2010. At one point they fell as much as 12.4 percent, their lowest since January 2010. Shares of affiliate Kia Motors, which will report its earnings on Friday, slumped 5.9 percent.   A U.S. consumer advocate group this month called for an expansion of the engine-related recall, which was announced by the South Korean duo last year, citing a surge in fire complaints. A U.S. senate committee asked Hyundai and Kia executives to testify at a hearing next month. A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns about engine defects to the U.S. safety regulator, which has subsequently launched a probe into the timeliness of the recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.   “Transportation authorities in the U.S. and other countries are taking a more rigorous and detailed look at quality matters than in the past,” Lee Hyang, head of Global Quality Strategy Division, said during a conference call with analysts.  “We are continuing company-wide efforts to minimise additional quality problems going forward,” he added. The one-off charge will also cover expenses related to new technology aimed at detecting engine defects that will be used in upcoming and some existing models. “The one-off costs were too big, and the question is whether the costs will be just one-off or whether there will be more to come,” said Jung Yong-jin, an auto analyst at Shinhan Investment & Securities, adding that he did not expect a meaningful earnings recovery in the near term. Hyundai also said sharp drops in currencies of emerging markets such as Turkey and Russia weighed on its bottom line. Hyundai said escalating trade wars and slowing growth in China and the United States cloud the industry outlook, but predicted its profit would rebound in the fourth quarter, helped by new SUVs. It did not elaborate. Hyundai had been counting on its new Santa Fe SUV to turn around its flagging fortunes in the United States where it had missed out on a SUV boom due to its heavy reliance on sedans. But its U.S. retail sales rose only 1 percent in the third quarter. Sales in China declined 6 percent, despite an agreement between Seoul and Beijing last year to normalise ties, putting a diplomatic row that had hit sales of South Korean goods behind them.     The automaker said Santa Fe sales should increase gradually. “The initial response for the Santa Fe is positive,” said Koo Zayong, head of investor relations, adding the model will raise the utilisation rate of its U.S. factory to above 90 percent in the fourth quarter from the second-quarter’s 86 percent. Hyundai is also bracing for a decision from the United States as to whether it will slap tariffs on imports of vehicles and vehicle parts. South Korea has argued it should get tariff exemptions, saying it has already made concessions in the auto sector after a bilateral deal was revised last month.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its policy unchanged as expected on Thursday, staying on course to end bond purchases by the end of December and to raise rates sometime after next summer. With inflation rebounding and growth on a five-year run, the ECB has been removing stimulus for much of this year, even if more recent growth indicators appear to show that the expansion is running out of steam and risks to the outlook are mounting.  But with the bank having already exhausted much of its firepower the threshold for any extension of its stimulus is high, requiring a major shock rather than the gradual slowdown that has characterized this year. The bank also made no change to its policy guidance, first formulated in June and kept broadly unchanged through several meetings.  “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,” it said, repeating its guidance. Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi’s 1230 GMT news conference, at which he is likely to discuss the broader economic outlook and will be questioned about Italy’s budget fight with the European Commission. Investors will also look to see if Draghi maintains the ECB’s long-standing stance that growth risks are broadly balanced or takes a more dovish view given a string of disappointing data.  With Thursday’s decision, the ECB’s rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at -0.40 percent. The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00 percent while the rate on the marginal lending facility — the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks — remains at 0.25 percent.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - BT Group Plc (BT.L) appointed Worldpay (WP.N) co-CEO Philip Jansen as its new chief executive on Thursday, ending months of speculation about who would be chosen to tackle a host of problems at Britain’s biggest broadband and mobile provider.  Several media outlets had flagged Jansen as frontrunner for the job after the board and investors lost confidence in his predecessor Gavin Patterson earlier this year. Jansen, currently co-chief executive at payment processing firm Worldpay, previously worked with Patterson at Telewest and both men also worked for consumer giant Procter & Gamble. Jansen, 51, has been Worldpay CEO for five years and led the business through Britain’s biggest financial technology IPO. He will be appointed to the board as an executive director on Jan. 1 before taking over from Patterson at the start of February. Worldpay announced in September that Jansen would step down at the end of this year when Charles Drucker would become the company’s sole CEO. BT shares were down over one percent at 247.6 pence at 0748 GMT. Separately, the company said former Vodafone and O2 executive Matthew Key would join the BT board as a non-executive director immediately. Patterson ran BT for almost five years and announced some 13,000 job cuts earlier this year as the former fixed-line monopoly struggled with intense competition, an underperforming IT services unit, a huge pension deficit and criticism of its broadband plans. A fraud left a 530-million-pound black hole in the company’s Italian business, forcing Patterson to cut profit targets in 2017. Announcing it would replace him in June, Chairman Jan du Plessis said the board was confident in Patterson’s strategy but doubted his ability to deliver it.  Patterson won plaudits when he took BT into TV sports, going head-to-head with rival Sky SKYB.L in Premier League soccer rights, and back into mobile by buying market leader EE, sending shares to a 14-year high in 2015. But a failure to hit a revenue target and a forecast of no growth in profit for the next couple of years sent BT shares to six-year lows in May and they are now down more than 24 percent since the start of Patterson’s tenure. Jansen will be paid 1.1 million pounds a year along with a cash allowance in lieu of pension of 15 percent of salary and an annual bonus of up to 240 percent of salary subject to performance. Patterson received a total of 2.3 million pounds in the year to the end of March, according to the company’s annual report — basic pay of 997,000 pounds plus a 1.292 million pound bonus. He had missed out on a bonus in the previous year after a number of setbacks.

2019-02-08,"PULAU INDAH, Malaysia (Reuters) - Hundreds of sacks filled with plastic waste from the United States, Britain, South Korea and Spain spill onto the streets of an industrial zone in Pulau Indah, an island town just an hour’s drive from Kuala Lumpur and home to Malaysia’s biggest port.  The stench of burning plastic and fumes from nearly a dozen recycling factories wafts through the neighbourhood, even as more container-loads of plastic waste are unloaded.  Pulau Indah - ironically, the name means “beautiful island” in Malay - is one of many towns in Malaysia where illegal plastic recycling factories have popped up in recent months as the Southeast Asian nation became the top choice for plastic waste exporters from around the world.  The trigger for this dumping deluge was a Chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year, which disrupted the flow of more than 7 million tonnes of plastic scrap a year.  Malaysia quickly became the leading alternative destination, importing nearly half a million tonnes of plastic waste between January and July from just its top 10 source-countries. Dozens of factories have opened up in Malaysia to handle that waste, many without an operating licence, using low-end technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal.  “The situation is getting worse, especially with more and more illegal plastic recycling factories,” Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia’s minister of energy, technology, science, climate change and environment, told parliament last week.  Used plastic is recycled into pellets, which are then used to manufacture other plastic products, but the process comes with pollution risks. Plastic unsuitable for recycling is burnt, which releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. Or it ends up in landfill, potentially contaminating soil and water sources. Yeo said she does not want Malaysia to be the “trash can” for developed nations, but Housing Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin, who oversees the waste management department, told Reuters that the government also does not want to miss out on a business that could be worth billions. Both ministers are members of a government committee studying its options for dealing with the growing pile of plastic waste. In the Pulau Indah industrial zone, Reuters reporters saw nearly a dozen recycling plants, many of them without signboards or company names, though government data shows only two factories in that area have a licence to import plastic waste. One of the bigger ones, Jingye Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, was shut down in August for not having a licence, according to an official notice seen by Reuters. But workers in the factory and others nearby say it reopened within weeks, and when Reuters reporters visited earlier this month, it was operating. Plastic waste was stacked up within the premises and all along the road.  The factory supervisor declined to comment. Company records show Jingye was set up in Malaysia in October 2017, three months after China said it would ban imports of foreign waste from 2018. Reuters could not reach the owners of the factory and no contact details were listed in records. One worker in the industrial zone, who did not want to be identified, said there were as many as eight illegal factories in the zone and many openly burned plastic that cannot be recycled.  “Every night they burn. I see black smoke at night, so I go over and ask him ‘why are you trying to kill me?’ They ignore me,” he said. In the nearby district of Kuala Langat, authorities found 41 factories operating illegally, many of them run by Chinese companies, according to Housing Minister Zuraida. Around 30 were shut down by authorities in the last three months after residents complained of open burning of plastic and health complications.  It is unclear how the illegal factories are sourcing plastic waste. Zuraida said some of the 95 companies that have a permit to import and recycle such waste are subcontracting to illegal factories as they lack the capacity to handle such volumes.    Malaysia’s imports of plastic waste from its 10 biggest source-countries jumped to 456,000 tonnes between January and July, versus 316,600 tonnes purchased in all of 2017 and 168,500 tonnes in 2016. The United States, the world’s top exporter of plastic waste, sent 178,238 tonnes of such waste to Malaysia between January and July, nearly twice as much as it sent to second top destination, Thailand, according to the United Nations’ trade database and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries.   Britain, another big plastic waste exporter, sends a quarter of its waste to Malaysia, also more than any other country. Environment Minister Yeo estimated that the plastic recycling industry would earn Malaysia 3.5 billion ringgit (649.89 million pounds) this year. Zuraida said she planned to introduce new rules soon that will make it harder for factories to qualify for an import licence.  “I understand plastic recycling is quite lucrative. So I am also thinking should we miss this economic opportunity? This is something the committee will study,” Zuraida told Reuters. If such an option is pursued, Malaysia would do so on strict terms, require high-end, green technology and allow factories to operate only in heavy industrial areas, she said. The factories are currently located haphazardly, including near or within residential areas. In Kuala Langat, southwest of Kuala Lumpur, a massive recycling factory nestled between palm plantations was shut down three months ago. But 10-foot (3 metre) tall towers of plastic waste - mostly consumer packaging material from the United States, Britain, France, Netherlands, Germany and Australia - were still piled in the front yard. A large plot of land next to the factory has been turned into a dumping site for scrap. (Click tmsnrt.rs/2OKAfWJ for an interactive graphic) Reporting by A.

U.S. data showed a decline in sales of new single-family homes to a near two-year low in September and numbers for the prior three months were revised lower.

2019-02-08,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Wednesday that company moderators during the last quarter removed 8.7 million user images of child nudity with the help of previously undisclosed software that automatically flags such photos. The machine learning tool rolled out over the last year identifies images that contain both nudity and a child, allowing increased enforcement of Facebook’s ban on photos that show minors in a sexualized context. A similar system also disclosed on Wednesday catches users engaged in “grooming,” or befriending minors for sexual exploitation. Facebook’s global head of safety Antigone Davis told Reuters in an interview that the “machine helps us prioritize” and “more efficiently queue” problematic content for the company’s trained team of reviewers. The company is exploring applying the same technology to its Instagram app. Under pressure from regulators and lawmakers, Facebook has vowed to speed up removal of extremist and illicit material. Machine learning programs that sift through the billions of pieces of content users post each day are essential to its plan.  Machine learning is imperfect, and news agencies and advertisers are among those that have complained this year about Facebook’s automated systems wrongly blocking their posts. Davis said the child safety systems would make mistakes but users could appeal. “We’d rather err on the side of caution with children,” she said. Facebook’s rules for years have banned even family photos of lightly clothed children uploaded with “good intentions,” concerned about how others might abuse such images. Before the new software, Facebook relied on users or its adult nudity filters to catch child images. A separate system blocks child pornography that has previously been reported to authorities. Facebook has not previously disclosed data on child nudity removals, though some would have been counted among the 21 million posts and comments it removed in the first quarter for sexual activity and adult nudity. Shares of Facebook fell 5 percent on Wednesday. Facebook said the program, which learned from its collection of nude adult photos and clothed children photos, has led to more removals. It makes exceptions for art and history, such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of a naked girl fleeing a Vietnam War napalm attack. The child grooming system evaluates factors such as how many people have blocked a particular user and whether that user quickly attempts to contact many children, Davis said. Michelle DeLaune, chief operating officer at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), said the organization expects to receive about 16 million child porn tips worldwide this year from Facebook and other tech companies, up from 10 million last year.  With the increase, NCMEC said it is working with Facebook to develop software to decide which tips to assess first. Still, DeLaune acknowledged that a crucial blind spot is encrypted chat apps and secretive “dark web” sites where much of new child pornography originates.  Encryption of messages on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, for example, prevents machine learning from analyzing them. DeLaune said NCMEC would educate tech companies and “hope they use creativity” to address the issue.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May received a show of support from her Conservative Party on Wednesday at a meeting in parliament, shifting the focus away from talk of an imminent leadership challenge over her Brexit strategy. May has angered both supporters of Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers since failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week by raising the possibility of extending a post-Brexit transition period to help ease the deadlocked negotiations. But her arrival at the packed meeting was greeted with cheers and some of those who heard her speak said it had gone well. Other attendees complained the event had been heavily stage managed to distract from their dissatisfaction. May had asked to address the powerful “1922 Committee” after persistent criticism over the direction of the Brexit talks.  “She’s brilliantly united the party ... well at least for tonight,” said one pro-Brexit lawmaker who attended the meeting. With just over five months to go until Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU on March 29, May’s Brexit negotiations have stalled over a disagreement on a fallback plan for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Many business leaders and investors fear internal party politics could scupper an agreement, thrusting the world’s fifth largest economy into a “no-deal” Brexit they say would spook markets and clog up the arteries of trade. Indeed, sterling has already weakened in recent days over the prospect of a leadership challenge. “People spoke very freely to her about their concerns but a lot of people came back to the fact that they really wanted her to realise that they backed her in delivering for the country and for government,” said former interior minister Amber Rudd as she left the meeting. An Ipsos MORI poll on Wednesday showed a record 78 percent of voters lacked confidence in May to get a good deal from Brussels, compared with 70 percent in September.  “And yet, the public don’t put all the blame at her door – and nor is there much evidence that they would have much more confidence in anyone else,” said Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI. Many Conservative Party lawmakers are wary of toppling a leader on the eve of Britain’s most significant political and economic move since World War Two. Many also fear an election could bring the opposition Labour Party into power. “There is an appetite among the majority of the party to pull together because the risks are too high,” said another lawmaker who attended the meeting but spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ever since losing her party its majority in parliament with a botched bet on a 2017 snap election, May has faced talk of a leadership challenge.  A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the 1922 Committee to demand such a vote. The number of letters held by the committee chairman is not made public. The Sunday Times newspaper said 46 had now been sent and the BBC’s political editor said on Monday that the 48 number had not yet been reached.  But, with the Brexit clock ticking down and little sign of a plan to satisfy her critics, there was a change of tone in the British media this week, upping the ante before the meeting. Some newspapers carried unusually bloodthirsty language by unidentified opponents. One said May was entering “the killing zone”, while another said May should “bring her own noose” to the meeting. Lawmakers said that language crossed a line for many Conservatives and had been a point of common concern for those speaking in the meeting.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Saudi authorities staged the “worst cover-up ever” in the killing of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi this month, as the United States vowed to revoke the visas of some of those believed to be responsible.  Trump spoke hours after Turkey’s president, Tayyip Erdogan, dismissed Saudi efforts to blame Khashoggi’s death on rogue operatives. Erdogan urged Riyadh to search “from top to bottom” to uncover those behind Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, an incident that has sparked global outrage and strained relations between Riyadh and Washington. For Saudi Arabia’s allies, the question will be whether they believe that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. Trump said the killing and subsequent cover-up by Saudi Arabia were “a total fiasco.” “There should have never been an execution or a cover-up, because it should have never happened,” Trump told reporters. He said he had spoken on Monday with the crown prince who denied having anything to do with Khashoggi’s killing. Earlier, Trump said the Khashoggi matter was handled badly by Saudi officials. “Bad deal, should have never been thought of. Somebody really messed up. And they had the worst cover-up ever,” Trump told reporters at the White House.     Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, was a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist. Trump’s comments in recent days have ranged from threatening Saudi Arabia with “very severe” consequences and mentioning possible economic sanctions, to more conciliatory remarks highlighting the country’s role as a U.S. ally against Iran and Islamist militants, as well as a major purchaser of U.S. arms. Trump did not give his views on who was ultimately responsible. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States had identified some of the Saudi government and security officials it believed were involved in Khashoggi’s murder and would take appropriate actions including revoking U.S. visas. The U.S. State Department said 21 Saudis would have their visas revoked or be made ineligible for U.S. visas. Another official said the vast majority of the group had U.S. visas. “As we continue to develop our understanding of the individuals that were responsible for this, not only those who executed it but those who were connected to it, the world should know that we intend to hold those individuals accountable when we develop this fact set,” Pompeo told reporters. Pompeo also said the State Department was looking into whether sanctions could be applicable for those found to be involved. “These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States,” Pompeo said, although he emphasized as have other senior U.S. officials, the importance of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. “Neither the president nor I are happy with this situation.” The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on the U.S. measures. As the crisis unfolded over the past three weeks, Saudi Arabia changed its tune on Khashoggi. Riyadh initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi’s fate before saying on Saturday he was killed in a fight in the consulate, an account met with skepticism from several Western governments, straining their relations with the world’s biggest oil exporter. Saudi Arabia has detained 18 people and dismissed five senior government officials as part of an investigation into Khashoggi’s death. One of those fired includes Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide who ran social media for Prince Mohammed. According to two intelligence sources, Qahtani ran Khashoggi’s killing by giving orders over Skype. Turkish security sources say that when Khashoggi entered the consulate, he was seized by 15 Saudi intelligence operatives who had flown in on two jets just hours before. Erdogan on Tuesday stopped short of mentioning the crown prince who some U.S. lawmakers suspect ordered the killing.  “The Saudi administration has taken an important step by admitting to the murder. From now on, we expect them to uncover all those responsible for this matter from top to bottom and make them face the necessary punishments,” Erdogan said in a speech in parliament. “From the person who gave the order, to the person who carried it out, they must all be brought to account,” Turkey’s president said. Turkish sources have said that authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting the killing. Erdogan made no reference to any audio recording.      A Saudi Cabinet meeting chaired by King Salman said Riyadh would hold to account those responsible for the killing and those who failed in their duties, whoever they were. Turkish investigators searched a Saudi consulate vehicle in Istanbul that contained two suitcases and other items, according to broadcaster CNN Turk. It was not clear what was in the suitcases. Trump said he would work with the U.S. Congress to determine the U.S. response to the Khashoggi matter. “In terms of what we ultimately do, I’m going to leave it very much - in conjunction with me - up to Congress,” Trump said, adding he would like a bipartisan recommendation.     CIA Director Gina Haspel, in Turkey to investigate the death of Khashoggi, has sought to hear the purported audio recording of his torture and murder, four sources familiar with her mission told Reuters on Tuesday. A host of Western executives and governments have pulled out of a high-profile Saudi investment summit that started on Tuesday because of the Khashoggi affair.         Erdogan said the killing was planned from when Khashoggi, 59, first went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Sept. 28 to obtain documents necessary for his marriage. He was told he would need to return later to collect the documents.     A day before Khashoggi’s death, agents arrived from overseas and began to scout locations, including the Belgrad Forest near Istanbul and the city of Yalova to its south, Erdogan said. Police have searched both areas for evidence of Khashoggi’s remains, Reuters has reported. On the day Khashoggi arrived for his appointment and was later killed, the hard disk in the consulate’s camera system was removed, Erdogan said.  “Covering up a savage murder like this will only hurt the human conscience. We expect the same sensitivity from all parties, primarily the Saudi Arabian leadership,” he said. “We have strong signs that the murder was the result of a planned operation, not a spontaneous development.” Reporting by Jeff Mason in Washington and Gulsen Solaker in Ankara; Additional reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu in Ankara, Ezgi Erkoyun, Daren Butler, Ali Kucukgocmen and Sarah Dadouch in Istanbul and Jonathan Landay and Susan Heavey in Washington; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Yara Bayoumy, Will Dunham and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-khashoggi-turkey/trump-says-saudis-staged-worst-cover-up-ever-on-khashoggi-u-s-revokes-visas-of-some-saudis-idUKKCN1MX1A3,2019-02-08,"President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Saudi authorities staged the ""worst cover-up ever"" in the killing of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi this month, as the United States vowed to revoke the visas of some of those believed to be responsible.",Trump says Saudis staged 'worst cover-up ever' on Khashoggi; U.S. revokes visas of some Saudis
2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia would not have murdered prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi without American protection, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday Saudi authorities staged the “worst cover-up ever” in the killing of Khashoggi in Turkey this month, as Washington vowed to revoke the visas of some of those believed to be responsible. “No one would imagine that in today’s world and a new century that we would witness such an organised murder and a system would plan out such a heinous murder,” Rouhani said, according to IRNA.  “I don’t think that a country would dare commit such a crime without the protection of America.” Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 has triggered global outrage. Saudi Arabia initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi’s fate before saying on Saturday he was killed in a fight in the consulate, an account met with scepticism from several Western governments.  Iran and Saudi Arabia are regional rivals and have supported opposing sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen and different political factions in Iraq and Lebanon.  U.S. protection has allowed Saudi Arabia to carry out bombings against civilians in Yemen’s war, Rouhani said, according to IRNA. “If there was no American protection, would the people of Yemen still have faced the same brutal bombing?” Rouhani said. Rouhani also called on Turkey’s government to conduct an impartial investigation into Khashoggi’s “unprecedented” murder. Separately, Rouhani said that Iran would “defeat” new American sanctions targeting its oil sector, according to the IRIB news agency. Washington plans to impose the sanctions from Nov. 4 with the aim of stopping Iran’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and bringing Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile programme.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on Wednesday, and the two discussed the steps needed to bring to light all aspects of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a presidential source said. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and a U.S. resident, disappeared three weeks ago after a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Riyadh, which initially denied knowledge of his whereabouts, has since said he died in a “fistfight”. It later blamed Khashoggi’s death on a “rogue operation”. The journalist was a critic of the crown prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Erdogan has said Turkey will not let the killers escape justice, not matter how highly placed they were.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s central bank governor said the kingdom will not penalise foreign banks that boycotted an investment conference in Riyadh because of the fallout from the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He also reiterated the country’s commitment to defend its currency peg to the dollar after some recent weakness. Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) Governor Ahmed al-Kholifey, speaking in an interview with Al Arabiya TV on Wednesday, said that institutions that pulled out of the Saudi conference will still be able to apply for and obtain banking licenses to operate in the kingdom. More than a dozen foreign banks have licenses to operate branches in Saudi Arabia, battling for business resulting from the kingdom’s efforts to itself off reliance on oil revenues. But U.S. and European reaction to Saudi Arabia’s account of the death of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi is threatening to smother some of the enthusiasm among some Western banks for opportunities in the kingdom. “We, at the central bank, deal in complete professional manner whether with local or international banks,” al-Kholifey said when asked if the banks that decided not to participate in the event will be penalized. Saudi Arabia is holding this week in Riyadh a large investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative, despite boycotts by Western political figures, international bankers and executives. Many Western banks and other companies, fearful of losing business such as fees from arranging deals for Saudi Arabia’s $250 billion (193 billion pounds) wealth fund, sent lower-level executives to the event even as their top people stayed away. The governor also reiterated the country’s commitment to defend the Saudi riyal’s peg to the dollar, adding that the current pressure to the peg was much lower than in the past when oil prices crashed.  The riyal SAR=, which sank to a two-year low of 3.7526 against the U.S. dollar earlier this month because of concern that the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi could hurt foreign investment in Saudi Arabia, has recovered some of the losses and on Wednesday stood at 3.7511.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Washington will press ahead with a plan to quit a landmark nuclear arms control pact despite objections from Russia and some European countries, senior U.S. official John Bolton said on Tuesday, after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. Bolton had a 90-minute meeting in the Kremlin with Putin which resulted in an agreement for the Russian leader to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in Paris next month, their first meeting since a July summit in Helsinki. But the Moscow talks appeared to yield no breakthrough over Trump’s stated desire for Washington to leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF), a step Moscow has decried as dangerous and many European countries have warned could reignite a Cold War-style arms race.   “There’s a new strategic reality out there,” Bolton, who is National Security Advisor to Trump, told a news conference, adding that the Cold War-era treaty did not address new missile threats from countries such as China, Iran and North Korea, and was therefore redundant.   “In terms of filing the formal notice of withdrawal, that has not been filed but it will be filed in due course,” he said, suggesting it was a process that could take several months.  Moscow has warned Washington it will be forced to respond in kind to restore the military balance if Trump carries through with his threat to quit the INF treaty, a 1987 agreement that eliminated all short- and intermediate-range land-based nuclear and conventional missiles held by both countries in Europe.   Putin used the start of the meeting with Bolton to take the White House to task over what he said were a series of unprovoked U.S. steps against Moscow. But Bolton told reporters afterwards Russian missiles were a threat and signalled Washington would ignore Russian objections to its exit plans. “The problem is there are Russian INF violations in Europe now,” Bolton told reporters, repeating an allegation Moscow denies. “The threat is not America’s INF withdrawal from the treaty. The threat is Russian missiles already deployed.” He said Russia had first illegally tested a land-based cruise missile in 2008 and described its violations of the treaty as “long and deep”. Russia in turn accuses Washington of violating the same treaty, something it denies. Bolton has said the treaty is outdated because other countries remain free to make intermediate-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles while the United States finds its hands tied. He noted that previous efforts to expand the treaty to include other countries had come to nothing.  Putin made an acerbic reference to the U.S. coat of arms at the start of his meeting with Bolton. “We barely respond to any of your steps but they keep on coming,” he jokily complained to Bolton.  “On the coat of the arms of the United States there’s an eagle holding 13 arrows in one talon and an olive branch in the other. My question is whether your eagle has gobbled up all the olives leaving only the arrows?” Bolton quipped that he had not brought any olives. Before the talks, a Kremlin spokesman said the INF treaty had its weak points, but that the U.S. approach of talking about leaving it without proposing a replacement was dangerous. But Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, speaking to reporters after the talks finished, sounded a conciliatory note, saying that Moscow viewed Bolton’s visit as a sign that Washington wanted to continue dialogue on the issue. He said Moscow wanted the same thing. Ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, now 87 and an original signatory to the treaty, has warned that unravelling the pact could have catastrophic consequences. Countries such as Poland have, however, backed Trump’s move. Trump’s withdrawal announcement is causing particular concern in Europe which was the main beneficiary of the INF treaty as a result of the removal of Pershing and U.S. cruise missiles from Europe and of Soviet SS-20 missiles from the European part of the then Soviet Union.  Without the treaty, some European countries fear that Washington might deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe again and that Russia might move to deploy such missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad which would once again turn Europe into a potential nuclear battlefield.          Bolton said Washington was “a long way” from making any such deployments in Europe and said grim warnings about the dangerous consequences of Washington quitting the treaty were wide of the mark and reminded him of similarly hollow warnings when the United States left the Cold War-era Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in 2002.  “It was not true then and it will not be true now,” he said.

A Reuters witness said a Saudi team accompanied the Turkish investigators as they carried out the search in a car park where the vehicle was found in Istanbul’s Sultangazi district on Monday. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi agents on Oct. 2.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shares sank fell more than 1 percent to their lowest since March on Tuesday as a broad sell-off hit stocks across Europe, caused by a toxic mix of weak results, jitters over geopolitical tensions, Brexit, Italy’s budget and cooling markets overnight. The FTSE 100 .FTSE, on track for its worst monthly performance in a decade, was down 1.1 percent by 0941 GMT, after breaching technical support at 7,000 on the open. European shares fell to their lowest levels in nearly two years after a disappointing batch of third-quarter results, particularly in the tech sector. Pressure also returned after Asia’s rally cooled amid renewed fears about the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute, geopolitical tensions and the strength of earnings as peak earnings season arrives. “We’re back to where we were. We had a week of respite and now the market’s resumed its focus on negative factors more than anything else,” said Mike van Dulken, analyst at Accendo Markets. St James’s Place (SJP.L) sank to its lowest since December 2016 after results revealed a slowdown of inflows in the third quarter, even as the wealth manager reported funds under management reached a record. Shares were down 4.3 percent. Net inflow of funds rose 15 percent in the first nine months, compared with 21 percent growth in the first half. “Q3 must have been a lot slower to average out. The growth of inflows in the third quarter must have slowed considerably,” van Dulken said. “It all plays into consumer and investor uncertainty,” he said, pointing to weakness in Hargreaves Lansdowne (HRGV.L) and Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (SMT.L), which was the third biggest loser on the main board, down 4.5 percent.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland’s government on Tuesday approved the exhumation and reburial of the decades-old remains of hundreds of babies left in unmarked graves at the site of a former church-run home for unwed mothers in the western town of Tuam. Findings last year by an official inquiry that “significant quantities” of remains were stored in underground chambers horrified Ireland, reviving anguish over how women and children were once treated at state-backed Catholic institutions. Almost 800 children could be interred in the grounds, according to a local researcher who first brought the issue to light in 2014 by comparing the number of death certificates issued to recorded burials at the site. The infant mortality rate at Church-run institutions was significantly higher than in wider Irish society at that time, with death certificates mostly blaming infections like measles, gastroenteritis, bronchitis, tuberculosis and pneumonia. Relatives have alleged the babies were mistreated because they were born to unmarried women. “Every effort will be made to locate and recover all juvenile remains from the site,” Children’s Minister Katherine Zappone told a news conference, saying the testimony of relatives who had lost relatives at the home will live with her forever. “I am committed to ensuring that all the children interred at this site can have a dignified and respectful burial,” she said.   Run by nuns from the Bon Secours order, the home operated from 1925 to 1961 and was demolished in the 1970s. Remains dated from between 35 foetal weeks and 3 years of age were found at the site which is now an estate of low-rise, modest homes. The Church’s prestige and authority have been greatly diminished over the past three decades by a series of scandals over paedophile priests, abuse at Magdalene laundries, forced adoptions of illegitimate babies and other painful issues. During Pope Francis’ recent visit to Ireland where he begged forgiveness for the multitude of abuses suffered at the hand of the church, he was handed a letter by Zappone calling for a  substantial contribution to the cost of action at the site. She said on Tuesday that the Vatican had not yet responded but that the Bon Secours order had offered a voluntary contribution of 2.5 million euros towards the estimated 6 to 13 billion euro cost.  Described as a “chamber of horrors” last year by then prime minister Enda Kenny, excavating the site would not be easy, Zaponne said, first requiring legislation and then a phased approach that she was unable to put a timeline on. She also said that Ireland must prepare itself for “further truths to come to the fore” next year when a wider inquiry into the so-called “mother-and-baby homes” reports on institutions where tens of thousands of unmarried pregnant women, including rape victims, were sent to give birth.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) and Schroders (SDR.L) said on Tuesday they had struck a multi-billion pound wealth management deal aimed at changing the way Britons save and invest. Schroders, Britain’s second largest listed fund management group by assets under management, and Lloyds, its biggest retail lender, said they would launch a financial planning joint venture after confirming earlier this month they were in talks. The deal, the highest profile of its kind between a British bank and fund manager, combines Schroders’ investment offering with Lloyds’ 27 million-strong customer base and wide distribution network.  It revives a traditional partnership model between banks and insurers that has dominated in mainland Europe for decades.   “The aim is to become a top three UK financial planning business within five years,” said Antonio Lorenzo, director of insurance and wealth at Lloyds and chief executive of its subsidiary Scottish Widows.  The bank launched a renewed push into insurance and wealth earlier this year. It is already a market leader in its core products like mortgages, and the limited opportunity for growth in key markets has helped drag its share price down 17 percent this year.  For Schroders, the deal is likely to boost its ability to sell its broad range of equity and fixed income products to Lloyds customers, and is the latest move in a long-standing plan to diversify its revenues.  “We think this move makes good sense for both parties,”  Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said of the deal, which follows a series of mergers and tie-ups in the asset management sector.   Schroders shares were down 4.2 percent at 2,649 pence at 1540 GMT on Monday afternoon, as the UK’s main stock benchmark, the FTSE 100, fell 1.2 percent. Lloyds shares were flat, down just 0.07 percent to 56.4 pence.  Lloyds’ CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio and Schroders Chief Executive Peter Harrison welcomed the deal, under which Lloyds will own 50.1 percent of the new entity and Schroders 49.9 percent. The venture, whose branding was not outlined in the statement, will be led by a management team compromising representatives from both parties. Lloyds’ Lorenzo will be its chairman, while James Rainbow, Schroders’ co-head of UK intermediary, will be its chief executive.  Schroders also won an 80 billion-pound investment contract from Lloyds, 67 billion of which represents a large part of the 109 billion-pound mandate that Lloyds pulled from previous manager Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA.L) earlier this year. The assets previously managed by SLA are subject to arbitration, after SLA disputed Lloyds’ right to terminate the contract.   However the statement said they will transfer to Schroders whatever the outcome of this process, either once arbitration concludes or when the bank’s contract with SLA expires in March 2022, and remain with the firm for at least five years.  Lloyds has been using negotiations over the mandate to leverage partnerships that support its push into the sector. It also handed 30 billion pounds of the assets to BlackRock in return for an alliance. The joint venture with Schroders, which the firms aim to have in operation by the end of the first half of 2019, will offer a personalised, advice-led service focused on affluent customers, the companies said in a joint statement.    Lloyds will transfer 13 billion pounds of assets and associated advisers from its existing wealth management business to the joint venture, and a further 400 million pounds of its private client assets to Schroders as soon as possible, they said.  Under the deal, Lloyds will also take a 19.9 percent stake in Schroders’ UK wealth management business.  St James’s Place, Britain’s largest standalone listed wealth manager, on Tuesday posted a 4.1 percent rise in third-quarter funds under management to pass 100 billion pounds for the first time.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was still not satisfied with what he has heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey, but did not want to lose investment from Riyadh.   Trump spoke with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, on Sunday. He told reporters on Monday that he has teams in Saudi Arabia and Turkey working on the case and would know more about it after they returned to Washington on Monday night or Tuesday. CIA Director Gina Haspel was travelling to Turkey on Monday to work on the Khashoggi investigation, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. “I am not satisfied with what I’ve heard,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I don’t want to lose all that investment that’s been made in our country. But we’re going to get to the bottom of it.” He later told USA Today that he believed the death was a “plot gone awry.”  Trump has expressed reluctance to punish the Saudis economically, citing the kingdom’s multibillion-dollar purchases of U.S. military equipment and investments in U.S. companies. Prince Mohammed met in Riyadh with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and discussed “the importance of the Saudi-U.S. strategic partnership,” Saudi state media said. Mnuchin’s spokesman said on Twitter the two discussed the Khashoggi investigation as well as Iran sanctions and Saudi economic issues. Mnuchin cancelled his speaking engagement at a high-profile Saudi investment conference on Tuesday, as did two dozen other top speakers. Hundreds of bankers and company executives were still expected to attend the Future Investment Initiative, which aims to help the country curb its economic dependence on oil exports. But Khashoggi’s killing has tarnished an event that last year attracted global business elites and won the moniker “Davos in the Desert.” Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of Prince Mohammed who lived in the United States, disappeared after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage.  Saudi Arabia initially denied knowledge of his fate before saying he had been killed in a fight in the consulate, an explanation that drew scepticism from several Western governments. Following the global outrage prompted by the journalist’s disappearance, Trump’s comments have varied from playing down Riyadh’s role to warning of possible economic sanctions. He has repeatedly highlighted the kingdom’s importance as a U.S. ally and said Prince Mohammed was a strong and passionate leader. For Saudi Arabia’s allies, the question will be whether they believe that Prince Mohammed, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to the 33-year-old prince. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate by Saudi agents. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting the killing of the 59-year-old.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said he will release information about the investigation in a speech on Tuesday. Earlier on Monday, Trump’s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, said in an interview on CNN that he had urged the crown prince to be transparent about Khashoggi and told him “the world is watching” Riyadh’s account of the journalist’s disappearance. Kushner has cultivated a personal relationship with Prince Mohammed and urged Trump to act with caution to avoid upsetting a critical strategic and economic relationship, a senior administration official said. Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Turkey, have pressed Saudi Arabia to provide all the facts. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would not export arms to the kingdom while uncertainty over Khashoggi’s fate persisted. Omer Celik, the spokesman for Erdogan’s AK Party, said that the truth of the case would eventually come out. “We are facing a situation that has been monstrously planned and later tried to be covered up,” he told reporters. “It is a complicated murder.”  On Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said Khashoggi had died in a rogue operation. But some of his comments did not match previous statements from Riyadh, marking yet another shift in the official story. Jubeir said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi had died. That contradicted the public prosecutor’s statement a day earlier that Khashoggi died after a fistfight with people who met him inside the consulate. It also contradicted two Saudi officials’ comments to Reuters that it was a chokehold that killed him. A Saudi official has said that a member of the team dressed in Khashoggi’s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate. Support for that strand of the account appeared to come from footage aired by CNN showing a man dressed as Khashoggi walking around Istanbul. CNN described the images as law enforcement surveillance footage. On Saturday, Saudi state media said King Salman had fired five officials over the killing carried out by a 15-man hit team, including Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide who ran social media for Prince Mohammed. According to two intelligence sources, Qahtani ran Khashoggi’s killing by giving orders over Skype. In Moscow, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said talks were continuing with the Saudis about the incident. “We want to get the truth, and not just talk. First of all, we need to know why he died. Who killed him? We want to get the full lowdown,” Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy quoted Bolton as saying during a visit to Moscow.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. withdrawal from a Cold War-era nuclear arms treaty with Russia could give the Pentagon new options to counter Chinese missile advances but experts warn the ensuing arms race could greatly escalate tensions in the Asia-Pacific. U.S. officials have been warning for years that the United States was being put at a disadvantage by China’s development of increasingly sophisticated land-based missile forces, which the Pentagon could not match thanks to the U.S. treaty with Russia. President Donald Trump has signalled he may soon give the Pentagon a freer hand to confront those advances, if he makes good on threats to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which required elimination of short- and intermediate-range nuclear and conventional missiles. Dan Blumenthal, a former Pentagon official now at the American Enterprise Institute, said a treaty pullout could pave the way for the United States to field easier-to-hide, road-mobile conventional missiles in places like Guam and Japan. That would make it harder for China to consider a conventional first strike against U.S. ships and bases in the region. It could also force Beijing into a costly arms race, forcing China to spend more on missile defences. “It will change the picture fundamentally,” Blumenthal said. Even as Trump has blamed Russian violations of the treaty for his decision, he has also pointed a finger at China. Beijing was not party to the INF treaty and has been fielding new and more deadly missile forces. These include China’s DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a maximum range of 4,000 km (2,500 miles) and which the Pentagon says can threaten U.S. land and sea-based forces as far away as the Pacific island of Guam. It was first fielded in 2016. “If Russia is doing it (developing these missiles) and  China is doing it and we’re adhering to the agreement, that’s unacceptable,” Trump said on Sunday. John Bolton, White House national security advisor, noted that recent Chinese statements suggest it wanted Washington to stay in the treaty. “And that’s perfectly understandable. If I were Chinese, I would say the same thing,” he told the Echo Moskvy radio station. “Why not have the Americans bound, and the Chinese not bound?” U.S. officials have so far relied on other capabilities as a counter-balance to China, like missiles fired from U.S. ships or aircraft. But advocates for a U.S. land-based missile response say that is the best way to deter Chinese use of its muscular land-based missile forces. Kelly Magsamen, who helped craft the Pentagon’s Asian policy under the Obama administration, said China’s ability to work outside of the INF treaty had vexed policymakers in Washington, long before Trump came into office. But she cautioned that any new U.S. policy guiding missile deployments in Asia would need to be carefully coordinated with allies, something that does not appear to have happened yet. Mismanagement of expectations surrounding a U.S. treaty pullout could also unsettle security in the Asia-Pacific, she cautioned. “It’s potentially destabilising,” she said. Experts warn that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse U.S. requests to position missiles there. Abraham Denmark, a former senior Pentagon official under Obama, said Guam, Japan and even Australia were possible locations for U.S. missile deployments. “But there are a lot of alliance questions that appear at first glance to be very tricky,” he cautioned. Still, current and former U.S. officials say Washington is right to focus on China’s missile threat. Harry Harris, who led U.S. military forces in the Pacific before becoming U.S. ambassador to Seoul, said earlier this year that the United States was at a disadvantage. “We have no ground-based (missile) capability that can threaten China because of, among other things, our rigid adherence ... to the treaty,” Harris told a Senate hearing in March, without calling for the treaty to be scrapped.   Asked about Trump’s comments, China’s foreign ministry said a unilateral U.S. withdrawal would have a negative impact and  urged the United States to “think thrice before acting.” “Talking about China on the issue of unilaterally pulling out of the treaty is completely mistaken,” spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May urged restive lawmakers to back her in the final stages of Britain’s exit from the European Union, saying talks were in their most difficult phase even if a deal was close.    After facing some of the fiercest attacks to date over her Brexit plans since again failing to clinch a deal at an EU summit last week, May tried to calm passions in parliament where her strategy has angered eurosceptics and EU supporters alike. “Serving our national interest will demand that we hold our nerve through these last stages of the negotiations, the hardest part of all,” May told parliament. Financial markets seized on the possibility that May could be toppled as prime minister by rebels in her Conservative Party, driving sterling below $1.30 to its lowest since Oct. 4. With just over five months until Britain is scheduled to exit the EU, talks have stalled over a disagreement on the so-called Northern Irish “backstop”, an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland if a future trading relationship is not agreed in time.  But May’s attempt to unlock the talks by considering an extension to a status-quo transition period beyond the current proposed end date of December 2020 has further riled both pro- and anti-EU factions in her deeply split Conservative Party. May again dismissed the EU’s proposed backstop as unacceptable and she set out two options for Britain to choose from: an extension to the transition period, or a temporary UK-EU customs territory which was first outlined earlier this year. May said the EU had made a substantial shift on the latter option. EU sources told Reuters negotiators were looking at ways to promise Britain a customs deal that could stretch Brussels’ Brexit red lines but might break a deadlock.   In an attempt to highlight how much progress has been made in more than a year of talks with the EU, she told parliament the government has reached agreement on everything from Gibraltar to future security over the last three weeks. “Taking all of this together, 95 per cent of the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled,” she said. But the deal - the terms of Britain’s divorce - cannot be signed off until the two sides settle on future management of the border between Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland. British and EU leaders are committed to avoiding obstacles at the border, a crucial aspect of the 1998 Good Friday peace deal that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed. The EU proposal for Northern Ireland to remain in the bloc’s customs union has been rejected by May as it would potentially create barriers to trade with the rest of Britain - something ruled out by Northern Ireland’s DUP party, whose 10 votes in parliament prop up May’s government. At an EU summit in Brussels last week, any agreement seemed just as far off as it did months earlier, with EU officials and diplomats saying that May had offered nothing new to ease the deadlock. Since then, her proposal to extend the transition period has stoked anger among Conservative eurosceptics, who fear she is leading Britain into a deal that will make Britain a “vassal state” indefinitely - unable ever to fully leave the EU or to forge its own free trade deals with other countries. Critics of May used Britain’s Sunday newspapers to rhetorically savage the British leader, with unnamed rivals using phrases such as “assassination is in the air”. However, that approach looked to have backfired as even May’s harshest critics condemned the violent nature of the comments, tempering any confrontation with their leader.  A vote of no-confidence in May would be triggered if 48 Conservative lawmakers submit letters to the chairman of the party’s so-called “1922 Committee” of backbenchers to demand such a vote. The Sunday Times said 46 had now been sent, but Reuters could not verify that number. However a planned show of strength among the Brexiteers, who intended to rebel at a vote on Northern Ireland legislation in parliament later this week, was called off by the leader of the rebellion, former minister Steve Baker.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday vowed to begin curtailing millions of dollars in American aid to three Central American nations and called a caravan of migrants bound for the United States a national emergency, as he sought to boost his party’s chances in Nov. 6 congressional elections. “Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them,” Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts. The caravan, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands, is in southern Mexico, inching towards the distant U.S. border.  Trump and his fellow Republicans have sought to make the caravan and immigration campaign issues ahead of the midterm elections, in which his party is fighting to maintain control of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. “Remember the Midterms!” Trump tweeted.  Trump’s remarks also seemed aimed at piling pressure on Mexico to stop the caravan, something that he complained the Mexican police and military had failed to do. Mexico, which has refused Trump’s demands that it pay for a border wall between the countries, tries to walk a fine line between showing solidarity with the Central American migrants and responding to Washington’s demands to control its borders. The caravan was moving north again on Monday as migrants left the southern Mexican city of Tapachula near the Guatemalan border, bound for the town of Huixtla, also in Chiapas state. Some shielded themselves from the midday sun with umbrellas, others with bits of cardboard on which they had slept the previous night. As they left the city and crossed a highway, Mexican drivers honked their horns in support.  U.S. administrations have long seen aid programs as an essential part of efforts to stabilise the countries of Central America and stem the flow of migrants leaving.  But since Trump became president last year, the United States has already moved to sharply decrease aid to the region. In 2016, the United States provided some $131 million in aid to Guatemala, $98 million to Honduras, and $68 million to El Salvador, according to U.S. data. By next year, those sums were projected to fall to $69 million for Guatemala, $66 million for Honduras and $46 million for El Salvador - a reduction of almost 40 percent for the three nations. Later on Monday, Trump headed to Texas, a key border state, to campaign for Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who is seeking re-election. Speaking to reporters, Trump stepped up his criticism, saying that despite getting a “tremendous amount of money” in U.S. foreign aid, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador “like a lot of others, do nothing for our country.”  Trump also said, without providing evidence, that “Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” are mixed in with the caravan, a claim immigration advocates disputed. Democratic Representative Nita Lowey said Trump’s threat to cut foreign aid “ignores that Congress, not the president, is entrusted by the Constitution with the power of the purse.” Lowey said Congress provides assistance to Central American countries to address the root causes of why people want to leave in the first place. “Cutting funding would make the problem worse, not better,” Lowey added in a statement. The migrants - men, women and children - have defied threats by Trump that he will close the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as Mexican government warnings. Argelia Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the caravan, said there were about 10,000 people in the group and that around 6,000 of them would seek to remain in Mexico. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq estimated the caravan includes more than 7,000 people. “Donald Trump can say what he wants. At the end of the day, he knows he’s not the king of the world,” Ramirez told Reuters. “We’re fighting for a cause, and I think God will end up moving the hearts of all the American people.” The caravan is still a long way - more than 1,100 miles (1,800 km) - from the U.S. border. Mexico hopes to disperse the convoy long before it can reach the border using bureaucratic procedures, telling migrants to register with authorities in order to submit applications for asylum in Mexico. That process can last weeks, and migrants are supposed to stay where they register while applications are processed. If they violate those rules, they face deportation. Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete told a media briefing on Monday that 1,128 Hondurans had sought refugee status in Mexico. He said 82,166 migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador had been returned to their homelands in 2018. He did not give a clear answer when asked if federal police would accompany the migrants to the U.S. border or stop them. Officers had instructions to keep watch over the caravan and help the national migration agency, Navarrete said. He did not provide further details of how the police would be deployed.  Separately, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told a business summit that those in the caravan who did not follow the rules were unlikely to be able to remain in Mexico or reach the United States. A spokesman for the president’s office in El Salvador, Roberto Lorenzana, said the country had slashed migration to the United States by 60 percent over the past few years, a feat its Central American neighbours had not matched. In Guatemala, a border crossing with Mexico and another with Honduras have been closed indefinitely, said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for that country’s migration agency. Army Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that while National Guard troops are currently supporting the Department of Homeland Security on the border, the Pentagon had not been asked to provide additional support. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops along the border in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, according to the Pentagon.

First of all, we need to know why he died. Who killed him?. We want to get the full lowdown on this process,” Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy quoted Bolton, on a visit to Moscow, as saying. Khashoggi disappeared three weeks ago after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s blue-chip share index gave up earlier gains and slipped into negative territory on Monday in see-saw trade as lower oil prices pressured energy stocks and gambling companies were knocked by a report of a UK crackdown on offshore taxes.  A weaker opening on Wall Street and renewed worries about Italy also dented sentiment in afternoon trade, offsetting positive earnings from NMC Health Plc (NMC.L). The FTSE 100 .FTSE closed down 0.10 percent, as energy stocks knocked more than 12 points off the index. Oil services company Wood Group (WG.L) fell 2.8 percent, the second-largest loser, and BP Plc (BP.L) ended down 1.2 percent. European shares tumbled 0.3 percent as a rally in Italian banks due to easing worries about the country’s budget ran out of steam later in the session. In the UK, gambling companies were under pressure after the Financial Times reported that Chancellor Philip Hammond was set to increase taxes paid by offshore gambling companies in his budget later this month.  Paddy Power Betfair (PPB.I) dropped to the bottom of the index, down 4 percent and GVC Holdings (GVC.L) fell 2.3 percent. Positive earnings helped lift NMC Health (NMC.L) to the top of the UK leader board, rising more than 5 percent for the biggest one-day gain since August last year.  The United Arab Emirates-based healthcare provider raised its full-year earnings and revenue forecasts, citing strong organic growth, and said it remained confident of achieving its longer-term margin guidance. “This is likely to be welcomed by investors after a sticky spell for the shares, largely relating to wider market weakness,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “The forecasts given today are impressive both in what they reveal about the growth trajectory and for their clarity.” The “impressive” performance by the UAE’s largest private healthcare company contrasts with the difficulties faced by rival Mediclinic, which has struggled with the more mature Swiss market, he said. UK mining companies were boosted by higher copper prices, with Anglo American Plc (AAL.L) up 1.6 percent, amid hopes of stronger demand from China, the world’s top commodities market, even as concerns grow about the impact of Washington’s trade dispute with its top trading partner. [MET/L] “The feel-good factor out of China at the moment has lifted the metals market,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Still the gains could be short-lived as the U.S.-China relationship comes under renewed pressure after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s warning against investing in China. Financials provided some support, with Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) gaining 0.5 percent after the FT reported that the bank is planning to double its share buy-back programme to almost £2 billion ($2.6 billion) next year. The move was seen as a sign of the lender’s confidence even as the economic outlook remains uncertain. Outside of the blue-chips, broker moves and M&A activity were in focus on the mid-cap FTSE 250 .FTMC, which fell by 0.2 percent. The top-ranked analyst at UBS upgraded Man Group (EMG.L) to “buy”, saying current pricing were an attractive entry point and pushing prices up 3.7 percent. B&M European Value Retail SA (BMEB.L) was the third biggest gainer, up 4.3 percent on news of plans to buy France’s Babou Stores Group. Among the losers, Cairn Energy (CNE.L) fell 6.6 percent with a Jefferies downgrade adding to pressure from lower oil prices.  Provident Financial (PFG.L) dropped 1.65 percent as Barclays cut its price target after the sub-prime lender’s trading update on Friday.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - White House adviser Jared Kushner said on Monday he had urged Saudi Arabia’s crown prince to be transparent about the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, and told him “the world is watching” Riyadh’s account of the journalist’s disappearance. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, disappeared three weeks ago after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for his upcoming marriage.  Riyadh initially denied knowledge of his fate before saying he was killed in a fight in the consulate, a reaction greeted sceptically by several Western governments, straining relations with the world’s biggest oil exporter. But as incredulity deepened over Saudi Arabia’s account, comments from President Donald Trump have varied. He has appeared at times to downplay Riyadh’s role in the incident, but also warned of potential economic sanctions. He has repeatedly highlighted the kingdom’s importance as an ally. Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has cultivated a personal relationship with Prince Mohammed and urged Trump to act with caution to avoid upsetting a critical strategic and economic relationship, a senior administration official said. On Monday, Kushner said he had told the crown prince: “Just to be transparent, to be fully transparent. The world is watching. This is a very, very serious accusation and a very serious situation.” Asked how the prince responded, Kushner, speaking on CNN, said: “We’ll see.”      He said the United States was in a “fact-finding phase” on the case and had its “eyes wide open”. He did not say when or by what means he had communicated with Prince Mohammed. Khashoggi went missing on Oct. 2 when he entered the consulate in Istanbul. After weeks of denying knowledge of his fate, Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a “fist fight”. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said Khashoggi had died in a rogue operation. But some of his comments appeared to contradict previous statements from Riyadh, marking yet another shift in the official story. Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Turkey, have pressed Riyadh to provide all the facts, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while uncertainty over Khashoggi’s fate persisted.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s ruling party said on Monday Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a “monstrously planned” murder, dismissing Riyadh’s assertion he died in a fight, as Western incredulity deepened over varying Saudi accounts of the journalist’s disappearance. Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the powerful Saudi crown prince, disappeared three weeks ago after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain documents for an upcoming marriage.  Riyadh’s reaction since - it initially denied knowledge of his fate before saying he was killed in a fight in the consulate - has left several Western governments deeply sceptical and strained ties with the world’s largest oil exporter. Ruling AK Party spokesman Omer Celik said efforts had been made to cover up the killing, referring to surveillance footage aired by CNN showing a man dressed as Khashoggi walking around Istanbul after he vanished in an apparent attempt at deception. “We are facing a situation that has been monstrously planned and later tried to be covered up. It is a complicated murder,” he told reporters. “We are being careful so nobody tries to cover the issue up. The truth will come out. Those responsible will be punished, something like this will not cross anybody’s mind anymore.” Khashoggi went missing on Oct. 2 when he entered the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. After weeks of denying knowledge of his fate, Saudi officials said the prominent journalist was killed in a “fistfight”. On Sunday Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said that Khashoggi had died in a rogue operation.

Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Turkey, have pressed Riyadh to provide all the facts, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would not export arms to Saudi Arabia while uncertainty over Khashoggi’s fate persisted. “One cannot help but wonder how there could have been a ‘fistfight’ between 15 young expert fighters ... and a 60-year-old Khashoggi, alone and defenceless,” Yasin Aktay, an adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and a friend of Khashoggi’s, wrote in the pro-government Yeni Safak newspaper. “The more one thinks about it, the more it feels like our intelligence is being mocked,” he wrote.        Erdogan has said he will release information about Turkey’s investigation in a speech on Tuesday. Turkish officials suspect Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate by Saudi agents and his body cut up. Turkish sources say authorities have an audio recording purportedly documenting the murder of the 59-year-old. A car belonging to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was found in the Sultangazi district of the city, broadcaster NTV and other local media said on Monday, adding that police would search the vehicle. For Saudi Arabia’s allies, the question will be whether they believe that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has painted himself as a reformer, has any culpability. King Salman, 82, has handed the day-to-day running of Saudi Arabia to him. In some critical areas, Jubeir’s explanation appeared to depart from previous official statements.  He said the Saudis did not know how Khashoggi had died. That contradicted the public prosecutor’s statement a day earlier that Khashoggi died after a fistfight with people who met him inside the consulate. It also contradicted two Saudi officials’ comments to Reuters that it was a chokehold that killed him. A member of the team dressed in Khashoggi’s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate, a Saudi official has  said. Support for that strand of the account appeared to come from footage aired by CNN showing a man dressed as Khashoggi walking around Istanbul. CNN described the images as law enforcement surveillance footage. Some top U.S. lawmakers turned their ire on the crown prince and said they believed he ordered the killing. “Do I think he did it? Yes, I think he did it,” Republican Senator Bob Corker, the influential chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview with CNN.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday offered a rare national apology, only the second since 2008, to victims of institutional child sexual abuse and their families, bringing some survivors to tears. The gesture followed a five-year inquiry into child sexual abuse that delved into more than 8,000 cases of sexual misconduct, most of them at religious and state-run institutions responsible for keeping children safe. “Today, as a nation, we confront our failure to listen, to believe, and to provide justice,” Morrison told lawmakers in the Australian capital, Canberra. “We say sorry. To the children we failed, sorry. To the parents whose trust was betrayed and who have struggled to pick up the pieces, sorry.” Expressions of national regret such as Monday’s are reserved for egregious misdeeds in which the state has played a role. In the previous instance in 2008, then prime minister Kevin Rudd apologised to members of the Stolen Generations of indigenous Australians, forcibly taken from their families and communities as young children under assimilation policies. Morrison also repeated Monday’s apology in a speech to nearly 800 victims, some of whom began to cry, images broadcast on television showed. “It was very, very intense to be in that room,” Graeme, a victim who identified himself only by his first name, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. “I looked around and I thought to myself there is not a room of stronger people anywhere in the country.” He added, “I am proud to be a victim and I am proud of all victims.” Morrison vowed tougher oversight, although some victims say the government has failed to do enough. “If they think saying sorry is going to finish it, it’s not,” Tony Wardley, who suffered abuse in the 1980s, told the broadcaster. “There’s still so much to be done.” Australia set up a redressal scheme this year to pay abuse victims compensation of up to A$150,000 ($106,000) each. But the conservative government has yet to decide if it will adopt recommendations from the wide-ranging national inquiry, most notably one requiring Catholic priests to report child abuse they may learn about in the confessional. In August, a top Catholic body, the Australian Catholic Bishops’ Conference, said it would not comply with proposed state laws.

2019-02-08,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Some people in the Syrian capital Damascus have been able to enjoy a semblance of normality since fighting in the area ended in May, but in the rubble of shattered, destitute towns nearby, life could not be more different.  Central Damascus was held by the government throughout the war and suffered much less damage than opposition-held areas - evidence of the huge gulf in fire power between the two sides.  Parts of the eastern Ghouta region just outside Damascus were all but flattened during a government offensive this spring to retake it from rebels.  When the area surrendered, tens of thousands of its people, both fighters and civilians, chose to leave eastern Ghouta under safe passage for opposition areas in northern Syria rather than come back under government rule. Others decided to stay.  The risk of being hit by bullets or shellfire near the capital has now ended, but conditions in central Damascus, with its relaxed nightlife and bustling business district, seem a world away from the hardship of eastern Ghouta.  President Bashar al-Assad’s success in the war owes much to Russia, which entered the war on his side in 2015, and whose soldiers are now a common sight in government-held areas. Even during the fighting, people in Damascus would go out in the evenings to eat, drink and dance, but this summer, the bars and restaurants of the Old City were much busier. “During the war, when bombs were falling, it could be days without customers, but we never stopped working,” said Dana, a 24-year-old bar tender, mixing a blue moon cocktail in a shaker.  Barber shops do good business and cafes spill out onto the cobbled streets of the Old City on weekend evenings. This was the first summer since 2011 without the sound of fighting in Damascus. At a wedding outside the city, the noise came rather from student rock band Kibreet - a drummer, two guitarists and a singer.   The groom was carried on the shoulders of his friends and family, as people clapped around him. He swung his bride in his arms, her white dress billowing out behind.  Only a few miles away, in the eastern Ghouta city of Douma, rubble is all around. In one bulletpocked building, a young man on the fifth floor was shovelling debris from a balcony, preparing the flat for re-use.  Entire streets seem destroyed. At one of the area’s biggest hospitals, where huge shell holes are blown into the walls, medics are still operating out of the basement.  A woman held up a small boy on a bed, grimacing as he waited for the doctor to give an injection. In the ravaged streets, a small boy pushed a cart selling cooked sweetcorn cobs between ruined buildings.  The fighting in Douma only ended a few months ago, but any significant reconstruction might be very distant.  Syria cannot afford a major rebuilding programme. Its closest allies, Russia and Iran, seem unlikely to foot the bill. Western nations will pay no cash without a political transition. In al-Khalidiya district of Homs, retaken by the government in 2013, the slow nature of recovery is clear. Much of it is a ghost town, uninhabited and closed by the army.  In one area, boys played soccer near buildings so pancaked by bombs that the floors and ceilings hung down closely on top of each other. Their goal was made of two rusting oil drums with posts sticking up and a wire tied between them as the crossbar.  “The covered souk used to be chockablock but now very few people come to this area,” said Abu Fares, a shop owner in the Old City of Homs.  Even among the young people enjoying the nightlife in Damascus the challenge of the long, slow economic recovery ahead means many people are thinking of leaving.  “I like my job.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission does not want any crisis with Italy over its budget plans, but it expects answers to its concerns,   European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Monday. An Italian government source said that Rome was expecting the EU executive to take the unprecedented step to ask it to revise its 2019 draft budget, which includes lifting the deficit to 2.4 percent of GDP from 1.8 percent in 2018. “The European Commission does not want a crisis between Brussels and Rome,” Moscovici told France Inter radio. “My state of mind is that of constructive dialogue.” Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Monday that the Italian government was ready to discuss its budget targets with European Union authorities.    The Italian government is expected to send a letter on its budget to the Commission by noon. Moscovici said the European Commission would meet on Tuesday to discuss the response, adding that he could not say when it would take a decision. “When you are an EU member and a member of the single currency, of the euro zone, you must respect a number of joint rules,” Moscovici said, reaffirming the concerns the EU executive has expressed over the past weeks on Italy’s budget plans. Italy’s structural deficit is way too high, he said. Moscovici, a French Socialist, said he was making a difference between Salvini’s political ideas, which he disagrees with, and the Italian government, which he says he respects. “I can fight Mr Salvini as party chief; I can fight his ideas; I can consider that, he also belongs to the illiberal democracy space. After all he is Mrs Le Pen’s friend, let’s not forget this,” he said, referring to the French far-right leader.  “I fight the National Front and I fight the League on a political level, but I respect the Italian government. And it must also respect EU rules,” he said. “It is mutual respect that allows us to move forward in this diverse Europe.” Reporting by Ingrid Melander, editing by Larry King",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-budget-moscovici/eus-moscovici-doesnt-want-crisis-with-italy-expects-answers-on-budget-idUKKCN1MW0QM,2019-02-08,"The European Commission does not want any crisis with Italy over its budget plans, but it expects answers to its concerns,   European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Monday.","EU's Moscovici doesn't want crisis with Italy, expects answers on budget"

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The family of late Australian conservationist and “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin are following in his footsteps with a new television show dedicated to their wildlife conservation work. “Crikey! It’s the Irwins” will follow Irwin’s wife Terri and their two children, Bindi and Robert, looking after animals at their Australia Zoo in Queensland as well as heading out on various expeditions. Irwin, who was watched by audiences around the world in his popular television programmes, died in 2006 after a stingray’s serrated barb pierced his heart while filming off Australia’s northern Great Barrier Reef. “We are continuing on in dad’s footsteps and everything that we do today at Australia Zoo and with our Wildlife Warriors work is exactly what he started,” Bindi Irwin said of the family’s conservation organisation in an interview for Reuters. “In the show we’ll have some amazing moments of reflecting on what he used to do, from feeding crocodiles to cuddling koalas. and then you’ll see us doing the exact same things making sure that everything he loved the most carries on into the future.”  Bindi Irwin, who has previously had her own television show, will be seen working at the zoo’s wildlife hospital. Her brother said the family also takes trips abroad.  “Also we travelled to so many different places all over the globe,” Robert Irwin said.  “We’ll take you to Africa. We’ll take you to the Great Barrier Reef. We’ll take you up north to remote northern Queensland where we do our crocodile research. It’s all about wildlife, it’s all about conservation and fun as a family.” “Crikey! It’s the Irwins” debuts on Oct. 28 on Animal Planet.

2019-02-08,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghans unable to vote in Saturday’s parliamentary election because hundreds of polling stations failed to open were given another chance to cast their ballot on Sunday after the authorities extended voting for another day. With the Taliban operating freely across much of the country and heavy pressure from international partners for the vote to be held, the election was seen as a major test of the credibility of the Western-backed government. Around three million Afghans voted on Saturday, a larger-than-expected turnout, but across the country serious technical problems were reported and large numbers of polling stations remained closed, often because staff failed to turn up. “Turnout was above expectations and we should appreciate that, but unfortunately mismanagement and other problems with the commission gave us the worst election in our history,” said Mohammad Arif Rahmani, a member in the last parliament, saying there were “obvious” signs of fraud. “This extension of the election by a day and a half was in itself clearly something that opens the way to fraud,” he said. Facing a swell of complaints, the Independent Election Commission (IEC) announced it would extend voting at 401 polling stations, which had not opened, until Sunday, despite warnings that the extended opening would stretch security forces. “It is not an ideal scenario,” one international security official said. In the event, fewer than two thirds of the polling stations meant to open on Sunday actually did so, with the remainder closed for security reasons, IEC chairman Abdul Bade Sayad said. Preparations for the election had been marred by organizational problems, accusations of cheating and the threat of violence from Taliban militants. More than 120 attacks involving grenades or improvised explosive devices were reported on Saturday and dozens of people were killed and wounded across the country on Saturday. In Kabul, 15 people were killed in one suicide attack. Many independent election observers were reluctant to work fearing militant attacks but the threat came from other groups as well as the Taliban. Armed men loyal to local power brokers in some provinces entered polling stations by force and broke election materials and on Sunday, the bodies of four observers were found in the northern province of Balkh after they had been abducted a day earlier and shot. Ballot counting has begun but preliminary results of the election are not expected to be announced until next month. The parliamentary vote was seen as a dry run for next year’s more important presidential election which Afghanistan’s international partners are desperately hoping will avoid the bitterness and cheating that tainted the last election in 2014. More than a million people voted in the capital Kabul but turnout was very low in the provinces, said Naeem Ayubzada, director of Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan, a civic action body that has been monitoring the ballot. He also said the decision to extend the vote opened the way for abuse, with half-filled ballot boxes left open all night in some polling centres. “From a planning point of view, it’s very difficult,” he said. “It provides an opportunity for fraud.”     Mariam Sulaimankhel, a candidate for the nomadic Kochi minority who have 10 reserved seats, said that along with many Kochis in Kabul, she had been unable to vote because officials did not have the lists with their names. “We are a minority and the election commission does not care about fair representation,” she said. In addition, voting in the province of Kandahar was delayed by a week following the assassination of the powerful local police commander Gen. Abdul Razeq. The election in the central province of Ghazni was also postponed due to disagreements over the representation of different ethnic groups.

2019-02-08,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) scored limited gains in regional government in Sunday’s election, but lost a high-profile race for Warsaw mayor, an exit poll showed, laying bare divisions in Poland over the party’s democracy record. Since sweeping into power in 2015, PiS has remained broadly popular, benefiting from voter-pleasing welfare reforms, nationalist rhetoric and strong economic growth.  But critics at home and abroad have accused it of a tilt towards authoritarian rule after moves to increase government control over the judiciary and public media that have also fuelled Poland’s isolation within the European Union. The party won some 32.3 percent of votes for provincial assemblies, compared with 26.9 percent in a vote four years earlier and 37.6 percent it scored in the 2015 parliamentary election. A coalition of centrist opposition parties was set to win some 24.7 percent, an opinion poll by Ipsos showed. A strong showing for the agrarian PSL party, which was on track to win 16.6 percent on Sunday, was a blow for PiS which had focussed much of its election campaign on winning the rural vote. In Warsaw, however, the PiS candidate, Patryk Jaki, 33, came in second place after Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, a pro-EU centrist, who unexpectedly secured the office in a first round of voting by winning more than 50 percent of votes. If confirmed, the results will mean PiS could struggle to keep its support base during a parliamentary election in late 2019 and a presidential vote a year later. PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said the party’s showing on Sunday bodes well for next year, but he added: “We have to work, work, and work some more.” PiS leader told party activists after exit polls came out: “The election campaign is starting.” Final results of the election will be released by the electoral commission by the middle of the week.  The election is part of a larger battle over Europe’s future, as Brexit and Hungary’s Viktor Orban - who like PiS believes the EU’s powers should be reined in - shake up the bloc and right-wing parties make gains across the continent. With Brussels entering campaign mode ahead of a European Parliament election in May, the Polish vote could give some hints on whether eurosceptic groups can secure a stronger voice and thwart further EU integration. “I’d say its a tie, with some advantage for the opposition,” said Warsaw University political scientist Rafal Chwedoruk of the Polish vote.     While exit poll results can not give a clear indication of how many of Poland’s 16 provincial assemblies will fall under PiS control, any gains will mean better access to local funding. That could affect a general election in 2019. Since the 2014 election, PiS only controls one such assembly. “I don’t believe in a liberal democracy, because it leads to anarchy,” said Stanisław Lawniczak, 68, a real estate manager who voted for PiS candidates in Warsaw.  The turnout in the election topped 50 percent and was the highest in a regional vote since Poland overthrew communism in 1989, an indication of deep-running divisions that may have galvanised voters. Winning Warsaw, a bastion of anti-government protests since 2015, was seen as the top prize in the election, with PiS’ Jaki vowing city hall under his leadership would side with ordinary people against what he calls arrogant, liberal elites. A long-time EU emissary for the centrist Civic Platform party, Trzaskowski had promised the capital would remain “open, tolerant and European”. “I hope the victory in Warsaw is the first step and that we will win upcoming votes. It’s important for Poland that politicians who respect the rule of law have access to power,” Trzaskowski said after exit polls came out. Underlining divisions, the EU’s top court ordered the Warsaw government on Friday to suspend an overhaul of the Supreme Court and reinstate judges forced into early retirement. The moves were part of broader reforms of the judiciary, which PiS says are crucial to making the system more fair and efficient, but opponents say they are an attack on democratic checks and balances.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCA) has agreed to sell its Magneti Marelli unit to KKR’s (KKR.N) Calsonic Kansei, two sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday, adding the deal would be announced on Monday.  The sale is the first big decision for newly minted FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley, who took over in July when long-time boss Sergio Marchionne fell ill and later died after succumbing to complications from surgery. The transaction values Magneti Marelli, a diversified parts maker that specialises in lighting, powertrain and electronics, at 6.2 billion euros ($7.14 billion), excluding debt, one of the sources said.   The source added it was a full sale and neither FCA nor the Agnelli family, FCA’s top shareholder, would keep a stake after the deal.   No other details of the agreement were immediately known.  The sealing of the deal was first reported by Bloomberg. Calsonic Kansei and KKR were not immediately available for comment.  Reuters reported in September that the Japanese car parts maker had lined up around 5 billion euros in financing from Japanese banks to fund its proposed acquisition of Magneti Marelli. The Japanese car parts maker, which U.S. private equity fund KKR bought from Nissan and other shareholders in 2016, has been in talks with FCA for months and made an initial proposal of 5.8 billion euros for Magneti Marelli, sources have said previously. The deal was being structured as an outright acquisition by Calsonic to create a global auto components giant worth around 16 billion euros in revenues, cut costs through synergies and expand the customer base of both suppliers, the people added. Marchionne had set in motion a process to spin off the unit and distribute its shares to FCA shareholders by early 2019. However, at one of his last public appearances in June, Marchionne said FCA would still be “receptive” to an offer if it “properly recognised” Magneti Marelli’s value. FCA does not spell out earnings for Magneti Marelli, which sits within the carmaker’s components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid. The unit employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries. Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target and FCA has fielded interest from various rivals and private equity firms over the years, but so far a deal had remained elusive as potential bidders were offering too little or were only interested in some parts of the business. FCA also preferred the Calsonic offer to a pure private equity bidder because it limits the risk of the unit being broken up, sources have said.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will not allow a cover-up after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a senior member of President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party said on Sunday, warning that consequences could be “dire”. After denying any involvement in the disappearance of Khashoggi, 59, for two weeks, Saudi Arabia on Saturday said the journalist and critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had died in a fistfight at the consulate. An hour later, another Saudi official attributed the death to a chokehold. “If the incident transpired as it has been told across the world, there is no way Saudi officials can cover this up by saying a team from Saudi Arabia came and two or three men among them murdered him,” Numan Kurtulmus, deputy chairman of the AKP told CNN Turk in an interview. “A crime committed in a consulate cannot be carried out without the knowledge of the senior state officials of that country. If this crime was really carried out as has been said, if the evidence really leads to that conclusion, the situation will be dire and this must have very serious legal consequences.” Reflecting the intensifying international scepticism over its account, a senior Saudi government official has laid out a new version that in key respects contradicts previous explanations. The latest account includes details on how the team of 15 Saudi nationals sent to confront Khashoggi had threatened him with being drugged and kidnapped and then killed him in a chokehold when he resisted. A member of the team then dressed in Khashoggi’s clothes to make it appear as if he had left the consulate.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The remains of more than 60 infants and foetuses were found stashed in a Detroit funeral home, police said on Friday, calling the discovery “deeply disturbing.” The incident comes about a week after the badly decomposed bodies of 11 babies were found hidden in a false ceiling at a different funeral home in the Michigan city.  No connection between the two cases has yet been established, Detroit’s police chief said. He added city, state and federal investigators were looking to form a task force to investigate the improper storage of human remains. Unrefrigerated boxes containing about 36 sets of remains were recovered from the Perry Funeral Home along with another 27 sets of remains in a freezer, police said.  “This is deeply disturbing,” Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters on Friday. “I have never seen anything like this in my 41-1/2 years (on the force), ever.” Investigators are working to establish ages and identities. An official with Perry Funeral Home, which offers burial and cremation services, declined to comment on the incident. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in a statement it revoked the funeral home’s licence and shut down the facility after inspectors “found heinous conditions and negligent conduct at the home.”  Police have also launched an investigation into the now defunct Cantrell Funeral Home, where the remains of the 11 babies were uncovered last week after authorities received an anonymous letter leading them to the remains. Its former operators have not commented to media. In April, state regulators found “deplorable, unsanitary conditions” at the same premises, including embalmed bodies in an unrefrigerated garage and other badly decomposed remains, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in a statement at the time.  The funeral home was also accused of several licensing and financial violations, the agency said.

2019-02-08,"By Andrew MacAskill and Amanda Ferguson LONDON/BELFAST (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of supporters of the European Union marched through London on Saturday in the biggest demonstration so far to demand that the British government holds a public vote on the terms of Brexit. The protesters waved the blue and gold flag of the EU and held up “Bollocks to Brexit” banners under sunny skies to call for another referendum on the eventual deal on how Britain will leave the world’s biggest trading bloc. The march comes after another tumultuous week for Prime Minister Theresa May in which she failed to agree a divorce deal with EU leaders in Brussels and infuriated members of her own party by making further concessions in the talks. With just over five months until Britain is due to leave there is no clarity about what a future trade deal with the EU will look like and some rebels in May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one. James McGrory, one of the organisers of the march, said voters should have the chance to change their minds because the decision will impact their lives for generations.  “People think the Brexit negotiations are a total mess, they have no faith in the government to deliver the promises that were made, partly because they cannot be delivered,” he said.  At the march, demonstrators carried placards saying “Brexit is pants”, “Time for an EU turn” and “European and proud.”  Organisers said about 700,000 people took part in the march, which would make it the largest in Britain since a  demonstration against the Iraq war in 2003.  The “People’s Vote” campaign, which includes several pro-EU groups, said they had stewards stationed at regular intervals to estimate the size of the crowd. The police did not provide an independent estimate of numbers participating.  Protesters originally gathered near Hyde Park and then walked past Downing Street and finished outside parliament where they listened to politicians from all main political parties. Britain’s 2016 referendum saw 52 percent vote in favour of leaving the European Union. But the past two years have been politically fraught as the government has struggled to agree on a plan and there are fears that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal. Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favour of remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes and many in Britain say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit. The prime minister has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum. The opposition Labour party’s Brexit spokesman said last month his party open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc in certain circumstances. In Belfast in Northern Ireland, around 2,000 people gathered on Saturday to oppose Brexit. Brendan Heading, a 39-year-old IT worker, said he was worried the decision to leave the EU would damage the economy and  could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.      “I feel that Brexit threatens prosperity and stability,” he said. “People should have the opportunity to vote for an alternative based on what we now know.” Brexit supporters held their own rally in the town of Harrogate in the north of England.  Richard Tice, Vice-Chairman of Leave Means Leave and one of the speakers at the event, described the people on the march in London as “losers” and said a second referendum would trigger a  constitutional crisis. “We had a vote, we voted to leave, the idea to have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging,” he said. “People need to be under no illusions as to how people feel about what is a significant potential for a total betrayal of democracy in this country.”  Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Ros Russell, Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-protests/hundreds-of-thousands-take-to-streets-in-london-demanding-second-brexit-vote-idUKKCN1MU0JJ,2019-02-08,,Hundreds of thousands take to streets in London demanding second Brexit vote
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab wants the European Union to accept assurances that the country will remain tied to the bloc’s rules for longer in return for making a hotly contested so-called backstop for Northern Ireland unnecessary. Talks between Britain and the European Union have stalled over a disagreement over the backstop - an insurance policy to ensure there will be no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, a former focal point for sectarian tensions, if a future trading relationship is not in place in time. Raab writing in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said Britain’s proposal to extend its Brexit transition period should be an “alternative” to the insurance plan. “The Prime Minister has rightly refused to rule out considering different approaches – including extending the implementation period for a limited period of a few months, as an alternative to the backstop,” he said. But so far the European Union has said the backstop on the island of Ireland must remain in place to proceed with the divorce negotiations.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amnesty International said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s explanation of journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul appeared to be a whitewash of “an appalling assassination”. “The investigation findings by the Saudi authorities claiming that Khashoggi died as a result of a ‘fist-fight’ inside the consulate are not trustworthy and marks an abysmal new low to Saudi Arabia’s human rights record,” Samah Hadid, the human rights group’s Middle East director, said in a statement. It called on Saudi authorities to produce Khashoggi’s body so that independent forensic experts could perform an autopsy. It also said the United Nations should investigate his death. “An independent investigation will be the only guarantee against what increasingly appears as a Saudi whitewash surrounding the circumstances of Khashoggi’s murder or any attempts by other governments to sweep the issue under the carpet to preserve lucrative arms deals and other business ties with Riyadh,” Hadid said. Saudi Arabia’s claim that Khashoggi had died in a fight — rather than was deliberately killed - was Riyadh’s first acknowledgement of his death after two weeks of denials that it was involved in his disappearance. “This appalling assassination within the grounds of the Consulate amounts to an extrajudicial execution,” Amnesty said.

2019-02-08,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish truckmaker Volvo (VOLVb.ST) forecast slower demand for trucks in Europe and China next year, fuelling investor concerns these major markets may have peaked and sending its shares into reverse. It also gave no clarity on the potential costs of fixing an emissions issue with some trucks and buses sold in North America and Europe disclosed this week, causing its stock to fall 4.8 percent despite its third-quarter profit having topped consensus. Volvo, which also makes construction equipment and engines, forecast truck market demand in China would fall about 13 percent to 970,000 units next year and predicted a contraction in Europe of about 5 percent to 300,000 units.  It also expects demand in the Chinese construction market to be between flat and down 10 percent. Its comments came after China’s economic growth slowed to its weakest quarterly pace since 2009. CEO Martin Lundstedt blamed the Volvo slowdown in China partly on the trade war with the United States, but also said new emission legislation had led truck clients to hesitate after a number of years of strong growth. “Generally speaking there is a certain worry about what will happen when it comes to tariffs and different other types of uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic climate,” he told Reuters.  “But still I think the overwhelming part of our customers’ sentiment is really good activity in different markets... So what we see, that is not really a strong trend of a downturn.” Robust demand in recent years has come from a need for truck buyers to renew fleets starved of investment during the last  downturn. But the surge has caused bottlenecks, leaving Volvo having to cope with higher raw material and labor costs. Volvo, in which China’s Geely Holding (0175.HK) has a 15 percent stake, said on Friday that supply chain hold-ups were expected to persist in North America.  Volvo said on Tuesday it could face “material” costs as some of its engines could be exceeding limits set for toxic nitrogen oxide emissions as catalytic converters were wearing down more quickly than expected in certain situations.  Volvo management fielded multiple questions from analysts about the scale of the issue and the cost of dealing with it on Friday, but provided little in the way of fresh detail. Lundstedt told analysts he viewed the problem as a “one off” rather than a “going concern”, adding that some trucks had been fixed already and that Volvo had identified potential solutions. The company reported a jump in third-quarter adjusted operating profit to 10.25 billion Swedish crowns ($1.13 billion) from 6.95 billion, topping the 9.59 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. It also showed progress in curbing costs, with adjusted margins rising 11.1 percent, exceeding its 10-percent target thanks to slightly lower R&D costs and higher sales.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index fell on Friday, led by Intercontinental Hotels Group after disappointing results and budget airline EasyJet Plc following a broker downgrade amid growing gloom in the travel sector. The FTSE 100 reversed earlier gains and was down 0.3 percent by 0926 GMT. Still, the market looked likely to mark a rise for the week, having recouped some of the ground lost in last week’s dramatic sell-off. The FTSE outperformed European stocks thanks to its big weighting to high-dividend-yielding stocks, which investors flock to in times of economic uncertainty.  Oil majors BP and Shell helped stem the losses as crude prices climbed. [O/R] With earnings season in full swing, investor sentiment has grown increasingly gloomy this week, with few examples to give much cheer. Topping the FTSE 100 losers, InterContinental’s weaker-than-expected revenue added to the downbeat mood and stirred concerns about the cooling travel sector, even after the hotel chain said it would return 500 million euro ($572 million) to shareholders through a special dividend. Its shares were down 6.5 percent after hitting their lowest in more than a year.     “Revenue per available rooms is a little lower than hoped for, largely as a result of weak occupancy numbers in the U.S.,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “With IHG rapidly expanding its rate of room growth, including some sizeable acquisitions and new brand launches, lower revenues are far from welcome.” Broker moves drove other shares. Easyjet was the second-biggest faller, down 6.4 percent, after a MainFirst downgrade. Dechra Pharmaceuticals was one of only a few gainers on the mid-cap FTSE 250 after Stifel upgraded the stock to buy. Otherwise weak earnings took centre stage on the domestically focused index, which was down 0.7 percent and looked set for its fourth straight weekly loss. Industrials were the biggest drag. Precision engineering group Renishaw Plc topped the loser board, hitting its lowest level in more than a year and down 6.8 percent after a trading statement. In M&A news, retail property developer Intu Properties surged 12 percent to the top of the FTSE 250 after saying it was considering a 215 pence takeover offer from a consortium led by its deputy chairman John Whittaker and Saudi Arabian and Canadian investors. The shares were still below the offer price at 202 pence. Small caps were also hit by earnings news. Auto retailer Pendragon slid 11 percent after warning that new emissions rules will dent results.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - French Connection (FCCN.L) said on Friday it has begun discussions with four interested parties regarding a sale of the British clothing retailer. The company, which announced last week that it was reviewing all strategic options, said it has also had conversations with several other interested parties regarding its plans. French Connection, which was founded by Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Stephen Marks in 1972, has a market capitalisation of over 51 million pounds ($67 million), according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Once known for its provocative FCUK brand of clothes and accessories, the company has been in the red for six years. In March, it said it was close to turning profitable, adding that it would consider resuming dividend payments when it did. French Connection said in a statement that it expects the strategic review, including the formal sale process, to conclude during the first half of 2019. On Oct. 8, the company said it could be sold as it was reviewing its strategic options, sending its shares surging as much as 45 percent on the day.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he presumes missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is dead and that the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia will likely be “very severe” but that he still wanted to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. Turkish police are searching a forest on the outskirts of Istanbul and a city near the Sea of Marmara for the remains of Khashoggi more than two weeks after he vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, two senior Turkish officials told Reuters. Trump, who has forged closer ties with Saudi Arabia and the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, had likely been killed. “It certainly looks that way to me. It’s very sad,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One on a political trip. In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Trump based his acknowledgment that Khashoggi was dead on intelligence reports. Turkish officials have said they believe Khashoggi was murdered at the consulate and his body chopped up and removed. Riyadh strongly denies the allegations and said it is investigating the disappearance of the journalist, who was critical of Saudi rulers, calling for reforms. Trump spoke hours after receiving an update from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the results of Pompeo’s emergency talks in Saudi Arabia and Turkey this week. In the New York Times interview, Trump also expressed confidence in intelligence reports that suggest a high-level Saudi role in the suspected killing of Khashoggi. Trump said, however, it was still “a little bit early” to draw definitive conclusions about who may have been behind it. Pompeo told reporters that he advised Trump that Saudi Arabia should be given a few more days to complete its investigation into the disappearance of Khashoggi, which has caused an international outcry and strained Saudi relations with western countries and corporations. Trump said he was waiting for the results so that “we can get to the bottom of this very soon” and that he would be making a statement about it at some point. Asked what would be the consequences for Saudi Arabia, Trump said: “Well, it’ll have to be very severe. I mean, it’s bad, bad stuff. But we’ll see what happens.” The United States considers Riyadh a linchpin in efforts to contain Iran’s regional influence and a key global oil source, and Trump has shown no inclination to mete out harsh punishment to the Saudis. The United States and other Western nations are in a dilemma of how to respond because of lucrative business ties, including weapons sales to Riyadh. Referring to the Saudis, Pompeo said he told Trump that when the Saudi investigation was completed “we can make decisions about how - or if - the United States should respond to the incident surrounding Mr. Khashoggi.” By casting doubt on whether the United States will respond at all, Pompeo reflected the internal struggle among Trump and his national security advisers on what to do should the Saudi leadership be blamed for what happened to Khashoggi. “I think it’s important for us all to remember, too - we have a long, since 1932, a long strategic relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” Pompeo told reporters, also calling Saudi Arabia “an important counterterrorism partner.” A U.S. government source said that U.S. intelligence agencies are increasingly convinced of the crown prince’s culpability in the operation against Khashoggi, which they believe resulted in his death. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin abandoned plans to attend an Oct. 23-25 investor conference in Riyadh as did executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N), putting the high-profile event in question. “This incident is unacceptable and clearly they have to answer questions specifically regarding this incident,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon told CNBC. Earlier on Thursday, senior government ministers from France, Britain and the Netherlands also withdrew from the Riyadh conference, joining a list of international officials and business executives.  How Western allies deal with Riyadh will hinge on the extent to which they believe responsibility for Khashoggi’s disappearance lies with Prince Mohammed and the Saudi authorities.  Trump previously speculated without providing evidence that “rogue killers” could be responsible. After investigations at the Saudi consulate and the consul’s residence, Turkish authorities have widened the geographic focus of the search, the senior Turkish officials said. Investigators tracked the routes and stops of cars that left those two places on Oct. 2, the officials said.  Khashoggi’s killers may have dumped his remains in Belgrad Forest adjacent to Istanbul, and at a rural location near the city of Yalova, a 90-kilometre (55 mile) drive south of Istanbul, the officials said. “The investigations led to some suspicion that his remains may be in the city of Yalova and the Belgrad forest, police have been searching these areas,” one of the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A “farm house or villa” may have been used for the disposal of remains, the official said.    The pro-government Sabah newspaper published a series of photos of a man it identified as someone who travels with the Saudi crown prince. The time-stamped photos showed the man outside the Saudi consulate building in Istanbul on the morning Khashoggi disappeared, Sabah said. Khashoggi went to the consulate seeking documents for his planned marriage to his Turkish fiancee, who was waiting outside, and was never seen again.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, arrived with the gift of much-needed rain and cheer on Wednesday for the rural Australian city of Dubbo, where farmers are struggling with a prolonged drought. The prince charmed the crowd at a picnic in the town’s main park, standing at a podium in pouring rain with Meghan holding an umbrella over him, on the second day of their Pacific tour, which takes in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. “The rain is a gift!” Prince Harry told the thousands who had come out to see the royal couple in Dubbo, about 300 km (185 miles) northwest of Sydney. They had earlier visited a farm hit by the drought and Harry recalled his own stay on an Australian farm 15 years ago, where he said he was chased by countless cattle and perfected the Aussie salute of swatting flies. “You are the salt of the earth. Honest, hard-working, and as tough as they come,” Harry said.  In an issue close to his heart, he urged those facing mental health problems due to the tough times plaguing rural Australia to seek help. “You are all in this together and, if I may say, personally, we are all in this together - because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made. You will be continually amazed how life changes for the better,” he said to cheers and applause.   The royal couple’s visit to Australia coincides with the Invictus Games in Sydney from Oct. 20-27. The games, founded by Harry, are an international paralympic-style event that aims to lift the spirits of wounded military veterans. A 5-year-old boy earlier stole the show in a long line of school children who met the royals at Dubbo airport. Luke Vincent, who has Down Syndrome and adores Santa Claus, threw his arms around Meghan when she knelt down to greet him and tugged at Harry’s beard and patted him on the head when the prince hugged the boy. Meghan, who is expecting the royal couple’s first child in the northern spring, wore skinny black jeans, a white shirt, long gray jacket and black boots with her hair tied back in a pony tail. Prince Harry and Meghan, on their first international tour since marrying in May, also visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Dubbo.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May offered her fellow EU leaders no new Brexit proposals on Wednesday, though she appeared keen to reach an agreement, the head of the European Parliament said. Antonio Tajani spoke after listening to her address in Brussels, where she is meeting the other 27 EU leaders on the talks, stalled over how to ensure a continued open Irish border after Britain leaves. Tajani said May said she would evaluate an idea to extend the post-Brexit transition period by a year from the current cut-off date at the end of 2020 but that the British prime minister did not say whether she would favour that, or not. “There is a message of goodwill, readiness to reach an agreement. But I did not perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs. May,” Tajani said.  “As far as we are concerned, the content is not yet acceptable. But the tone is of somebody who wishes to continue the negotiations and not let them break down,” he said on May’s comments, made to EU leaders behind closed doors. Tajani said the European Parliament, which must endorse any Brexit deal sealed between London and the EU for it to take effect, was in favour of extending the post-Brexit transition period to three years from 21 months. “Both sides mentioned the idea of an extension of the transition period as one possibility which is on the table and would have to be looked into,” he added. “Mrs. May recalled the importance of a UK-wide customs territory... But we are defending the single market.” May’s office had ruled out extending the period even though some members of the government had held out that possibility.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A small group of Turkish investigators are examining the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Wednesday, a Reuters photographer said, the second such search this week of the premises after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared two weeks ago. The search at the consulate appeared to mostly focus on the backyard, the photographer said. Turkish investigators had searched the consulate for nine hours on Monday. They also started searching the Saudi consul’s residence on Wednesday.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey has not shared with the U.S. government or key European allies graphic audio or video evidence it allegedly collected on U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s visit to Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, seven U.S. and European security officials told Reuters.   Two weeks after Khashoggi’s disappearance on Oct. 2, the United States and allies have collected some intelligence through their own sources and methods, which partly confirms news reports based on leaks of audio recordings, four of the sources said. The sources, who requested anonymity, spoke with Reuters on Tuesday and Wednesday. Turkish pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak published on Wednesday what it said were details from audio recordings purportedly documenting Khashoggi’s torture and interrogation.  It reported that his torturers severed his fingers during an interrogation, and that Khashoggi was killed within minutes. According to the report, his body was later beheaded and dismembered by his killers. A New York Times report on Wednesday cited a senior Turkish official confirming the details published by Yeni Safak. Two Turkish government officials contacted by Reuters declined to confirm the report. Turkish sources told Reuters earlier this week that the authorities have an audio recording indicating that Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate and that they were sharing it with countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States. The reluctance of the Turks to turn over hard evidence they have said they have documenting Khashoggi’s fate has led U.S. and European security officials to assess that the most brutal accounts of Khashoggi’s demise are likely accurate, the sources said. U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm the lack of evidence in U.S. hands when he said on Wednesday that the United States had asked Turkey for any audio or video evidence it may have related to Khashoggi. “We have asked for it, if it exists ... I’m not sure yet that it exists, probably does, possibly does,” Trump said. “I’ll have a full report on that from Mike (Pompeo) when he comes back ... That’s going to be the first question I ask,” he said. Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi policies and columnist for the Washington Post who was living in the United States, vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to get marriage documents. Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, is due to return on Wednesday from a trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, where he met with leaders to discuss reports that Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Pompeo has said Riyadh should be given a few more days to complete an investigation into the disappearance of the journalist, a prominent critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Asked aboard his airplane whether he had heard any audio of Khashoggi’s capture, Pompeo declined to comment, but his spokeswoman later told reporters he had not.  The Saudis have strongly denied those allegations but U.S. media outlets have reported that they will acknowledge he was killed in a botched interrogation.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The potential for British online fashion retailer ASOS is “huge” as the shift to internet shopping accelerates, the company said on Wednesday, sending its shares soaring as it beat profit forecasts and flagged years of double-digit sales growth. ASOS’s current plans are for a 4 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) a year business, in terms of revenue, up from 2.4 billion pounds in the year to Aug. 31. “But that’s not the end for us. We will continue to invest and we’re eyeing up a significantly bigger prize than 4 billion pounds,” Chief Executive Nick Beighton told reporters. “The opportunity for ASOS remains huge which is why we’re investing to capture it,” he said. ASOS, which sells fashion aimed at twentysomethings, invested 242 million pounds in its 2017-18 financial year, mainly on warehouses and IT, and plans to spend 230-250 million a year over the medium term. While ASOS and online peer Boohoo continue to report robust sales growth, Britain’s traditional clothing retailers such as Marks & Spencer, Debenhams and House of Fraser are struggling and closing stores. Beighton said online sales currently account for about 24 percent of the UK clothing market and that this is forecast to hit 30 percent within five years. The United States and Europe are following similar patterns. While ASOS’ market share in Britain is 7.5 percent, it is still tiny overseas, with shares of 1.6 percent in the rest of Europe and 0.5 percent in the United States. Prior to Wednesday’s update, ASOS’ shares had fallen 26 percent this year. The stock, listed on London’s junior AIM market, fell sharply in July after the firm missed analysts’ forecasts for third quarter sales growth. ASOS said at the time it had reined in marketing as it focused on ramping up warehouse space in Germany and the United States. [nL8N1U8111] But on Wednesday, the firm hit full-year sales growth forecasts and reported a 28 percent rise in pretax profit. Combined with its confident outlook, that sent its stock as much as 15.4 percent higher. Shares in the 18-year old company were up 590 pence at 5,596 pence at 0850 GMT, giving a market capitalisation of 4.7 billion pounds - just ahead of the 134-year old Marks & Spencer’s at 4.6 billion pounds. “We believe that ASOS remains a structural winner, given the shift online by consumers, together with harnessing the global opportunity as the ‘go-to’ platform for online clothing,” said Shore Capital analyst Greg Lawless, maintaining a “buy” stance. ASOS made a pretax profit of 102 million pounds in the year to Aug. 31 - just ahead of analysts’ average forecast of 101 million pounds, on the back of a 26 percent jump in retail sales and 19 percent rise in active customers. “The underlying business is humming,” said Beighton.  ASOS forecast sales growth of 20-25 percent for the 2018-19 year and expects to grow at that rate for the medium term. The difficulties at traditional store-based retailers in the face of internet competition has prompted calls in Britain for a relaxation of business rates - a property tax - and for the imposition of an online sales tax to level the playing field. “It strikes me the core problem to solve and where the attention should be is on solving corporation tax leakage and fixing business rates,” said Beighton. “We will pay whatever tax the government says we should pay.” ($1 = 0.7601 pounds) Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-asos-results/asos-shares-bounce-back-as-firm-eyes-huge-prize-idUKKCN1MR0NA,2019-02-08,"The potential for British online fashion retailer ASOS is ""huge"" as the shift to internet shopping accelerates, the company said on Wednesday, sending its shares soaring as it beat profit forecasts and flagged years of double-digit sales growth.",ASOS shares bounce back as firm eyes 'huge' prize
2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A hard Brexit could ground UK flights for up to three weeks but would be survivable for Ryanair (RYA.I), the Irish budget airline’s CEO Michael O’Leary said ahead of a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Wednesday. “You can ground aircraft for a week, two weeks, three weeks. It would be very painful,” O’Leary told Reuters in Berlin. “But we are a big company, we can survive.” O’Leary had warned last month that there were no assurances that an agreement would be in place enabling flights to continue after Britain exits the European Union next March. O’Leary said he did not expect Ryanair to grow in Germany next year, after closing its bases in the northern city of Bremen and at Weeze near Duesseldorf. “Our traffic will be flat,” O’Leary said. O’Leary reiterated that he was confident that Ryanair could resolve its dispute with German unions representing pilots and cabin crew. He said talks were making progress and that he did not expect further labor strikes in the coming weeks.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey hopes to enter the Saudi consul’s residence in Istanbul on Wednesday in connection with the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Turkey’s foreign minister said after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Turkish officials have said they believe the journalist was murdered and his body removed, an allegation the Saudis have strongly denied. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident who wrote columns for the Washington Post and he was critical of the Saudi government, calling for reforms. Turkish police had been expected to search the Saudi consul’s Istanbul residence on Tuesday. They did not do so, officers at the scene said late on Tuesday, because Saudi officials were not able to join. Hours earlier, the consul general left Turkey for Riyadh. “Yesterday evening, unfortunately, police could not search the Saudi consul’s residence. The Saudis claimed that the consul’s family was inside,” Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters after meeting Pompeo.  “We hope the police will enter to the residence today. We have said before that Saudi Arabia must cooperate with us in every aspect without delay.” Cavusoglu, who said the search would extend to the consul’s vehicles, said the consul was free to travel home and had not been deported. He also said talks with Pompeo were “beneficial and fruitful”. Pompeo was on a brief visit to Turkey after having met with the Saudi king, crown prince and foreign minister in Riyadh on Tuesday. Turkish crime scene investigators carried out a nine-hour search of the consulate on Monday night in an investigation to look into what happened to Khashoggi, who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on Oct. 2. “The consul’s behaviour and approach drew reaction after Khashoggi disappeared,” Cavusoglu said - criticising the way the consul behaved in a Reuters tour of the consulate - “especially how he opened the cabinets saying ‘look he is not here’ as if mocking people, behaving disrespectfully. This was not right.”  Writing by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by David Dolan, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-politics-dissident-turkey/turkey-hopes-to-enter-saudi-consuls-home-on-wednesday-minister-idUKKCN1MR15H,2019-02-08,,Turkey hopes to enter Saudi consul's home on Wednesday - minister

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt in the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi even as  U.S. lawmakers pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership and Western pressure mounted on Riyadh to provide answers.  “I think we have to find out what happened first,” Trump told the Associated Press in an interview on Tuesday. “Here we go again with, you know, you’re guilty until proven innocent. I don’t like that.” Trump then referred directly to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ran into trouble in the Senate after several women came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, before Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed. Earlier, in a Twitter post, Trump said that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied knowing what happened in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where Khashoggi vanished two weeks ago after going there to collect documents he needed for his planned marriage. Turkish officials have said they believe the Saudi journalist was murdered and his body removed, which the Saudis have strongly denied. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident who wrote columns for the Washington Post and he was critical of the Saudi government, calling for reforms. “Just spoke with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate,” Trump wrote on Twitter. Trump also wrote that the crown prince “told me that he has already started, and will rapidly expand, a full and complete investigation into this matter. Answers will be forthcoming shortly.” How the crown prince, often referred to as MbS, emerges when the dust settles over Khashoggi’s disappearance is a test of how the West will deal with Saudi Arabia in the future. At issue will be to what extent the West believes responsibility lies with MbS for Khashoggi. MbS, who has enjoyed a close relationship with the Trump administration, painted himself as the face of a new, vibrant Saudi Arabia, diversifying its economy away from reliance on oil and making some social changes. But there has been mounting criticism of some of the prince’s moves.  These include Riyadh’s involvement in the war in Yemen, the arrest of women activists and a diplomatic dispute with Canada. The kingdom also denied an assertion by France that it held Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri captive in November 2017. Despite Western concerns about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, Trump still says he is unwilling to pull out of weapons sales agreements with Riyadh. Also, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plans to attend a high-profile investment conference in Riyadh starting on Oct. 23. Those are all indications Trump is sticking by Saudi Arabia, the first country he visited as president in 2017. Trump told the AP that Mnuchin’s trip could be cancelled by Friday depending on what the investigation finds. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met with Saudi King Salman, the crown prince and the foreign minister, said his assessment from the meetings was that there was “a serious commitment to determine all the facts and ensure accountability, including accountability for Saudi Arabia’s senior leaders or senior officials. Pompeo is due to travel to Turkey on Wednesday.  Pompeo and Trump’s remarks reflect a dilemma for the United States, Britain and other Western nations in how to respond to an authoritarian monarchy that does not typically bow to foreign pressures. Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter, spends lavishly on Western arms and is a major Sunni Muslim ally. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican close to Trump on some issues, called the crown prince a “toxic” figure, adding, “He can never be a world leader on the world stage.” “I’ve been their biggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate,” Graham said. “This guy is a wrecking ball. He had this guy murdered in a consulate in Turkey and to expect me to ignore it, I feel used and abused,” Graham said. The Group of Seven foreign ministers, including the United States, said in a statement that they remained “very troubled” by Khashoggi’s disappearance, and looked forward to Riyadh conducting a “thorough, credible, transparent and prompt investigation, as announced.” The statement was unusual for a group that normally weighs in on global foreign policy issues and speaks generally about human rights abuses in other countries. U.S. media outlets reported on Monday that Saudi Arabia will acknowledge that Khashoggi was killed in a botched interrogation.  Trump speculated on Monday that “rogue killers” could be behind the disappearance, but gave no evidence to back up that theory. Members of the U.S. Congress, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, are among the loudest voices in the United States demanding answers and action on Khashoggi, who moved to Washington last year fearing retribution for his criticism of the crown prince. Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, outgoing chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said Washington might have to seriously review relations with Saudi Arabia if Riyadh was involved in killing Khashoggi. “If this was a state-sanctioned assassination, which it may prove to be, then there will have to be a fundamental rethinking of our relationship vis-a-vis the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Absolutely,” Hensarling told Reuters. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan indicated that parts of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul had been repainted since Khashoggi’s disappearance. “The investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over,” Erdogan told reporters. A Turkish security source said the search of the consulate provided “strong evidence” but no conclusive proof that Khashoggi was killed there.  The source confirmed that Saudi Consul General Mohammad al-Otaibi left Istanbul on Tuesday, returning to Riyadh. The source said Turkish authorities had not asked him to leave. A search of the Saudi consul’s Istanbul residence was called off for the day because Saudi officials were not able to join, Turkish police said. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had said earlier on Tuesday that Turkish officials would extend their investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance to include the residence of the Saudi consul and some vehicles. Indicating unease over the Khashoggi case, international media and business executives have been pulling out of next week’s investment conference, known as “Davos of the desert.” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) Chief Executive David Schwimmer joined the list on Tuesday, as did the CEOs of HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), and David Bonderman, the billionaire chairman and founding partner of private equity firm TPG. Saudi Arabia has said it would retaliate against any pressure or economic sanctions. CNN reported on Monday that after denying for two weeks any role in Khashoggi’s disappearance, Saudi Arabia was preparing to say he died in a botched interrogation. The New York Times reported that Prince Mohammed had approved an interrogation or abduction of Khashoggi and the government would shield him by blaming an intelligence official. Saudi authorities could not be reached for comment. Turkish authorities have an audio recording indicating that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, Turkish sources have told Reuters.

2019-02-08,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescue teams searched ravaged areas of Florida’s Panhandle on Tuesday for hundreds of people reported missing nearly a week after Hurricane Michael flattened communities in the region and killed at least 27. Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, which had hundreds of volunteers on the ground, said he expects the death toll to rise as phone service is restored and roads are cleared. “For every one person we have made contact with, there are probably three we haven’t,” Marchetti said. Teams from the volunteer organization were searching for more than 1,135 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family, he said. Florida officials have not given a number for how many people are considered to be missing. Debris, downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people, but CrowdSource said a number of its missing person reports resulted from widespread phone and power outages.  The death toll includes 17 in Florida, one in Georgia, three in North Carolina and six in Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were due to the storm. Michael slammed into the northwest coastal strip of Florida last Wednesday with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), unleashing a surge of seawater that demolished homes. In Mexico Beach, which took a direct hit, some residents who returned to survey the damage made some startling discoveries. The storm shoved the top floor of Charles and Janice Anderson’s vacation home hundreds of yards from its foundation - with the living room intact and a stuffed marlin still hanging on the wall.  Most of those missing are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said.  “The hardest hit in disasters are generally our most vulnerable populations,” he said. In nearby Mexico Beach, the number of people missing dropped to three on Tuesday, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. “It’s miraculous if all we have is two fatalities,” said Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey. Nearly 190,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills.  At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless others in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage. The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Marchetti said the search has been hampered by spotty cell phone coverage in the devastated area, though authorities are making progress in restoring communications. Many residents have also expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery of wireless networks. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday called for wireless carriers to waive bills for customers affected by the storm.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk on Tuesday bemoaned the lack of leaders great enough to overcome a deadlock on the Irish border in Brexit talks, which he compared to the Gordian Knot unravelled by Alexander the Great. Casting gloom on the state of play ahead of a summit of EU leaders this week, Tusk said he wished for a leader of the likes of the Macedonian king, fabled to have solved the riddle of the Gordian Knot by slicing through it with one stroke of his sword. “It looks like a new version of the Gordian Knot,” Tusk said of an impasse over how to ensure there is no return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland. “Unfortunately, I can’t see a new version of Alexander the Great,” he quipped. “It’s not so easy to find this kind of creative leader.” With less than six months to go before Britain’s departure, he said he hoped Prime Minister Theresa May would present something creative enough to solve the impasse at the leaders’ summit but added there was not much grounds for optimism. Asked whether May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson might have the mettle to find a solution, Tusk said such claims may be exaggerated.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Paul Allen, the man who persuaded school-friend Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard to start what became the world’s biggest software company, died on Monday at the age of 65, his family said. Allen left Microsoft in 1983, before the company became a corporate juggernaut, following a dispute with Gates, but his share of their original partnership allowed him to spend the rest of his life and billions of dollars on yachts, art, rock music, sports teams, brain research and real estate. Allen died from complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a type of cancer, the Allen family said in a statement. In early October, Allen had revealed he was being treated for the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which he also was treated for in 2009. He had an earlier brush with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, another cancer, in the early 1980s before leaving Microsoft. Music-lover Allen had a list of high-profile friends in the entertainment business, including U2 singer Bono, but preferred to avoid the limelight at his compound on Mercer Island, across Lake Washington from Seattle, where he grew up. Allen remained loyal to the Pacific Northwest region, directing more than $2 billion to mostly local philanthropic projects, developing Seattle’s South Lake Union tech hub that Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) calls home and building the headquarters of his Allen Institute for Brain Science there. Gates described Allen as following the Microsoft partnership with a “second act” focused on strengthening communities and in a statement said, “I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends.” Current Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Monday called him a “quiet and persistent” man who changed the world. “He is under-appreciated in Seattle,” said David Brewster, founder of local news website Crosscut.com and the Seattle Weekly newspaper. “He’s remote and reclusive. There’s too much Howard Hughes in the way he behaves for Seattle truly to appreciate a lot of the good that he does.” Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, the son of a librarian father and teacher mother. He was two years older than Gates but when they met in the computer room at the exclusive Lakeside School in Seattle in 1968, they discovered a shared passion. “In those days we were just goofing around, or so we thought,” Gates recalled in his 1995 book “The Road Ahead.” Allen went on to Washington State University but dropped out in 1974 to take a job with Honeywell in Boston. While there, he pestered Gates, who was studying at nearby Harvard, to quit school and join the nascent revolution in personal computing. Gates finally agreed and in 1975 the two jointly developed BASIC software for the Altair 8800, a clunky desktop computer that cost $400 in kit form. The pair moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, close to the Altair’s maker, and formed a company. It was Allen’s idea to call it Micro-Soft, an amalgam of microcomputer and software. The hyphen was later dropped. Allen was in charge of Microsoft’s technical operations for the company’s first eight years, making him one of the handful of people who created early software such as MS-DOS and Word that enabled the PC revolution and thrust Microsoft to the top. But he had ceased to be on the cutting edge of software development by the early 1980s. He never displayed the commercial instinct of Gates, who generally is credited with powering Microsoft’s rise to ubiquity in the 1990s. Allen left Microsoft in 1983 after falling out with Gates and his new lieutenant, Steve Ballmer, in December 1982, only months after being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. As he recalled in his 2011 memoir “Idea Man,” he overheard Gates and Ballmer secretly plotting to reduce his ownership stake. “They were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,” Allen wrote. Gates and Ballmer later apologized but the damage was done and Allen left Microsoft, although he remained on the board until 2000. Allen recovered from his cancer after radiation treatment but in 2009 was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, another form of blood cancer. He went into remission in April 2010 but the disease resurfaced in 2018. Allen held onto his share of the company. His 28 percent stake at Microsoft’s initial public offering in 1986 instantly made him a multi-millionaire. His wealth peaked at about $30 billion in late 1999, according to Forbes magazine, but Allen was hurt by the sharp decline in Microsoft stock after the dot.com bubble burst in 2000 and some unprofitable technology investments. In October 2018, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $21.7 billion and said he was the 44th richest person in the world. Allen, the owner of 42 U.S. patents, liked to cast himself as a technology visionary who drove Microsoft’s early success and saw the future of connected computing long before the Internet. “I expect the personal computer to become the kind of thing that people carry with them, a companion that takes notes, does accounting, gives reminders, handles a thousand personal tasks,” Allen wrote in a column in Personal Computing magazine as far back as 1977, long before portable computers became a reality. In the same year, he outlined an early vision of what turned out to be the Internet to Microcomputer Interface magazine.  “What I do see is a home terminal that’s connected to a centralized network by phone lines, fiber optics or some other communication system,” he said. “With that system you can perhaps put your car up for sale or look for a house in a different city or check out the price of asparagus at the nearest grocery market or check the price of a stock.”  Allen later called this sweeping idea the “wired world,” which has broadly come to fruition. He was not alone in predicting connected computing but was one of the most prominent. Yet Allen’s technology ventures after Microsoft, which focused on areas he thought would grow with the advent of the “wired world,” were not as successful. He lost $8 billion in the cable television industry, chiefly with a bad bet on cable company Charter Communications (CHTR.O), while technology ventures he bankrolled such as Metricom, SkyPix and Interval Research were costly failures. He had better luck in sports and real estate. Allen bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988 and became a local hero in 1997 when he purchased the Seattle Seahawks football franchise after the previous owner had tried to move the team to California. The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in February 2014 and both franchises are now valued at many times what Allen paid for them. Allen also made hundreds of millions of dollars redeveloping South Lake Union, a shabby area of downtown Seattle that became a gleaming technology Mecca and site of Amazon.com’s glass “spheres” headquarters. All the while, the never-married Allen pursued myriad personal projects and pastimes. He owned one of the world’s biggest yachts, the 400-foot (122 meters) Octopus, which was the venue for many lavish parties and the base for scuba expeditions.  A rock ‘n’ roll aficionado, Allen had a band on call to jam with when he wanted, and spent more than $250 million building a museum devoted to his hero, Jimi Hendrix, which morphed into a music and science fiction exhibit designed by Frank Gehry. He spent millions more on a collection of vintage warplanes and funded the first non-government rocket to make it into space. He also collected priceless antiquities and works by Monet, Rodin and Rothko to put in his extensive art collection. Like Gates, Allen was a dedicated philanthropist, giving away more than $1.5 billion in his lifetime and pledging to donate more than half his wealth to charity. Through various vehicles, Allen focused his giving on brain science, motivated by the loss of his mother to Alzheimer’s disease, along with universities and libraries.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are expecting their first child in the spring of 2019, around a year after their glittering wedding injected Hollywood glamour into the British royal family. Harry, 34, younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, married the U.S. television star Meghan Markle in May at a ceremony that mixed traditional British pomp with a gospel choir and other nods to her American heritage. British media said Meghan, 37, was believed to be about 12 weeks pregnant. The baby will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. “Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public,” the couple’s Kensington Palace office said in a statement.    The news emerged shortly after the royal couple landed in Australia for their first overseas tour, a busy trip which will also take in New Zealand and the South Pacific islands of Tonga and Fiji. British media said Harry and Meghan broke the news of their pregnancy to the royal family on Friday, when they attended the wedding of Harry’s cousin Princess Eugenie at Windsor Castle, where Harry and Meghan themselves were married five months ago. There had been media speculation for a number of weeks that Meghan might be pregnant, and the couple had made no secret of their desire to have children. “Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future,” Harry had said in a TV interview when they announced their engagement in November last year. The child will not be a prince or a princess unless the queen authorises such a title before the birth. Instead, royal experts said if a boy, the child would officially be styled the Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harry’s subsidiary titles - and Lady Windsor if a girl. “My warmest congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the happy news they are expecting a baby in the Spring,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Twitter. “Wishing them all the best.”  After their arrival in Australia on Monday, Meghan and Harry were escorted by a motorcade to the residence of Australia’s Governor-General on Sydney’s north shore.  Braving rain, well-wishers lined the streets to Admiralty House where the pair were later spotted by local press enjoying a walk, hand in hand, through the grounds as they recovered from the long plane journey. Their official duties will begin on Tuesday with a ferry trip across Sydney Harbour and past the Opera House, a visit to Taronga Zoo to see koalas and a viewing of a contemporary indigenous dance troupe.

2019-02-08,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Political and civic groups backing Scottish independence from the United Kingdom started a fundraising drive on Monday to push support for secession above 50 percent. The initiative is a sign of growing frustration with Prime Minister Theresa May’s plans to take Britain out of the European Union, as well as pressure on Scotland’s pro-independence first minister Nicola Sturgeon.  With less than six months to go before Britain leaves the EU, May’s government has yet to agree a divorce deal.  Sturgeon has said she will wait to see the detail of any agreement before deciding on Scotland’s own path. The website “ThisIsIt”, which pools 18 Scottish nationalist groups, said it was seeking funds to pay for the professional campaign needed to push up public support for independence. “Scotland did not vote for Theresa May’s disastrous vision of Brexit,” it said. “The crisis we face shows that Scotland must go its own way.” The campaign raised over 12,000 pounds ($15,780) within a few hours on Monday, just over a third of its initial target. It aims to raise 180,000 pounds in total.  Scotland voted 62-38 percent to stay in the EU in Britain’s referendum on membership in June 2016, two years after rejecting independence by 55-45 percent in another, legally binding, plebiscite.  Britain as a whole voted 52-48 to leave the EU, taking Scotland with it.  Sturgeon says that the only solution to Scotland’s Brexit “problem” is independence. But she is wary of calling for a new vote only for May to refuse to consider it. Britain’s parliament, which is sovereign, needs to sign off on any new referendum. Sturgeon has tried to persuade May to keep the UK in the EU’s single market after Brexit, but many in May’s own conservative party want to break with the EU altogether.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British taxes would need to rise to their highest since just after World War Two to sustainably meet Prime Minister Theresa May’s goal of ending the austerity squeeze on public services, a think tank said ahead of her government’s annual budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said higher taxes need not hurt the economy but May’s fragile hold on power, as she attempts to navigate Brexit, made significant increases unlikely in the Oct. 29 budget statement. Instead, efforts to lighten Britain’s debt burden were the likeliest casualty of May’s promise to end austerity, potentially leaving the country vulnerable when the next economic crisis hits. “Increasing borrowing is clearly the line of least resistance,” IFS director Paul Johnson said. “It’s going to be very hard, for all sorts of very obvious reasons, for anything very substantial in terms of tax rises in the short run.” Last year, finance minister Philip Hammond backed down on planned tax rises for the self-employed which angered Conservative lawmakers. May’s minority government now relies on Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party which has threatened to vote against the budget if London does not heed its Brexit concerns. “At a point where you don’t have a parliamentary majority, the public finances don’t tend to be looked after in such a conservative way as they might otherwise,” Johnson said. Weak economic growth made deficit reduction much slower than the Conservatives expected when they took office in 2010. Hammond has said he aims to run a balanced budget by the mid-2020s.     At 1.9 percent of gross domestic product, the budget deficit last year was the lowest since the 2001/02 financial year.  But public debt more than doubled as a share of GDP after the financial crisis to above 80 percent, and has only recently started to fall. May did not specify what she meant when she told her Conservative Party’s annual conference that austerity “is over” on Oct. 3.  The non-partisan IFS said even a narrow interpretation of no more real-terms cuts for public services but a continued welfare squeeze would leave a 19 billion-pound hole in Hammond’s budget plans. Filling the hole via tax rises would need tax as a share of GDP to rise by 1 percentage point to 35 percent of GDP. “Doing that would mean having a tax burden that we haven’t had for a sustained period since the late 1940s,” IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said. However, this would still leave British taxation mid-table by international standards — above the United States and Japan but more than 10 percentage points below France and Denmark.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A British academic has been charged for spying in the United Arab Emirates, UAE authorities said on Monday, five months after he was arrested at the end of a study trip. Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old doctoral student at Durham University, was arrested on May 5 at Dubai airport after a two-week visit and has been kept in solitary confinement since then, his wife Daniela Tejada said last week. “The Attorney General of United Arab Emirates ... confirmed today that Mr. Matthew Hedges, a British Citizen, has been charged with spying for and on behalf of a foreign State, jeopardizing the military, economy and political security of the UAE,” the government said in a statement. Investigators had gathered evidence from Hedges’ electronic devices and intelligence from UAE security agencies, the statement said. The British Foreign Office did not immediately reply for a request for comment. British authorities have said they raised Hedges’ case with the UAE previously. Hedges appeared at a court in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi last week, after a first hearing earlier this month, but was not informed of any charges, his wife, Daniela Tejada, said, adding that she had been told his trial would resume on Oct. 24. “Matt was in the UAE to carry out academic research for his PhD. Since he was detained on May 5, 2018 he has only ever been granted two consular visits which is in direct violation of his rights,” she said.         According Durham University’s website, Hedges is a doctoral student in the School of Government and International Affairs whose research interests include civil-military relations, political economy and tribalism. Last year, he co-authored an article in an academic journal on the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the UAE is a member. The UAE is a tourism and trade hub for the Middle East, but tolerates little public criticism of its monarchy or policies and is opposed to the Islamist ideology of the Brotherhood.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brains, sweat and toil over the past week brought British and EU civil servants to the brink of a Brexit deal at the weekend, but in the end the painful history and fraught future of a divided Ireland defeated them. EU sources familiar with events in the European Commission’s Brussels headquarters over the weekend told Reuters more work was needed on the so-called Irish “backstop”. But it is now mostly up to political leaders to unravel a knot that has defied the creativity of Europe’s finest diplomatic brains.  “There is only so much we can do,” said an EU diplomat. “The Brits are not ready, they need more time,” he added. He echoed a widely held view that British Prime Minister Theresa May needs more of a sense of political crisis at home in order to persuade hardline political allies to give up the last concessions needed for agreement. Teams led by Oliver Robbins, May’s Europe adviser, and Sabine Weyand, German deputy to French chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, worked long hours, often into the night, over the past week and were still thrashing over ways to bridge gaps late on Saturday in the hope of an Irish solution. But by early Sunday, despite clearing out conflicts on other issues in what diplomats called an atmosphere of rising mutual appreciation, it seemed the Irish border was a bridge too far. London was still loath to endorse even the most modest insurance clause that might one day treat Northern Ireland differently from the British mainland in the interest of keeping the fragile province’s land border open, a key aspect of the 1998 peace deal that ended decades of Irish sectarian bloodshed. May’s “backstop” solution remained keeping the whole of the United Kingdom inside the EU customs area longer than planned until a new UK-EU trade deal is agreed that would ensure there is no friction on the Ireland-Northern Ireland border - but with a get-out clause to avoid this backstop becoming permanent. The Europeans had scaled back demands on Ireland as far as they could, offering to extend the whole United Kingdom’s place inside the EU customs area by a year and keep any checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the mainland discreet.  But they could not agree to sign a withdrawal treaty that leaves the Irish border issue dependent on the uncertain result of future talks on EU-UK trade relations. The British complained that the EU wanted a “backstop to the backstop” and said No. Addressing the British parliament on Monday, May urged the EU not to allow a stand-off over the Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable. When May’s Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab flew in to meet Barnier in late afternoon on Sunday to formally convey Britain’s red line on the backstop, that meeting not only did nothing to ease the impasse but, said EU sources, seemed to reopen other issues that the technical negotiators thought were closed. Leaders of the other 27 EU states will now meet over dinner in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss how to proceed. They have invited May to speak to them ahead of their regular EU summit on Thursday but they will try not to negotiate with her. They will take account of a briefing from Barnier to their Europe ministers on Tuesday in Luxembourg, and any new moves from May, who told parliament in London on Monday that the Irish backstop blockage should not derail Brexit talks.  Some, notably including French President Emmanuel Macron, want to press Britain - and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) which props up May’s minority government - to give ground, in part by stepping up planning for a “no deal” outcome next March, widely seen as risking economic upheaval. Other leaders, say diplomats involved in discussions among envoys on Brexit tactics, warned after the weekend debacle to go easy and not repeat the kind of angry cross-Channel rhetoric that followed their last summit with May in Salzburg last month. For now, the line for EU negotiators is, in an echo of a classic British expression, “keep calm and carry on”, hoping that the politicians can find a way to get out of their hole. “It may take longer for the panic around a no-deal to sink in and, hopefully, soften the DUP line,” said an EU diplomat. “And there has never been an EU deal done before the 11th hour.” Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Mark Heinrich",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-negotiations/border-blockade-irish-riddle-defies-creative-brexit-minds-idUKKCN1MP248,2019-02-08,"By Francesco Guarascio, Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald",Border blockade: Irish riddle defies creative Brexit minds
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares hit their lowest level since December 2016 in early trading after as trade wars, rising U.S. yields, Brexit and the Italy/EU budget row continued to weigh on markets, before recovering modestly to end the day up 0.1 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 had last week suffered its biggest drop since February. Noting that Wall Street had also managed to stage a rebound on Friday, ING analysts said the risks were still significant. “Just as you shouldn’t breathe too big a sigh of relief after earth tremors end, we remain anxious of a market that seems jittery, even against the backdrop of a very strong U.S. economy,” they told clients. European shares have underperformed their American peers since the beginning of the year and analysts believe companies that fail to meet expectations during the third quarter earnings season will be severely punished.   Indeed, early company reports on Monday indicated investors had no patience for below-par results. Shares in the Spanish supermarket chain Dia sank 40 percent after it issued its third profit warning in 12 months and suspended 2019 dividend payments. “That a full-year EBITDA shortfall of up to 30 percent should emerge less than three months from year end is worrying enough,” wrote Jefferies analysts.  “For this to materialise at a time of worsening leverage profile, historical restatements and drastic changes in leadership will add considerably to investors’ concerns on Dia.” British medical technology firm ConvaTec was the worst performer on the STOXX 600, losing a third of its market value after cutting its forecast and announcing its CEO was stepping down. A profit warning from the British fashion group Superdry sent its shares down 17 percent. Swedish medical equipment Getinge fell 18 percent after announcing a 200.5 million provision related to surgical mesh product liability claims. Among the winners was Danish food science firm Chr Hansen, up 4.3 percent after delivering better-than expected results and a strong outlook. Shares in miner Randgold Resources were also among the top performers, up 5.2 percent, as gold prices hit a near- 12-week high with investors looking for safe havens. The telecoms sector was the best-performing, up 1.6 percent as investors’ search for safer assets drove them into sectors considered “defensive” for their high dividend payouts. Overall, oil and gas stocks helped support gains, up 0.7 percent as crude prices climbed on geopolitical tensions over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The pan-European STOXX 600, currently at a 22-month low, is itself down almost 12 percent since its January peak, and 290 of its 600 components have lost at least 20 percent in value from their highest levels in the last 52 weeks. Two sectors stand out particularly in the retreat: the automotive industry and banks, which have lost roughly 28 percent and 25 percent respectively. While Wall Street’s buoyant indexes managed to bounce back last Friday after the biggest scare since a market correction in February, shares in Asia and in Europe are currently failing to recover. The divergence between bullish U.S. stock markets and the rest of global stock markets has been a red flag for investors since the beginning of the year. (Graphic: reut.rs/2yGacoQ) European equities have struggled as political turmoil and the region’s vulnerability to trade risks starkly contrasted with the allure of tax cuts, stock buybacks and a booming economy in the United States. A poll of about 30 brokers, fund managers and analysts at the end of August showed that the STOXX 600 index was expected to rise by only 2.8 percent to 400 points by year-end, but this forecast looks increasingly optimistic. “I was one of the most pessimistic but I think I was right,” said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets who participated in the poll and expects the index to end the year at 350 points. Hit by a toxic mix of rising U.S. Treasury yields, a strong dollar, slowing domestic growth, an escalating Sino-U.S. trade war and rising oil prices, equities from emerging markets are already deep into bear market territory, down more than 25 percent, and have lost more than $1.1 trillion in value.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has asked its climate change experts to advise on whether it should set a date to meet a net zero emissions target, the government said on Monday. Britain has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2050, but campaigners have warned this does not go far enough to meet pledges made under the Paris climate agreement. The move comes a week after a United Nations report warned the world needs to make unprecedented changes in the way people use energy to curb global temperature rises and limit the worst effects of climate change such as more extreme weather and loss of species. Britain’s Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry has asked the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to examine whether the target should be reviewed and if the country should set a date to meet net zero emissions. “The evidence is clear – governments, businesses and communities must take further action to confront one of the greatest global challenges we’ve ever faced,” Perry said in a statement on Monday. Under the Paris agreement more than 190 nations agreed in 2015 to pursue efforts to limit a rise in global temperatures this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The CCC said it would consider how and by when Britain can eliminate carbon emissions from its economy and look at whether the country’s 2050 target is still fit for purpose.

2019-02-08,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Three days before U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping portrayed Beijing as the champion and defender of globalisation at the Davos World Economic Forum amid rising fears of trade protectionism.  A few months later, as Xi launched a forum on China’s vast Belt and Road effort, promising to spread Chinese investment and soft power through the world, it appeared his country’s global stature was rising. But now the lustre on Beijing’s trade and investment story has dulled amid rising U.S. tariffs, higher interest rates and capital flight from emerging markets, all of which threaten to erode global growth. At the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali, some of that sentiment spilled into the open.  “I think there is a broad view growing in the West that China has in some ways taken advantage of the system,” said Charles Dallara, former head of the Institute of International Finance, who attended the meetings. “It reminds me of the view in the West of Japan in the 1980s, very much so.” Calls to fix global trading rules are tellingly coming not just from the Trump administration. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde this week laid out what needed to be done. “This means looking at the distortionary effects of state subsidies, improving the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and taking steps to ensure effective competition - to avoid the excesses of market-dominant positions,” she said at a trade conference during the Bali meetings. Lagarde did not mention China, but all those issues are charges frequently levelled by the Trump administration. Others were less restrained. “We absolutely need to address the issue of overcapacities in China. Nobody can say that this is not a problem. This has to be dealt with,” European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici said at the same event.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struck a more confident tone at the Bali meetings compared with similar gatherings over the last year, when he was the target of near-universal criticism over Trump’s tariff plans.        Fresh off a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, and with trade talks coming soon with the European Union and Japan, the U.S. administration is trying to build a coalition of allies to revamp global trade rules to combat technology transfer and other trade policies it associates with China.     Mnuchin said U.S. allies first viewed Trump’s trade views as simply protectionist but now have a better understanding of his desire for “free, fair and reciprocal trade.” “This is not a coalition to pressure China. This is a coalition of like-minded people who have very similar issues as it relates to China,” Mnuchin said. China is still a major political and economic power, but Chinese officials appeared more on the defensive this week, with the tone of debate at some IMF forums shifting more quickly than Beijing may have expected. Vice finance minister Zou Jiayi, on a World Bank panel on Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative, found herself fielding  questions from other panelists and the audience over debt sustainability, how effectively small countries could negotiate with Beijing, and whether the effort was viable in the midst of a protracted trade war. The debt burdens from the Belt and Road initiative came into sharper focus as Pakistan, a major recipient of Chinese-financed port, rail and road projects, formally sought an IMF bailout programme during the Bali meetings. Zou said China was using risk analysis methods from bodies such as the IMF and World Bank, and would supervise the projects’ debt more vigorously.  But she also said that they are essentially commercial projects and that countries should exercise caution and make their own evaluations of their commercial viability. And she said some of the risks came from a drastic change in external environment, giving an example of an unnamed African country with sound debt levels that sank into crisis after oil prices tanked and its currency fell. David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury official and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who spoke on the panel, said that Belt and Road could reduce trade costs, but that more work needed to be done.  “For low-income countries, there is really this risk of taking on too much debt even if the projects are very, very good,” Dollar said.      Some delegates from China at the Bali IMF and World Bank meetings expressed frustration that Beijing’s agenda was being bypassed while international institutions had largely been ineffective in deterring Trump’s tariff actions. “Personally I think unfortunately the G20 hasn’t contributed much to reconciliation and coordination of macroeconomic policies across the world,” said Xiang Songzuo, deputy director of International Monetary Institute at Renmin University of China, who was a speaker at a sideline event during the meetings in Bali. “We wish all these forums including G20, UN, World Bank, IMF, WTO, would become stronger, stronger and more productive in containing all these wrong things - protectionism, unilateralism,” Xiang added.  The current leaders of the G20, which bills itself as a leading forum that seeks to develop global policies and address the most pressing challenges, conceded that it is effectively sidelined on trade. “The G20 can play a role in providing the platform for discussions,” said Argentine Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne, chairman of this year’s G20 finance leaders’ meeting. “But the differences that still persist should be resolved by the members that are directly involved in the tensions.” Although there are reports that Xi and Trump will meet at the G20 leaders’ summit on November, Mnuchin told Reuters that currency issues would be part of trade talks, and that the onus was squarely on China to take concrete steps before trade talks could resume. “This can’t just be talk; there have to be meaningful commitments to create a rebalanced trading relationship,” Mnuchin told reporters on Saturday, adding that structural changes were needed to balance the relationship. “This is not about buying more soybeans and buying more LNG,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial regulator has fired a warning shot at payday lenders amid a rise in complaints about unaffordable loans and following the collapse of Wonga earlier this year. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Monday that it had sent a so-called “Dear CEO” letter to providers of high-cost short-term credit asking them to assess whether their creditworthiness assessments are compliant and whether borrowers should be reimbursed. The watchdog has also told lenders to inform it immediately if the cost of compensating customers with grievances will leave firms unable to meet their financial commitments. The warning comes amid an increase in complaints about unaffordable lending, including where so-called chains of loans, where an individual borrows repeatedly over an extended period, the FCA said.  It also follows the failure of payday lender Wonga in August, which collapsed following a jump in customer compensation claims after a crackdown on the sector in Britain.

2019-02-08,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has invited Pope Francis to visit, its President Tsai Ing-wen said, just weeks after the Vatican reached a milestone deal on the appointment of bishops with China, which claims the self-ruled island as its own.   Last month’s deal gives the Holy See, Taiwan’s last remaining diplomatic ally in Europe, a long-sought say over such appointments, although both sides call it “provisional” and sources have said some key issues remain unresolved. Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen met Francis on Sunday and invited him to visit, Tsai’s office said in a statement, adding that the pope had replied he would pray for Taiwan. But it gave no date for the proposed visit.  Chen emphasized the provisional nature of the agreement between the Vatican and China, saying it did not involve a “diplomatic element” or affect the friendship between Taiwan and the Vatican, the statement added. “We urge everyone not to excessively interpret and worry about this (deal),” it quoted Chen as saying. On social media, Tsai thanked the pope for his blessings. “We will take active and concrete actions to support the pope and to transmit our common values of freedom, justice, peace and care to all corners of the world,” she wrote. Although the Vatican says its Sept. 22 deal is not political, some Taiwan officials worry it could be a prelude to establishing diplomatic ties with Beijing, and Taiwan’s Vatican envoy has said China wants to make the island irrelevant.      Taipei has routinely accused China, which considers it a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to return it to the fold, of using dollar diplomacy and bullying to lure away its allies, charges Beijing has denied. This year, former allies El Salvador, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic switched ties to Beijing from Taipei, leaving it with just 17 formal allies, mostly less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific. On Oct. 1, in the first sign of a thaw after the pact, which was more than 10 years in the making, the Vatican said Beijing would, for the first time, allow Chinese bishops to attend a major Vatican meeting. The meeting, known as a synod, began on Oct. 3 and runs until Oct. 28. However, Michael Yeung, the bishop of Hong Kong, told Reuters it will take time to tackle issues beyond the appointment of bishops and he feared suppression of Catholics in mainland China would continue despite the accord. About a dozen bishops and priests, some elderly, remain in detention in China. Some have not been heard from in decades. Beijing has provided little clear information about their fate.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is sincere and really means to abandon nuclear weapons, South Korean President Moon Jae-in told a French newspaper, adding that the international community needed to reward him for that. Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged at a landmark summit in Singapore in June to work towards denuclearisation. But the agreement was short on specifics and talks have made little headway since, with the North refusing to declare its nuclear weapons and facilities or agree to a concrete timeline. “This year I have discussed in depth with Kim for hours. These meetings have convinced me that he has taken the strategic decision to abandon his nuclear weapon,” Moon told Le Figaro in an interview before a state visit to Paris.  Moon is to meet President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. While Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests this year, it failed to keep its promise to allow international inspections of its dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in May, stirring criticism that the move could be reversed. But Moon said Kim was “sincere, calm and polite” and “felt frustrated by the international community’s continuing mistrust”. “It is now time to respond to these efforts that were hard to agree to,” Moon said. “We need to assure Kim Jong Un that he took the right decision in deciding to denuclearise and we need to accompany him in his wish for a durable and solid peace.”     Washington wants concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities, before meeting Pyongyang’s demands, including an official end to the Korean war and the easing of international sanctions. Moon said he hoped another Trump-Kim summit would allow the two leaders to go further than the statements they made at their first meeting in Singapore. “Declaring an end to the Korea war would be a start to establishing a regime of peace,” he said, also calling for the United States to take “reliable corresponding measures to guarantee the security of the regime”.  “We could also in the future discuss the easing of sanctions, in accordance with progress on denuclearisation,” he added.

2019-02-08,"SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - In 1980, a day after urging El Salvador’s military to halt a string of abuses that would inflame a 12-year civil war in the impoverished country, Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero was shot dead while leading Mass. His homilies had blasted the U.S.-backed military dictatorship while voicing solidarity with the poor, making him a Latin American human rights icon. On Sunday at the Vatican, he will become a Roman Catholic saint. Romero was considered for canonization decades ago, but his nomination stalled on concerns that he was overly political. [nL5N1QP2OH] His reputation rebounded in 2015, when Pope Francis, a fellow Latin American committed to defending the poor, declared him a martyr who had been killed for hatred of the faith. Romero critiqued the military government and armed leftist groups alike. That earned him animosity from both sides ahead of a civil war that lasted until 1992, leaving some 75,000 people dead and sending thousands of Salvadorans fleeing to the United States. In 1980, at a church altar, he found a bomb meant to take his life. “Persecution is necessary in the Church. Do you know why? Because the truth is always persecuted,” he said at the time.  Two weeks later, undeterred by death threats, the man distinguished by his bushy eyebrows and thick glasses spoke directly to soldiers. “I beg you, I beseech you, I order you in the name of God: stop the repression,” he said. The following day, a sniper killed the 62-year-old as he delivered Mass at a hospital chapel in the capital. The main suspect is a former soldier. Romero’s murder was one of the most shocking of the long conflict between a series of U.S.-backed governments and leftist rebels in which right-wing and military death squads killed thousands. Romero was born in 1917 in a small coffee-growing town in Honduras, the second of eight brothers. As a boy, he apprenticed as a carpenter before entering the seminary and studying theology in Rome. In 1943, he returned to El Salvador as a parish priest until becoming Archbishop of San Salvador in 1977. The military’s killing, kidnapping and arrests of priests who supported workers’ rights turned him into a staunch critic of the regime.  The Vatican said the miracle cementing his sainthood was the 2015 survival of Cecilia Flores, whose husband prayed to Romero when she was close to death in pregnancy. “Doctors told my husband ... only a miracle will save your wife,” Flores said. After her husband began praying, she instantly recovered and gave birth to a healthy son, she added.  Salvadoran Cardinal Jose Gregorio Rosa said Romero’s sainthood will serve as an example for religious leaders as well as the faithful. “It’s the greatest thing a human being can achieve, an incredible joy,” he said.

2019-02-08,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - After suffering months of capital outflows, policy makers from emerging markets attending IMF-World Bank meetings in Indonesia had a message for leading economies: current monetary and trade policies risk undermining us all.     The International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings wrapping up on Sunday gave central bankers and finance ministers from around the world a chance to meet face-to-face in Indonesia, whose rupiah currency hit a new 20-year low this week.   Poorer and populous emerging markets have been particularly vulnerable to the escalating U.S.-Sino tariff war and rate rises by the U.S. central bank. Investors dumped assets seen as riskier, sparking painful currency plunges that have punished countries from India to recession-hit South Africa, as well as triggering crises in Turkey and Argentina. “We are all aware that the normalisation of the monetary policy in the U.S., combined with their fiscal policy and trade policy ... are all creating a systemic impact to the whole economy in the world,” Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in an interview during the meetings in Bali.   The Federal Reserve’s nearly three-year-old tightening cycle has in part prompted a global shift in capital away from emerging markets and after three hikes this year, it foresees another December rise, three more next year, and one in 2020. A senior Fed official in Bali said the rate rises were right for domestic policy and ensuring they were gradual and predictable was “the best solution” for minimising unintended volatility in emerging markets. In a bid to support the rupiah, Bank Indonesia has raised rates five times since mid-May and intervened regularly, but still the currency has lost nearly 11 percent this year, leaving it at the weakest levels since the 1998 Asian financial crisis. Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said that the 150 basis point rate hikes since mid-May aimed to keep Indonesian assets attractive enough for foreigners to stay invested, but calibrating this in the current environment was hard.  “The risk premia are very difficult to incorporate because risk premia are responding to geopolitical, responding to trade tension,” Warjiyo told a panel in Bali.  Finance ministers for developing nations in the Group of 24 economies urged major economies to reform the global trading system, rather than discard it. The G24 statement, issued on the sidelines of the Bali meetings, said all emerging markets were “adversely affected” by excessive capital flow volatility.     While many countries shared common fears, Indrawati said it was difficult to forge cooperation to counter the risks. “It’s not really clear how the world is going to coordinate more effectively, especially when each country has their own domestic issues,” she said.  The Philippine peso has shed nearly 8 percent this year and its deputy central bank governor, Diwa Guinigundo, said the IMF and other global institutions should advise advanced economies on the potential negative consequences of their moves. “It’s the spillovers that we are concerned with ... the spillover could have effects from one market to the other, from the financial market to the real market,” said Guinigundo.  He said while it was good for policymakers to be ahead of the curve in tightening, they should take account of the growing clout of emerging markets. “It should also be emphasized that ASEAN+3 (China, Japan, Korea), we account for a good bulk of the world’s population and GDP.” IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde urged members at the meeting to “de-escalate” trade tensions and work on fixing global trade rules. She also warned against adding currency to the trade conflict, saying this would hurt global growth as well as “innocent bystander” nations, including emerging markets that supply commodities to China. Egyptian Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said policy makers in developed countries should understand that if their actions hurt other countries it would have knock-on effects. “You need me. I am a market for you, I am an opportunity for you,” Maait told Reuters. “I don’t believe there will be a winner and a loser. Either all are winners or all are losers.”  Indeed, market ructions have now cascaded through to developed markets with Wall Street seeing a six session slide until a rebound on Friday, amid fears over the trade war between China and the United States. However, other than having effective monetary policies, developing markets can do little to cope with the impact of rate hikes and trade battles, said Jacob Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International. “When elephants fight, the grass suffers.” Additional reporting by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-imf-worldbank-emerging/innocent-bystanders-emerging-economies-struggle-to-contain-capital-outflows-idUKKCN1MO06M,2019-02-08,,'Innocent bystanders' - Emerging economies struggle to contain capital outflows
2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A delegation from Saudi Arabia has arrived in Turkey as part of a joint investigation into the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, three Turkish sources said on Friday. A Saudi source also said a senior royal, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, visited Turkey on Thursday for talks. Later the same day Turkey said the two countries had agreed to form a joint working group - at Riyadh’s initiative - to investigate the case. Saudi state news agency SPA later quoted a Saudi official as welcoming Turkey’s approval of its request to form the team. U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in Ohio, said he had not yet spoken to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman about Khashoggi’s disappearance but would be calling him “pretty soon.” “This is a very serious thing and we’re looking at it in a very serious manner,” Trump said. Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but Turkish officials and his fiancée, who was waiting outside, said he never came out. Turkish sources have told Reuters the initial assessment of the police was that Khashoggi, an outspoken critic of the Saudi government, was deliberately killed inside the consulate.  Riyadh has dismissed the claims. SPA said on Friday that Saudi Arabia’s interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif, condemned the “lies and baseless allegations” against the kingdom, although he praised the joint investigation with Turkey. The Saudi delegation, which arrived in Turkey on Thursday, is meeting a Turkish prosecutor investigating the case as well as representatives from the Justice Ministry, Interior Ministry, police and the national intelligence agency, one source said.       There is no set date for how long the meetings will take, but “very quick results need to be seen”, the source said. The team is now in Istanbul and will continue to work over the weekend, the source added. Prince Khaled, the governor of Mecca, made his brief visit in his capacity as special adviser to King Salman, a source with links to the prince’s family told Reuters, in a move that would suggest the monarch was treating the issue as a priority. President Tayyip Erdogan has previously said that Turkey could not remain silent over Khashoggi’s disappearance and called on officials at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to prove he had left the building. On Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry said the Saudi consulate in Istanbul would be searched as part of the investigation.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Wall Street bankers will show up at an elite Saudi investment conference this month despite a growing exodus of top media companies and business leaders after the disappearance of a Saudi journalist. Mnuchin’s plan to attend the high-profile Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments that he saw no reason to block Saudi Arabian investments in the United States despite concern over the welfare of Jamal Khashoggi. “I am planning on going at this point. If more information comes out and changes, we can look at that, but I am planning on going,” Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. In a letter to Trump, the leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee said Mnuchin should cancel plans to attend the conference unless Saudi Arabia fully discloses what it knows about Khashoggi’s disappearance. “We urge you to use all pressure necessary to encourage greater Saudi cooperation in the investigation into this incident,” said the committee’s chairman, Republican Ed Royce, and its top Democrat, Eliot Engel.  Pressure has mounted on U.S. ally Saudi Arabia since Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policies, went missing. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate. Riyadh has said the claims are baseless. CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg, as well as reporters and editors from the Economist, said they were no longer participating in the conference, which relies heavily on journalists to moderate top sessions. CNBC and Bloomberg, along with Fox Business Network, were among media partners with a big role at the event, which begins on Oct. 23. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi, U.S. mass media conglomerate Viacom Inc CEO Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, said they were no longer going. Entrepreneur Arianna Huffington will also not participate and has resigned from the conference advisory board, her company Thrive Global PR said. The absence of media and technology executives is likely to cast a shadow over the three-day conference, known as “Davos in the desert”, which has become the biggest show for investors to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reform vision. It has attracted some of the world’s business elite,  including Wall Street’s top bosses and executives from multinational media, technology and financial services companies. On Friday, conference organizers removed all the names of attendees from its website as the number of cancellations grew. “Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh,” a Future Investment Initiative spokesperson said. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, listed as a speaker, will not go to Riyadh due to a scheduling conflict, a World Bank official said on Friday.  Asked about business leaders’ doubts about the conference, a Saudi diplomatic source said late on Thursday that he hoped a joint Turkish-Saudi investigation into the affair could reach a conclusion before the event began. However, the fallout over Khashoggi’s welfare shows signs of extending beyond conference participation. British billionaire Richard Branson said his Virgin Group would suspend discussions with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in the group’s space ventures. On Wednesday, former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said he had suspended his role on the board of Saudi Arabia’s planned mega business zone NEOM - another of Prince Mohammed’s large projects - until more is known about what happened to Khashoggi. While many media and technology executives have abandoned the conference, the financial industry showed no signs of doing so. None of the financial firms whose senior executives were scheduled to speak said they had made any changes to those plans when contacted by Reuters. Europe’s biggest bank, HSBC, declined to comment on whether CEO John Flint is still attending. HSBC is a ‘strategic partner’ of the event, along with Credit Suisse, whose CEO Tidjane Thiam is still planning to attend, according to a source familiar with the matter. Bill Winters, CEO of Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank Standard Chartered is likewise still planning to go, a spokeswoman at the lender told Reuters.    JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon was scheduled to speak, as was Mastercard Inc CEO Ajay Banga. Representatives for those companies, as well as Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment. Siemens AG said CEO Joe Kaeser still planned to attend. High-profile investors also steered clear of announcing plans to abandon the conference. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it was “closely monitoring the situation.” Private equity company Blackstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether CEO Stephen Schwarzman would still speak at the event. A spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, whose CEO David Schwimmer is also a speaker, declined to comment. The exchange has been working for years to attract the listing of Saudi state oil major Aramco. The City of London, Britain’s financial district and one of the main lobbyists for the country’s finance sector, said it is urgently seeking more information on Khashoggi. Its leader Catherine McGuinness is due to attend the conference.

Onlookers gasped and laughed after the bottom half of “Girl with Balloon”, one of Banksy’s best-known works, was sucked into a shredder hidden in its frame as the hammer fell last Friday after a bid of 1,042,000 pounds ($1.38 million) - matching Banksy’s all-time record. “When the hammer came down last week and the work was shredded, I was at first shocked, but gradually I began to realize that I would end up with my own piece of art history,” the buyer, an unnamed female European collector, said according to Sotheby’s. The auction house said the artwork had been granted a certificate by Banksy’s authentication body and has given a new title, “Love is in the Bin”. “Banksy didn’t destroy an artwork in the auction, he created one,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s Head of Contemporary Art, Europe. Banksy himself posted an Instagram picture of shocked attendees watching the painting disintegrate last week, with the caption: “Going, going, gone...” The artist, whose real identity is unknown, is known for sharply ironic outdoor graffiti with political themes, including at Israel’s barrier at the West Bank and Disneyland where he painted a life-size figure of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK/DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she is convinced that jailed photographer Shahidul Alam instigated trouble by spreading what she describes as “false news” about protests against her rule in August.  In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Hasina described Alam, who is known as one of South Asia’s preeminent photographers, as “mentally sick” and blamed his behaviour on his family background – Alam’s great uncle was on the opposing side to Hasina’s father in Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan. She offered no evidence for her accusations, which Alam’s family and lawyer reject.  Alam was arrested in August, hours after criticizing the government’s response to widespread student protests.  His detention has been widely seen as a test for freedom of speech in the country and has sparked worldwide demands for his release. Hasina, who was returned unopposed in 2014 after the opposition boycotted the poll, is seeking a third term in an election at the end of December against a backdrop of growing dissent at what critics believe is her increasingly authoritarian government.     “You are now guilty until proven innocent - we have a reverse system,” said Ataur Rahman, a professor of political science at Dhaka University. “People don’t want to be engaged in debates in case they end up like Shahidul.”     Told of Hasina’s comments, Alam’s family said the government had already decided on his guilt before a trial can be held. “It shows they have already made their judgement,” said Alam’s niece, Dilruba Karim. She added that Hasina’s comments “are hugely cruel and don’t befit the leader of a so-called democracy”. Anisul Huq, a cabinet minister who handles legal affairs in Hasina’s government, said the country’s judicial system has “full independence and freedom”.      Alam, a long-term critic of Hasina’s Awami League, is being investigated under a controversial section of the Information and Communication Technology Act, which Human Rights Watch says has been used by Hasina’s government in a number of arbitrary detentions of government critics and is one of several laws that have been used to stifle free speech. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has called the case “rife with due process violations”, an accusation that Huq denied. Alam’s lawyer, Shahdeen Malik, said his comments during the protests did not constitute a criminal offence, and that Hasina’s remarks regarding Alam’s uncle suggested a “feudal” justice system.      Hasina’s government has also introduced laws that prescribe jail time for those spreading “propaganda” against the country, while her main political rival, Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges she claims were part of a plot to prevent her from challenging Hasina.     The government firmly denies it has interfered with freedom of speech. “No government has safeguarded and upheld principles of freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of press as much as this government of Hasina has done,” Huq said.     Alam was detained for what the government says was misleading reporting on the demonstrations, that began because of the deaths of two school students in a traffic accident before escalating into the widest anti-government protests in years. Alam says he was covering the demonstrations as a photojournalist.     In one of a dozen Facebook videos he posted from the protest site, Alam said he had been attacked and had his camera smashed by “goons” wielding metal rods and sticks from the Chhatra League, a student movement affiliated with the ruling Awami League. He later posted a photograph he said showed men from the movement wearing masks and being allowed to disrupt the protests in full view of police officers. Biplob Barua, a senior leader in the Awami League, said the allegations made by Alam in the Facebook videos about attacks on students and the failure of the police to act were “totally false” and had provoked additional violence. Photographs of protesters being attacked by young men are widely available online but Reuters could not verify what group the assailants belonged to. Alam was picked up hours after giving an interview to Al Jazeera in which he accused the government of involvement in extrajudicial killings in the past. The government has denied allegations of sanctioning extrajudicial killings in its controversial anti-drugs campaign.     Hasina said in the interview with Reuters in New York late last month that Alam had spread false news as authorities were trying to calm the students.     “He tried to use this situation, to instigate it,” she said. “We tried to save the children but he tried to use these children. All the false news he started... how can you accept it?”     In the interview, she also sharply criticized Alam’s deceased great uncle, Abdus Sabur Khan, a former government minister who opposed Bangladesh’s independence and allied with Pakistan.     “He opposed our liberation war, he joined Pakistan, he didn’t accept Bangladesh. In 1971 he was with the Pakistani occupation army,” Hasina said. “Sometimes blood speaks, you understand that.” The war for independence is still a sensitive topic in the country.      A new law, called the Digital Security Act, signed into law by the nation’s president on Monday despite protests from local journalists and the United States, stipulates a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for several offences, including secretly recording inside government buildings and spreading “propaganda” against Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence.     Hasina told Reuters that reporters had nothing to fear from the Digital Security Act.     “If they have confidence that they will not do anything wrong then why should they worry,” she said.  Reporting by Jonathan Spicer in NEW YORK and Serajul Quadir in DHAKA; Additional reporting by Saad Sayeed in ISLAMABAD and Rodrigo Campos in NEW YORK; Writing by Alasdair Pal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Martin Howell and Alex Richardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-bangladesh-protests-photographer-hasi/exclusive-bangladesh-pm-takes-aim-at-photographer-critics-say-it-is-part-of-wider-crackdown-idUKKCN1MM1UJ,2019-02-08,,"Exclusive - Bangladesh PM takes aim at photographer, critics say it is part of wider crackdown"
2019-02-08,"WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Final preparations were being made in the English town of Windsor on Thursday for Britain’s second major royal wedding this year, this time involving the Queen’s granddaughter Princess Eugenie. Eugenie, younger daughter of the queen’s third child Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, will tie the knot with Jack Brooksbank, at the monarch’s Windsor Castle home on Friday. The nuptials come just five months after the glittering wedding of Prince Harry, younger son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and U.S. actress wife Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, at the same location. Eugenie, 28, ninth-in-line to the throne and a director at London’s Hauser & Wirth art gallery, and Brooksbank, 32, who works in the drinks and hospitality industry, are copying some of her cousin’s plans.  The couple, who met in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier in 2010 and got engaged in Nicaragua in January, have likewise invited 1,200 people from across Britain to join in the celebrations in the castle grounds and to watch the newlyweds leave St George’s Chapel after the service. They will then take an open-top carriage ride through Windsor, although it will be shorter than the one Harry and Meghan took in May when thousands thronged the streets and hundreds of millions worldwide watched on television. “We think we’ve been blessed this year with two royal weddings,” said Phillip Bicknell, the local council deputy leader. “We’re hoping she’s going to have a great day and we’re very pleased that she’s shared her day with us.” Stars from the world of showbusiness and sport attended Harry’s wedding and Buckingham Palace announced on Wednesday that one of Eugenie’s bridesmaids will be Theodora Williams, the six-year-old daughter of ex “Take That” singer Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda Field. Three-year-old Princess Charlotte, daughter of second-in-line to the throne Prince William and his wife Kate, will also be a bridesmaid while her brother Prince George, 5, will be a page boy. Eugenie’s older sister Beatrice, 30, will be her maid of honour. Nearly all Britain’s senior royals are expected to attend although Prince Charles’s wife Camilla will be absent as she has a prior engagement in Scotland. It was not certain whether the 92-year-old queen’s husband Prince Philip, 97, who no longer carries out official duties, would be present. The Dean of Windsor will officiate the ceremony while Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform during the service. Also among the guests will be the surgeon who carried out an operation to straighten Eugenie’s back when she was 12, British media reported. The ceremony will be broadcast on British TV and live streamed on the Royal Family and Prince Andrew’s YouTube, Facebook and Twitter channels. “I’m not stressed at all,” Eugenie told Vogue magazine for its September issue. “It’s very nerve-wracking because you want it to be perfect but then you realise that you’re going to be with the person you love forever and nothing else really matters.” While the royal family is paying for the wedding itself, there has been disquiet among republicans and some newspapers over the security bill for the event, which has been estimated at more than 2 million pounds ($2.6 million), given that Eugenie does not carry out official royal duties. About 38,000 people signed a petition, organised by campaign group Republic, against taxpayers’ money being spent on the occasion. “Most Brits opposed taxpayer funding of Prince Harry’s wedding but as with all royal events were forced to accept it,” a spokesman for the group said. “But there’s something different about Friday’s royal wedding, and people aren’t happy.” Britain’s top-selling Sun newspaper ran a front page story on Wednesday with the headline “£2m too much for Eugenie wedding”, saying the event could have been held at a chapel near her childhood home.

2019-02-08,"MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) is negotiating the sale of its stake in a Venezuelan oil joint venture to Paris-based Maurel & Prom (MAUP.PA), three sources said this week, a move to scale down its crude business in the ailing OPEC-member country to focus on gas. The Anglo-Dutch company is seeking to sell its 40 percent stake in Petroregional del Lago, a joint venture with Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in the western state of Zulia near Colombia.  The area has been plagued by frequent theft of equipment and near-daily power cuts as Venezuela remains mired in deep recession, hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine. Foreign companies also have complained in private that joint ventures with PDVSA are stymied by convoluted bureaucracy, dodgy contracts, and lack of resources, according to dozens of sources in the industry.  At Petroregional, Shell has grown frustrated by delays in receiving dividends from PDVSA and a ban on minority partners independently exporting production, one of the sources said. That has deprived Petroregional, which in 2016 produced about 33,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, of much-needed income and dented profitability, the source added.  Its potential sale is being analysed by Venezuela’s Oil Ministry, according to two of the sources. The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about the negotiations.  In the last few weeks a disagreement with Venezuela has emerged over a fee called an entrance bonus that Maurel & Prom would have to pay to the government, as required by Venezuelan law, to gain access to the field’s reserves, two of the sources said. Negotiations are currently on hold, they added. “Everything was going very well but suddenly there were discrepancies over the entrance bonus,” one of the sources said. The persons were unaware of a possible price tag negotiated between Shell and Maurel & Prom, whose main stakeholder is Indonesian state energy firm Pertamina [PERTM.UL]. Shell declined to comment. Maurel & Prom, Pertamina, PDVSA and Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for information. Pertamina in 2013 tried to enter Venezuela by buying a stake in another joint venture, Petrodelta, but did not receive government approval. Maurel & Prom has traditionally been focussed on Africa, but it has also formed strategic alliances with Toronto-based Frontera Energy Corp (FEC.TO) in Colombia and Peru in recent years. One of the sources said Maurel & Prom was planning to buy Petroregional as part of a consortium.  “There are Venezuelan investors involved in the purchasing consortium,” the person said. The identity of the investors was not immediately clear. Shell’s potential scale-back comes as Venezuela’s oil industry, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves, is in meltdown. Its oil output declined again in September to 1.434 million barrels per day (bpd), OPEC data showed on Thursday,  knocking down the annual average to a six-decade low. Workers unable to feed their families on PDVSA wages are quitting in droves, underinvestment has left many installations in precarious conditions, and the production drop has accelerated under new military management.      Shell was a pioneering firm in Venezuela and has operated in its oil industry for more than a century. But it has maintained a low profile in Venezuela since late President Hugo Chavez nationalized swaths of the energy sector in 2007, converting all oil projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures.  Petroregional, which operates the Urdaneta Oeste crude field in Venezuela’s traditional oil hub of Maracaibo Lake, is Shell’s only crude operation in Venezuela. In recent years, production has plummeted in what used to be the country’s most important crude producing zone, Zulia state. Exiting Petroregional would allow Shell to focus more on natural gas, a priority for the company.  Under a plan still under negotiation with Venezuela, Shell is pushing for a deal to let it produce gas in the Dragon field, one of four areas that form part of the Mariscal Sucre offshore project in the Caribbean sea. Shell has said the gas would be processed at facilities it operates in Trinidad and Tobago. Shell in 2016 completed the $52 billion purchase of BG Group, creating the world’s largest trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The takeover and other purchases gave Shell greater access to gas operations in Trinidad, a few kilometres from Venezuela’s eastern coast.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former British leader Tony Blair said there was a 50-50 chance of another Brexit referendum as Prime Minister Theresa May will be unlikely to secure a parliamentary majority for any divorce deal. Less than six months before Britain leaves the European Union, there is little clarity about how post-Brexit trade between the EU and the world’s fifth largest economy will function. If May can strike a deal with the EU, her minority government then has to get it approved by a deeply-divided parliament.  “Whatever Brexit is on offer today is going to result in significant economic harm,” Blair, former head of the opposition Labour Party and prime minister from 1997 to 2007, told Reuters. “I think the odds are now 50 percent that you will get another (referendum) vote.” “I still believe it is possible that Brexit is stopped,” he said. “There is no majority in parliament for any proposition that the prime minister brings back.”  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain’s most significant political and economic move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.9 trillion UK economy and the world’s biggest trading bloc. Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: Less than two decades ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of fringe politicians. But the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted Britons to vote 52 to 48 percent for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum. A new vote, Blair said, could ask whether voters wanted to exit without a deal or stay in a reformed EU and offer new membership terms. He said EU leaders would be willing to reform the bloc. Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other critics, including French President Emmanuel Macron, who have suggested Britain could still change its mind. Recent opinion polls indicate a slight move towards support for staying in the EU. But May has repeatedly said there will be no new referendum.  Blair said that if Brexit did happen, economic dislocation would force Britain to deregulate further to attract foreign investors. Brexiteers anticipate some short-term economic pain but say Britain will then thrive if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending. Blair said that if the UK exited the EU and then socialist Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn won power, the country would face a “truly damaging and challenging situation”. “This is the problem with the policies of both major parties: they seem to think you can do Brexit and then engage in a whole lot of social legislation to make capitalism fairer and more equal and so on,” Blair said. “They have got to wake up to the fact that if you do Brexit your number-one priority is going to be keeping this place as an attractive place for investors to come.” He said European regulators would not want the centre of European finance - currently London - to be outside their orbit. “Why give ourselves this problem in a field of the global economy where we are globally preeminent?” Blair said, adding that the government had cast aside the interests of the service sector.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)  have placed the jobs of chairman and chief executive in the hands of one person, and now No. 3 Citigroup Inc (C.N) must decide whether to follow suit.  The matter will be resolved in the next few months as the current chairman, Mike O’Neill, reaches 72, the company’s retirement age for directors. Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat will soon know if he will be taking on the additional duties of chairman or working for a new boss.     “The change in the chairman is the biggest corporate governance decision at Citigroup in six years,” said analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. “That’s important given what we see as worst-in-class returns, efficiency and stock market valuation.”  Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reports third-quarter results on Friday. Investors will be watching its progress toward cost efficiency and return on equity targets, as well as revenue from its big U.S. credit card business.     Six years ago O’Neill became chairman and shortly after he led the board to replace then-CEO Vikram Pandit with Corbat.  O’Neill said Corbat had impressed him with his handling of some $800 billion of Citigroup assets damaged in the financial crisis. Since then Corbat, 58, has kept Citigroup on a path of improving profits and returning billions of dollars of excess capital to investors. But the recovery has been slow and has fallen short of the company’s goals, as well as the performance of competitors. “Citi needs a greater sense of urgency to improve,” Mayo said.     Under Corbat, Citigroup shares have nearly doubled. But their 91 percent gain, as of Wednesday, pales compared with the 163 percent jump for JPMorgan and the 210 percent gain for Bank of America, the biggest and second-biggest U.S. banks.  Citigroup stock has lagged the past year but probably not enough for Citigroup directors to feel pressed to make big changes when O’Neill leaves, said analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  “You need something like for the stock to be down 30 percent,” he said. “That’s not what is going on here.”  In the second quarter, Citigroup’s return on tangible common equity was 10.8 percent compared with Bank of America’s 15.15 percent and JPMorgan’s 17.2 percent. Kleinhanzl said Citigroup stock is weak partly because investors doubt Citigroup can reach its target for return on tangible common equity, which rises to 13.5 percent in 2020. Getting there, Kleinhanzl said, “is going to be a challenge.” Citigroup declined to comment on the selection of the next chairman. In a statement, it said it was successfully executing its 2017 financial plan and had updated, and in one case raised, its targets for 2020. O’Neill has publicly addressed the question of his successor at annual shareholder meetings. At the April meeting he said Corbat might become chairman and that he was “a bit agonistic” on whether the jobs of CEO and chairman should be kept separate. One year earlier, O’Neill said the board believed that “an independent chairman is a good idea.” Other banks have faced shareholder votes on the issue. Bank of America took the chairmanship title away from CEO Ken Lewis in 2009 following a shareholder vote on the issue, only to give the job to CEO Brian Moynihan five years later. Since then the board has faced three shareholder votes on the question and prevailed in each. In 2013, JPMorgan directors beat back a shareholder proposal seen as calling for CEO Jamie Dimon to give up his chairmanship after a $6.2 billion trading loss. Mayo said some of Citigroup’s largest shareholders have told him that they want the board to keep the chairman and chief executive roles separate. They “would be reassured having an extra set of eyes representing their interests,” he said. Studies are inconclusive on whether companies perform better with different people in the two posts, said Abby Adlerman, founder of consulting firm Boardspan. Adlerman said she used to advocate separating the two posts, but has come to realize that titles suggesting independence and objectivity are not as important as personalities and collaborative relationships between directors and executives. “The best CEOs, whether they are currently a chair or aspire to be a chair, realize the value of independent boards,” said Adlerman.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as the worst storm ever to hit that region and the third most intense hurricane to ever slam into the continental United States, with its minimum pressure recorded at 919 millibars (mb) on Wednesday afternoon.  Michael was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (249 km per hour). The lower the minimum pressure, the more intense the hurricane.  Here are five of the most powerful hurricanes to make landfall in the mainland United States based on minimum pressure: - Florida Keys Labor Day hurricane, 1935, 892 mb The hurricane struck the Florida Keys as a Category 5, the highest ranking possible. It killed more than 200 World War One veterans who were in the Keys to build a highway. It generated wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 km per hour). After ravaging the Keys, the storm moved north off the western coast of Florida before turning inland. In all, more than 400 people died in Florida.   - Hurricane Camille, 1969, 900 mb Camille struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast as a Category 5 hurricane, bringing with it devastating storm tides and strong winds that demolished buildings and destroyed orchards. More than 200 people were killed. - Hurricane Katrina, 2005, 920 mb The hurricane made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. Most of New Orleans was flooded, and some people who were stranded in their homes climbed to the roofs to await rescue. About 1,200 people died, according to the National Weather Service. Most victims were in Louisiana, but neighbouring Mississippi also was hard hit. Katrina caused an estimated $108 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane ever to strike the United States. - Hurricane Andrew, 1992, 922 mb The hurricane struck South Miami-Dade County in Florida and caused an estimated $26 billion in damage. That ranked as the most expensive storm in U.S. history, until Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and pummelled other parts of the U.S. South in 2005. More than a dozen people were directly killed by the storm in Florida, with others dying of indirect causes.  - The Indianola, Texas hurricane, 1886, 925 mb The hurricane destroyed the Texas town of Indianola, which at the time was vying with Galveston to become the state’s main port. Several dozen people were killed in the storm, which also ended a catastrophic drought in the region.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of a “new dawn” in British wage growth are growing after  years of stagnation but the pick-up in pay is likely to be limited, the Bank of England’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said on Wednesday. Haldane contrasted the situation with a year ago, when he said there had been a number of false dawns on pay and repeated failings on the part of the BoE in forecasting higher pay. Now, with the end of a government cap on public-sector pay rises and a steady rise in the average level of private-sector pay deals, pay growth was turning a corner. “I think there is more compelling evidence of a new dawn breaking for pay growth, albeit with the light filtering through only slowly,” he said in a speech at a conference held by Britain’s ACAS labour dispute arbitration service. British workers are earning less than they did 10 years ago - before the global financial crisis - when adjusted for inflation, and Haldane highlighted longer-term headwinds to pay if trends in automation and the dominance of big businesses intensified. Haldane said the “limited and gradual” outlook for pay rises was being reflected in bets by investors that the central bank will raise interest rates by only about a quarter of a percentage point a year over the next three years. The BoE pushed up borrowing costs for only the second time since the 2007-08 financial crisis in August, taking them to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent. The BoE forecasts pay growth including bonuses will rise to 3.25 percent by the end of next year, up from 2.9 percent in the most recent data, before hitting 3.5 percent by the end of 2020. However, the BoE has often produced pay growth forecasts that were too high, which Haldane said was largely due to over-optimism about productivity and an underestimation of how much unemployment could fall without pushing up wages. More recently, pay appeared to be rising in line with BoE forecasts. But Haldane said in the longer term there was a risk of downward pressure on pay growth from reduced worker bargaining power, automation and less competition between businesses. A 30-percentage-point fall in recent decades in the proportion of Britons in trade unions had probably reduced pay growth by around 0.75 percentage points a year. If Britain reached U.S. levels of automation over the next decade, pay growth could be lowered by about 0.4 percentage points a year and U.S. levels of business concentration could reduce pay growth by 0.05 percentage points, Haldane said. Britain’s government appointed Haldane on Monday to chair a committee looking at how to improve productivity. Weak management appears a bigger problem in Britain than in other countries, Haldane said on Monday.

2019-02-08,"ABOARD JS KAGA (Reuters) - Women serving on Japan’s biggest warship, the Kaga, are a tight-knit group on the frontline of a push to transform the Japanese navy into a mixed-gender fighting force, where men outnumber them more than 10 to one. The Maritime Self Defence Force (MSDF) needs more women because falling birth rates mean it has too few men to crew warships in home waters or on helicopter carriers such as the Kaga, sailing in foreign waters to counter China’s growing regional influence. “Women all over the world are working in a wider number of areas and I think Japan needs to be a part of that,” said petty officer Akiko Ihara, 31, standing beside one of the helicopters she helps to maintain.  The proportion of women in the Kaga’s 450-strong crew is about 9 percent, a level Japan is targeting for the military overall by 2030 from 6 percent now. That would still fall short of U.S., where 15 percent of people in uniform are women, and Britain with 10 percent. “We all work in different teams around the ship but we are all friends,” Ihara added. “We do sometimes moan a little about our male colleagues.” The nine-year veteran says she has encountered no workplace discrimination, and would challenge any man who thinks women are unsuited for military life to work with her. (For accompanying package, click on reut.rs/2pHU2ab) More women recruits are making the SDF a more “rounded” organisation, said Ayako Yoneda, 29, a firefighter and engineer on the Kaga.  “When I first joined nine years ago there were few women and it felt like men then didn’t know how to deal with us,” she said. “I think the men now see things more from our perspective. The SDF has become a gentler place.”Nonetheless, the women do face sexual harassment. In July, the navy discharged a male petty officer for kissing and groping three women sailors over several months.     Japan’s demographic woes are forcing it down a path taken years earlier by its U.S. ally, which lifted a ban on women on warships in 1993.  The MSDF, which let women crew ships a decade ago, could soon remove the last major barrier to female sailors by ending a ban on submarine duty, defence ministry sources have told Reuters. Japan has one of the world’s largest navies, with 45,000 crew on more than 100 vessels, including about 20 submarines, more than 40 destroyers and four helicopter carriers, such as the Kaga.  The Kaga was on its way to Sri Lanka after drills in the contested South China Sea as part of a two-month deployment in waters stretching from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Commissioned in 2017, it is among a new generation of warships designed to accommodate mixed crews, with more toilets and bathrooms than older vessels. Signs at the entrance to the women’s segregated sleeping quarters warn men to keep out. The women inside carry electronic pagers that can be contacted via numerical keypads beside the doors. Those better facilities and privacy safeguards will draw more women to sign up, the MSDF hopes. Japan’s navy struggles more to find recruits than the air force or army, as young people balk at the prospect of being cut off from social media networks on long deployments. In 2016, for example, the airforce received 6,900 applications, versus just 3,927 for the MSDF, even though both have about the same number of enlisted personnel.   Miku Ihara, 22, a woman cadet on the Kaga, says she reads books or studies when off-duty, but misses access to Line and Instagram. Sailors are limited to sending four text emails every day when at sea.  “You just have to get used to not having it and make the most of it when you do,” she added. The presence of women on board has had one unexpected benefit on the men that report to him, says Command Master Chief Yasuharu Tohno, the most senior enlisted sailor on board. “They shave regularly and iron their clothes,” said Tohno, who joined up to an all-male fleet 35 years ago.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Telford Homes (TELF.L) shares fell more than 15 percent on Wednesday, after the London-focused homebuilder warned of lower demand especially for luxury homes, as the UK’s exit from the European union approaches. The British property market was among the hardest hit since the referendum decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 with households seeing their spending power pinched by inflation that has risen faster than pay. “We continue to see very little domestic investor demand from individuals,” Telford said in a statement, adding that sales of homes above 600,000 pounds had become more challenging and each transaction takes longer to secure. “This is not expected to get any easier in the short term as negative sentiment is leading customers to take a ‘wait and see’ approach or to look for more significant price reductions to offset a perception of higher risk as Brexit gets closer,” the company said.     Shares in the company were down 11.3 percent at 349.5 pence at 0833 GMT and were among the top losers on the London Stock Exchange. Telford shares suffered their biggest one-day drop since the Brexit referendum during Wednesday’s session. Homebuilders have increasingly been focussing on affordable housing as it is becoming harder to sell premium or luxury homes because Britons are becoming more careful with money. The companies have been taking advantage of the government’s “help-to-buy” scheme, which helps Britons get on the housing ladder by providing them subsidies.  Telford, which has about 300 employees, has been focussing on brownfield opportunities across London to take advantage of areas where demand for homes exceeds supply. It has concentrated on non-prime locations across London and forward selling to customers including individual investors, owner-occupiers, housing associations and, increasingly, institutional investors in the build to rent sector.  The developer of residential-led, mixed use sites in London said it has under 90 homes left to sell to cross its target of 50 million pounds of pretax profit for the year to March 31, 2019. However, 25 of those homes are priced over 600,000 pounds and the company sees a greater risk in them. Telford forecast pretax profit to exceed 8.7 mln pounds in the first half of 2019, but said it would be lower than the second half of next year.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his threat to slap tariffs on an additional $267 billion (203 billion pounds) of Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates for the recent levies and other measures the United States has imposed in an escalating trade war between the economic giants. Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, also said China is not ready to reach a deal on trade. “China wants to make a deal, and I say they’re not ready yet,” Trump said. “I just say they’re not ready yet. And we’ve cancelled a couple of meetings because I say they’re not ready to make a deal.” When asked whether he was ready to levy new taxes in case of retaliation from China, Trump said, “sure, absolutely.” He added that the current U.S. trade imbalance with China means “they’ve already retaliated.” Last month Trump imposed tariffs on nearly $200 billion of Chinese imports and then threatened more levies if China retaliated. China then hit back with tariffs on about $60 billion of U.S. imports. Citing the growing trade war, the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019.  Asked about Trump’s remarks at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said a trade war was bad for the global economy and not in the interests of either country. “But China’s resolution to protect its own legitimate interests is unwavering. No one should have any illusions about this,” Lu said. The United States wants to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its trade, technology transfer and high-tech industrial subsidy practices. Trump’s latest comments underline a threat by Washington that it may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - nearly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brett Kavanaugh spent a collegial first day on the bench as a U.S. Supreme Court justice on Tuesday that contrasted sharply with the venom of his confirmation process, taking an active role in arguments alongside his eight new colleagues. Kavanaugh, a veteran of such proceedings after 12 years on an influential U.S. appeals court, looked at ease as he asked several questions during two hours of lively oral arguments involving a federal sentencing law for repeat offenders. It seemed like business as usual in the ornate courtroom, three days after Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Republican-led Senate despite being accused of sexual assault by a university professor named Christine Blasey Ford. Appointed by President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh’s confirmation cemented a conservative majority on the court that could last for years. Kavanaugh took his seat at the right end of the courtroom’s mahogany bench - the location assigned to the court’s junior-most member - and wore traditional black robes like the other justices. Retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 82-year-old jurist who Kavanaugh replaced, was in the courtroom, as were members of the new justice’s family. With police standing by, a small group of protesters demonstrated outside the courthouse, holding signs saying “Shame” and “He sits on a throne of lies,” while chanting, “This isn’t over, we’re still here.” With courtroom security tight, there were no disruptions by protesters during the arguments, as there had been during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings. Chief Justice John Roberts formally welcomed Kavanaugh, 53, to a court that now has five conservative members and four liberals. “We wish you a long and happy career in our common calling,” Roberts told Kavanaugh, who could serve for decades in the lifetime job. The bitterly divided Senate voted 50-48 on Saturday to confirm Kavanaugh, with just one Democrat supporting him. Kavanaugh’s confirmation gave the Republican president a political victory ahead of crucial Nov. 6 congressional elections. Kavanaugh was Trump’s second selection for the nation’s highest judicial body, following conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch last year. Kavanaugh posed questions to lawyers in both cases before the court, his first one coming about 20 minutes into the arguments. At one point, Kavanaugh could be seen having a lighthearted exchange with liberal Justice Elena Kagan, seated next to him. At another point, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor appeared to pinch Gorsuch, sitting next to her, to playfully illustrate her point about what constitutes a violent act. Gorsuch responded with a faux grimace of pain.  Tuesday’s cases involved the 1984 Armed Career Criminal Act, a “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” criminal sentencing law that boosts prison sentences for people who are convicted of crimes involving guns if they previously have been convicted of certain other crimes. The cases, involving a Florida robbery and burglaries in Tennessee and Arkansas, challenged the types of crimes that qualify as violent felonies under that law and can lead to 15-year mandatory minimum sentences. Roberts prompted laughter when he described asking his law clerks to try to grab a dollar bill from his hand to determine if that constituted a violent act.  “I’m not saying nobody could do it ... but it requires a lot of force, more than you might think,” Roberts said. Based on Tuesday’s arguments, defendants could win in both cases, with liberal justices likely to be joined by some conservatives in the majority. Kavanaugh appeared less sympathetic to the defendants than Gorsuch. Kavanaugh had served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington since 2006. Before Tuesday’s arguments, the justices turned aside appeals of a 2017 ruling authored by Kavanaugh while on the lower court striking down a 2015 environmental rule imposed under Democratic former President Barack Obama regulating a potent greenhouse gas linked to climate change. The justices privately made the decision to reject the appeals by an environmental group and companies that supported the regulation before Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and announced the action on Tuesday. Kavanaugh is expected to push the court further to the right as he is replacing Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes voted with the liberal justices on key social issues such as abortion and gay rights. His nomination had appeared safe until Ford last month went public with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 when they were high school students in Maryland. Two other women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct dating to the 1980s.  Kavanaugh denied the allegations and during a Senate hearing accused Democrats of an “orchestrated political hit.” He later expressed regret over some of his comments. But critics said Kavanaugh’s demeanor raised questions about his temperament and potential political bias in deciding cases. At a White House ceremony on Monday night, Kavanaugh said he was starting his new job with “no bitterness,” seeking to be “a force for stability and unity.” Trump on Twitter on Tuesday said he was “very proud” of Kavanaugh and his family, and disparaged the anti-Kavanaugh protesters.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Nikki Haley, a rising Republican star, said on Tuesday she was stepping down as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but knocked down speculation that she might challenge President  Donald Trump at the next election. Sitting beside Trump in the Oval Office, Haley said her 18-month stint at the United Nations had been “an honour of a lifetime” and that she would stay on until the end of the year.     A former governor of South Carolina and the daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley, 46, is the highest profile woman in Trump’s Cabinet and has often been seen as a possible presidential candidate. Haley criticized Trump during the 2016 election campaign but has been the face of his “America First” policies at the United Nations, steering the U.S. withdrawal from several U.N. programs and ardently defending his hard-line policies against Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs. Haley said in her resignation letter to Trump that she would “surely not be a candidate for any office in 2020” and would instead support his re-election bid. She referred to returning to the private sector and some media reports said she had debts to pay off. But Haley also said she did not have any future plans set, and her decision surprised many at the White House and the United Nations. Speaking to reporters later on Tuesday aboard Air Force One, Trump said he had five people on his short list for U.N. envoy,  including former White House adviser Dina Powell, a friend of Haley’s. Trump said U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, was not on the short list but that he was willing to consider him. Trump’s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, who is a senior adviser to her father, ruled herself out of consideration in a Twitter post. He had said she would be “incredible” in the role and acknowledged he would be accused of nepotism if he nominated her. Trump said Haley had told him six months ago that she was thinking of leaving by the end the year “to take a little time off.” He was effusive in his praise of her. “She has done an incredible job. She is a fantastic person, very importantly, but she also is somebody that gets it,” Trump said on Tuesday. “She’s done a fantastic job and we’ve done a fantastic job together.” Haley’s name has come up as possible Republican running mate in the last two presidential elections and she could also become a U.S. senator if fellow South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham takes up a job in the Trump administration, as is often speculated. Trump suggested the two of them jointly announce Haley’s departure in the Oval Office, an administration official said, noting that Haley was the only outgoing senior member of Trump’s administration to be feted in this way. Returning the favour, Haley praised Trump and his family for their support.  She described Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and aide, as “such a hidden genius that no one understands” for his work on renegotiating the NAFTA trade deal and preparing a long-awaited Middle East peace plan that has not yet been released.             The feel-good nature of her resignation was markedly different from other high-profile departures from Trump’s Cabinet. Trump unceremoniously announced his firing of former secretary of state Rex Tillerson in March in a tweet. Haley was seen by her counterparts at the United Nations as a voice of clarity in a U.S. administration that often gave off mixed signals on foreign policy, diplomats say. “Nikki Haley is one of the most talented, most authentic U.S. government officials that I have ever met,” said U.N. ambassador for France, Francois Delattre.  But she has been overshadowed in recent months by the appointments of Trump loyalist Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and hawk John Bolton as White House national security adviser.   Pompeo has led policy on talks with North Korea, while Bolton has taken the lead on trying to implement Trump’s hard line against Iran. A convert to Christianity in her 20s after being raised a Sikh, Haley is popular with religious conservatives in the South. Her status as a potential candidate for national high office was boosted in 2015 when she ordered the Confederate battle flag to be pulled down at South Carolina’s state capitol grounds after a white supremacist gunman shot dead nine black worshipers at a church in Charleston. Haley has also applauded women who come forward to denounce sexual abuse or misconduct by men and said they should be heard, even if they are accusing Trump. “Women who accuse anyone should be heard,” Haley said last  December after accusations against three members of Congress. “They should be heard, and they should be dealt with.” Referring to women whose accusations brought down powerful men, like movie producer Harvey Weinstein, Haley said: “I’m proud of their strength. I’m proud of their courage.” Haley has long taken a tougher public stance on Russia than Trump, who has sought better relations with President Vladimir Putin. Haley raised eyebrows within the administration when she announced in April that Washington was going to impose sanctions on Moscow over its support of Syria’s government. Trump then decided not to go ahead with the move. Haley fought against what she called anti-Israel bias at the United Nations, and sometimes seemed to be channelling Trump’s abrasive style of diplomacy.     Last year, she upset U.S. allies and foes alike by warning that the United States would be “taking names” of countries that backed a U.N. resolution criticizing Trump’s decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.            Echoing previous statements from Trump, Haley said on Tuesday that the United States under his presidency is now respected around the world.      “Now the United States is respected. Countries may not like what we do, but they respect what we do. They know that if we say we’re going to do something, we follow it through,” she said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Norwegian Air Shuttle (NWC.OL) has overtaken British Airways as the biggest non-U.S. airline on transatlantic routes to and from the New York area, in the latest illustration of the low cost carrier’s move into British Airways territory.  Norwegian carried 1.67 million passengers to or from airports in the New York area in the 12 months to the end of July, compared with the 1.63 million carried by British Airways, data from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey showed. No-frills carrier Norwegian has been rapidly expanding in the transatlantic market over the last five years, prompting the owner of British Airways, IAG (ICAG.L), to try to buy it earlier this year.  The data showed four U.S. airlines, led by United, are the biggest carriers of international passengers out of the main airports in the New York area, which include John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty International. Air Canada is the biggest non-U.S. carrier of international passengers, but its dominance is on travel between the United States and Canada. Norwegian, and other relatively recent entrants to the market such as Wow Air, have led a charge to shake up Europe’s long-haul flight market, offering ticket prices that can be as little as half those charged by traditional carriers.  The traditional airlines have responded by selling a new budget class of ticket, as well as setting up, in IAG’s case, new airline Level to compete directly with Norwegian on price. “Our commitment to New York is as strong as ever,” a BA spokeswoman said. “We fly up to 70 times a week from all three of our London airports, and we recently announced a $65 million (49.7 million pounds) investment on new lounges, improved food, seating and shops at JFK Terminal 7.” Lufthansa has also started budget long-haul flights using its Eurowings brand. Norwegian said in May it had rejected two approaches from IAG, which also owns the Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling brands, because they undervalued the company. IAG owns a 4.6 percent stake in Norwegian.  The pace of Norwegian’s growth - figures from July 2017 show it only carried 750,000 passengers into and out of the New York region - has weighed on its finances and it faces mounting pressure to control costs and shore up its balance sheet. “Fares have been too high for too long as transatlantic routes have been long dominated by carriers with outdated legacies running on fumes,” a Norwegian spokesman said. “Norwegian will continue to spread its wings to the Big Apple with a third-daily service between London and New York JFK from 28 October.”  Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Mark Potter and Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-norweg-air-shut-british-airways-new-y/british-airways-loses-new-york-crown-to-low-cost-rival-norwegian-idUKKCN1MI1YA,2019-02-08,"Norwegian Air Shuttle  has overtaken British Airways as the biggest non-U.S. airline on transatlantic routes to and from the New York area, in the latest illustration of the low cost carrier's move into British Airways territory.",British Airways loses New York crown to low-cost rival Norwegian
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sought to put a bruising confirmation battle behind him on Monday at a White House ceremony in which President Donald Trump declared him innocent of sexual misconduct and apologised for the heated process. Kavanaugh, whose bid to join the top U.S. court nearly failed after a California professor accused him of assaulting her when they were in high school, said he would enter his new job without bitterness despite a political fight that he told lawmakers had destroyed his family and his name. “The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional. That process is over. My focus now is to be the best justice I can be,” he said at the White House, with his wife and children standing nearby. Kavanaugh said he would aim to be a force for stability and unity on the court, whose other eight members all attended the  ceremony. “Although the Senate confirmation process tested me as it has tested others, it did not change me,” he said. Kavanaugh, who served as part of special counsel Kenneth Starr’s team that investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and testified that the sexual misconduct accusations were funded by left-wing groups seeking revenge on behalf of the Clintons, said the Supreme Court was not a partisan body. “The Supreme Court is an institution of law. It is not a partisan or political institution,” he said. “The Supreme Court is a team of nine, and I will always be a team player on the team of nine.” Kavanaugh’s confirmation proceedings exploded in controversy after Christine Blasey Ford went public with allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982.  Kavanaugh gave a forceful, emotional denial of those allegations during testimony before lawmakers that some Democrats said showed a lack of judicial temperament.  The U.S. Senate voted 50-48 on Saturday to confirm him, with just one Democrat supporting him. His confirmation to the lifetime job was a victory for Trump and locked in a conservative majority on the court. “On behalf of our nation, I want to apologise to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure,” Trump said at the start of a ceremonial swearing-in. “Those who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,” he said. Trump, under pressure from moderate Republican senators, had ordered a brief FBI investigation, whose results Republicans viewed as failing to corroborate the allegations and which Democrats saw as insufficient. Trump, who drew criticism for mocking Ford at a rally, said Kavanaugh had been cleared. “A man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty,” Trump said to applause. “And with that I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent.” Kavanaugh has cited his mother, a former state judge in Maryland, as an inspiration, and emphasized his commitment to the advancement of women. He noted that his newly hired law clerks were all women, which he said was a historic first at the Supreme Court. He will hear his first arguments as a justice on Tuesday.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - At least 40 lawmakers in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party are willing to vote down her possible Brexit deal if it leaves the United Kingdom ‘half in and half out’ of the European Union, a senior lawmaker said on Tuesday. “My estimate is that there are at least 40 colleagues who are not going to accept a ‘half in, half out’ Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union,” lawmaker Steve Baker told BBC radio. “Colleagues will not tolerate a half in, half out Brexit,” said Baker, who served as a junior Brexit minister in May’s government until he resigned in protest at her Brexit proposals. If May secures a deal with the EU, she has to get the British parliament to approve it and would need the backing of about 320 lawmakers to get approval. If 40 of her lawmakers voted against a possible deal, the fate of the government and exit process would depend on the opposition Labour Party, which has indicated it will vote against almost any deal May might secure. Under May’s proposals, Britain will seek a free trade area for goods with the EU, largely by accepting a “common rulebook” for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide authorisations for goods. Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept control over swathes of the British economy and thus run counter to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs Union and the Single Market. “We are awaiting the detail of exactly what we are going to be asked for vote for. I don’t doubt that every possible technique us going to be used to sow doubt in colleagues’ minds and to encourage them to vote with the government,” Baker said. “In the end the EU is not entitled to split the UK and it’s not entitled to constrain how we regulate our economy and govern ourselves after we leave,” he added. Without an approved deal, the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the European Union to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. “If the UK faces either possibility then we must in the end be willing to say it’s a bad deal, and no deal is better than a bad deal,” Baker said. “We would need to be unafraid to go forward without an agreement.” Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Michael Holden",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-rebels/at-least-40-of-mays-mps-willing-to-vote-down-brexit-deal-ex-minister-says-idUKKCN1MJ0KU,2019-02-08,,"At least 40 of May's MPs willing to vote down Brexit deal, ex-minister says"
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - (This November 6 story has been refiled to correct day of congressional elections to November 6 in the second paragraph.) Two Democratic senators on Sunday said voters angry that Republicans confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual misconduct should focus on next month’s congressional elections instead of seeking to impeach the new justice. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives have indicated Kavanaugh could face investigations or even potential impeachment if they win majorities in the House and possibly the Senate. But Senators Chris Coons and Mazie Hirono distanced themselves from those demands, saying they are concentrating on the Nov. 6 congressional elections. “I think that’s premature,” Coons said of impeachment talk on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Frankly we are just less than a month away from an election. Folks who feel very strongly one way or other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate.” Kavanaugh was sworn in late on Saturday amid protests at the court after he was narrowly confirmed in a 50-48 Senate vote but with questions raised from Democrats and liberal groups as to whether he will be a partisan justice. Democrats are hopeful of winning control of the House but the Senate is a long shot. Republicans say that anger on the right at the way Democrats treated Kavanaugh may have energized their voters as well. U.S. President Donald Trump said the public protests against Kavanaugh were the work of “an angry left-wing mob” and has urged his supporters to vote in November. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday that “nothing unifies Republicans like a court fight.” With both parties focusing on the confirmation battle, it is unclear who will capitalise on it most effectively in the elections. Hirono, speaking on ABC’s “This Week,” said, “I’m focused like a laser beam on the elections” when asked about impeachment. “I’m very focused on the here and now, which is that all these angry women, mainly, out there who saw what was going on and how the Senate was not able to deal with the entire issue of sexual assault,” she said. Noting that only one Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached, Coons said the Senate needed to show leadership and seek to heal the country. “I think talking about it at this point isn’t necessarily healing us and moving us forward,” he said. Samuel Chase in 1804 was the only justice to be impeached by the House. He was acquitted by the Senate the following year. Kavanaugh fought back against the accusations with a blistering partisan attack at a Sept. 27 Senate hearing on Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school. Kellyanne Conway, a senior White House adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week” that the focus should turn from Kavanaugh’s combative testimony and toward his 12 years as a respected appeals court judge in Washington. “The Supreme Court, thank God, is a sacrosanct institution that can withstand much,” Conway said. Kavanaugh’s confirmation means the nine-justice court now has a solid 5-4 conservative majority that is likely to move the court further to the right as it rules on contentious issues such as abortion, immigration, transgender rights, industry regulation and presidential powers.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS Group AG (UBSG.S), its French unit and six executives faced charges of aggravated tax fraud and money laundering on Monday, the first day of a trial into allegations they helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in France. After seven years of investigation and aborted settlement negotiations, UBS will also answer allegations that it illegally solicited clients in France. It risks being fined up to 5 billion euros (4.40 billion pounds) plus potential damages to the French taxman for the missing revenue. On the first day of the court hearing on Monday, the defendants’ lawyers raised technicalities to try to get the court to drop the money laundering charges and limit the proceedings to tax fraud, which carries lighter penalties. UBS’s lawyer Jean Veil said the French state was asking for 1.6 billion euros in damages, which he told the court was excessive. “They are asking crazy amounts,” he told the court. UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, has said it intends to firmly defend its position. “After more than six years of legal proceedings, we will finally have the opportunity to respond to the often unfounded allegations that were frequently leaked to the media, in clear violation of the presumption of innocence and the legal confidentiality of the process,” UBS said in a statement ahead of the trial. The bank said it would reserve its arguments for the court. Banks have become more rigorous after the 2008 financial crisis and the banking scandals that followed, while tighter regulations have forced the industry to become more cautious, analysts say. UBS’s trial in France follows a similar judicial process in the United States, where the bank in 2009 accepted to pay $780 million in a settlement. In Germany, UBS agreed to a 300 million euro fine in 2014. During the French investigation, UBS turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros made by the authorities. The amount corresponded to what the Swiss bank had already paid as a court bond, according to judicial sources.  The investigation into UBS in the United States began after employee Bradley Birkenfeld revealed a scheme to funnel wealthy customers’ cash from the United States to Switzerland, bypassing the U.S. taxman. Birkenfeld spoke separately to French investigators. Even though he is not due to testify in court in Paris he intends to attend all the hearings.  The whistleblower told Reuters that he hoped for a heavy penalty for the Swiss bank. “If they set an example with UBS, most other banks will be scared,” he said. For money laundering, French criminal law lets judges enforce fines as high as half the amount laundered. In the French case, prosecutors estimate that up to 10.6 billion euros was denied to the French tax authorities. The court hearing is due to resume on Thursday and the case is scheduled to continue until Nov. 15.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker threw a little dance move before a speech on Monday, raising a laugh in Brussels as he appeared to mimic Theresa May but angering supporters of the embattled British prime minister and her Brexit plan. May sashayed on stage last week to the sound of Abba’s “Dancing Queen” - a self-mocking gag about a recent trip to South Africa where she had danced with schoolchildren. May then used the stage to rally her divided party behind her efforts to negotiate a smooth withdrawal from the European Union. Preparing to speak at a conference on Monday, Juncker was unable to start as music continued to play in the hall. Looking up from his notes, the European Commission president, whose negotiators are locked in talks with May’s officials, spread his arms and moved his shoulders and hips in time with the rhythm. A couple of seconds was enough to provoke laughter in the room as the music faded. Juncker gave a broad grin in response. Britons were quick to spot how close his gestures were to May’s before her keynote speech last Wednesday at the annual conference of her Conservative Party. The pro-Brexit Daily Mail said he appeared to “mock” May, while online comments on its website reflected anger over the EU’s refusal to accept the May government’s terms for leaving the bloc next March. A spokesman for Juncker, a former premier of Luxembourg, said his improvised performance was “not directed at anyone” and repeated that the Commission president has “great respect” for May.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report on Monday saying temperatures were likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace. Below is some background about the IPCC and the report. The IPCC is the world’s leading body for assessing the science related to climate change, its impacts, potential future risks and possible response options. It was established in 1998 by the U.N. Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to provide policymakers with scientific assessments on climate change. It has 195 member states. The IPCC’s previous report, called the Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report (AR5), was completed at the end of 2014 and called for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut to zero by 2100 to limit the risk of irreversible damage from climate change. Its next major synthesis report, AR6, will be finalised in the first half of 2022. There will also be two more special reports on oceans and land use next year.  Monday’s “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees”,  prepared at the request of governments which signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, outlines the impact of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and steps needed to contain warming at that level. The summary for policymakers presents the main findings of the report, based on an assessment of all available scientific, technical and socio-economic research. It compares the impact of global warming of 1.5C and 2C. The report was prepared by 91 authors and review editors from 40 countries. More than 6,000 scientific references are cited and there were 133 contributing authors. It also contains more than 42,000 expert and government review comments. Writing of the report was led by three working groups - one to assess the physical scientific basis of climate change, the second to look at impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and the third to assess climate change mitigation. The IPCC met in Incheon, South Korea last week to finalize the report’s findings. Scientists and government representatives reviewed the summary to ensure agreement on the wording. It was approved by the IPCC on Oct. 6. IPCC sessions are conducted behind closed doors. Governments can try and make changes to the text but changes must be agreed by consensus. In addition, IPCC scientists ensure any amendments are consistent with the scientific evidence.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As women rallied at the U.S. Capitol to protest Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court on Saturday, activist Linda Sarsour flew from Washington to Texas with her eyes on the next challenge: the Nov. 6 congressional elections. Sarsour, a leader of the Women’s March organization, said it was time to harness women’s furor around Kavanaugh to galvanize voters in races that will soon determine which party controls Congress. “This is not the end,” Sarsour, 38, said in a telephone interview. “I think the rage will be translated into mass voter turnout.” Women’s March, which grew out of the massive January 2017 demonstrations protesting Donald Trump’s presidency, mobilized thousands of women during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process over concerns about how the conservative judge would vote on issues such as abortion, and allegations that he sexually assaulted university professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers in 1982.  Sarsour said the group will use its vast digital infrastructure to get hundred of thousands of women to support Democrats in dozens of U.S. House of Representatives races and to target incumbent Senate Republicans Ted Cruz in Texas and Dean Heller in Nevada. Polls show Cruz and Heller, who both voted for Kavanaugh’s confirmation, in tight contests. Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which advocates for women’s healthcare and abortion access, launched a digital ad in Nevada this week criticizing Heller for calling sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh a “hiccup” in the confirmation process. Women are playing a key role in the first midterm election since Trump’s 2016 victory. Fuelled by his statements about women and the #MeToo movement, a record number of women are running for Congress this year. Women who live in suburbs, where some of the most competitive House races will be contested, have trended away from Republicans in recent polls and may be further energized by the Kavanaugh debate. Activists are also encouraged by the response to a crowdfunding effort focused on Republican Senator Susan Collins, a possible swing vote who ultimately voted for Kavanaugh. More than $3.2 million was pledged to help her future opponent in 2020, when the Maine senator is up for re-election. “Starting tomorrow, it’s not unlikely we ask those 130,000 donors to start to support some of the Senate Democrats in really tough races this year,” said Liz Jaff, co-director of Be A Hero, which advocates for healthcare causes. Jaff cited Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who both opposed Kavanaugh and face serious challenges in states won by Trump. Conservative groups also vowed to keep the confirmation battle at the forefront of voters’ minds.  “Americans saw through the vilification of an exceptionally qualified nominee, and their senators will be held accountable,” Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion group, Susan B. Anthony List, said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday he was closely following the case of missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after Turkish officials said they believed he had been killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.   Erdogan told reporters that authorities were examining camera footage and airport records as part of their investigation into the disappearance last week of Khashoggi, who had been increasingly critical of Saudi Arabia’s rulers. A former newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia and adviser to its former head of intelligence, Khashoggi left the country last year saying he feared retribution for his criticism of Saudi policy in the Yemen war and its crackdown on dissent. On Tuesday he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents for his forthcoming marriage. Saudi officials say he left shortly afterwards but his fiancee, who was waiting outside, said he never came out. Two Turkish sources told Reuters Turkish authorities believe Khashoggi was deliberately killed inside the consulate, a view echoed by one of Erdogan’s advisers, Yasin Aktay, who is also a friend of the Saudi journalist.   “My sense is that he has been killed...in the consulate,” Aktay said. Erdogan said he was personally following the issue, without saying what he believed had happened to Khashoggi. “Entries and exits into the embassy, airport transits and all camera records are being looked at and followed. We want to swiftly get results,” he said, adding without explanation: “My expectation is still positive.” A Saudi source at the consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless. The consulate has also denied that Khashoggi was abducted. The United States is seeking information, a State Department official said. “We are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,” the official said. Khashoggi’s fiancee could not immediately be contacted but she said in a Tweet that there had been no official confirmation of the Turkish sources’ statements. “Jamal was not killed and I do not believe he was killed,” Hatice Cengiz posted. Another Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country. The source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them. Turkey’s Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate. Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain. Over the past year, he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post criticising Saudi policies towards Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.  “I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,” he wrote in September. “To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.” Two months later, writing about the detentions of scores of Saudi royals, senior officials and businessmen accused of corruption, he said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman dispensed “selective justice” and said there was “complete intolerance for even mild criticism” of the crown prince. Khashoggi’s disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha. Erdogan, whose AK Party is rooted in political Islam, also supported a government in Egypt led by the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia has designated a terrorist movement.  Erdogan’s adviser Aktay told Reuters that Turkish authorities believed the group of 15 Saudi nationals were “most certainly involved” in his disappearance. “The Saudis are saying we can come investigate, but they have of course disposed of the body,” he said, adding that he believed Saudi statements about a lack of footage from security cameras were insincere. Saudi Consul-General Mohammad al-Otaibi told Reuters on Saturday that the consulate’s own security cameras showed only a live stream and did not record footage, so they could not provide evidence of Khashoggi’s movements. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by reports Khashoggi may have been killed inside the consulate. “The Saudi authorities must immediately give a full and credible accounting of what happened to Khashoggi inside its diplomatic mission,” the CPJ said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Turkish authorities believe Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside his country’s consulate in Istanbul last week, Turkish sources said, in what they described as the deliberate targeting of a prominent critic of the Gulf kingdom’s rulers. As a journalist, he interviewed Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden several times in Afghanistan and Sudan, and served twice as editor of Al Watan newspaper. Khashoggi gained a wide following with his appearances on Arab satellite television networks. A consummate insider, he advised Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief, and has also been close to billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. A year ago, Khashoggi left Saudi Arabia after he said the authorities had instructed him to stop tweeting. In his columns in the Washington Post, Khashoggi had been escalating his criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: accusing him of repressing the Saudi people, creating a mess in Lebanon and prosecuting a cruel war in Yemen. Here are excerpts from his writings in the Washington Post: Sep 18, 2017: Saudi Arabia Wasn’t Always This Repressive. Now it’s Unbearable. “It anguishes me to speak with other Saudi friends in Istanbul and London who are also in self-exile. There are at least seven of us — are we going to be the core of a Saudi diaspora?  “We spend endless hours on the phone trying to understand this wave of arrests that have included my friend, businessman and thoughtful Twitter personality Essam Al-Zamil. “It was just last Tuesday that he returned home from the United States, having been part of an official Saudi delegation. That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia. It is all quite shocking. But this has not been business as usual in my country.” Nov 5, 2017: Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince is Acting like Putin “As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice. The crackdown on even the most constructive criticism — the demand for complete loyalty with a significant “or else” — remains a serious challenge to the crown prince’s desire to be seen as a modern, enlightened leader. “Mohammed bin Salman rather famously bought a $500 million yacht in 2015. Rumours rippled across the kingdom of other extravagances. The buck stops at the leader’s door. He is not above the standard he is now setting for the rest of his family, and for the country.” Nov 13, 2017: Saudi Arabia Is Creating a Total Mess in Lebanon “As if we Arabs need another crisis in our shattered world — but that’s exactly what’s coming after the mysterious resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri from Riyadh last Saturday and declarations from the Saudi royal court that Iran has officially crossed a red line. “The impulsivity of MBS has been a consistent theme — from the war in Yemen to the wave of arrests of constructive critics, royals and senior officials accused of corruption. The severity of Saudi Arabia’s action against Lebanon mirrors the blockade of Qatar in June — abrupt, with no room for negotiation” Jan 3, 2018: Why Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Should be Worried about Iran’s Protests “Indeed, many Saudis must find it contradictory for their media to hail Iranians protesting price increases in Iran, while Saudis are banned from protesting the approximately doubled cost of fuel and the introduction of a sales tax for the first time in the country (which took effect Jan. 1). Just last week, Salih Shehi, a prominent columnist, was arrested for appearing on TV and defending the people’s right to object. “Ironically, these protests may well overlap with the seventh anniversary of the Jan. 25 Egyptian revolution that changed the face of the Arab world. Perhaps Arabs — and Saudis — will dare to say that they also want some of that Iranian freedom.” Feb 28, 2018: What Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Can Learn from Queen Elizabeth II “MBS’s downsizing and relative humbling of the House of Saud is welcome news. But maybe he should learn from the British royal house that has earned true stature, respect and success by trying a little humility himself. If MBS can listen to his critics and acknowledge that they, too, love their country, he can actually enhance his power.” Aug 7, 2018: Saudi Arabia Cannot Afford to Pick Fights With Canada “Instead of lashing out at Canada, shouldn’t we ask why peace-loving Canada has turned against us? We, Saudi citizens, need to see the bigger picture. Canada raised the flag against human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia. Surely, we cannot arbitrarily arrest female activists and expect the world to turn a blind eye.” Sep 11, 2018: Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Must Restore Dignity to His Country — by Ending Yemen’s Cruel War “The longer this cruel war lasts in Yemen, the more permanent the damage will be. The people of Yemen will be busy fighting poverty, cholera and water scarcity and rebuilding their country. The crown prince must bring an end to the violence and restore the dignity of the birthplace of Islam.” Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-politics-dissident-excerpts/excerpts-from-saudi-journalist-khashoggis-column-idUKKCN1MH0P1,2019-02-08,,Excerpts from Saudi journalist Khashoggi's column
2019-02-08,"JAKARTA/PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - When up to six-metre (20-foot) tsunami waves crashed into the Indonesian city of Palu last month, Didiek Wahyudi Kurniawan’s house near the beach was quickly engulfed with water, leaving his wife and two daughters barely any time to escape.  “I know there is supposed to be a tsunami warning alarm, but maybe it was outdated? I have no idea. We never get any warning from it,” said Kurniawan, 46.  He said he was out at the time but his family escaped by wading through chest-high water to a neighbour’s three-storey building.     While his family was spared, scores attending a beach festival in Palu were among those swept away, adding to the more than 1,600 deaths from the 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami that have been confirmed so far. Other survivors also said they heard no sirens, even though a tsunami warning was issued and then lifted 34 minutes after the quake, based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, which is on Sulawesi island. As Indonesia struggles with the aftermath of the devastating  quake, the spotlight has again been shone on the apparent lack of preparedness in a sprawling archipelago that suffers regular tremors, lying on the seismically active so-called Pacific Ring of Fire.      There was a major push in the region to improve warning systems after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed more than 120,000 in Indonesia alone, including establishing a network of 22 warning buoys to detect tsunamis that was put in place with German and U.S. help. International agencies and countries poured $4.6 billion into the reconstruction of Indonesia’s devastated Aceh province on Sumatra island, with new infrastructure such as strategically placed evacuation centres.          Still, with the first waves in Palu arriving within around four minutes and power and communications knocked out by the quake, text message alerts or sirens would probably not have been enough, even if they were working. Denis McClean, a spokesman of the U.N. Disaster Risk Reduction agency, told a briefing only public awareness would have saved people under these circumstances. “It happened very quickly. There wasn’t much time for warnings to be disseminated, so it was very much dependent on the level of public awareness in order to save lives.” Indonesia’s national disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said people still often did not know what to do when a disaster strikes. Unlike in quake-prone countries like Japan and New Zealand, earthquake education and drills are conducted only sporadically in Indonesia.    “The problem in tsunami early warning systems is not the structure, not its tools, but the culture in our communities,” Nugroho told reporters. Palu has some tsunami evacuation route signs, but Mokhtar, a resident, said while he was aware of government sponsored simulations shown on television on what to do in an earthquake, he had not seen any on the ground. “There is a warning system but on that day there was none. No siren or anything,” said the 51-year-old civil servant, adding that he has never heard the warning system ever. Nugroho of the disaster agency said communities sometimes vandalise early warning tools like tsunami buoys. The network of 22 buoys in Indonesia, which are connected to seabed sensors, have been inoperable since 2012, often due to neglect or vandalism. Fishermen often used buoys to tie their boats, sometimes damaging sensors, while in one case a buoy was towed by fishermen from its original mooring to another part of the sea off Sulawesi.   Indonesian President Joko Widodo called this week for the buoys to be repaired or replaced, but experts and officials say investment has also been neglected in other areas. According to data from the disaster agency, out of about 1,000 tsunami sirens needed across Indonesia, only 56 are in place. Only about 3,100 km (1,920 miles) of evacuation routes have been established against a need for 11,900 km (7,390 miles), while there are only 50 evacuation shelters compared with estimates of 2,200 needed, the data showed. The speaker of Indonesia’s parliament, Bambang Soesatyo, pledged in a statement that at least in the case of buoys, parliament would support the budget for this. Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said from evidence so far it appeared the tsunami in Palu was generated by a submarine landslide, something most warning systems would not pick up. “The earthquake is the warning. The first thing you need to do is take cover in a safe space until the shaking stops and then get yourself away from the coast. It’s about education,” said Switzer, stressing that this needed “to be ingrained in every child in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia”. Even putting aside the human cost, there are powerful economic arguments for doing more to prepare for disasters. Udrekh, a disaster expert at Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT), said Indonesia is discussing with Japan whether to invest in seabed cables with sensors that could detect tsunami and earthquakes, similar to a system in Japan. Such cables would be less vulnerable and quicker than buoys and cost 300 billion rupiah ($19.8 million) a year for every 200 km (125 miles), he said. “We always say for disaster infrastructure that you save $7 for every $1 investment you make, so this is needed and the cost is nothing compared to other infrastructure,” he said. He estimated Indonesia lost about 30 trillion rupiah ($2 billion) each year from disasters, but spent too little on disaster mitigation infrastructure and education. “It’s like we never learned from 2004,” he told Reuters.

2019-02-08,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Tens of thousands marched through the streets of Edinburgh on Saturday to show support for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, a cause Scottish nationalists say has drawn strength from Britain’s struggles to leave the European Union. The campaigners waved giant blue Scotland flags and sported kilts as they congregated in a park near the Scottish Parliament building.  The Scottish National Party (SNP), which backs secession from the UK and has almost half the seats in the country’s devolved parliament, starts its annual conference on Sunday. A Reuters journalist at the march estimated there were several tens of thousands of people present. There were a handful of pro-union counter-protesters waving British flags.  Scots voted to stay in the European Union in 2016 by a large margin, but Britain as a whole voted to leave. The Brexit process has since put Scotland’s devolved nationalist government increasingly at loggerheads with the UK’s Conservative leadership. Scotland rejected independence by a 10 percentage point margin in a 2014 referendum. Most polls show public support for Scottish independence from the UK stuck at the same 45 percent level it has	 been since the 2014 vote, although a recent poll showed backing for a split from the UK has ticked up in a sign of discontent over Brexit.

2019-02-08,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has refused to renew a work visa for the Asia news editor of the Financial Times, who is also an official of the city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC), a decision that shocked many in the financial hub’s international community.  The news comes two months after government officials in China and Hong Kong condemned the FCC, one of Asia’s leading press clubs, for hosting a speech by an independence activist, reigniting debate about the viability of the city’s promised freedoms. “The Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application to renew the work visa of Victor Mallet, Asia news editor at the Financial Times,” the newspaper said in a statement.  “This is the first time we have encountered this situation in Hong Kong. We have not been given a reason for the rejection,” it said. Mallet, who is the FCC’s vice-president, did not respond immediately to a request for comment, while Hong Kong’s immigration department said it did not comment on specific cases.  In August, Mallet, who was the FCC’s acting president at the time, hosted a speech by pro-independence activist Andy Chan in a move strongly condemned by China’s Foreign Ministry.  The ministry had urged the FCC to withdraw its invitation to Chan, a founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, which was formally banned by Hong Kong authorities last month. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have said the notion of independence is inconsistent with the principle of “one country, two systems” under which the territory has been governed since Britain handed it back to China in 1997. The principle promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed elsewhere in China, rights which are enshrined in a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law. Mallet said in August the FCC neither endorsed nor opposed the diverse views of its speakers, fully respected the law and championed free speech and freedom. The FCC said it was expecting a full explanation from the Hong Kong authorities.  “In the absence of any reasonable explanation, the FCC calls on the Hong Kong authorities to rescind their decision,” the club said in a statement late on Friday, describing the move as “extremely rare, if not unprecedented”.  Reuters received multiple messages via email and social media from foreign banking and legal professionals expressing shock at the decision. A spokesman for the U.S. Consulate General described the rejection as “deeply troubling”. “This decision is especially disturbing because it mirrors problems faced by international journalists in the mainland and appears inconsistent with the principles enshrined in the Basic Law,” he said. Reporters Without Borders called on Hong Kong authorities to reverse their decision.  “This is clearly a form of retaliation for his involvement in the public talk organised in August by FCCHK, which angered Beijing by featuring a pro-Hong Kong independence activist,” the group said in a statement.  “Such action is yet another proof that the Chinese authorities are extending their policy of intimidating foreign journalists to the territory of Hong Kong,” it said. The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said it was shocked at the move and urged the government to reconsider and explain its decision. “If left unexplained, it will give rise to worries that it is an act of reprisal against Mr Mallet, further undermining public confidence in freedom of speech and the press,” the HKJA said. Twenty-two lawmakers from Hong Kong’s democratic opposition called for Mallet’s visa to be reissued. “It is sending a very wrong message to the international community that Hong Kong is just another city in mainland China,” veteran Democrat Party legislator James To told reporters. Some pro-establishment politicians backed the government’s move, however, saying strong messages had to be sent that Hong Kong had zero tolerance of independence calls, government-funded broadcaster RTHK reported. New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a statement the visa rejection, together with the unprecedented banning of the Hong Kong National Party, showed a quickening downward spiral for human rights in Hong Kong. “This is shocking and unprecedented,” it said. “The Hong Kong authorities’ visa renewal rejection - without explanation - of a journalist who’s done nothing more than his job smacks of Beijing-style persecution of critics.” The FCC, whose members include senior lawyers, scholars and government officials besides journalists, has long portrayed itself as fostering and defending free speech. Mallet has worked as a journalist and foreign correspondent for more than 30 years, first at Reuters and then for the Financial Times, including more than 12 years in Asia.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s Brexit negotiators believe a divorce deal with Britain is “very close”, diplomatic sources said, in a sign a compromise on the most contentious issue - the future Irish border - might be in the making though details were scarce. The EU signalled on Thursday it was engaging with new proposals emerging in Britain on how to avoid extensive border checks between Britain’s province of Northern Ireland and EU member state Ireland after Brexit, the critical potential deal-breaker in the talks to end four decades of union. A member of EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier’s team told a briefing with national diplomats in Brussels late on Thursday that a divorce pact with Britain was “very close”, according to two sources present. “We are going in the right direction,” a senior EU diplomat said separately of the work on the Irish fix.   Two days of cautiously positive comments from Brussels have helped strengthen sterling but Britain has yet to formally put any new proposals to the EU in writing. On Friday evening, EU Brexit negotiators told ambassadors of the 27 states remaining in the bloc that there was still no breakthrough on the Irish issue and much would depend on what their British counterparts bring to Brussels next week.  The two sides are trying to push the divorce deal as well as an agreement on post-Brexit relations over the line in time for leaders’ summits scheduled for Oct. 17-18 and Nov. 17-18.  Under the plan described by EU sources, Britain would give up on insisting on only a time-limited emergency Irish border solution. Britain would get its way in having all of the United Kingdom - rather than just Northern Ireland - stay in a customs union with the bloc if the “backstop” is triggered. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, speaking in Brussels on Thursday, urged Britain to make new proposals well ahead of the EU summit in less than two weeks to leave enough time for analysis. Sources in Brussels say the devil is in the detail.  “Negotiations are not easy because we also have to be critical that we receive different signals from London,” European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said in Austria. “There is a polyphonic chorus at the level of the British cabinet and we try to arrange the pieces ... so that they become a melody,” he said, referring to divisions within Prime Minister Theresa May’s government over the terms of Brexit. Any such compromise would leave the EU concerned that Britain could use Northern Ireland’s special access to the bloc’s single market to sell cheaper goods that would not adhere to EU labour, environment and other standards.   The bloc worries that London would try to use that unique trade arrangement as a building block for the overall future trade relationship and win an unfair competitive edge.     For Britain, the problem is agreeing to checks on goods and livestock with Northern Ireland, something strongly opposed by the province’s Democratic Unionist Party - on whose votes May relies to govern. Britain’s Brexit ministry said on Friday London’s new proposals on the Irish border would preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom. While the EU is pushing London on the Irish issue, the 27 states remaining in the bloc are also fleshing out their proposal on future ties with Britain.  The chairman of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Thursday a “Canada plus plus plus” was on offer - meaning an advanced free trade deal coupled with close security ties, tight cooperation on global affairs and research, among other elements.  Another senior EU diplomat said the EU would propose “zero tariffs and zero quotas” in trade with Britain after Brexit, which would go beyond what the bloc has with Canada. Such a proposal goes down well with May’s critics at home who advocate a more uncompromising split with the EU than she is seeking. But for the EU an Irish backstop would be an essential part of any such offer, which, in turn, is not to the liking of Brexiteers, who do not want Britain’s means to forge independent trade deals limited by staying in a customs union.  Any deal between May and fellow EU leaders must be endorsed by both the EU and British parliaments, another hurdle to clear to avoid the most damaging scenario of Britain leaving the bloc with little in place to mitigate the economic shock. “Time is pressing. All partners know that,” a German government spokesman said. “Britain exiting without an agreement would not be in the interests of Britain, Europe or Germany.” Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska and Alastair Macdonald; Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Sarah Young in London, Jan Strupczewski in Brussels, Kirsti Knolle in Vienna and Michelle Martin in Berlin; Editing by Mark Heinrich",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-deal/eu-negotiators-say-brexit-deal-very-close-but-details-missing-idUKKCN1MF0K9,2019-02-08,,EU negotiators say Brexit deal 'very close' but details missing
2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major world stock markets sank for a second straight day on Friday after strong U.S. jobs numbers signaled a continued tightening of the labor market and increased inflation pressures, while Treasury yields rose again to multi-year highs.    The increase in U.S. non-farm payrolls slowed in September, likely from Hurricane Florence’s impact on restaurant and retail payrolls, but the Labor Department report also showed a rise in wages that could keep the Federal Reserve on track for more interest rate hikes.  “The jobs report has become a inflation report,” said Russell Price, senior economist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc in Troy, Michigan.

2019-02-08,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - The European Court of Justice has set a Nov. 27 date for a hearing to decide whether Britain’s parliament can unilaterally change its mind on Brexit, a legal source told Reuters, adding that the case is moving fast. Scottish lawmakers opposed to Brexit filed a petition with Scotland’s Court of Session last year to show that Britain has a unilateral option of staying in the world’s biggest trading bloc, once the outcome of Brexit is known. They argue that while there is no legal doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 EU member states, it should seek to establish a legal right to do so unilaterally, whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not. The news comes as Britain appears to be on the brink of an agreement with Brussels over its decision to leave the European Union, diplomatic sources said on Friday. Because no country has ever left the EU before, the exact meaning of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which regulates withdrawal from the EU is untested. “We have our hearing on November 27 at 9am” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This shows the ECJ is moving at breakneck speed on this case.”  The ECJ, which rules on the meaning of EU law, hopes to make a decision on the case before Christmas, a source close to the case told Reuters on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oscar-winning film director Danny Boyle has called on Britons to mark the upcoming centenary since the end of World War One by sketching out sand silhouettes on UK beaches in memory of the millions of people who lost their lives in the conflict. The “Pages of the Sea” project will see artists etch out large portraits of people killed in the 1914-18 conflict during low tide on Armistice Day on November 11 at various beaches around the country. Members of the public will also have a chance to create silhouettes of people as a tribute to those who died in what is known as the “Great War”. They will then wait for the tide to come in and wash away the imprints. “Pages of the Sea will be a unique moment, when we’ll say goodbye, together, to the millions of men and women who left their shores during the First World War,” British-born Boyle, known for films like “Trainspotting” and “Slumdog Millionaire”, said in a statement.  “Beaches are truly public spaces, where nobody rules other than the tide. They seem the perfect place to gather and say a final goodbye and thank you to those whose lives were taken or affected by the First World War.” Scottish poet Carol Ann Duffy will pen a sonnet for the occasion, which will be read out on the beaches. An estimated 17 million people were killed in World War One, many of them in the trenches of northern France and Belgium. Around one million of those who perished were from Britain and its then-empire. Various commemorative events are planned for Nov. 11, the day in 1918 when fighting ended on the Western Front.

2019-02-08,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - A week after a major earthquake brought devastation to Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, Ichsan Hidayat told how the bodies of his sister and her 43-day-old daughter were found under a sea of mud and debris, the mother clutching her baby to her chest. Hidayat was not on Sulawesi last Friday when the 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck, triggering a phenomenon called soil liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire. The neighbourhood of Petobo, in the south of the city of Palu, where his sister, Husnul Hidayat, lived with her daughter, Aisah, was wiped out. Rescuers who recovered the bodies told Hidayat his sister was found holding Aisah close. “Today, I prayed that they are in a better place. They deserve better,” Hidayat told Reuters as he left Friday prayers at a mosque in the centre of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. Worshippers knelt to pray on red carpets put down outside the mosque as the building is unsafe due to quake damage. Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population but also pockets of Christians, including on Sulawesi, and other religions. The official death toll from the quake and the tsunami it triggered stands at 1,571, but it will certainly rise. Most of the dead have been found in Palu. Figures for more remote areas, some still cut off by destroyed roads and landslides, are only trickling in, if at all. No one knows how many people were dragged to their deaths when the ground under Petobo and nearby areas south of Palu, dissolved so violently. The national disaster agency says 1,700 homes in one neighbourhood alone were swallowed up and hundreds of people killed. Hasnah, 44, also a resident of Petobo, has trouble remembering all of the relatives she’s trying to find in the tangled expanse of mud and debris. “More than half of my family are gone,” Hasnah said as she sobbed. “I can’t even count how many. Two of my children are gone, my cousins, my sister, my brother in law and their children. All gone.” Homes were sucked into the earth, torn apart and shunted hundreds of metres by the churning mud. “The earth was like a blender, blending everything in its way,” said Hasnah, who like many Indonesians goes by only one name. Hasnah said she has enough food and water but she’s furious that a search and rescue operation in her area only began on Thursday. “They said they would come with the heavy machines but they didn’t,” she said. “They lied.” Sick of waiting for help, villagers themselves have been searching, Hasnah said. “We’ve marked the possible bodies with sticks. You can see a foot sticking out, but there’s no one here to dig them out.” Rescue workers retrieved several bodies later on Friday. As the sun set, a mass prayer ceremony was held by Palu’s seafront that was scoured by the tsunami. “We pray for the ones who have died and for those yet to be found,” the imam said. “Allahu Akbar,” or God is Greatest, responded the congregation. The first signs of recovery are evident in Palu. Electricity has been restored and some shops and banks have reopened and aid and fuel are arriving. Vice President Jusuf Kalla, visiting the disaster zone, said recovery would be completed in two years, beginning with a two-month emergency response phase when everyone who lost their house would get temporary shelter. Doctors have been flocking to help from other parts of Indonesia. The Budi Agung hospital has 134 beds with about 20 more set up in a tent outside, all full. A hospital ship is also due to arrive. Doctors said many patients have been at high risk of infection because they were buried in mud.  Rescue workers are pushing into outlying districts cut off for days. Villagers rushed a Red Cross helicopter that landed at Sirenja village near the quake’s epicentre, about 75 km (45 miles) north of Palu, to drop off supplies. Some quake damage was evident but the coast did not appear to have been battered by the tsunami, a Reuters photographer said. Sulawesi is one of the archipelago nation’s five main islands, and like the others, is exposed to frequent earthquakes and tsunami. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - British mobile operator O2, which is owned by Spain’s Telefonica (TEF.MC), said on Thursday its network had suffered an outage that prevented users from making calls, but it had now been fixed.     “Some customers may have experienced issues using their mobile earlier today,” the company said on Twitter.  “This was fixed within 40 minutes but some customers may experience intermittent issues reconnecting to the network. We’re investigating what happened and we’re truly sorry for any inconvenience caused.”  Users of the country’s second-largest mobile operator had taken to social media on Thursday afternoon to complain about the outage.

2019-02-08,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will not leave Syria until the Syrian people hold an election, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday. “Whenever the Syrian people hold an election, we will leave Syria to its owners after they hold their elections,” Erdogan said at a forum in Istanbul. Erdogan agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month to set up a demilitarized zone between rebel and government fighters in northern Syria. It also has a presence in the northwest Afrin region and further east, around Jarablus.  Erdogan also said on Thursday that Turkey is not experiencing difficulty in conducting talks with radical groups in Idlib, the last major rebel-controlled enclave outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s control. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib. Turkey designated the group a terrorist organization in August, matching a decision by the United Nations in June. Last month, in a summit in Sochi, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to create a demilitarized zone with a depth of 15-20 km, from which radical groups will withdraw by Oct. 15. On Thursday, Erdogan said that in addition to 12 observation hosted by Turkey in the area, Russia has 10 observation points and Iran has six. “Securing this corridor means securing Idlib,” he said. “And we have started fortifying our observation posts.” Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun, Writing by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by David Dolan and Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey/turkey-will-not-leave-syria-until-syrian-people-have-an-election-erdogan-says-idUKKCN1ME250,2019-02-08,,"Turkey will not leave Syria until Syrian people have an election, Erdogan says"

2019-02-08,"TONDO, Indonesia (Reuters) - About 100 metres from the beach north of the earthquake-shattered Indonesian city of Palu, a wooden A-frame home is rising in the midst of a wasteland of concrete, mangled sheets of iron and uprooted trees. In the absence of help, survivors of last Friday’s quake and a devastating tsunami minutes later are helping themselves with a mix of stoicism and fatalism, picking through debris to construct homes and rescue household items. Two brothers - Nanang and Eko Joko -  are busy nailing planks of salvaged timber in the hammering heat.  “I was born here and it is better to die here,” said Eko, 41, a furniture maker, standing near three wrecked sewing machines that once upholstered sofas in a nearby workshop. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a devastating tsunami - three waves in only a few minutes - that levelled much of the coastline for 300 km (185 miles) north of Palu. Inland, the tremor destroyed homes, while liquefied soil sucked up entire villages. According to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency, 1,424 people have died, more than 2,500 have been injured and 66,238 homes damaged. There are 70,821 internally displaced people at 141 sites. In the centre of Palu, tent cities are starting to appear though further away aid has been slow to arrive and evacuation centres are still being constructed. An assessment from the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre reviewed by Reuters said 191,000 people had “urgent needs”, including 60,000 children and elderly. “Where else can we build? Who will give us the money to buy land elsewhere?” said Eko. “Besides, the evacuation centres are not hygienic.” The makeshift house will shelter ten people. As the construction continues, male members of the community are staying in the teetering ruins of their former homes, some of them shorn in half. Within minutes of the earthquake, as people gathered outside their homes, the men said they heard a loud noise, like “rolling thunder”.  “Our home withstood the earthquake but the tsunami was too much. The wave was half as high as that,” said Nanang, pointing to a 20-metre-high telecommunications tower. Residents ran “as far and as fast” as they could after hearing the roar of the ocean but about 50 of the roughly 1,000 residents in the neighbourhood were killed, the men said. On Thursday, four bodies were recovered a short distance from the emerging home.  While the government has helped recover some bodies and cleared the road, the area has received no other help, the men said. “We will start again here ourselves because God does not strike twice,” said Eko. “We can reinforce as much as we want. We could build dykes. But how tall are we going to build them? How can we withstand the forces of nature?” Editing by Ed Davies and",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-quake-rebuilding/god-does-not-strike-twice-indonesians-rebuild-in-disaster-zone-idUKKCN1ME1GI,2019-02-08,"About 100 metres from the beach north of the earthquake-shattered Indonesian city of Palu, a wooden A-frame home is rising in the midst of a wasteland of concrete, mangled sheets of iron and uprooted trees.",'God does not strike twice' - Indonesians rebuild in disaster zone
2019-02-08,"WANI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Ship’s engineer Charles Marlan had the unsettling sensation his vessel was being sucked out to sea, the telltale sign of an imminent tsunami, just minutes after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday. His passenger and cargo vessel, the 500-tonne KM Sabuk Nusantara 39, was docked in Wani, east of the city of Palu, which suffered the brunt of the disaster. “The whole ship was shaking, everything in our bunks started falling,” Marlan said. The ship was picked up by the tsunami rushing in from the sea and slammed onto land, crashing into a dockside settlement. And that’s where it lies, high and dry, nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami devastated the area, killing at least 1,424 people. Marlan and his fellow crewmen knew they were in trouble when they felt the ship being pulled back out to sea from the dock, as the sea receded, heralding the arrival of a tsunami. They had no sooner scrambled into life jackets when a five-metre wave bore down on them. “I could hear the waves coming,” Marlan said, describing how he was gripped by fear. “The waves carried us very fast and before we knew it, we were sitting on land,” he said in an interview aboard the ship, which sits balanced precariously, its propeller and rudder exposed, hanging dusty metres above the ground. No one on the boat was hurt. Now Marlan and 20 crewmen are stranded, awaiting a decision on what should be done from the national ferry operator, which owns the vessel. They survive on handouts from passing ferries and while away the time, attending a roll-call every now and then and chatting with neighbourhood kids who climb up on board. Marlan said he was thankful his ship had not killed anyone when it was hurled onto the land, as far as they knew. “What is important is we are alive and for that we should be grateful.” Editing by Robert Birsel and Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-indonesia-quake-ship/engineer-grateful-to-be-alive-after-tsunami-beaches-his-500-tonne-ship-idUKKCN1ME1LE,2019-02-08,,Engineer grateful to be alive after tsunami beaches his 500-tonne ship

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A leading proxy voting adviser said investors with  London-listed shares of Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) should oppose the consumer goods company’s plan to create a single holding company in the Netherlands. The call by the influential advisory firm follows a series of public announcements in recent days from institutional investors concerned about the move. Pensions & Investment Research Consultants Limited (PIRC), which advises pension schemes and other investors, said it was concerned about the impact on investors who would be forced to sell their shares. “The company’s exclusion from the FTSE 100 may compel some shareholders to sell their shares at a price and time that is not of their choosing, effectively resulting in a forced selling decision,” PIRC said in a report. With affected holders likely to be some of Unilever’s longest-standing investors, the board was being “short-sighted to presume that they have no voice”, PIRC said. “Ultimately, it could be viewed that the (UK) PLC shareholders are being asked to consent to a takeover without a premium being paid,” it added. PIRC said it had issued separate guidance to holders of the Dutch shares backing the move. Earlier on Wednesday, Royal London Asset Management said it would also vote against the plan, following similar statements from Legal & General Investment Management, Schroders and others. For Unilever’s proposal to pass, it needs approval from 75 percent of the UK PLC’s voted shares, and 50 percent of the Dutch NV’s. It also needs to be endorsed by a majority of shareholders. If approved, at votes scheduled for Oct. 25 and 26, the existing shares would stop trading on Dec. 21, with the new shares beginning to trade on Dec. 24.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Shares of Ted Baker (TED.L) fell nearly 14 percent after the British clothing and accessories retailer warned of a “challenging” remainder of the year, while posting a 3.2 percent drop in pretax profit for the first half.  Ted Baker, which operates 544 stores, concessions and outlets worldwide, has been focusing on its fast-growing online and wholesale businesses to offset retail sluggishness as consumers spend less. The company's stock was down 13.2 percent at 2004 pence on Thursday and was the top loser on the FTSE mid-cap index .FTMC “Whilst we believe that the second half of the year will remain challenging due to external factors, we are well positioned to continue Ted Baker’s long-term development”, Chief Executive Officer Ray Kelvin said. Pretax profit fell to 24.5 million pounds for the half-year ended Aug. 11 from 25.3 million pounds, a year earlier as more promotions to boost sales dragged on margins. But the promotions helped overall revenue rise 3.5 percent to 306 million pounds, with e-commerce sales surging more than 24 percent to 53 million pounds.  Retail sales were up 1.1 percent, the company said, adding that it was hurt by the hot weather across the UK and Europe earlier this year.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Opposition among Americans to Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, has increased in the wake of his testimony last week before a U.S. Senate committee in which he defiantly denied sexual misconduct allegations, Reuters/Ipsos polling data showed on Wednesday. In the latest seven-day average in a survey of U.S. adults, 41 percent of respondents opposed Kavanaugh, 33 percent supported the conservative federal appeals court judge and 26 percent said they did not know. Opposition to Kavanaugh grew 4 percentage points after the Sept. 27 Judiciary Committee hearing in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed a sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh and he denied it, portraying himself as the victim of a “political hit.” Opposition grew every day after the hearing in the poll, conducted between Sept. 25 and Oct. 1. The increase in opposition to Kavanaugh, facing a confirmation vote in the Senate after being nominated by Trump for a lifetime position on the court, appears to be driven by those who previously did not have an opinion. The percentage of respondents with no opinion on Kavanaugh decreased by about 7 percentage points compared to a week before the hearing. Support for Kavanaugh has remained relatively stable, the polling showed, rising slightly after the hearing.  Opposition rose among Democrats by 6 percentage points to 71 percent and was relatively unchanged among people unaffiliated with a political party compared to before the hearing, according to the poll. Support among Republicans stood at 70 percent, rising 4 percentage points in the days after the hearing, but was lower among Republican women, at 64 percent. Among independents and people unaffiliated with a political party, 31 percent opposed Kavanaugh, 20 percent supported him and 49 percent said they did not know. The fight over Kavanaugh’s nomination comes against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault that has toppled a succession of powerful men. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English. It gathered responses from 4,057 U.S. adults, including 1,347 Republicans and 1,653 Democrats.

2019-02-08,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The World Court ordered the United States on Wednesday to ensure that sanctions against Iran, due to be tightened next month, do not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety. Judges at the International Court Of Justice (ICJ) handed a small victory to Tehran, which had argued that sanctions imposed since May by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump violate terms of a 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries. But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the decision. He said the United Nations court, often called the “World Court”, had no jurisdiction over the sanctions, which Pompeo said were essential to U.S. security interests, and that Washington would “terminate” the little-known treaty with Iran. “This is a decision frankly that is 39 years overdue,” Pompeo told a news conference. “Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes and their case, as you can see from the decision, lacked merit.” Pompeo said the United States had already taken steps to ensure that the sanctions, which it intends to tighten next month, do not impact humanitarian aid — regardless of the court’s ruling. The court order issued on Wednesday was temporary, pending a resolution of Iran’s full lawsuit against Washington at the ICJ, something that could take years. Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement “the decision proved once again that the Islamic Republic is right and the U.S. sanctions against people and citizens of our country are illegal and cruel. “The United States must comply with its international commitments and lift obstacles to Iranian trade,” it added. The ICJ is the United Nations’ highest court for resolving disputes between nations. Its rulings are binding, but it has no power to enforce them, and both the United States and Iran have ignored them in the past. The court said assurances offered by Washington to ensure sanctions do not affect humanitarian conditions were “not adequate”. “The court considers that the United States must. ..remove by means of its choosing any impediment arising from the measures announced on 8 May 2018,” said Presiding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf, reading a summary of a ruling by the 15-member panel of justices. The sanctions may not hurt “exportation to the territory of Iran of goods required for humanitarian needs such as medicines, medical devices and foodstuffs and agricultural commodities as well as goods and services required for the safety of civil aviation,” he said. While U.S. sanctions “in principle” exempt food and medical supplies, the court said “it has become difficult if not impossible for Iran, Iranian nationals and companies to engage in international financial transactions” to purchase such goods. The Trump administration argued last month that Iran’s request was an attempt to misuse the court and that the 1955 treaty specifically ruled out using courts to resolve disputes. The treaty was signed long before Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution which ended friendly relations between the countries. U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Jennifer Newstead had said Iran’s real quarrel was its frustration over the U.S. pullout from the nuclear pact, under which Tehran restricted its disputed uranium enrichment programme under U.N. monitoring in exchange for a lifting of most international sanctions. Trump’s unilateral move has put it at odds with the other signatories to the deal, including Washington’s close European allies Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. Washington nonetheless plans to pursue a new series of sanctions due to go into effect Nov. 4 aimed at curtailing Iranian oil exports, the lifeblood of its economy.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union must focus on getting a divorce deal with an Irish border fix before they embark on discussions on their post-Brexit trade ties, the Czech Republic’s pointman on Europe said.  Britain is due to leave the EU in 177 days but talks on managing the unprecedented split have stalled over differences on how to avoid border checks between EU-member Ireland and Britain’s province of Northern Ireland. Officials expect a flurry of negotiations after Wednesday’s speech by British Prime Minister Theresa May closing the annual Conservative Party conference as both sides seek to break the deadlock in time for an EU summit in two weeks. “The chief concern for the EU right now is reaching a deal on the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide us with a two year transition period in which to set out the future relationship between the EU and the UK,” State Secretary for European Affairs Ales Chmelar said, adding divorce must cover an Irish fix.  Britain’s preferred option is focusing on agreeing close future trade ties. London wants this post-Brexit arrangement to regulate the Irish border but the bloc wants an emergency solution if trade talks fail or take longer. “The future relationship ... is a matter for future discussions. Without the Withdrawal Agreement we are, very soon, heading towards a no-deal scenario in which a hard border would inevitably be drawn up,” Chmelar said.  As both sides ready concessions, Britain is expected to present a new proposal for the Irish border soon.  The other 27 EU member states will put in writing for the first time next week their free trade proposal for Britain for after Brexit, hoping a more fleshed-out promise would woo London into compromises on Ireland and help May get enough support behind any divorce deal.  However, EU negotiators are also keen to maintain the “sequencing” used to keep up pressure on London to first deal with the Irish issue in order to ensure a smooth exit from the bloc before Brussels will fully engage on a future trade deal. The 27 leaders scheduled a crunch summit dinner in Brussels for Wednesday, Oct. 17, the evening before May joins them for a quarterly meeting. That is the point at which the EU hopes that the outline of an exit deal is agreed. If it is, more talks will follow on the future relationship in the hope that a further summit on Nov. 17-18 can wrap up both elements of the accord. The EU rejected London’s previous fix for Ireland last June because it envisaged only a time-limited emergency border backstop and assumed all of the UK would remain in the EU’s customs area for a while after Brexit. EU diplomats and negotiating officials stress they have not yet seen the new British plan, but warned against recasting what was already discussed after Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab told his party’s conference: “We said we would need to retain a UK-wide customs backstop.” “We will be open to looking at some of the options on regulatory checks,” he added, though it was not sure if that would also cover manufactured goods. Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, on whose support May relies to govern, was quick on Tuesday to reject differing regulation to the rest of the UK after Brexit.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Executives at the world’s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves, halt output declines and take advantage of a crude price rally after years of austerity. With oil at a four-year high of $85 a barrel, exploration departments are urging company boards to drill more, wages are creeping higher, service companies say rates will have to rise and some investors say Big Oil must start growing again soon. For the heads of companies such as BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) who have pledged to stick to lower spending after slashing budgets by as much as 50 percent since 2014, the pressure may become hard to resist. As in previous oil price cycles, there are concerns about the strength and duration of the business cycle, now in its 10th year of growth after the 2008 financial crisis. Unlike previous oil price cycles, there is the prospect, eventually, of an end to growth in oil demand as the world shifts to cleaner energy. But there are already signs some cost cuts implemented after oil slumped from $115 a barrel in 2014 to $26 in 2016 are being rolled back. Shell, for example, said last month its teams in the UK North Sea will switch to a less tiring rota of two weeks offshore then three weeks onshore. During the austerity years, teams spent three weeks offshore then four onshore. More frequent rotations mean more ships and helicopters will need to be chartered. Shell says the change will increase costs slightly but is convinced it will make its North Sea operations more cost effective and productive. More generally, salaries across the oil and gas sector have edged up about 6 percent so far in 2018 after declining in the previous three years, according to a survey published by Rigzone. At one major firm, senior managers who had been meeting by video conference for several years are now getting flights approved for face-to-face gatherings, according to an executive at the company. The boards of large oil firms are facing more internal requests to invest in new projects and acquisitions, and to beef up staff, according to senior executives present at such discussions. “There is lots of pressure from all the units to get more money,” said an executive at a large European oil company. (For a graphic showing spending by major oil companies: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CqZfMP) LONG-CYCLE INVESTMENTS New project approvals are picking up. Shell and its partners this week gave the green light to LNG Canada, one of the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in recent years. “Shell’s motivations for the project are clear: without this project, the company’s upstream, LNG contract portfolio and LNG production was set to go into decline early next decade,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Dulles Wang said. Typically, after a period of lower capital spending, or capex, and low prices comes an era of rapid investment as oil recovers and supplies tighten. During the lean years, companies cut back sharply. Now, they generate as much cash as in 2014 and are vowing to remain thrifty to focus on higher dividends, buying back shares and reducing debt. But in an industry where reserves and production decline naturally as oil is pumped from fields, continued investment is considered critical. “We are likely in need of more long-cycle investments given the persistent and accelerating base declines observed in global conventional and offshore projects,” said a source at in investment firm with large stakes in big oil companies. Although some companies such as BP (BP.L) were able to stem production declines thanks to technology and lower costs, a drop in new production has taken a toll on the longer-term outlook for many companies. Oilfield decline rates doubled from 3 percent in 2014 to 6 percent in 2016. For the big oil firms, rates went from 1.5 percent to just over 2 percent during the same period, according to Morgan Stanley. “I expect capex rises due to a significant drop in reservoir life. Some capex will be used to reinvigorate existing wells,” said Darren Sissons, partner at Campbell Lee & Ross Investment Management, adding that increases would be cautious initially. (For a graphic showing reserve life for major oil companies reserve life: https://tmsnrt.rs/2wPUtmd) Spending by the world’s top seven oil companies is expected to rise to a combined $136 billion by 2020 from $105 billion in 2017, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Jefferies (JEF.N). Starting from the middle of next year, boards will change their tone to prepare shareholders for higher spending from 2020, Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats said. “New project awards will likely already accelerate in 2019, but for major developments, capex in the first year tends to be limited. From 2020 onwards, capex is likely to go higher.” Boards are not blind to the pressure. Many companies have defined a range for spending, while committing to the lower end. Shell, for example, has a “soft floor” and a “hard ceiling” for spending of $25 billion to $30 billion per year. For some companies such as Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), which is developing major gas projects in Egypt and Mozambique, boosting costs may be unavoidable. “(Oil companies) proved themselves in a low oil price environment, but at some point they do need to start respending on new projects to keep getting oil out of the ground,” said David Smith, fund manager of the Henderson High Income Trust. Patrick Pouyanne, chief executive of French oil company Total (TOTF.PA), conceded this week that while it aimed to stick to its spending range of $15 billion to $17 billion a year beyond 2020, capex could rise to $20 billion. “Our view is that the majors’ capex is probably 5 to 10 percent or so too low if they are to maintain their current reserve lives,” said Jonathan Waghorn, co-manager of Guinness Asset Management’s global energy fund. (For a graphic showing upstream investment by oil and gas companies: reut.rs/2NZjaI5)  The pressure to increase spending also comes at a time oil services companies are slowly increasing rates, saying their sacrifices to help Big Oil weather the slump should now be rewarded as crude prices rise. “Current investment levels, particularly in the international market, are clearly not sustainable to meet either medium-term demand or long-term reserves replacement needs,” Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer of Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world’s largest oil services provider, told a conference last month. He said the international production base needed double-digit growth in investment for the foreseeable future just to keep production at current levels. But investors and executives say reserve life - which was at its lowest in at least two decades in 2017 - is no longer the gold standard for measuring the health of oil companies. A spending splurge could also eat into profits and revive fears oil companies are returning to the wasteful practices of the first half of the decade when crude prices soared. ""Historically, excess free cash flow above dividend cost has seen capex rise in the industry but the sector is trying to shake off the capital indiscipline tag and I believe they will stick to that,"" said Rohan Murphy, analyst at Allianz Global Investors www.allianzgi.com.

2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain cannot be bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening the government’s criticism of the European Union for taunting Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks. May’s ministers have come out one by one at their party’s annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to show “respect” in the talks to end Britain’s membership. Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country’s biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not only in her governing party but also in Brussels. Party unity is on British ministers’ minds, and they are encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather than at their prime minister, who some eurosceptic Conservatives accuse of leading Britain towards a “Brexit in name only”. But the new strident tone has annoyed many in Brussels, especially when foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the bloc to the Soviet Union, the master of several states in eastern Europe which saw membership of the EU as a measure of their freedom. Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond, have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a deal could hurt Britain’s economy, the world’s fifth largest. But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the “ambition and pragmatism” Britain had put forward with May’s Chequers proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement with her ministers was hashed out in July. “Unfortunately, that wasn’t on display in Salzburg,” he said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan. “Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation.” “What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country’s interests,” Raab said, later calling again on the EU to move their position and meet Britain half way. Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit. A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: “A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries” “certainly had an impact”, one official said. With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any future relationship, the possibility of a “no deal Brexit” has increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a worst case scenario. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the discussion in Britain over Brexit was still far removed from reality.    “The world is watching,” said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the Confederation of British Industry.  “Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills would be hugely helpful,” he told Reuters. But one source close to the government said there was now a sense that the EU had realised that the tone set in Salzburg was “perhaps a bit off” and, behind the scenes, conversations between the two sides were more constructive. Raab later said the government was open to looking at regulatory checks to try to ease talks on a so-called backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - one of the outstanding issues yet to be agreed. Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance. After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still “be neighbours and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,” he told the conference, again backing May’s Chequers plan. “Mr Tusk says it won’t work. But that’s what people said about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.” But Hunt’s popular line at conference, that the EU was acting like the Soviet Union, did little to soothe relations, provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later. Lithuania’s EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labour camp and was jailed by the Soviet KGB state security agency. “Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and Soviet Union,” he said. “Anytime. Whatever helps.” But back in Birmingham, it was Raab, winning a standing ovation for his story about his father’s journey from then Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion, who summed up Britain’s new combative stance. “The EU’s theological approach allows no room for serious compromise,” he said. “If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious.” Additional reporting by William James, Kylie MacLellan, Michael Holden, Guy Faulconbridge and Gabriela Baczynska, writing by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Janet Lawrence, Toby Chopra, Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/dont-bully-us-britain-takes-new-combative-tone-to-brexit-talks-idUKKCN1MB2CG,2019-02-08,,"'Don't bully us', Britain takes new combative tone to Brexit talks"
2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Former British foreign minister Boris Johnson set out his stall to the Conservative Party faithful on Tuesday, stopping just short of an outright leadership bid to replace Prime Minister Theresa May but tearing into her Brexit blueprint. To standing ovations, cheers and laughter, Johnson, May’s most powerful critic in her governing party, said her so-called Chequers plan to leave the European Union was a “cheat” that would leave Britain “locked in the tractor beam of Brussels”. But May, who did not watch her former minister, again showed little sign of shifting away from her so-called Chequers plan to keep close ties with the EU after Brexit, the biggest shift in British foreign and trade policy for more than 40 years. With just six months before Britain leaves the EU, May’s precarious position at the helm of her party has been further shaken by criticism of her Chequers plan, named after her country residence, at home and in Brussels. Johnson, the figurehead for the campaign to leave the EU and the bookmakers’ favourite to replace May, has become the loudest critic, warning Conservatives that if they supported Chequers they could be signing up to the party’s electoral death. But despite seeming to rally party members to his cause by calling on Conservatives to return to their traditional values, he disappointed some supporters by saying he would stick by May at least for now. “If we get it wrong, if we bottle Brexit now, believe me, the people of this country will find it hard to forgive,” Johnson told the hundreds of Conservatives who queued to get a seat in a hall just across from the main venue where May will address the party’s annual conference on Wednesday. “Do not believe that we can somehow get it wrong now, bodge it now and fix it later,” he said to cheers. “This is the moment to chuck Chequers,” he said. “If we cheat the electorate, and Chequers is a cheat, we will escalate that sense of mistrust.” May has shown little sign of moving away from her blueprint, and had tried to put on a show of unity at her party conference in the central English city of Birmingham. But her bid to revitalise her domestic agenda and steal the initiative from the main opposition Labour Party has been overshadowed by the party splits over Brexit.  She told the BBC, she was a bit cross with Johnson but only because his alternative Brexit proposals would, she said, tear up the United Kingdom by forcing Northern Ireland to operate separately from the rest of the UK. “Boris always puts on a good show but what matters to people is what we are delivering for them on the things that affect their day to day lives,” she told Sky News. Other ministers chimed in, with Justice Minister David Gauke doubting whether Johnson’s credentials for leadership. “Now is a time for a credible and serious plan, and credible and serious leadership. We have that from Theresa May, I think there are others who would struggle to provide that type of leadership,” Gauke said. Some of Johnson’s supporters, while welcoming his speech, said they believed now was not the time to launch a leadership bid against May. “He is absolutely right about the threat that Chequers poses to our democracy, our country and ultimately the fortunes of the Conservative Party if we stick with it,” Andrew Bridgen, a Conservative lawmaker, said. “Am I disappointed (that he didn’t declare)? No, because I think we probably can’t have the self-indulgence of a leadership challenge.” But while Johnson may be holding his fire on the leadership for now, he gave both barrels to May’s Brexit plan and set out his vision for the Conservative Party - one that returned to its traditional values of low taxes and a strong police. Namechecking Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister from 1979 to 1990 who remains a hero to many in the party, he called on the party to build more houses and, while courting business, he struck out at bankers over the 2008 financial crisis. “It was a great speech, he was optimistic, he talked about Conservative values, and he talked about the opportunities if we do Brexit properly,” Richard Tice, co-chairman of campaign group Leave means Leave, said after Johnson’s speech.  “I think the whole country will be listening and the whole country will be saying here is a guy that was deeply involved in securing Brexit in the first place who is basically saying that Chequers is a constitutional outrage, and it is.” Additional reporting by Michael Holden, Kate Holton, Andy Bruce, Andrew MacAskill and Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Jon Boyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-johnson/chuck-chequers-johnson-challenges-may-on-brexit-idUKKCN1MB3SM,2019-02-08,,"'Chuck Chequers', Johnson challenges May on Brexit"
2019-02-08,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy defied pressure from Brussels and its euro zone partners on Tuesday to water down ambitious budget plans, threatening to sue EU officials it said were to blame for a deepening sell-off on Rome’s financial markets. The government last week set a deficit target of 2.4 percent of economic output for the next three years.  That tripling of its predecessor’s goal by the EU’s second most indebted nation unnerved investors and prompted criticism and calls for a rethink from the European Commission. “We are not turning back from the 2.4 percent target... We will not backtrack by a millimeter,” Luigi Di Maio, deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, said on RTL radio. As Italian bonds and banking shares sold off sharply, Di Maio said there was “no doubt” the leaders of France and Germany wanted the Italian government to fall, while one lawmaker suggested the country would be better off without the euro. Euro zone finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg said Italy, whose representative Giovanni Tria was a notable absentee, needed to toe the fiscal line. “The majority of the member states will clearly ask and demand that these (EU budget) rules are observed,” Austrian minister Hartwig Loger, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, told a news conference.    European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said the current draft appeared not to comply with the rules, though Brussels was open to dialogue.  Italy’s ruling coalition, which joined forces in June on promises to slash taxes and boost welfare spending, directed anger at Brussels. Its other deputy Prime Minister, right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini, said it might seek compensation from the EU over Italy’s rising borrowing costs.  “The words and the threats of Juncker and other high EU bureaucrats continue to raise the spread (between Italian and German bond yields). We are ready to seek damages from those who want to harm Italy,” Salvini said. Italian 10-year bond yields peaked at a 4-1/2-year high on Tuesday and shares in Italian banks .FTIT8300 at a 19-month low. Both assets later trimmed those losses. EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker drew parallels on Monday between Italy’s budget plans and the finances of Greece, which emerged from its third international bailout as recently as August. While the headline deficit of 2.4 percent that Italy is proposing would be within the Commission’s 3 percent limit, under the current plan the structural - or underlying - deficit would rise, which runs contrary to EU rules. The Commission is also concerned the proposal will increase Italy’s huge public debt, proportionally the EU’s second highest after Greece’s. The government says the debt will fall as the expansionary budget spurs economic growth. On Monday, Juncker said the EU must be “strict” with Italy to avoid putting the euro project at risk. Salvini called that a “threat” that “no-one in Italy is taken in by”. He said the government’s priority was to respond to its citizens’ needs and criticism of its budget “will not stop us.” The government’s task is made harder by pressure on Italian bonds, intensified when euroskeptic League lawmaker Claudio Borghi said the country’s economic situation would improve outside the euro zone. Borghi did not suggest the government planned to drop the euro, and Di Maio and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte later reiterated that Rome has no intention of leaving either the euro zone or the EU. “The euro is our currency and for us it is unrenounceable,” and declarations suggesting otherwise had nothing to do with government policy, Conte said on Facebook. Di Maio said Rome’s adversaries were hoping to use markets to weaken the coalition, but their bid would fail because the 5-Star/League alliance was more united than ever. Economy Minister Tria, a moderating but seemingly increasingly isolated voice in government who is a member of neither party, left Luxembourg late on Monday for Rome to put the finishing touches to the budget plan. The document is expected in coming days but could be published as soon as Tuesday. additional reporting by Giselda Vagnoni and Massimiliano Di Giorgio, Editing by Gavin Jones and John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-budget/defiant-italy-says-no-turning-back-on-budget-despite-eu-threats-idUKKCN1MC1I6,2019-02-08,"Italy defied pressure from Brussels and its euro zone partners on Tuesday to water down ambitious budget plans, threatening to sue EU officials it said were to blame for a deepening sell-off on Rome's financial markets.",Defiant Italy says no turning back on budget despite EU 'threats'

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland expects Brexit negotiators to return to the kind of “professional” talks that had been going on before British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party conference and do what is needed to reach a deal, Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Tuesday. With six months to go before Britain leaves the EU, May’s precarious position at the helm of her party has been tested this week by a conference that further highlighted the deep divisions within her party over how she intends to see Britain leave the EU. Coveney said that had resulted in a lot of very forceful language on both sides of the Brexit debate within Britain’s ruling Conservative party but that much of that was for domestic and internal political party consumption. The European Union - which is deadlocked in negotiations with Britain over how to avoid the return of a hard border between Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland post-Brexit - should instead be “calm and sensible” and not get dragged into that debate, he said. “As soon as this conference is over I hope we will get back to the kind of professional negotiations that had been going on before the Tory party conference to get what needs to be done in the next couple of months over the line,” Coveney told reporters. “That will be our focus and not taking the bait from comments that are somewhat inflammatory....

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - With oil prices hitting fresh four-year highs, long-dormant proposals to allow the United States to sue OPEC nations are getting a fresh look in Congress, though they were once considered a longshot to becoming law. A U.S. Senate subcommittee on Wednesday will hear testimony on the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, which would revoke the sovereign immunity that has long shielded OPEC members from U.S. legal action.  The bill would change U.S. antitrust law to allow OPEC producers to be sued for collusion; it would make it illegal to restrain oil or gas production or set those prices - removing sovereign immunity that U.S. courts have ruled exists under current law. Past U.S. leaders have opposed the NOPEC bill, but the possibility of its success may have increased due to President Donald Trump’s frequent criticism of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and as some predict that Brent crude, the international benchmark, could reach $100 a barrel before long.  “OPEC is a pet peeve for him,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research. “Everybody thinks he could easily support NOPEC.” Saudi Arabia is lobbying the U.S. government to prevent the bill’s passage, sources familiar with the matter said. Business groups and oil companies also oppose the bill, citing the possibility of retaliation from other countries. OPEC controls output from member nations by setting production targets. Prices are up 82 percent following the cartel’s decision to cut output at the end of 2016, hitting $84 a barrel on Monday, and lawmakers have trained their ire on the group, saying it is again harming consumers and represents interference in free markets. Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights could give insight into the executive branch’s stance, McMonigle said. One of the witnesses will be Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, who has written in support of such legislation.  A version of NOPEC passed both houses of Congress in 2007 but was shelved after President George W. Bush said he would veto the legislation. Chances of passage this year are slim, as the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to be in session only 16 days the rest of this year, leaving little time for anything but must-do legislation like keeping the government funded. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is worried that NOPEC could turn into another Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) law, which allows victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States to sue Riyadh, the sources said. The JASTA law is seen as key to why state-run Saudi Aramco was hesitant in publicly listing its shares on U.S. markets in an IPO that has since been shelved.  With close to $1 trillion in investments in the United States, Riyadh has a lot to lose if NOPEC becomes law. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih raised concerns about it with U.S. officials, including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, during private meetings in recent months, two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Earlier this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute told Congress they opposed the bill, saying surging U.S. energy output had mitigated OPEC’s influence.      Since the U.S. renewed sanctions on Iran this May, other nations, including Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase production. However, that has not yet stopped oil’s upward climb.

2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain will unilaterally implement a digital service tax if there is no international agreement soon on how to tax big internet companies, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said on Monday, blaming U.S. tax reforms for slow multilateral progress. “The best way to tax international companies is through international agreements but the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop,” Hammond told the Conservative Party conference in the English city of Birmingham. “If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own,” he said. Britain has previously said it was considering taxing the revenues of internet firms such as Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) until international tax rules are changed to cope with digital firms that can shift sales and profits between jurisdictions. Speaking at a later event, Hammond said the tax would only apply to firms above a “quite substantial” size threshold and would involve putting a value on the content and data of British consumers as a share of the firms’ overall value and calculating what proportion of the business is based in the UK.  He said talks at an international level had been stalled by U.S. tax reforms aimed at ensuring internet firms pay their taxes there. “I have to say my prognosis is that it is quite unlikely that we will be able to achieve international agreement in anything like a sensible time scale because the U.S. isn’t frankly onside with this agenda,” he said. Hammond said Britain was also looking at ways to update its competition policy in response to the power of major companies. “The expansion of the global tech giants and digital platforms, while of course bringing huge benefits to consumers, raises new questions about whether too much power is being concentrated in too few global technology businesses,” he said. Hammond has appointed President Barack Obama’s former chief economist, Jason Furman, to lead a review of Britain’s competition regime, to ensure it is fit for the digital era. The Confederation of British Industry warned that any tax moves should not damage the UK’s global competitiveness. “All businesses are increasingly digital. Any new approach must be built on evidence from enterprise or it risks being blunt and counterproductive,” Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s Director-General, said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Liquefied soil caused numerous buildings to collapse in the Indonesian city of Palu after Friday’s magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which has killed more than 800 people.  Here’s a brief explanation of liquefaction, how common it is, and where it is likely to happen.   Liquefaction is a phenomenon where saturated sand and silt take on the characteristics of a liquid during the intense shaking of an earthquake, according to the United States Geological Survey website.   It takes place when a quake has increased water pressure in saturated soil and made particles in the soil lose contact with each other, making the soil - particularly sandy soil - act like liquid. The effect has been likened to slapping a wet, hard beach and the sand beneath your palm becomes jelly.     In the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said.  Satellite images of the Petobo district, south of Palu’s airport, showed another large area of urban development seemingly wiped clear of buildings. “When the quake hit, the layers below the surface of the earth became muddy and loose,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s national disaster mitigation agency. “Mud with such large mass volume drowned and dragged the housing complex in Petobo so that most of them became as if they were absorbed. We estimate 744 units of houses are there.” Amateur video footage appeared to show trees, buildings and even a large communications tower being tossed around in fast-moving landslides. Reuters was unable to verify the footage.  Among those killed were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp that was hit by liquefaction, a Red Cross official said. Liquefaction is most likely to happen in reclaimed land. Areas with shallow water tables and close to the sea or rivers are also susceptible to liquefaction.  “Compared with what’s been formed naturally over a long period of time, what’s manmade has been constructed for a short period of time, where soil particles are only loosely connected to each other,” said Toshitaka Kamai, professor at Kyoto University’s Disaster Prevention Research Institute.  The eastern Japanese city of Urayasu, where the majority of land was formed by reclamation, saw 86 percent of its land affected by liquefaction following the massive 2011 earthquake. It took the city six years to repair all the damaged underground sewerage, water and gas facilities. “It renders underground pipes mangled mess. One of its characteristics is it takes time to recover (from liquefaction damage),” Yoshiharu Yokoyama, an executive at Jibannet Co Ltd, which provides soil analysis services.     Conditions that could lead to liquefaction can be found in many places in Indonesia and throughout Asia, said Mark Quigley, Associate Professor of Earthquake Science at the University of Melbourne. “People need to live in places that are habitable for a whole bunch of reasons. In the case of Palu it’s on a very nice, natural bay. It’s on a river that would have provided historically a source of water for them. There’s a lot of really mountainous jungle-y terrain all around it, it’s not like they had endless opportunity to just choose whatever site they wanted.”  Earthquake and soil experts say liquefaction is fairly common. It happened after the massive 9.0 magnitude quake that hit eastern Japan in 2011 and numerous other Japanese earthquakes in recent years. It has also been reported in several previous Indonesian earthquakes, major quakes in Christchurch, New Zealand in 2010 and 2011, and the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Big Four accounting firms can invest in technology that will raise standards beyond what could be achieved by smaller rivals, the head of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said on Tuesday, defending the top firms against UK calls to be broken up.  British lawmakers want the country’s competition watchdog to consider forcing PwC, EY, KPMG and Deloitte, the four accounting firms that check the books of most blue chip companies globally, to separate out their audit and consultancy operations. This, the lawmakers said earlier this year, would provide a better focus on raising standards to ensure auditors flag company difficulties before collapses like at retailer BHS and outsourcer Carillion in Britain. “Various people are providing this relatively easy answer to split up the firms, but we do not support it,” PwC global chairman Bob Moritz told Reuters. PwC, which employs over 250,000 people, will have invested a billion dollars on “Cloud” computing by 2019, a huge sum that firms outside the Big Four would find hard to match.  Such advanced technology will mean harvesting far more data from a company to ensure accounts face tougher “checks and balances” to meet the criticisms over audit standards from policymakers, Moritz said. Any intervention in the market must be “well thought out” given it would  be watched closely by the rest of the world, he added. Moritz was speaking as PwC announced record annual revenues of $41.3 billion (31.6 billion pounds) for its year ended June 30, making it the second largest accounting firm in the world, behind Deloitte, whose latest annual revenues topped $43 billion. Moritz said the focus was on PwC being a “balanced” firm: “I don’t want to be number one just for the sake of growth.” PwC was hit by a record 6.5 million pound ($8.5 million) fine in June from Britain’s Financial Reporting Council after it failed to flag significant doubts over the future of BHS. Moritz said PwC made mistakes and had taken responsibility for its actions, but authorities should not rush to carve up the sector because of them. The industry has already met with Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to offer temporary, voluntary limits on how many big listed companies a Big Four accounting firm could audit in a bid to help smaller rivals expand. The CMA has yet to respond. “The challenge is whether or not the other firms have the skills, capability and staff to do those audits as well,” Moritz said. “There is nothing abusive in the competition that’s happening,” he said, adding there was a need for the Big Four to have more “scalable and credible competitors”. So far, attempts in Britain to persuade companies to “rotate” their accountant every decade have ended up creating a Big Four merry-go-round.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index lagged other European markets on Monday as investors kept one eye on developments over Brexit from the ruling Conservative Party’s annual conference, and another on Ryanair’s 13 percent dive after a profit warning. Gains in sterling on finance minister Philip Hammond’s speech and a report of Brexit progress reined the FTSE 100 back. The FTSE 100 .FTSE, whose companies make 70 percent of their earnings from abroad, fell 0.2 percent while the domestically focussed mid cap index .FTMC rose 0.5 percent.  “All eyes on sterling over the next few days as the pound will remain sensitive to news from the Conservative conference,” said Peel Hunt economist Ian Williams. Hammond said the UK had the fiscal capacity to cope with leaving the European Union without any agreement but believed the mood in Brussels was to reach a divorce deal. His comments lifted the pound and that in turn sent shares in multinationals BAT (BATS.L) and Shire SHP.L down between 1.7 and 2.3 percent. A report that the government was proposing a compromise on the Irish border issue - a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations - also boosted the pound, taking the FTSE 100 down into negative territory. Politics aside, a big weight on the FTSE 100 was Royal Mail (RMG.L). Shares in the postal service operator sank as much as 20 percent after a trading statement warning full-year performance will be “significantly below target” due to labour market and other cost pressures impacting margins “more than anticipated”. Oil majors Shell (RDSa.AS) and BP (BP.L) rose 0.6 and 1 percent respectively, the biggest supports to the FTSE, as Brent prices climbed to their highest since November 2014 ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran. [O/R] Airlines, which have recently been hit by rising oil prices that could increase their fuel costs, were under further pressure after a profit warning from Ryanair (RYA.I). Europe’s largest low-cost carrier cut its forecast for full-year profit by 12 percent and said there could be worse to come if recent coordinated strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings. Its Dublin-listed shares fell 12.4 percent, while London-listed rivals easyJet (EZJ.L) and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG.L) fell 6.5 and 1.9 percent respectively. “Whilst this announcement is not a total surprise given the short-term headwinds Ryanair has faced over the past few months, following easyJet’s cautious outlook for FY19 on Friday, it is the latest indication that the “low cost wins, legacy loses” story may be coming to an end,” wrote Bernstein airlines analyst Daniel Roeska. Housebuilders were another weak spot. Berkeley Group (BKGH.L), Barratt Developments (BDEV.L), and Persimmon (PSN.L) were among the top fallers on the FTSE, down 1 to 3 percent after the Conservative Party set out plans to levy an extra fee on foreign buyers of homes in Britain. United Utilities (UU.L) rose 2.6 percent after a Deutsche Bank upgrade to buy. Among the smaller companies, Avocet Mining (AVM.L) plummeted 37.9 percent after warning it could be broken up as the gold miner continues talks with its largest shareholder to restructure its debt. Just Group (JUSTJ.L) fell 9.2 percent after the pensions provider said its finance chief would step down at the end of October, days after proposed regulatory changes forced the company to delay dividend payments.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The United States and Canada forged a last-gasp deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a three-country, $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century. JOHN BODE, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE U.S. CORN REFINERS ASSOCIATION: “This is a milestone. Mexican and Canadian markets are very important to American farmers, ranchers, and agribusiness. We commend President Trump for his efforts to conclude this trilateral agreement. We look forward to reviewing the agreement text released today.” RANDY GORDON, CEO NATIONAL GRAIN AND FEED ASSOCIATION (NGFA) AND GARY MARTIN, CEO NORTH AMERICAN EXPORT GRAIN ASSOCIATION (NAEGA)  “Given the integrated nature of the North American economy, including within the food and agricultural sector, it was extremely important to reach a trade agreement that included all three countries.    “Our industry is encouraged about reports that the final agreement takes steps to modify some existing impediments to agricultural trade, including dairy, and will preserve some form of the trilateral Chapter 19 tariff dispute-settlement mechanism contained in the North American Free Trade Agreement. PRESIDENT AND CEO MATTHEW SHAY, THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION:    “We are pleased a deal has been reached that preserves NAFTA’s trilateral framework, which is critical to protecting North American supply chains that support millions of American jobs. The administration, as well as officials from Canada and Mexico, should be applauded for months of hard work aimed at modernizing NAFTA for the 21st century —  a goal retailers have shared from the start.” GEOFF FREEMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (GMA)  “U.S. consumers rely on the high-quality ingredients and affordable products made possible through trade with our closest neighbours. This trade has quadrupled since NAFTA went into effect more than two decades ago, totalling nearly $18 billion in 2017. Canada and Mexico buy about half of all U.S. processed product exports, and this agreement will expand that success. MICHAEL DYKES, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE INTERNATIONAL DAIRY FOODS ASSOCIATION, A WASHINGTON GROUP THAT REPRESENTS DAIRY PROCESSORS:  “Having this agreement be trilateral is very important. We are pleased to see the negotiators preserved access with our number one customer, Mexico. For Canada, our priorities included increased market access and my understanding is we did get that. “We are pleased with the negotiators and are pleased with the priority they placed on the dairy industry.”  EDWARD R. HAMBERGER, CHIEF, THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS:  “The free flow of goods across North America without burdensome tariffs is a net positive for U.S. workers, bedrock industries and the economy.” “Nothing but good news here for the US dairy industry. Class 7 milk pricing in Canada caused problems for US manufacturers in two different ways. First, it stopped the flow of ultra-filtered milk, a concentrated skim solids ingredient that was used to boost protein content in cheese and yogurt made in Canada. “Second, the pricing system allowed for Canada to be competitive to export their excess skim milk powder, taking away market share from the US. Eliminating the Canadian Class 7 pricing system could open these markets back up to US processors. Lastly, any further opening of the Canadian market to general imports is helpful to the US dairy industry. While exact details of the agreement between Canada and the United States have yet to be released, there is nothing at the core of the agreement that looks bearish to the US dairy industry and should lead to a boost in export demand for US dairy products.”  DON ROOSE, PRESIDENT OF U.S. COMMODITIES, AN IOWA-BASED AG BROKERAGE AND ADVISORY FIRM: “It opens up the trade for a lot of different agricultural products. I don’t know if (the USMCA) was a surprise; it was definitely a positive for all the ag markets, for the psychology of the markets. Pushing forward to the EU and Japan talks – those are probably as dominant (for the market) as NAFTA.” “Looking at the price action last week the Canadian dollar outperformed, so there may have been some inkling in the markets that with this sort of self-imposed deadline that we had at the end of September that we could get something or should get something, but we have run into a lot of those soft deadlines before and nothing of consequence has happened. I don’t know that anyone was overly convinced that we would get something necessarily this weekend but I think most people viewed a trade arrangement would be bound at some point. “The good news is that the risk of bad news has been removed. I don’t think there’s anything here that really changes the medium term outlook for the Canadian dollar or the Canadian economy, it’s just removed an uncertainty.”  DAVID KELLY, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN FUNDS, NEW YORK:  “The most significant thing about this new deal is that they changed the name. Reading it, it really is tweaks to NAFTA, but at least some of them in a positive direction from the economic perspective. It really is very small changes to the underlying framework of North American trade, but that’s a positive. There’s only downside to a trade war. To the extent we avoided a trade war in this hemisphere at least that is a positive. “The fact that having made a very big deal about Nafta during the elections but then agreed to a deal which only changes small parts of it does say something about the potential end game for trade talks with China. There is a limit to how much China will compromise in the end, a limit to how much we will need them to compromise in the end. After all the U.S. trade deficit is primarily caused by a too-high U.S. dollar and a big deficit.”   “Obviously this is a positive step forward, it’s one more box to tick. Overall, markets and investors are very much focussed on economic policy and the upcoming earnings season and ignoring everything coming out of Washington. But given that last week it was looking to be more of a Mexico-US deal as opposed to a trilateral deal, it’s a positive development. It shows investors that in spite of an unconventional approach, the President’s hard tactics seem to be working.”  MIKE LORIZIO, SENIOR FIXED INCOME TRADER AT MANULIFE ASSET MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK:  “There is a pretty significant risk-on tone following the new NAFTA agreement.  “However, an eventual agreement was priced in, or at least a non-disaster scenario was priced in. The market was more focussed on the risk of a trade war with China than any other area and the market has been positioned accordingly. And even with China, the market has discounted what impact any trade negotiations will have on the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. “This is a positive, and you’ve seen risk assets respond, and you’ve seen Treasuries respond a bit, but U.S. fundamentals are so strong right now that the effects of these negotiations had already been priced in.   RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES FOR CHARLES SCHWAB IN AUSTIN, TEXAS:  “Anything positive relating to trade has always buoyed the markets so it’s not surprising to see a bounce. Generally those things are relatively short lived but the economics in the market are very strong and really only the concerns about the trade issues have been holding the market back from moving higher.” ALEC YOUNG, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL MARKETS RESEARCH, FTSE RUSSELL IN NEW YORK:  “Stocks are rallying on the back of a last-minute deal Sunday that allows Canada to join the revised NAFTA Trade deal agreed to by the US and Mexico in late August. Despite all the handwringing over trade, the bark is proving far worse than the bite for U.S. stocks.  “Although the trade outlook with China remains uncertain, overall trade uncertainty has been receding for months helping propel stocks to record highs. And even when it comes to China many investors are betting there’s room for a market friendly compromise after the U.S. midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25 percent tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019. That rate is currently only 10 percent. International stocks have even more to gain from trade breakthroughs than their U.S. counterparts because they have been held back too far by trade worries due to their economies’ increased sensitivity to trade.” STOCKS: Stocks were ahead, with the S&P 500 .SPX up 0.7 percent in early trading.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday as a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact lifted some of the gloom over global trade, while Italian stocks extended Friday’s slide as top EU officials weighed in on the government’s budget plans. There was no shortage of corporate news to drive the markets either, with Ryanair taking a 12.5 percent dive after a profit warning, Fresenius boosted by a ruling in its favour, and Linde rising on a regulator’s green light for its merger with Praxair. The euro zone's top stock index .STOXX50E rose 0.4 percent while Germany's trade-sensitive DAX .GDAXI climbed 0.8 percent. “News overnight of a late agreement between the U.S. and Canada to salvage the NAFTA trade agreement should give a boost to global risk appetite at the start of the fourth quarter,” wrote Peel Hunt strategist Ian Williams, adding the deal “may offer encouragement that the other global trade disputes can be settled satisfactorily”. Ryanair (RYA.I) was the worst performer, down 7.5 percent  after it cut its forecast for full-year profit and said there could be worse to come if recent coordinated strikes across Europe continue to hit traffic and bookings. The fall in Europe’s largest low-cost carrier weighed on the wider sector .SXTP which fell 0.5 percent. Peers Easyjet (EZJ.L), Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) and British Airways owner IAG (ICAG.L) were down 4.1 percent, 2.6 percent and 1.4 percent  respectively.  While the overall market gained, Italian shares were still on tenterhooks in the fallout of the government’s decision to increase its deficit target, while Italy’s government bond yields climbed higher. Starting the day as the strongest gainer, the FTSE MIB reversed course to finish down 0.6 percent with Italian banks .FTIT8300 extending Friday’s fall by another 3.1 percent.  The Vice President of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis said its initial view was that the Italian budget plans break EU rules. “Tria went there to reassure but intial comments from Moscovici and Dombrovskis are not positive,” said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Banca Ifigest in Milan.    Euro zone banks .SX7E also felt the strain, down another 1.2 percent and the worst-performing sector. Among gainers, Fresenius (FREG.DE) shares topped the STOXX with an 8.3 percent gain after a Delaware judge ruled the German healthcare group could walk away from its $4.75 billion deal for U.S. drugmaker Akorn Inc (AKRX.O) and rejected Akorn’s claim that the merger agreement had been breached. Germany’s Linde (LING.DE) jumped 6.2 percent after it received approval for its proposed $83 billion merger with Praxair PX.N from the Chinese antitrust authorities. French supermarket group Casino (CASP.PA) inched up 0.1 percent after it said it had agreed to sell some property assets for 565 million euros ($655 million) to reduce debt levels that have worried investors.

2019-02-08,"MADRID (Reuters) - Britain’s exit from the European Union will likely trigger a period of high uncertainty that may significantly impact Banco Santander’s business, the Spanish lender said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The document, which details Brexit’s potential impact on Santander’s UK operations including its operating results and its ability to hire and retain staff, was the most specific statement to date from the euro zone’s largest bank by market value. “There remains significant uncertainty as to the respective legal and regulatory environments in which we and our subsidiaries will operate when the UK is no longer a member of the EU,” the bank said in a filing on Friday to the SEC. “This uncertainty, and any actions taken as a result of this uncertainty, as well as new or amended rules, may have a significant impact on our operating results, financial condition and prospects,” it said as part of risk assessment. In Britain, Santander’s net profit fell 8.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, partly due to ongoing competitive pressure on income and costs related to regulation and digital projects. Banco Santander also said in its filing it was finalising the implementation of restructuring and strategic initiatives, such as the ring-fencing of retail banking activities in the UK, its third-largest market. The bank has already transferred 22.9 billion pounds ($29.9 billion) of assets and 20.7 billion pounds of liabilities to its Madrid-based parent group in a move to comply with new rules that come into force next year. Banks operating in Britain must separate deposit-taking operations from riskier investment banking activities before January 2019. Personal and small business banking services will have to be provided by a ‘ring-fenced bank’. Britain’s looming exit from the EU and political uncertainty in Brazil are expected to test the management skills of Santander’s new chief executive Andrea Orcel. So far this year, Santander has lost around 20 percent of its value as lenders face pressure from low interest rates, especially in Spain, its second-biggest market, while trying to shift from traditional commercial banking towards more digital-oriented lending to compete with fintech startups.

2019-02-08,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States and Canada forged a last-gasp deal on Sunday to salvage a three-country, $1.2 trillion open-trade zone agreement with Mexico that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century. Here are some of the details in the agreement, which will change its name from NAFTA to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA): Canada agreed to provide U.S. dairy farmers access to about 3.5 percent of its approximately $16 billion (£12.3 billion) annual domestic dairy market, Canadian sources said, adding that the Canadian government is prepared to offer compensation to dairy farmers hurt by the deal. Under the agreement Canada has agreed to eliminate its Class 6 and Class 7 milk categories and associated pricing schedules for skim milk, skim milk proteins and other components and ultrafiltered milk, within 6 months after the USMCA goes into force.  U.S. farmers said those schedules had effectively pushed them out of the Canadian dairy market.  The agreement will increase U.S. access to Canada’s dairy market beyond Trans-Pacific Partnership levels, a senior Trump administration official said. The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from U.S. anti-dumping tariffs.  No substantial changes appear to have been made to the chapter 19 trade dispute settlement mechanism, nor the state-to-state dispute settlement. However, the agreement limits investor-state dispute settlement to preferential treatment cases and certain sectors dominated by state firms, such as energy and telecoms and infrastructure. Keeping chapter 19 will not affect Washington’s enforcement of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy laws, said a U.S. official. A side-letter to the agreement showed that Trump preserved the ability to impose threatened 25 percent global tariffs on autos while largely exempting passenger vehicles, pickup trucks and auto parts from Canada and Mexico. If Trump imposes so-called “Section 232” autos tariffs on national security grounds, Mexico and Canada would each get a tariff-free passenger vehicle quota of 2.6 million passenger vehicles exported to the United States annually, well above their current export levels. Pickup trucks built in both countries will be exempted entirely. Additionally, Mexico will get an auto parts quota of $108 billion annually, while Canada will get a parts quota of $32.4 billion annually in the event of U.S. autos tariffs. The deal set a 5-year transition period after the agreement enters into force for the regional value content requirement for autos to increase to 75 percent, from a current 62.5 percent. It requires 40 percent of vehicles value to be made in high wage areas paying $16 an hour, requiring significant automotive production in the United States and Canada. The pact also requires that vehicle manufacturers source at least 70 percent of their steel and aluminium from within the three countries.  Reflecting the concerns of Mexico’s incoming government that the agreement would limit the country’s control over its oil resources, the deal states that Mexico has the direct, inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of all hydrocarbons in its subsoil. Despite the strongly worded language, the energy chapter does not prevent foreign oil companies from producing oil in Mexico under a liberalisation of the industry passed by the outgoing government.

2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said on Monday the United Kingdom had the fiscal capacity to cope with leaving the European Union without any agreement but believed the mood in Brussels was to reach a divorce deal. Britain’s exit from the European Union next March has increased uncertainty for employers, with talks about the future relationship between the world’s fifth largest economy and its largest trading partner becoming increasingly fraught. “I’m clear that we will have the fiscal capacity to support the British economy if we were unfortunately to find ourselves in a no-deal situation,” he told Sky News. However, Hammond said the doubts about the future had already hit the economy and the next few weeks would be crucial in securing an agreement with the EU. “The mood is undoubtedly that people want to do a deal with the UK. People want to minimise the disruption of the UK’s departure from the European Union, they want to continue having a relationship with us and smooth trading partnership in the future,” he told BBC TV. “Clearly there has been a hit to the economy through the uncertainty the Brexit process has caused. Many businesses are sitting on their hands frankly waiting to see what the outcome of this negotiation is before confirming their investment plans.” Reassuring businesses they remain at the heart of the centre-right Conservatives Party’s plan for the economy will be the focus of Hammond’s speech to his party’s conference on Monday. The business community has expressed frustration over the government’s lack of clarity during the Brexit process and what some see as a decision to put ideology before the economy.   “We back business, as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society, and as an essential expression of our values,” Hammond will say in his speech to the Conservative Party’s annual conference in Birmingham. The British Chambers of Commerce said it wanted the Conservatives to overcome their internal divisions and “to deliver real-world, practical answers to business’s ongoing questions around Brexit – and avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU.” Relations suffered earlier this year when then-foreign minister Boris Johnson was quoted dismissing business leaders’ concerns about Brexit, using foul language, in a meeting with EU diplomats. Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed May, has become a cheerleader for hardline Brexit supporters in the Conservative Party who have denounced her so-called “Chequers” proposals and has put forward his own plans for an alternative free trade deal. Hammond said Johnson’s idea was not on offer from the EU. “What Chequers does is offer an in-the-middle solution, down the centre, taking the best from both models, and proposing a way forward which delivers on the mandate of the British people in the referendum but also protects British jobs and British businesses,” he told Sky News. Last week, Britain’s opposition Labour Party sought to woo business bosses even as it unveiled a raft of radical economic policies, saying the Conservatives had given them the opportunity to pitch an alternative leftist strategy.  Despite Brexit dominating political discussions, polls suggest it lags behind the state-run National Health Service as Britons’ greatest concern and Hammond said people would have to pay more in tax to fund extra investment. “The prime minister was very clear and very honest with the public that if we want in the future a growing NHS to support our ageing population of course we’ll have to accept a little more tax to fund that service,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson, Britain’s former foreign secretary, on Sunday called on the government to use its international aid budget to focus on national priorities amid speculation about whether he will challenge Prime Minister Theresa May. Johnson, who left the government during the summer over his opposition to May’s Brexit plans and is the bookmakers’ favourite to replace her, has declined to say whether he would challenge her for the leadership. In his latest newspaper column, Johnson did not mention Brexit and instead said Britain’s aid budget should be shifted to projects “consistent with the political and commercial priorities of this country.” “Everywhere you go, you will find other countries that subtly or openly use their development aid budgets as leverage to support their exports, or other popular objectives,” Johnson said. “It was infuriating to travel to South East Asia, and see for instance how Japanese contractors were supported by development assistance, as they applied for contracts, in ways we deem to be illegal.” Britain has an aid budget at 0.7 percent of economic output and the target has previously come under fire from lawmakers who say it is a blunt tool that is too high and should be spent in Britain itself. “If we are going to spend so much on aid – and there is no doubt that it wins Britain friends and admirers around the world – then let’s get value for this country as well,” Johnson said.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four in 10 Americans believe sexual misconduct allegations against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, while three in 10 do not and the rest do not know, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that split largely along party lines. The poll, released on Sunday, follows an emotionally charged week in Washington, during which Kavanaugh’s once-certain confirmation was jeopardized after three women made allegations against him, including accusations of assault and exposing himself in public in the 1980s.  Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge nominated to the country’s top court by U.S. President Donald Trump, has denied those allegations. The FBI has opened an investigation after Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans. The poll found that 42 percent of adults said they believed the accusations, including about the same number of men and women. Thirty-one percent do not believe them and 27 percent said they “don’t know” what to believe.  The responses were divided largely along partisan lines - about two-thirds of Democrats said they believed the allegations and nearly two-thirds of Republicans said they did not.  One of the women accusing Kavanaugh of misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that when they were teenagers in 1982, Kavanaugh and a friend pushed her into a room and that he held her down and tried to take off her clothes.  Ford said she feared that she would be raped and accidentally killed.  Kavanaugh told the committee afterward that he considered the allegations part of a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” from Democrats who do not want him confirmed. He said he did not know any of the women who have accused him of wrongdoing and he produced calendars from the time that he said exonerated him. A recent YouGov poll found that the country was split over the testimony that Kavanaugh and Ford presented to the panel, with 41 percent saying that they believed Ford and 35 percent saying they believed Kavanaugh. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted after the allegations were publicized, also found that 41 percent of adults opposed Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. That was up about 5 percentage points from a similar poll conducted from Sept. 18-24.  When it came to the allegations of sexual misconduct, the poll found that Americans who are younger, more educated and single were more likely to believe the allegations than those who are older, less educated and married.  The poll was conducted online in English from Sept. 26-30 throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,478 American adults, including 983 who identify as Democrats and 818 who identify as Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to President Donald Trump, said on Sunday that she was the victim of sexual assault and that women who survive such experiences should be heard. “I feel very empathetic, frankly, for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape,” Conway told CNN while defending the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by one woman and sexual misconduct by two other women. “I’m a victim of sexual assault,” Conway said. Conway and White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The court nomination has been upended by the allegations, and President Donald Trump was forced to order the FBI to look into them after several moderate Republicans, whose votes could be crucial for Kavanaugh’s confirmation, called for a probe. One Kavanaugh accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, detailed her allegation in testimony before a Senate panel on Thursday that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were in high school in the 1980s. Appearing afterward before the committee, Kavanaugh repeated his categorical denial. The swirling allegations have led other sexual assault victims to come forward to tell their stories. Conway suggested on Sunday that the ire of many victims was improperly pointed at Republican supporters of Kavanaugh, as opposed to the perpetrators of the assaults. “It’s not a meeting of the #MeToo movement,” she told CNN. “It’s raw partisan politics.” For the past 12 months, women and men have shared stories of sexual harassment and abuse under the social media hashtag ‘#MeToo.’ In that time, the careers of a number of prominent men in entertainment, politics and finance have been toppled in the face of accusations of sexual misconduct.

The agreement, which gives the Vatican a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, was signed last Saturday, but details have not been made public. Three sources aware of the substance of the provisional deal say the plight of a dozen or so detained priests and bishops, some elderly, remains unresolved and will be subject to on-going Vatican efforts. Beijing has provided little clear information about their fate despite repeated Vatican requests in recent years, the sources said. A senior Vatican source said the precise number still believed to be in detention was not clear.  Some of those held are feared to have died in detention, according to Catholic priests and activists who monitor the situation on the mainland. Neither China’s Foreign Ministry, which has been leading the talks with the Vatican, nor the Ministry of Public Security immediately responded to requests for comment. A Vatican spokesman said he had no immediate comment. The Justice and Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese issued a statement in June protesting the renewed detention of Bishop Cui Tai from Hebei province in April, urging the release of all “unreasonably and illegally detained clergy”. They also highlighted the detention of Baoding Bishop James Su Zhimin. Now 86, Su has been held since his arrest in October, 1997 but no details of his whereabouts or condition are known. “The reality is this deal is a small step, a very small step...there is much hard work ahead on unresolved issues,” said one cleric familiar with the pact. Hong Kong priests say a total figure of clerics under detention or house arrest in China is hard to pin down given official opacity. Beyond long-term detentions, some are held briefly by local authorities. China’s approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground church loyal to the pope and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. While some critics have slammed this month’s agreement as a betrayal that could finally crush the underground Church, Vatican officials said failure to strike the deal could have led to a fatal schism between Chinese Catholics. “There are many other points and concrete matters that pertain to the life of the Church that can now be put forward,” said Father Federico Lombardi, a former papal spokesman who followed the negotiations closely. “The fact that a positive result has been achieved leaves hope that others can follow, that there can be development,” he told Italy’s Catholic SIR news agency. Another issue still to be finalised, according to the same three Catholic sources, is the future roles and responsibilities of some of the seven bishops ordained by Beijing’s state-backed church without Vatican approval but legitimised by Pope Francis to clear the way for the deal. Two of the seven had faced earlier Vatican investigations into allegations they had wives or girlfriends, according to Catholic sources  - contravening the vow of celibacy taken by Catholic priests. They are expected to take up administrative or symbolic roles, keeping the title of bishop without carrying out full responsibilities, including the ordination of priests, the sources said. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the personal status of these two bishops. Under the deal, the government will no longer appoint bishops without the approval of the Vatican, which will be given candidates chosen by Catholic communities and Chinese authorities. But uncertainty is already mounting among some Chinese faithful over how their underground body will integrate with the government-linked Church. Father Bernardo Cervellera, editor of Rome-based Catholic news agency AsiaNews, said that underground bishops were still restricted. They can say Mass but not move around their dioceses as freely as they wanted. Missionary priests in contact with underground counterparts in recent days say the pressure on them has intensified in recent months. “I think of the endurance of the Catholics who suffered. It is true that they will suffer. There is always suffering in an accord, but they have great faith,” Pope Francis said on Tuesday. He has repeatedly defended the deal, which he said would give him, and not Beijing, the final say. The Bishop of Hong Kong - for decades a vital Catholic beachhead on the edge of officially atheist China - on Saturday expressed his reservations over the pact, saying time and more details were needed before it could be fully judged, or even called an agreement. Quoted in this weekend’s edition of the Sunday Examiner, the city’s Catholic newspaper, Bishop Michael Yeung referenced lyrics from the 1970s Swedish pop group ABBA: “The winner takes it all, the loser’s standing small.” “Catholics in China are neither radicals nor revolutionaries, instead they are really poor people,” he was quoted as saying. “It is unfortunate that the Communist government targets the Catholic Church more than any other religious group in China.” Bishop Yeung, who told the paper he was not yet aware of the content of the accord, did not respond to Reuters’ questions. A Hong Kong-based Vatican envoy was also quoted in the Examiner saying that the deal was of “great importance”, but more negotiations were needed to ensure more freedom and autonomy for the Church. “I hope the agreement may also bring more trust between the two parties and will inspire other solutions for the benefit of our Catholic Church in China,” said Monsignor Ante Jozic, one of only two semi-official Vatican representatives in greater China under Communist Party control. Jozic confirmed his remarks to Reuters, but said he could not comment further. Hong Kong is one of the most important Catholic cities in Asia, home to an extensive network of aid agencies, missions, scholars and media that have supported Catholics in China and elsewhere. While the Vatican instituted similar accords with Communist authorities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War, the situation in China differs because Beijing created a rival brand of Catholicism through the Patriotic Association.

2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that her plan for leaving the European Union addresses the concerns that manufacturers have raised about the future of the operations after Brexit. “The proposal we have put forward to the European Union for our future economic relationship with the EU for a free trade area, frictionless trade across borders, absolutely addresses the issues that manufacturers have been raising with us,” May told BBC TV, when asked about concerns raised by the boss of Jaguar Land Rover (TAMO.NS).

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent South Korean President Moon Jae-in a pair of white North Korean Pungsan dogs as a gift, the latest sign of a dramatic thaw in relations between the Korean rivals. Moon and Kim held their third meeting this year in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in mid-September, when Kim proposed the idea of the canine presents, the South Korean presidential Blue House said in a statement on Sunday. The dogs passed through the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) and the truce village of Panmunjom into South Korea on Thursday. Kim crossed at the same place to meet Moon for the first time in April this year.         The breed, named after a North Korean county, is known for its loyalty and skills for hunting, even tigers. It is designated as a North Korean “natural monument” animal. The two will live with South Korea’s First Dog, Tori, who became the first shelter dog to take up residence at the South Korean presidential compound. Moon, who is known to be an animal lover, adopted the black mixed breed Tori in July last year, two months after he took office. It is not the first time a North Korean leader has sent a pair of Pungsan dogs to a South Korean leader.  In 2000, late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, father of Kim Jong Un, sent two Pungsan dogs to then-South Korean president Kim Dae-jung when they held the first inter-Korean summit.

2019-02-08,"COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wrapped up an ill-tempered visit to Germany on Saturday with a visit to Cologne, where a security lockdown kept supporters and protesters away from a ceremony to open the country’s largest mosque. Police snipers were stationed on rooftops and the area was cordoned off after the city authorities cancelled plans for up to 25,000 people to be allowed to gather outside the mosque, built by an Islamic religious organisation that has close ties to the Turkish state. Germany had invited Erdogan for the three-day state visit in an attempt to mend ties hit by a crackdown on his opponents following a failed coup in 2016, hoping to secure the release of several of its citizens who remain in detention.  Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting Erdogan on Friday that “deep divisions” remain. On Saturday in Cologne, the Turkish leader sought to strike a conciliatory note. “In a critical period, we have made a fruitful, successful visit to Germany,” he told guests at the opening of the Central Mosque. “I stressed that we need to put aside our differences and focus on our common interests.” Yet he also called on Germany to crack down on Kurdish separatists, and complained that soccer star Mesut Ozil had been hounded out of the German national team after Germany’s World Cup exit because of his Turkish roots. “This racism has to end,” said Erdogan. At a banquet hosted by President Frank Walter Steinmeier on Friday night the Turkish leader, departing from his prepared remarks, accused Germany of harbouring terrorists, according to those present. “Hate speech against Germany,” ran the headline in Saturday’s edition of best-selling daily Bild. Senior Merkel allies said the visit had been premature, and ruled out providing any fresh economic aid to Turkey, which has suffered a slump in its currency following the imposition of trade sanctions by Washington. “The timing of this visit was wrong - it was far too early,” Norbert Roettgen, chairman of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told the Funke newspaper group. “The Turkish-German relationship is neither better nor simpler after this visit.” In Cologne, a major centre of the 3 million-strong Turkish community in Germany, a few hundred Erdogan supporters gathered behind security barriers waving flags and wearing scarves in Turkey’s red-and-white national colours. “It’s a great honour for us,” said supporter Ali Tas of Erdogan’s visit. Around 1,000 protesters - including emigres and German left-wing activists - gathered on the opposite bank of the River Rhine after being denied permission to march through the city centre. “I don’t like that the German government is in cahoots with a head of state who locks up people, imprisons journalists and (ethnically) cleanses his own country,” said a German man who gave his name as Goetz. Regional chief minister Armin Laschet did not attend the mosque opening, citing the importance of separating state and religion. Other local civic leaders complained that they were not invited to the event. Erdogan and Laschet met earlier at Cologne airport. They were to have held talks at a stately home, but the venue was switched after its owners objected.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close its consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra and relocate diplomatic personnel assigned there following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire. The decision adds to mounting tension between the United States and Iran, which is the target of increasing U.S. economic sanctions.  In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said the consulate closure was “unjustified and unnecessary”, and said Iran condemned any attack on diplomats or diplomatic locations, according to the ministry’s website. Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it regretted the decision and urged foreign diplomats not to pay attention to “what is being circulated to undermine the climate of security and stability accompanying Iraq’s relations with the countries of the world.” Iraq is committed to protecting diplomatic missions, spokesman Ahmed Mahgoub said in a statement on Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as he explained the move, renewed a warning that the United States would hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans and U.S. diplomatic facilities. It followed recent rocket attacks that Pompeo said were directed at the consulate in Basra. U.S. officials said the rockets, however, had not impacted the consulate, which is located on the Basra airport compound. “I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks,” Pompeo said in a statement. Pompeo did not explicitly say whether a U.S. response was imminent, however, and other U.S. officials did not disclose potential response options. Still, Pompeo said the threats against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq were “increasing and specific” and added that Washington was working with Iraqi forces and U.S. allies to address them. “We look to all international parties interested in peace and stability in Iraq and the region to reinforce our message to Iran regarding the unacceptability of their behavior,” he said. In a statement, the U.S. State Department said the consulate was placed on “ordered departure,” which technically involves a drawdown in staff. Although some personnel could remain on the diplomatic compound, the move is believed to effectively close the consulate, at least temporarily.  The decision came days after U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly, with Trump vowing more sanctions and accusing Iran’s leaders of sowing “chaos, death and destruction.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, speaking at a nearby event in New York on Tuesday, warned “there will indeed be hell to pay” if Iran crosses the United States, its allies or harms U.S. citizens. In May, Trump withdrew the United States from an international deal to put curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for easing sanctions.  France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of U.S. sanctions. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since April.  Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency’s fall, saying the measures amount to a “political, psychological and economic” war on Tehran, and accused the United States and Israel of involvement in a deadly attack at a military parade in southwestern Iran this month. Basra has already been rocked by violent protests seen by experts as a rejection of the Iraqi political establishment that has held on to power — with the support of the United States and Iran — despite failing to improve people’s lives there. Protesters in Basra ransacked and torched Iraqi government buildings this month and the Iranian consulate was set alight  by demonstrators shouting condemnation of what many see as Iran’s sway over Iraq’s affairs. For the first time in several years, mortar shells also landed this month inside Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses parliament, government buildings and many foreign embassies.

2019-02-08,"Barcelona (Reuters) - Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on secession. A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police pelted them with eggs and hurled powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that would usually be thronged with tourists. Scuffles also broke out later in the day with police using their batons to contain the fighting. Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting “No forgetting, no forgiveness” faced off with unionist protesters shouting, “Long live Spain”. Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local press reported. Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans. Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote.  According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote going ahead at polling stations across the region in violent clashes. Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police. The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route. Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.  “Last year we lived through one of our best moments. I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck,” he said. Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.  “It’s getting more and more tense,” he said. On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year. “Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.

Asked in an interview by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether he would rule out challenging May, he replied: “My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I have set out today and I believe in it very, very sincerely and I’m going to keep going for as long as it takes.” Former foreign minister Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed May, said earlier on Friday that her Brexit plans would leave the United Kingdom half in and half out of the club it joined in 1973 and in effective “enforced vassalage”.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gina Miller, who took the British government to court over triggering Brexit, said if Britain leaves the European Union next year all sides must accept the result and the campaign to remain in the bloc should be abandoned. More than two years since the 2016 EU referendum, the United Kingdom, its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit while Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a divorce deal with the EU. Opponents of Brexit are exploring ways to stop what they say is Britain’s biggest mistake since World War Two. Miller is leading a campaign to have another referendum, but she said if the government manages to successfully navigate an exit deal then politicians must be allowed to focus on domestic issues without the distractions of a debate about Britain’s relationship with Europe. “Whatever happens at the end of the Brexit process we have got to draw a line under it,” Miller told Reuters on Friday in an interview in Mayfair in central London.  “Everyone is obsessed. Our bandwidth is completely taken up with Brexit. Our money, our time ... We can’t carry on like this. We need to make the best of it.” The complexity of delivering Brexit has sapped the government’s time as officials focus on creating new systems for policing immigration and customs, settling the rights of citizens in each other’s countries, negotiating a potential exit bill and preparing to strike new trade deals. Miller, who co-founded an investment management company and campaigns for transparency in the industry, is one of the most outspoken campaigners on Brexit, best known for successfully taking the government to the Supreme Court to challenge its authority to leave the EU without a vote in parliament. She now wants a new referendum, this time offering voters the option of leaving on the terms of May’s deal or staying in a reformed EU, or for there to be another general election. Miller has been vilified in the pro-Brexit media and faced death threats, harassment and racial abuse for her views. Opinion polls show Britain remains deeply divided over Brexit, though some recent surveys have shown a swing towards support for staying in the EU. While pro-EU supporters have praised Miller, opponents have cast her as a wealthy member of an establishment which wants to soften or slow Brexit in defiance of the wishes of the people. A British aristocrat was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison last year for racial threats against Miller, and she said that a few weeks ago she was sent a package with crystals in and that if she had opened it, it would have burned her hands. Campaigners on both sides of the argument have been stepping up their efforts in recent weeks as some Brexiteers argue for a cleaner break from the EU and Remainers say ending membership as currently planned would do economic damage to Britain.  Miller says it is “very likely” Britain will need to hold a second referendum on EU membership or a general election to break the deadlock over Brexit. Some eurosceptic rebels in May’s party and opposition parties have publicly said they will oppose the prime minister’s plans to leave the EU. If the opposition parties and just over a dozen rebels in May’s party vote against a deal, she would fall short of the majority needed to get her deal through parliament. This would plunge British politics into crisis and increase the likelihood that Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement or face the possibility of another general election or a second referendum.  “There’s no way out other than to give it back to the people,” Miller said. “It is only morally and democratically right to give people a say.” Miller said, though, if the government does eventually pass a deal then she is not interested in leading a campaign for Britain to re-enter the EU in the future.  She would instead like to campaign on other constitutional issues like devolving policy and government spending away from London to the rest of the United Kingdom. “At what point do you need to say that the country needs to get on with being a country? You can’t have a nation living in stress,” Miller said. “Whatever happens there has to be an amnesty.”  Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-miller/brexit-challenger-gina-miller-uks-battle-over-eu-membership-must-end-idUKKCN1M817I,2019-02-08,,Brexit challenger Gina Miller: UK's battle over EU membership must end
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Londoners fed up with Brexit can vent their rage with a special gym routine that includes high-intensity exercises like pummelling punchbags bearing photographs of some of the main players like Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker. The 30-minute circuit also features the “Theresa May Sack Race,” “Jacob Rees-Logg lifts” and “Politico Headslammer” in which participants slam balls on to pictures of British Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn.  There is also a “Cameron Quitters’ Corner” named after May’s predecessor David Cameron to take time out. The Brexfit classes are being offered by fitness company Gymbox, whose boss Marc Diaper said the theme was chosen by a members’ poll of their main frustrations with living in the British capital.  Fifty two percent of respondents said Brexit, followed by rent prices and train delays. “We thought well, what better way to actually release frustration and anger than actually put on a Brexfit class as we’ve called it, where you can actually punch your most hated politician in the face on a punch bag,” he told Reuters. The course was designed with the help of an anger management expert, said fitness instructor Boriss Visokoborskis. “It’s for our members to relieve the stress caused by Brexit, and all the frustration they see in the mass media and internet and so on,” he added. “They are leaving our classes feeling relieved, lighter and they do something good for themselves, they work on their body.” Student Ania Jarzabkiewicz, 26, originally from Poland, said she felt “amazing” after the class. “I have a problem to get my student loan because of Brexit, so today I really take out my frustration on this whole situation and I feel really good,” she said. Fitness coach George, 25, said his favourite exercises were the sack races and punch bags. In this particular class, leading Brexiteer and former Foreign Secretary Johnson bore the brunt of his frustration. “It’d be wrong to punch him in the face in real life so ... doing it on a punch bag there’s nothing wrong with that, and it’s definitely a great way to get your frustration out,” he said. With six months until Britain leaves the EU, May has yet to reach a deal on the terms of the divorce, and her plan for future trade ties has been rebuffed by both the EU and many in her own Conservative Party. Corbyn said this week that Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on May’s proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the EU is hanging by a thread.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Telecoms and financial services companies face an investigation by Britain’s competition regulator after consumer body Citizens Advice complained that customers who do not switch providers were being “ripped off” . Such customers were being overcharged 4.1 billion pounds a year, the charity said on Friday and asked the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to tackle this. “The practice of overcharging loyal customers is widespread and Citizens Advice has repeatedly warned that loyal consumers are being ripped off,” its Chief Executive Gillian Guy said. Citizens Advice submitted a so-called super complaint, which the government defines as raising “any feature, or combination of features” of a market for goods or services which “appears to be significantly harming the interests of consumers”. The CMA said it would consider the concerns raised and what should be done about them. This will include engagement with relevant regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Ofcom. It will publish a response within 90 days. The competition regulator said possible outcomes include recommendations to change legislation, action by sectoral regulators and competition or consumer enforcement action. Citizens Advice said its research had found that eight in ten people were paying a significantly higher price, in at least one of the markets, for remaining with their existing supplier. “As a result of this super-complaint, the CMA should come up with concrete measures to end this systematic scam,” Guy said. The FCA said it has been concerned for some time about the issue of long-standing customers being charged more for some products than new ones. The financial watchdog said it would launch a market study into how general insurance firms charge their customers for home and motor insurance. “Citizens Advice have raised a number of important issues and we will work closely with the CMA as they investigate this super-complaint,” FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said. The FCA said it was already looking at the savings and mortgages market. UK Finance, which represents banks, said the industry has already made changes to improve competition in mortgages and savings markets, including helping longstanding borrowers switch to a better deal. The super-complaint is the fourth the charity has made since being given the power in 2002. It said its complaint on payment protection insurance (PPI) in 2005 has helped customers receive 32.2 billion pounds in refunds and compensation so far.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - European shares slid on Friday after the Italian government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels. Shares in Italian banks .FTIT8300, whose big sovereign bond portfolios makes them sensitive to political risk, bore the brunt of selling pressure, sinking 7.3 percent as government bonds sold off and the focus turned to rating agencies. Along with the main Italian stock index .FTMIB, the banks had their worst day since the June 2016 Brexit vote triggered a selloff across markets. The pan-European STOXX 600  index slid 0.8 percent with the leading euro zone stocks index .STOXX50E down 1.3 percent.  As the quarter drew to a close, the pan-European index managed a modest gain - its second quarter in the black. But the fact the three months resulted in just a 1 percent rise reflects the turmoil the region has gone through in that time. Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB index fell 3.7 percent, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI fell 1.4 percent. “The deficit number is higher than expected and that clearly is not a good sign. All the attention will now shift to ratings agencies which were waiting for the budget to reconsider their scorings,” said Gilles Guibout, portfolio manager at AXA IM in Paris. “Meanwhile, it’s difficult to imagine that Italian stocks will perform well,” he added. Italy’s government on Thursday targeted the budget deficit at 2.4 percent of gross domestic product for the next three years, defying Brussels and marking a victory for party chiefs over economy minister Giovanni Tria, an unaffiliated technocrat. Financials weighed heavily on the STOXX 600, dragged down by losses among Italian banks. The euro zone banks index .SX7E fell 3.9 percent, its worst day in four months.  Analysts at Credit Suisse led by Carlo Tommaselli said Italy’s deficit target at 2.4 percent of GDP was not the worst-case scenario for markets but still posed some issues. “The key point is that the higher than expected deficit is addressed to finance new expenses rather than growth,” they wrote in a note, adding that action from rating agencies was now critical for the country’s banks. “A potential downgrade of the country rating could pose risks to the sovereign investment grade and additional potential charges to CET1 ratios which nevertheless would be mitigated by the internal models which most of the Italian banks adopt,” they added. Shares in Italy’s two largest banks, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI), fell 8.4 and 6.7 percent, while smaller lenders such as Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) and UBI (UBI.MI) were also under heavy selling pressure.  Postal group Poste Italiane (PST.MI), which holds 130 billion euros of Italian government bonds, fell 4.3 percent. The EU adopted a non-confrontational stance toward Italy after the budget plan was released. Elsewhere, BASF (BASFn.DE) fell 2.3 percent after the  chemicals group agreed to combine its oil and gas businesses Wintershall with DEA to create an independent European oil and gas company. BASF also said demand was slower than initially expected in the third quarter. RSA Insurance (RSA.L) reported a small rise in net written premiums for the year so far, but said higher weather losses in Britain led to a disappointing third quarter. Its shares fell 9.3 percent. Losses on the broader European market were limited by gains among some defensive healthcare and consumer stocks.  Swedish aerospace company Saab (SAABb.ST) rallied 8.2 percent boosted by news its partner Boeing had won a $9.2 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A flotilla of small boats rescued all 47 passengers and crew from an Air Niugini flight that crashed into the sea short of the runway at an airport in the tiny South Pacific nation of Micronesia on Friday, the airport’s manager said. “It was supposed to land but instead of landing it was 150 yards short and she went down,” Jimmy Emilio, general manager of Chuuk Airport at Weno in Micronesia, told Reuters by telephone. “We don’t really know what happened ... people were rescued by boats - 36 passengers and 11 crew were all rescued, only the plane is sinking right now,” he said. The Boeing 737-800 (BA.N) aircraft hit the lagoon surrounding the small island about 9.30 a.m. local time (2330 GMT Thursday), Emilio said. The passengers and crew were taken to hospital, where eight remained, four in a serious condition with bone fractures and other injuries, according to a hospital spokesman.     “I thought we landed hard until I looked over and saw a hole in the side of the plane and water was coming in,” passenger Bill Jaynes said in a video posted by the Pacific Daily News website. “I thought, well, this is not like the way it’s supposed to happen,” he said. Water was waist-deep in the cabin before rescuers arrived, he said. Video published online by Radio New Zealand and pictures posted on Twitter showed the half-submerged aircraft surrounded by small speedboats. Air Niugini said in a statement that “the weather was very poor with heavy rain and reduced visibility at the time of the incident”. A spokesman for Papua New Guinea’s Accident Investigation Commission said investigators would fly to the scene as soon as possible to piece together what happened. In 2013, all 101 passengers aboard a Lion Air flight that overshot the runway at Denpasar in Indonesia and landed in shallow water were similarly rescued by boats without casualties.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Nationalism and a winner-take-all attitude are undermining the cohesion of Europe, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump rejected globalism and touted “America First” in a United Nations speech. Without naming Trump or his nationalist, protectionist approach, Merkel told fellow conservatives at an event of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin that the European Union and Germany were facing a watershed moment. Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), potentially undermining one of the foundations of the modern global economy, which Washington was instrumental in creating. The tycoon-turned-president has also questioned the value of the NATO alliance, the centrepiece of transatlantic security cooperation for almost seven decades. “Perhaps the most threatening development for me is that multilateralism has come under such pressure,” Merkel said. “Europe is facing attacks from the outside and from the inside.” Merkel, who grew up in old Communist East Germany, called the end of the Cold War illusory, saying she never would have expected the world would face a similar ideological clash between different schools of thought again. “I did not expect to have conflicts of different systems again, as we have today with China, but also in dealing with data and certainly also with the United States of America,” Merkel said. The changing political landscape and shifting international order, she said, make it necessary again to emphasize supposedly self-evident achievements such as tolerance and the art of striving for political compromises. “It’s a time of decisions where supposedly obvious things call for a standpoint,” said Merkel, adding that win-win outcomes could hardly be achieved if some were approaching the resolution of disputes with a winner-take-all attitude. “Where compromises are scorned, democracy is in danger,” Merkel said, against a backdrop of rising tensions within both her governing coalition and European Union member states. It was the “supreme discipline of democracy”, she said, to find a balance between different interests. Pointing to the increased use of social media platforms by some politicians, Merkel warned of producing “spirals of outrage”. The exchange of differing views was vital for democracy, as was the need to avoid simplification. Her warning followed a report by Germany’s leading economic institutes who said on Thursday that any escalation of trade friction involving the United States could cause a major recession in Germany and Europe. Trump’s speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday was a thunderous recitation of his “America First” policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defence.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Paul McCartney has written a children’s book called “Hey Grandude!”, a name the 76-year-old former member of The Beatles says came from one of his grandchildren. “I’ve got eight grandchildren and they’re all beautiful and one day one of them said to me ‘Hey Grandude!’. I said ‘What?’ and I thought, I kind of like that,” McCartney said in a video he posted on Twitter on Thursday. “From then on, I was kind of known as Grandude.” The picture book tells the story of a grandfather with four grandchildren and is illustrated by Toronto-based artist Kathryn Durst. “He calls them ‘Chillers’. They love him and they go on adventures with him and he’s kind of magical,” McCartney said. McCartney is currently on his “Freshen Up” world tour featuring songs from his latest album, “Egypt Station”.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The leader of Britain’s main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said he had told the EU’s Brexit chief Michel Barnier in talks on Thursday that Britain’s withdrawal must not disrupt trade across the Ireland-Northern Ireland border. Corbyn, who has previously met Barnier and once brought him an Arsenal football shirt as a gift, stressed that he was not negotiating with him on his visit to Brussels but laying out  Labour’s views on the dangers of a no-deal Brexit. “He (Barnier) was interested to know what our views are,” Corbyn told reporters. Barnier has offered no opinion on the merits of Labour’s Brexit proposals - which envisage Britain staying in a customs union with the EU after Brexit - as opposed to those of Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May. Corbyn said on Wednesday Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on May’s own proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the EU is hanging by a thread. May has said the EU needs to show Britain respect and come up with their own alternatives to her so-called “Chequers” proposals, which EU leaders rejected at a summit in Austria last week. She has said Labour’s meetings with EU officials are undermining her efforts to negotiate a Brexit deal.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain’s biggest retailer, is stepping up efforts to encourage shoppers to recycle plastic bottles, trialing in-store recycling machines which pay customers for every bottle returned.     The British government has said it wants to work with industry to clamp down on the huge waste that litters the land and sea every year. According to government data Britain recycled only 57 percent of the bottles that were sold in 2016, well behind the rates achieved in, for example, Denmark where a deposit return scheme has boosted rates to 90 percent. Tesco said on Thursday the trial of “reverse vending machines” will take place at stores in Borehamwood, north of London, Manchester, Birmingham, Swansea and Edinburgh. The first machine opened in Borehamwood with customers paid 10 pence for each bottle returned. Tesco’s trial follows the launch of similar initiatives by Morrisons (MRW.L), Britain’s No. 4 grocer, the Co-operative, the No. 6 and Iceland, the No. 9. Tesco, which has a UK grocery market share of 27.4 percent, cited polling data by YouGov which found that nearly 75 percent of Britons would be likely to return plastic bottles and aluminium cans under a reverse vending scheme. Tesco said that from Oct. 3 customers would also be able to reuse their own plastic containers when they buy meat, cheese or fish from deli and fish counters in British stores. The group, which has committed to making all its packaging fully recyclable or compostable by 2025, also called on the government to introduce a consistent nationwide approach to recycling. Britain has managed to slash the use of plastic bags since 2015 by charging 5 pence for each bag.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition regulator has identified 463 local areas where Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) and takeover target Asda’s (WMT.N) stores overlap, threatening higher prices or a worse quality of service, it said on Thursday. Last week the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) referred Sainsbury’s proposed 7.3 billion pound purchase of rival Asda, the British supermarket arm of Walmart (WMT.N), for an in-depth, or “phase 2”, review, saying it could result in a substantial lessening in competition in places where both chains had shops. Both Sainsbury’s, Britain’s No. 2 supermarket chain, and Asda, the No. 3, had requested a fast-track to a phase 2 process. On Thursday, the CMA published the full text of its initial phase 1 decision, revealing the 463 figure, and sending shares in Sainsbury’s down as much as 2 percent. Sainsbury’s has 606 supermarkets, 815 convenience stores and 311 petrol filling stations. Asda has 584 grocery stores and 317 petrol filling stations. Encouraged by last year’s surprise decision by the CMA to unconditionally clear market leader Tesco’s (TSCO.L) near 4 billion pounds purchase of wholesaler Booker, Sainsbury’s and Asda have expressed confidence the regulator will not insist on mass store disposals but have not said how many would make the deal unattractive. A source with knowledge of Sainsbury’s and Asda’s thinking has told Reuters store disposals that run “into the hundreds” would likely kill their deal. Analysts noted that the CMA identified 369 areas of concern in its phase 1 review of the Tesco/Booker deal but did not insist on any disposals after phase 2. The watchdog had identified 92 areas of concern in its phase 1 probe of discount retailer Poundland’s takeover of 99p Stores but again did not ask for any disposals. “Whilst, at first glance, the number of local areas the CMA identified...seems high, the CMA’s decisional practice strongly suggests that the final number of local areas of concern in the phase 2 merger review will be significantly lower,” said Nelson Jung, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance and a former director of mergers at the CMA. Analysts at UBS have a base case scenario of a modest 28-54 store disposals to satisfy the regulator. However, that number rises to 132-161 stores if the CMA excludes discounters such as Aldi and Lidl as competitors in its analysis. The CMA did not include the impact of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its phase 1 competition assessments, but said this did not infer they would be excluded in the phase 2 review. Sainsbury’s and Asda have both said that discounters, online grocery and food delivery businesses, should all be included in the CMA’s probe. Spokeswomen for both Sainsbury’s and Asda said they welcomed the start of the phase 2 process. The CMA’s deadline for a decision on Sainsbury’s/Asda is March 5 next year.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU officials were waiting anxiously on Thursday for the eurosceptic Italian government’s decisions on its deficit targets for next year, which could challenge the bloc’s fiscal rules and further rattle markets. Fearing that public statements from Brussels could inflame the eurosceptic wave in Italy, they have largely preferred to maintain silence, but informally admit “concerns” for its economy and the risk of spillovers into other euro zone countries. “Let the markets talk” is the refrain repeated by officials, implying that Italy may be forced into fiscal discipline by higher yields on its sovereign bonds and crashing prices of its domestic bank shares rather than by EU recommendations. Market pressure resurfaced vigorously on Thursday as the Italian press reported divisions within the government on fiscal plans.      A spokesman for the European Commission on Thursday declined to comment on Rome’s budget plans until they are submitted to Brussels. The government is expected to agree its targets later in the day and submit a draft budget for next year by mid-October. Privately, EU officials say nobody expects Italy to stick to a pledge of a structural correction of public finances worth 0.6 percent of the country’s gross domestic product next year.  The issue is how broadly this target can be missed. Under highly complex EU rules, a member state may deviate from targets by a maximum of 0.5 percentage points over two years.  EU economics commissioners have repeatedly stated they expect Italy next year to “improve” its structural deficit, a measure that strips out the effects of the business cycle and one-off income and spending. This in turn would allow a reduction of the country’s huge debt, the second largest in the EU after bailed-out Greece as a proportion of GDP. They have not clarified publicly what headline deficit figure would correspond to a minimal structural improvement, but EU officials have informally said between 1.5 and 1.7 percent of GDP could allow a debt reduction.  A 1.8 percent headline deficit could also be consistent with a slight drop in Italy’s debt, which hovers dangerously around 130 percent of GDP, but only in exceptionally positive circumstances. The Commission said it had reached an “understanding” on fiscal targets with Italy’s Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, but many in his government are pushing for a deficit above 2 percent, to meet election promises on tax cuts, a lower retirement age and a basic income for the poor.    That could cross Brussels’ red lines. EU reaction depends on how far Italy tries to bend the rules. The Commission could reject its draft budget after receiving it in mid-October, but this is a “nuclear option” that has never been used against euro zone states who have broken fiscal rules in the past. More likely, the Commission would wait until spring to decide whether to open a sanctions procedure against Rome, when final figures for the 2018 deficit will be available.  That is very close to European Parliament elections in May, and political considerations might weigh heavily on its decisions then.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying Beijing did not want his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade. “China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November. Against my administration,”  Trump told a U.N. Security Council meeting whose ostensible subject was nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Chairing the Council for the first time, Trump made no reference to suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and provided no evidence for his allegation about China, which Beijing immediately rejected during the same meeting. “We did not and will not interfere in any country’s domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China,” the Chinese government’s top diplomat Wang Yi told the Council. The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by Trump’s accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidise state-owned companies. Later on Wednesday, Trump referred to a Chinese government-run media company’s four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade. The practice of foreign governments buying space in U.S. newspapers to promote trade is common and differs from a clandestine operation run by a national intelligence agency. “China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news,” Trump said in a Twitter post. In a Des Moines Register article about the advertising supplement, Carol Hunter, executive editor of the newspaper, said the placement was not surprising. “It’s not surprising that China Daily sought to place advertising with the Des Moines Register, because the Register is Iowa’s largest news organisation and Iowa farmers are disproportionately affected by China’s tariffs,” Hunter said. A senior Trump administration official said China uses political, economic, commercial, military and information tools to influence U.S. public opinion and promote the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to make a speech next week detailing the allegations, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying the U.S. government was working to declassify further information on the matter. During an evening news conference, Trump described Chinese President Xi Jinping as a friend, prompting a reporter to ask how that could be the case given the allegations of meddling. “Maybe he’s not any more, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump replied.  Trump also used the Security Council session to defend the U.S. withdrawal in May from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, hint at progress in U.S. efforts to curb North Korea’s nuclear programme, and to criticise Iran and Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country’s war, now in its eighth year. “The Syrian regime’s butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran,” Trump said. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in a Twitter post, saying the United States had “abused” the Council and is “further isolated.” Trump’s allegation of Chinese election meddling came as a surprise during a formal meeting around the Security Council’s horseshoe table that was expected to concentrate on the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. “They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. We don’t want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election,” said Trump, who is attending the U.N.’s annual gathering of world leaders. Trump himself is not up for re-election until 2020 but November’s voting will decide whether his Republican Party can keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Some opinion polls show that the Democratic Party could make a strong showing, notably in the House. In the latest salvo in the trade dispute, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (152 billion pounds)  worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products kicked in on Monday, unnerving global financial markets. During his roughly 10-minute speech, Trump made no reference to U.S. allegations against Russia concerning the election that brought him to power. Speaking later to reporters, Trump said: “They (China) are trying to meddle in our elections. And we’re not going to let that happen, just as we’re not going to let that happen with Russia.” Trump’s presidency has been dogged by the Russian issue, which led to an investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, which Trump rejects. Moscow denies interfering.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and left intact its plans to steadily tighten monetary policy, as it forecast that the U.S. economy would enjoy at least three more years of growth. In a statement that marked the end of the era of “accommodative” monetary policy, Fed policymakers lifted the benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 2.00 percent to 2.25 percent.  The U.S. central bank still foresees another rate hike in December, three more next year, and one increase in 2020. That would put the benchmark overnight lending rate at 3.4 percent, roughly half a percentage point above the Fed’s estimated “neutral” rate of interest, at which rates neither stimulate nor restrict the economy. That tight policy stance is projected to stay level through 2021, the timeframe of the Fed’s latest economic projections. “The thing that folks were watching for, which they went ahead and did, was remove the word ‘accommodative’ in regard to their monetary policy,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “It does seem to potentially indicate they believe monetary policy is becoming less accommodative and getting more towards that neutral rate.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the removal of the wording, which had been a staple of the central bank’s guidance for financial markets and households for much of the past decade, did not signal a policy outlook change. “Instead, it is a sign that policy is proceeding in line with our expectations,” Powell, who took over as head of the Fed earlier this year, said in a press conference after the release of the statement. The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened and the U.S. dollar .DXY briefly weakened against a basket of currencies. U.S.  stocks initially extended gains but fell later in the trading session, with bank and financial stocks getting hit hard.  The Fed sees the economy growing at a faster-than-expected 3.1 percent this year and continuing to expand moderately for at least three more years, amid sustained low unemployment and stable inflation near its 2 percent target.  “The labor market has continued to strengthen ... economic activity has been rising at a strong rate,” it said in its statement. The Fed inserted no substitute language for the dropped  ‘accommodative’ wording in its statement. That wording had become less and less accurate since the central bank began increasing rates in late 2015 from a near-zero level, and its removal means the Fed now considers rates near neutral. Wednesday’s rate increase once again drew criticism from President Donald Trump, who has complained that the Fed’s actions are countering his efforts to boost the economy. “We’re doing great as a country. Unfortunately they just raised interest rates because we are doing so well. I’m not happy about that,” Trump told a press conference on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. “I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.”  Powell, at his press conference, declined to say whether Fed policymakers had discussed Trump’s previous criticism of the central bank. Last month, Trump expressed his displeasure about rising rates and said the Fed should do more to boost the economy. Powell, who was appointed by Trump and took over as Fed chairman earlier this year, said the central bank would remain independent. “We don’t consider political factors or things like that,” the Fed chief said. Wednesday’s rate hike was the third this year and the seventh in the last eight quarters. Ahead of Wednesday’s statement, traders put the chance of a rate increase at 95 percent, according to CME Group.    The Fed’s latest projections show the economy continuing at a steady pace through 2019, with gross domestic product growth seen at 2.5 percent next year before slowing to 2.0 percent in 2020 and to 1.8 percent in 2021, as the impact of recent tax cuts and government spending fade.  Inflation was forecast to hover near 2 percent over the next three years, while the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 3.5 percent next year and remain there through 2020 before rising slightly in 2021. The jobless rate is currently 3.9 percent. With risks described as roughly balanced, the statement left the Fed on a steady course for the next year. Risks to the current run of economic growth, such as the threat of a damaging round of global tariff increases, were largely set aside.     There were no dissents in the Fed’s policy statement.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A beluga whale spotted in London’s River Thames surfaced again on Wednesday near the British capital, hundreds of miles from its normal Arctic habitat. The white cetacean, which feeds on fish, squid and crabs, was first spotted on Tuesday and surfaced near Gravesend, Kent on the southern side of the estuary, television footage showed. “We are surprised and a little saddened that it has resurfaced again - we had hoped it had gone out to deeper waters and gone out to where it should be,” said Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at the ORCA charity. The last sighting of Beluga whales in UK waters was in 2015 when they were spotted off northeastern England near the Northumberland coastline, but they left shortly afterwards. Belugas, which can grow up to 5.5 metres (18 feet) long, spend most of their time off the coasts of Alaska, Canada and Russia, though they often travel great distances in search of food. Babey said it was unclear why this one had lost its way and come into the Thames, though it would be unlikely to have lost its way due to storms or because it was following prey. “The most likely scenario, which we are not going to know until we can investigate this animal more, is that there is an impairment to its navigation system,” Babey said.  “If that navigation system is impaired or there is a lot of disturbance to its environment, whether from natural causes or man-made noise, the animal will not be able to navigate correctly and can go off course.”  The whale spotted in the Thames was clearly a mature beluga whale, and possibly a female or a younger whale due to its size, Babey said.   “It is a beluga - I can confirm that,” she added. In 2006, a northern bottle-nosed whale died after stranding itself in the Thames.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May was reminded of how worried businesses are about Brexit on Wednesday when a rallying speech to executives in New York was met with a single stark question from the floor - just how bad can things get?  May assured her audience that Britain would flourish after Brexit and remain an attractive place to invest, seeking to ease concerns about the country’s future after it leaves the European Union next March. She said she was confident that Britain would be able to achieve a good deal with the EU over its future trading relationship. But in a question and answer session following her speech, Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of private equity firm Blackstone Group (BX.N), asked May to confront the downside risks to Britain’s EU exit. “I guess we are believers,” said Schwarzman whose firm was part of a joint venture that agreed to buy up the commercial property portfolio of Britain’s rail network owner for $1.9 billion. “But on the other side, things could really go off with a bad Brexit and ultimately a change of government. What we really worry about is how bad things can get?” In response, May said: “I absolutely appreciate and understand from that – you’re making decisions and looking ahead to what the future holds. And at the moment there is that uncertainty about what the future will hold in terms of Brexit.” She pledged Britain would make a success of Brexit whatever the outcome of negotiations.     Earlier, IBM boss Ginni Rometty asked May on stage how she suggested businesses should manage the risks of Brexit. “If you were us ... what would you do in our shoes to be planning right now. What would you do now to balance that risk?”  PRO-BUSINESS  May’s Brexit proposals were savaged by EU leaders at a summit last week and many in her own party have criticised her approach, raising prospects that she will fail to strike any agreement and that Britain could leave without a deal, something business leaders fear would be hugely damaging. “We’re at the point of the negotiations where we’ve got a few weeks to go,” May said. “We don’t know where the negotiations will end. I’m confident about getting a deal but we have to make sure we’re prepared for any eventuality.” In her speech, May said she would not abandon her current Brexit plan, shrugging off criticism at home and in Brussels. She said her proposal to keep a close trading relationship with the EU on goods, protect manufacturing jobs and resolve arguments over the borders of Northern Ireland, while ending unrestricted immigration from the EU, was the only way forward. However, with many of her own lawmakers and the opposition Labour Party saying they will vote against such a deal in parliament, there are major doubts over the final outcome of negotiations and May’s long term future as leader. In her speech, May promised that businesses investing in Britain would get the lowest rate of corporation tax among the G20 group of leading economies, with access to service industries and a financial centre in London “that are the envy of the world”. She pledged to deliver an economy that is “knowledge-rich, highly innovative, highly skilled and high quality but with low tax and smart regulation” and said a new immigration system would allow businesses to attract the brightest and best.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - As few as 630 UK-based finance jobs have been shifted or created overseas so far ahead of Brexit, while the number of jobs that UK-based financial institutions said they expected to move in the event of a “hard” Brexit is 5,766, a Reuters survey shows. Nearly all of the financial companies that responded to Reuters third survey on Brexit-related staff moves said that while they continue to plan for the worst-case scenario, they are shifting as few jobs as possible, hoping for a last-minute political deal that protects access after Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019. Reuters approached 169 banks, asset managers, insurers, ratings agencies and exchanges with UK operations on their plans and received answers from 134, against 119 in March, when respondents predicted 5,275 jobs would move. The numbers of respondents are different because some companies who responded in March did not do so this time, while others were included in the survey for the first time. The first Reuters survey in September 2017, which collated answers from 123 firms, indicated 9,777 roles would be affected. The survey was conducted by email and telephone between Aug. 1 and Sept. 15. A total of 65 banks responded, along with 32 insurers and insurance brokers and 32 asset managers, two exchanges and three ratings agencies. Ninety-seven of the companies that responded said they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, although only 63 specified numbers. The rest said it would have no impact, that they were still deciding what to do or they declined to comment. Many participants declined to comment on several questions. Some participants also asked for the information to be part of an aggregate only, which is why Reuters has not published the complete data. The respondents included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters’ data. The insurers who responded to the survey included the largest listed insurers in Britain, along with large European Union and non-EU insurers operating in Britain, major insurance brokers and listed and unlisted insurers with an international focus, such as those operating in the Lloyd’s of London market. The asset managers who responded included many of the global managers who use the UK as a base in Europe, as well as most of the leading British firms. Survey participants were asked if Brexit would mean new jobs moved or created in the European Union by March 2019, how many had already been moved or created, and what other steps they were taking. They were also asked how many UK employees they currently have. The employee numbers totalled 482,267 and included 359,357 employed by banks, 91,797 by insurers and 29,841 by asset managers. The 32 banks who gave figures when asked the question about how many jobs would be affected by Brexit said they expected 5,213 jobs to be moved or created in the EU, although just 580 had been so far. Sixteen insurers answered the question by saying they expected 204 roles to be created elsewhere in the EU, in total, of which 30 had been so far. Fifteen asset managers who gave the information saw 349 jobs in total being created, of which 20 had already been moved or created. There are 317 banks registered in Britain, according to the Bank of England, although that includes the domestic-focused subsidiaries of many larger banks as well as many smaller lenders that earn the bulk of their revenue in Britain so won’t be affected so much by Brexit. There are 443 UK authorised insurers, according to the Bank of England, though many larger firms have more than one authorisation. Many UK insurers also have a purely domestic focus, insurance specialists say. While the asset managers contacted account for the lion’s share of the assets managed in Britain, there remains a long tail of smaller managers registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, a figure it currently puts at 1,840 firms.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Union has more pressing priorities than Britain’s future relationship with the bloc, starting with its own future, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.   EU leaders last week rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposals for post-Brexit trade, standing firm on their position that the plan would undermine their cherished single market. “The British made their choice, that’s fine. Excuse me to say so brutally, but there are more important things for us than the future of the United Kingdom. It’s the future of the European Union,” Le Maire told a small group of foreign journalists on Tuesday. “Any decision that gives European citizens the impression that you can leave the European Union and keep all the advantages would be suicidal,” he added. He said the priority was to strengthen the euro zone, notably by completing plans for a backstop for its bank resolution fund and creating a shared budget, so that it could cope with a new financial or economic crisis. Paris is reluctant to let Britain’s EU divorce talks drag on and President Emmanuel Macron said last week that he expected Britain to put forward new proposals next month. May has insisted she is sticking with her “Chequers” plan, despite fierce opposition from some in her party. She has complained that the EU had not given her detailed reasons for its rebuff. Macron’s cabinet is holding meetings every two weeks to ensure practical preparations are in place should Britain leave the EU without a post-Brexit agreement in place. Le Maire said far more was at stake for Britain as all estimates indicated Brexit would have only a limited impact on French economic growth.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s wife and several of his top allies on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump urged members of the United Nations to support a “restoration of democracy” in the once-booming OPEC nation. The measure sanctioned six officials in Maduro’s “inner circle,” including Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, and “blocked” a $20 million private jet identified as belonging to a front-man of a top official. The move adds pressure to a government already widely criticised for economic collapse and undermining democracy. But it does not materially change Washington’s efforts to pressure Socialist Party stalwarts who have shown no willingness to hand over power or negotiate a transition. “Today, socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty,” Trump said in remarks to the United Nations General Assembly. “We ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” he said. Separately, a group of Latin American nations will present a complaint in New York on Wednesday against the Maduro administration for alleged human rights abuses to be investigated by the International Criminal Court, officials said. Peru, Colombia, Paraguay, Chile and Argentina will be joined by Canada in submitting the initiative against Venezuela’s government, according to two officials familiar with the plans. Under Maduro, Venezuela has limited the powers of the opposition-run legislature, jailed opposition politicians and created a parallel congress with unlimited powers.  Inflation is running at 200,000 percent and basic foods and medicines, like rice and antibiotics, are increasingly difficult to obtain. That has fuelled an exodus of Venezuelans to nearby Latin American countries, where borders are now overwhelmed by Venezuelan migrants.  Maduro says he is the victim of an “economic war” led by U.S.-backed adversaries. He denies limiting political freedoms, insisting opposition leaders have plotted assassination attempts and sought to overthrow him through violent street protests. On Tuesday, he said Trump’s comments were an apology for America’s history of colonialism in the region and offered words of support for the sanctioned officials who joined him during an event broadcast over state television. “I’m surrounded by sanctioned (officials),” he said. “Thank you, Donald Trump, for surrounding me with dignity.” He nonetheless said he hoped to arrange a face-to-face meeting with Trump. The White House responded to a similar request last year by saying such a meeting would happen when the country returned to democracy.  The Trump administration has levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro’s government since 2017. Sanctions such as those published on Tuesday bar American citizens and companies from any dealings with the individuals in question, which blocks them from holding bank accounts or contracting services from U.S. firms. “More personal sanctions can maybe deprive top Venezuelan officials from some ill-gotten gains but this will hardly destabilise the regime,” said Raul Gallegos, associate director of consultancy Control Risks.  A broader set of financial sanctions created last year bar American investors from acquiring newly issued debt, effectively locking the country out of credit markets and further fuelling its cash-flow problems. A group of U.S. senators said on Tuesday they had introduced legislation seeking to address the crisis in Venezuela by, among other things, tightening sanctions and providing $40 million (£30.35 million) in humanitarian aid.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence separately said on Tuesday the United States would provide an additional $48 million to “partners in the region” to confront the “humanitarian crisis” caused by the growing migration of Venezuelans.  The U.N. migration and refugees organizations said in a joint statement in August that 2.3 million Venezuelans are currently living abroad and more than 1.6 million have left since 2015. Venezuela does not release migration figures. But Maduro said in September no more than 600,000 Venezuelans had migrated in the past two years, and that 90 percent of them want to return. Maduro has hung on to power in part because of continued support of members of the armed forces such as Padrino, 55, who was appointed defence minister in 2014.  The Treasury said Padrino helped ensure the military’s loyalty to Maduro. In the past, it has accused high-ranking officers of corruption and undermining human rights.  First lady Cilia Flores, a lawyer and former attorney general who also ran Venezuela’s legislature, frequently appears at public events with Maduro and is seen an important behind-the-scenes power broker. Treasury also said a Gulfstream 200 private jet located in Florida had been identified as belonging to a front man of Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello, who the United States accuses of being involved in drug trafficking. Reuters was unable to immediately obtain comment from Cabello, who denies the accusations.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European shares climbed on Tuesday as oil prices above $80 a barrel lifted energy stocks, while U.S. stocks slid on losses in chipmakers and rate-sensitive shares ahead of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike. U.S. consumer confidence also unexpectedly rose in September, lifting it to levels last seen in 2000, the Conference Board said, underscoring strength in the labor market and overall economy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.72 points, or 0.26 percent, to 26,492.33, the S&P 500 lost 4.38 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,914.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 8,003.29. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.54 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.02 percent. “A lot of the noise around trade and anything else around politics really hasn’t suppressed consumer confidence nearly to the degree that the other factors have boosted it,” said Mike Dowdall, investment strategist for BMO Global Asset Management, in Chicago. Brent crude futures shot to four-year highs of almost $82 a barrel, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.[O/R]     “The combination of tight supply, healthy demand, falling global inventories – down from already under-stored levels – and anemic spare capacity helps support an oil price which could end the year above $90,” Richard Robinson, manager of Ashburton’s Global Energy Fund, said.    U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.28 per barrel, up 20 cents or 0.28 percent. Brent  settled at $81.87, up 67 cents or 0.83 percent. The rise in energy shares, however, failed to squash broader market pessimism after new tariffs imposed by Beijing and Washington on each other’s goods kicked in on Monday, and Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen accused the United States of putting “a knife to China’s neck.” There are other big worries for investors too, not least the timing and pace of central bank policy tightening. While the Fed is poised to hike rates for a third time in 2018 this week, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Monday raised expectations the euro zone will also start to normalize policy over the coming year by referring to “relatively vigorous” underlying inflation and brisk wage growth. That pushed German 10-year bond yields to four-month highs above 0.5 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields held at a new four-month high above 3.10 percent after a $38 billion government debt sale on Tuesday.  Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 3.1039 percent, from 3.078 percent late on Monday. The U.S. dollar weakened ahead of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, as investors have already priced in two more interest rate increases this year and some in 2019, leaving little room for further currency gains. The dollar index fell 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.1765. Since mid-August, the dollar has declined 3.1 percent against that basket of currencies. “The U.S. dollar appears vulnerable... given extended speculative bullish positioning against most of the G10 currencies and considerable tightening already reflected in fed funds futures,” said Eric Theoret, currency strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The drifting dollar helped gold edge higher. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,201.01 an ounce.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pyotr Verzilov, an anti-Kremlin activist being treated in a Berlin hospital for suspected poisoning, has been given a police guard for his own protection, a close friend who visited him in hospital said on Tuesday. Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news portal with close ties to punk protest group Pussy Riot, fell ill suddenly two weeks ago, losing his sight, hearing and the ability to walk.  German doctors have not found any traces of poison in his body though they say there is no other explanation for his condition.  Verzilov, in a tweet from hospital on Tuesday, said he had been stricken by “wonderful poisons ... something new and surprising.” Hunter Heaney, a close friend who visited Verzilov in Berlin’s Charite hospital, said he noticed he was being followed by two unknown people near his home and close to the hospital. He was worried about his safety and called the German police. The police responded by putting Verzilov, his family members and Heaney under police guard for their protection. “We are very definitely under police protection all the time,” he told Reuters by phone from Berlin.  A spokesman for Berlin police said they were in contact with Verzilov and his entourage and the situation was constantly being assessed. “We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on possible measures in detail,” the spokesman said. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a Pussy Riot member who was previously in a relationship with Verzilov and has a child from their relationship, visited him in Berlin and returned to Moscow only on Sunday. She told Reuters in Moscow that his condition had improved and he could be discharged from hospital in a few days. She said, though, that he was still suffering from bouts of delirium and his pupils had dilated. Nika Nikulshina, with whom Verzilov is currently in a relationship, told Reuters: “Forecasts are good although Petya (Verzilov) is not yet stable.” Earlier, a Berlin doctor said Verzilov was likely poisoned as there was no other explanation so far as to why Verzilov was in such a condition. However, no official evidence of poisoning has been found in his body, according to Tolokonnikova. Verzilov was one of four Pussy Riot activists who ran onto the pitch during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July to protest police brutality. When he fell ill, he was treated in a Russian hospital for four days before being flown to Berlin for further care. Tolokonnikova said Russian doctors concluded he was not poisoned, and diagnosed him with psychological problems. She said that, despite that diagnosis, the doctors had pumped his stomach and carried out liver dialysis. In a Twitter post on Tuesday, Verzilov said “I’ve been relatively conscious now only for the past three days, and before that it was like being in a black hole.” He added: “I am spending my days in the friendly company of wonderful poisons. But not polonium 210 or Novichok, but something new and surprising.” Polonium is the radioactive isotope that poisoned former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. He later died, and British police alleged he was the victim of a Russian  state-sponsored plot, an allegation denied by Moscow. British officials identified Novichok, a Soviet-developed nerve agent, as the substance which last year poisoned former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. They survived. Russian has denied any involvement.

2019-02-08,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The new owners of the largest independent news outlet in Hungary say they will not meddle in its editorial policies. Reporters at Index.hu are far from sure, and recent history shows why. Dozens of newspapers, radio and television stations critical of Prime Minister Viktor Orban have changed hands in the past four years. Some subsequently closed down, while others quickly and dramatically changed their tune. On the day news channel Hir TV was taken over last month, one of its new owners, Zsolt Nyerges, told the newsroom he would not interfere with its work. That evening’s programmes, including a hard-hitting political talk show, were cancelled. In its place, a recent Orban speech played on a loop. Last week, the European Union’s parliament voted to punish Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, corruption and civil rights, including media freedom, although the actual punishment, suspending its voting rights, is unlikely. An EU parliamentary report said media had been concentrated in the hands of pro-Orban oligarchs, state-funded advertising went largely to outlets loyal to the government and other journalists were often banned from parliament. Hungary’s government has denied undermining press freedom and says it has no desire to control the media. It is taking the EU Parliament to court, accusing it of breaching voting rules. Asked about Index’s independence, one of its new ultimate owners, Gabor Ziegler, said on Wednesday it was guaranteed. “We have no right to interfere with daily editing or the paper’s contents,” he said in an interview with napi.hu, one of a number of smaller sites clustered around Index that Ziegler and his partner also acquired.  “We need an independent, widely read and decidedly high-quality Index.hu to achieve our business goals.” Index.hu’s editorial line has not changed since the takeover on Monday, but staff are on the alert. A new dial on its home page has a needle pointing towards “independent”: next to it is “in danger” and further along, “not independent”. “When it changes we’ll talk. As loudly as possible”, the strapline says. A statement signed by dozens of staff likened the situation to a war. Chief editor Attila Toth-Szenesi told Reuters his fellow journalists were tense. “We would like to work peacefully,” he said. “It is not good for anyone for us to be the news.” Ziegler and media investor Jozsef Oltyan gained ultimate control over Index by buying media group cemp-X Online Zrt, which sells its advertising space, as well as the company owning the foundation set up to guarantee Index’s editorial freedom. Oltyan is a member of a party in coalition with Orban’s ruling Fidesz, while Ziegler has been a staff member on Index’s business side for nearly two decades. Editor Toth-Szenesi said he was concerned that the ownership change could bring Index.hu under the influence of Fidesz and its ideological agenda called the “National System of Cooperation” (NER). NER was launched in 2010 to counter liberal values and champion nationalist policies, and under its auspices some of Orban’s friends and family have won an increasing share of publicly funded business. “What seems to be the doomsday scenario may be reality,” Toth-Szenesi said. “It may in fact be the NER approaching Index right now.”  Ziegler denied that. “I would like to reject that in the strongest possible terms,” he wrote in an emailed response to Reuters. “We decided freely to buy (the companies that own Index and sister publications); there is nobody behind us.” He added that nobody had the option to buy the companies in the future, and they wanted to hold on to them for the long term. Oltyan did not respond to requests for comment. Since Orban was reelected for a third straight term in a landslide election in April, the pace of news outlets changing hands has accelerated.  Political loyalty has paid off for dozens of titles that have toed the government line. Those that back Orban get more state advertising spending, media researchers say. About 10 percent of state online ad spending goes to Index, for example, while its closest rival, pro-government Origo, gets about 80 percent, a proportion that shot up after its takeover by a pro-government group in 2015, media analysis group Mertek said. Asked about state ad revenue, Ziegler told Napi.hu: “If the change of ownership means we have an easier time, we will take advantage of opportunities more easily.” Revenue from state ads at TV2, Hungary’s second largest commercial channel, more than tripled in 2016 after Orban ally Andy Vajna took it over, research company Kantar media said, while state income stayed flat at levels far below TV2’s at market leader RTL. “Many commercial advertisers publish ads in pro-government media that is watched or read by hardly anyone,” media analyst Attila Batorfy said. “We can call that lobbying money.” “Things like reach or visitor numbers make no difference, replaced by an adjustment to government. This is harmful on every level.” As the media landscape narrows, more Hungarians have turned to Index. Average daily visitor numbers so far this month are up 20 percent from the same period in 2017, to 630,000, according to figures from web-monitoring service DKT. Orban is scathing about the website, which carries investigations into alleged government corruption and editorials criticising his anti-immigration, anti-European Union rhetoric alongside straightforward news. At a public event in May, Orban met a question from one of its reporters with: “I won’t answer to fake news factories”. Hir TV continues to follow the government’s cue. “The EU wants to strip Hungary of the right to defend our borders,” said the main story on its website after the European Parliament’s censure vote. For Gabor Varga, an investigative journalist at the station who quit on the spot last month, it was déjà vu. He had previously worked at Nepszabadsag, the country’s top daily, until another Orban ally bought the newspaper then shut it in 2016. Varga is looking for another job in journalism but with more than a dozen newsrooms recently disbanded, his options are limited. “Lots of my fellow journalists have become political activists of sorts, and I will not follow them,” he said. “I believe in objective, balanced journalism. That doesn’t work in Hungary.” Four prominent media outlets were caught up in a public feud between Orban and his former ally Lajos Simicska, a media mogul whose portfolio included Hir TV and the conservative magazine Heti Valasz, which had given an outlet to conservative voices sometimes at odds with Orban’s anti-immigration views. After Simicska broke with Orban in a public spat in 2015, private advertisers followed a state ad moratorium and withdrew from Heti Valasz. A one-billion forint ($3.6 million) profit in 2014 became a 900-million forint loss in 2017. In July, Simicska sold the ailing magazine to Nyerges at the same time as Hir TV.  Despite interest from investors in buying Heti Valasz, Nyerges shut it down within weeks. Last October, David Kostelancik, then the top U.S. diplomat in Hungary, said the country’s independent journalists “face pressure and intimidation” from the government, noting that the government directed substantial advertising contracts to friendly media outlets. The Hungarian Foreign Ministry summoned Kostelancik to the ministry and said the comments were “uninvited interference in Hungarian internal politics.” The next month, Washington announced a programme “to increase citizens’ access to objective information” by awarding a grant of up to $700,000 to a provincial news organisation. Ferenc Nimmerfroh, fired from editing a local daily in Pecs, southern Hungary, soon after premier Orban’s close friend bought it in early 2017, was hopeful his application to launch a website with a string of regional newsrooms would win. As Hungary’s relations with the United States warmed after the election of President Donald Trump, Nimmerfroh said he began to fear the programme was doomed. In July the U.S. State Department dropped it before the grant was awarded. The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Budapest did not reply to emailed questions about the reversal. Ambassador David Cornstein told the New York Times in August that the U.S. had reconsidered its overall view of the subject. Editing by Andrew R.C.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England can reverse its huge bond-buying stimulus programme without sharply pushing up long-term interest rates and hurting the economy, as long it explains the plan properly and moves only gradually, a top BoE policymaker said on Tuesday. Gertjan Vlieghe said the careful messages sent out by the U.S. Federal Reserve about the reversal of its quantitative easing (QE) programme had avoided sending the wrong signals about how fast it will wean the U.S economy off its crisis-era stimulus. The BoE said in June it might start to unwind the 435 billion pounds of government bonds it has amassed since the financial crisis once its benchmark interest rate reaches 1.5 percent, double its current level. “Understanding the main channels through which QE works is going to be very important when it comes to unwinding QE,” Vlieghe, one of the central bank’s nine monetary policymakers, said in a speech at Imperial College in London on Tuesday. His speech challenged the BoE’s view that QE works mostly through “portfolio rebalancing,” or the idea that a central bank’s government bond purchases force investors to buy other assets like corporate bonds, helping the economy. Vliehge argued that QE shaped expectations of future policy steps which “implies that unwinding QE need not have a material impact on the shape of the yield curve, or indeed on the economy, if properly communicated and done gradually”. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said Vlieghe had presented a new case for the view among policymakers that QE had a more powerful impact on pushing rates down when a central bank buys bonds than on pushing rates up when the purchases are unwound. Vlieghe said economists should look back into history for where rates might be heading. He said the yield curve - the difference between the return on short and long-term debt - had been flat in the period before World War One, when the gold standard was still in force. Since the BoE was granted independence in 1997, Britain’s  inflation and inflation risk fundamentals had been more similar to the gold standard period than the 20th century average.  “So we should expect yield curves to be flat again on average,” he said. He repeated his view that one or two interest rates hikes a year would be needed for the BoE to meet its 2 percent inflation target.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian trade union warned on Tuesday that Ryanair is “playing with fire” in its handling of a planned cabin crew strike across five countries on Sept. 28, by not warning passengers about possible disruptions to flight schedules. The company is continuing to sell tickets for flights on Friday and is not responding to queries from customers about the status of their flights on that day, the Belgian cabin crew union CNE said in a statement. “This situation is totally irresponsible,” the union said. Ryanair did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cabin crew unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands are planning a 24-hour strike on Sept. 28 over Ryanair’s labour agreements. They plan to strike once a month until their demands are met. Some pilots’ associations are also planning to join the strike. The Belgian cabin crew union predicted that the strike would be the biggest ever seen in Europe and cause the cancellation of about 80 percent of flights from Charleroi Airport and probably all of the airline’s flights from Brussels Airport. Earlier in September, Ryanair rejected claims by the unions that the strike would cause “travel chaos” and said the airline would warn affected customers of a small number of flight cancellations. During a walkout by pilots and crew earlier this month, the airline was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 German flights. Customers on Twitter have asked the Irish airline about the status of their flights on Sept. 28. Ryanair has responded to some that it expects “the vast majority of cabin crew to work as normal on Sept. 28, as they have during previous strikes” and that “all fights are scheduled to operate.” Reporting by Daphne Psaledakis; Editing by Kirsten Donovan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ryanair-unions-belgium/ryanair-not-informing-passengers-about-strike-belgian-union-says-idUKKCN1M51QX,2019-02-08,,"Ryanair not informing passengers about strike, Belgian union says"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May and her ministers have agreed to focus Britain’s post-Brexit migration system on high-skilled migrants and will not offer preference to European Union workers, newspapers said. In a nod to the concerns of businesses, the plan backed by May’s cabinet on Monday would also allow some access for low-skilled foreign workers, the newspapers said. Last week, official advisers recommended prioritising high-skilled migrant workers coming to Britain after Brexit, alarming companies in low-paid sectors. They also said there should be no preferential treatment for workers from the EU. The Financial Times said that while ministers backed the advisers’ proposals, the idea of giving no preferential treatment to EU workers could change if Britain agrees a trade deal with the bloc. “That would mean a better deal on migration, but the same offer would be available if we struck trade deals with other countries around the world,” the newspaper quoted a source as saying. With little more than six months to go before Britain leaves the EU, London and Brussels remain at loggerheads on what their future relationship will look like, and May has insisted on new controls for migrant workers from the bloc. Spokesmen for May’s office and for Britain’s interior ministry declined to comment on the reports. Earlier, May’s office said the ministers had agreed that Britain would be able to “introduce a new system which works in the best interests of the United Kingdom – including by helping to boost productivity.” The government’s advisers said in their report that evidence suggested high-skilled migrants had a more positive impact on productivity than lower-skilled workers from abroad. After she was rebuffed by other EU leaders who told her last week that her Brexit plans would not work, May told her ministers that they must hold their nerve in the impasse, her office said after Monday’s cabinet meeting. May said her plan was the only viable one on the table and that she remained confident of securing a deal, it said in a statement. “At the same time, the government will continue to sensibly plan for no deal,” the statement quoted her as saying. May’s government published a latest batch of notices on Monday explaining to businesses and individuals what could happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The lack of an agreement could hamper airlines, stop the movement of goods to the world’s biggest trading bloc and cause headaches for pet owners who want to take their dogs on holiday, documents showed.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Leaving the European Union without a proper divorce deal could ground airlines, stop hauliers from lugging goods to the world’s biggest trading bloc and even make headaches for pet owners who want to take their dogs on holiday, according to government documents. With just six months to go until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29, Prime Minister Theresa May has warned that negotiations are at an impasse and that the EU must come up with new proposals on how to craft a divorce settlement. Many business chiefs and investors fear politics could scupper an agreement, thrusting the world’s fifth largest economy into a “no-deal” Brexit that they say would spook financial markets and silt up the arteries of trade. Britain, which has warned it could leave without a deal, published 25 technical notices on Monday covering everything from commercial road haulage and buying timber to airline regulations and taking pets abroad. “If the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no agreement in place, UK and EU licensed airlines would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission,” the government said. Overall, the government has published more than 65 such notices giving a glimpse of what a no-deal Brexit - the nightmare scenario for chief executives of most multinationals operating in Britain - would look like.  Amid warnings that trucks could stack up on both sides of the English Channel in the confusion of a no deal, Britain said it would seek to strike bilateral agreements with European countries to ensure hauliers would retain access. The notices covered a vast swathe of the British economy, warning, for example, that labels on packaged food would have to be changed. “Use of the term ‘EU’ in origin labelling would no longer be correct for food or ingredients from the UK,” the government said.  Honey producers would have to change their labels while EU countries might not accept British mineral water, the government said.  In the worse case scenario for pet owners, dogs, cats and even ferrets might need health certificates and rabies jabs. Travel plans would have to be discussed with a vet at least four months in advance before travelling to the EU. That would mean someone wanting to take their pet to the EU on March 30, 2019, the day after Britain leaves the bloc, would have to discuss the trip with a vet before the end of November. Without a deal, the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. Brexiteers accept there is likely to be some short-term economic pain but say the government is trying to scare voters about the impact of a no-deal Brexit.  Britain, many Brexiteers say, will thrive in the longer term if cut loose from what they see as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China hopes that Britain can stand by its position of not taking sides in the South China Sea and earnestly respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Chinese government’s top diplomat told Britain’s foreign minister. Beijing expressed anger after a British Royal Navy warship sailed close to islands claimed by China in the South China Sea late last month, saying Britain was engaged in “provocation” and that it had lodged a strong complaint. China also warned that ties were at risk after the naval operation.

China “hopes that Britain will truly implement its position of not taking sides in the South China Sea issue, earnestly respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and not do anything to disturb mutual trust between the two countries”, it cited Wang as saying. China and Britain, which have talked of a “golden era” of relations, agreed last month to look at the possibility of reaching a “top notch” post-Brexit free trade deal that promises an important political win for the conservative British government.

2019-02-08,"LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party will vote this week to keep a second Brexit referendum as an option if Theresa May fails to pass her plan to quit the European Union through parliament, heaping pressure on a struggling prime minister. But with the leadership intent on any such referendum not allowing a re-run of a 2016 vote to stay or leave the EU, the move could reignite tensions in the party, which, like much of Britain, is divided over how to quit the bloc. After May’s plans for Brexit - the biggest shift in British policy for more than four decades - were rebuffed by the EU on Thursday, the outcome of talks to leave are more uncertain than ever and have boosted those who want to stop the divorce. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been reluctant to support growing demands for a second referendum, or People’s Vote, but the party agreed a motion after five hours that went some way to appeasing members who want another chance to vote on Brexit. Labour agreed late on Sunday night the party would vote on Tuesday on a motion committing the party to support “all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote” if no election is triggered by May’s Brexit plans. For Corbyn’s backers, the motion does little to change his position that Labour prefers a new national election to a second vote, which will ask a different question from the one posed at the 2016 referendum in which the Leave campaign beat Remain by 52 percent to 48 percent.  Corbyn’s second in command, finance spokesman John McDonnell repeated that Labour was ready for an election, which he said was the “best solution”, and that any new vote would not be a repeat of the 2016 referendum to stay or leave the bloc. The Labour Party says the motion is not “prescriptive” on what the question of any second referendum should be, leaving options open to gauge the lie of the land if, or when, such a vote needs to take place. A source in the campaign for a People’s Vote cautiously welcomed the move, saying: “We feel it’s moved in the right direction.” “It’s always going to be babysteps rather than a giant leap but it’s an important shift.” In the opposing corner, Brendan Chilton of Labour Leave told Reuters: “There are 5 million Labour leavers in the country who will look upon this motion with dismay.” Britain is to exit the EU in March next year after months of talks that have again exposed the deep divisions in both the country’s main parties - the Conservatives are all but at war with each other and Labour is also at odds over how to leave.  The country’s path out of the bloc is even more unclear after weeks of positive noises about the prospects of clinching a divorce deal and one on a future trading relationship, the mood between Britain and the EU turned sour on Thursday. Brexit minister Dominic Raab again said he was confident of clinching a deal with the EU, calling the summit in Austria last week just one of several “blips in the world”. “They’re blown a little bit out of proportion, but we double down, we don’t throw our toys out the pram, hold our nerve, keep our cool,” Raab said. But the summit in Salzburg seemed to increase the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal, which could hurt the economy and sever trade flows, and spurred those who want another referendum to try to overturn the 2016 vote. May has ruled out a second referendum and EU officials say they would not want to see a re-run of the vote - prolonging uncertainty that has already forced companies to stop taking investment decisions. And with talk of a new election swirling, May’s Conservative Party was keen to target Corbyn over his move to back a second referendum. “Jeremy Corbyn this morning proved he is not fit to govern our country,” Brandon Lewis, the party’s chairman, said on Sunday. “He confirmed Labour would take us back to square one on Brexit.”  Writing by Elizabeth Piper, additional reporting by Michael Holden in London; Editing by Alison Williams",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-labour/labour-keeps-second-brexit-referendum-on-table-idUKKCN1M400U,2019-02-08,"Britain's opposition Labour Party will vote this week to keep a second Brexit referendum as an option if Theresa May fails to pass her plan to quit the European Union through parliament, heaping pressure on a struggling prime minister.",Labour keeps second Brexit referendum on table

2019-02-08,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Pope Francis paid tribute on Sunday to Jews killed by the Nazis and victims of murder and deportation by the Soviet KGB, in twin visits to memorials marking the darkest periods of Lithuania’s history. On the 75th anniversary of the wartime liquidation of the Vilnius ghetto, Francis stopped to pray at a simple stone monument commemorating the 200,000 Lithuanian Jews killed either in the country or in Nazi concentration camps in Europe. Minutes later, he paid an emotional visit to the nearby Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, a former KGB basement jail where Lithuanians who were considered enemies of the Soviet Union were either executed or tortured before being sent to labour camps in Siberia. A sombre-looking Francis prayed and lit a candle in a room whose walls were lined with pictures of Catholic priests and bishops either killed or tortured in the jail. He then entered the execution chamber where, according to the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre, more than 1,000 people were killed during the Soviet period. In at least one case, nearly 50 were killed in just one night. “Your cry, O Lord, is echoed in the cry of the innocent who, in union with you, cry out to heaven,” Francis said in a prayer to a crowd outside that included several survivors in their 90s. The jail, Francis said, evoked the “sorrow and bitterness, of abandonment and powerlessness, of cruelty and meaninglessness” that Lithuanians suffered “as a result of the unrestrained ambition that hardens and blinds the heart.” After Lithuania broke from the Soviet Union in 1991, the remains of nearly 800 people executed in the jail were found in a mass grave in Vilnius. “This was our nation’s Golgotha, a trial of our faith,”   Bishop Sigitas Tamkevicius, 79, who was imprisoned there in 1983 before spending six years in Soviet labour camps and who accompanied the pope to the jail, told Reuters before the visit. About 70,000 Lithuanians died at the hands of Soviets. On Sunday morning in Kaunas, Lithuania’s second-largest city, Francis said society should be vigilant for “any whiff” of resurgent anti-Semitism, calling for new generations to be taught the horrors of the Holocaust. “The Jewish people suffered insults and cruel punishments,” Francis told a crowd of about 100,000 at an open-air Mass. “Let us ... ask the Lord to give us the gift of discernment to detect in time any seed of that pernicious attitude, any whiff of it that can taint the heart of generations that did not experience those times,” he said. Reports of anti-Semitic acts have increased in Europe, coinciding with the rise of populist, right-wing parties in a number of countries.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast scored a big win in the scramble for media assets by beating Rupert Murdoch, and his backer Disney, in the battle for Sky with an eye-watering $40 billion bid. It was a “great day” for Comcast (CMCSA.O), Chairman and Chief Executive Brian L. Roberts said of Saturday’s auction victory. The U.S. group has had its sights set on Sky SKYB.L, Europe’s biggest pay-TV company, ever since Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) beat it to most of Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) assets in July. Some analysts, however, said that Comcast’s bid of 17.28 pounds per share in the rare blind auction was driven by an urgent need to build scale to defend against the threat posed by streaming services Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O). “The price being paid for Sky is shocking, but it is a clear sign that legacy media companies are desperate for scale in a world dominated by tech platform giants,” said Richard Greenfield, technology and media analyst at research firm BTIG. Explaining the basis of big media’s rush to merge, Greenfield likened it to the opening scene in the documentary “March of the Penguins”.  “The penguins huddle to survive winter. With Disney/Fox and Comcast/Sky, it’s penguins huddling. Winter is still coming,” he said, referring to the advance of tech players such as Amazon. Sky would reduce Comcast’s reliance on its mature U.S. market by opening the door to Europe, where pay-TV penetration is at about 30 percent and rising.  The deal would also transform Comcast into the world’s largest pay-TV operator with 52 million customers and lift the proportion of its non-U.S. revenue to about 20 percent from about 9 percent, based on 2017 full-year figures. Comcast is paying a high price - more than double Sky’s share price before Fox made its approach in December 2016. But analysts said that a favorable result in the English Premier League soccer rights auction - Sky’s biggest expense - during the takeover saga had made the business more valuable. Sky also gives Comcast an immediate beachhead in online video streaming with its Now TV business, which has about 2 million customers.  Analysts see Comcast super-charging Now TV to combat Netflix across the globe. And Sky’s exclusive relationships to distribute HBO entertainment content and Premier League soccer further insulate Comcast over the next few years.  Critics of the deal, however, argue that such relationships are sure to come under threat in the longer term, as content producers launch their own services and competition for sports broadcasting rights intensifies as deep-pocketed tech companies join the fray. On the upside, however, Sky’s product range - including  broadband connections that complement its satellite offer in state-of-the-art platforms such as Sky Q - and its brand make it more than a content aggregator, said Alice Enders, head of research at Enders Analysis,  “Sky has an extraordinarily well established brand; it is a destination, and that is very valuable in the world of fragmented media,” she said.

2019-02-08,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia and its biggest oil-producer ally outside the group, Russia, ruled out on Sunday any immediate, additional increase in crude output, effectively rebuffing U.S. President Donald Trump’s calls for action to cool the market. “I do not influence prices,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters as OPEC and non-OPEC energy ministers gathered in Algiers for a meeting that ended with no formal recommendation for any additional supply boost. Benchmark Brent oil LCOc1 reached $80 a barrel this month, prompting Trump to reiterate on Thursday his demand that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries lower prices. The price rally mainly stemmed from a decline in oil exports from OPEC member Iran due to fresh U.S. sanctions. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” Trump wrote on Twitter. Falih said Saudi Arabia had spare capacity to raise output but such a move was not required at the moment and might not be needed next year as, according to OPEC’s projections, a stellar rise in non-OPEC production could exceed global demand growth. “The markets are adequately supplied. I don’t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get it,” Falih said, adding that Saudi Arabia could raise output by up to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) if needed. “Given the numbers we saw today, that (an output increase in 2019) is highly unlikely unless we have surprises on the supply and demand,” Falih added. The statement from Trump, meanwhile, was not his first criticism of OPEC.  Higher gasoline prices for U.S. consumers could create a political headache for Republican Trump before mid-term congressional elections in November. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, has accused Trump of orchestrating the oil price rally by imposing sanctions on Tehran and accused its regional arch-rival Saudi Arabia of bowing to U.S. pressure. On Sunday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said Trump’s tweet “was the biggest insult to Washington’s allies in the Middle East”. A mid-term report released by OPEC on Sunday forecast that non-OPEC supply from countries led by the United States would rise by 2.4 million bpd in 2019 while global oil demand should grow by just 1.5 million. It also steeply raised U.S. oil output growth estimates to 2023, predicting OPEC would lose further market share. “Our attention is shifting to 2019. We have been briefed on the prospect of 2019 inventory builds which result from significant supply growth from non-member counties,” Falih said. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said no immediate output increase was necessary, although he believed a trade war between China and the United States as well as U.S. sanctions on Iran were creating new challenges for oil markets. “Oil demand will be declining in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. So far, we have decided to stick to our June agreements,” Novak said. Seeking to reverse a downturn in oil prices that began in 2014, OPEC, Russia and other allies decided in late 2016 to reduce supply by some 1.8 million bpd.  In June this year, however, after months of cutting by more than their pact had called for, largely due to involuntary reductions from Venezuela and other producers, they agreed to boost output by returning to 100 percent compliance. That equates to an increase of about 1 million bpd, but the latest data shows they are some way from achieving that target. In August, OPEC and its allies cut production by 600,000 bpd more than their pact required, mainly as a result of falling output in Iran as customers in Europe and Asia reduced purchases ahead of the U.S. sanctions deadline. OPEC put Iran’s current production at 3.58 million bpd, down some 300,000 bpd from the start of the year, according to OPEC’s secondary sources such as researchers and ship-trackers. Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili insisted on Sunday that Iranian production was steady at 3.8 million bpd but appeared to soften his stance on potential increases in OPEC output. “If there is a fall not only from Iran, but anybody else, it is the responsibility of OPEC and non-OPEC to balance the market,” Kazempour told reporters. Falih said returning to 100 percent compliance was the main objective and should be achieved in the next two to three months. Although he refrained from specifying how that could be done, Saudi Arabia is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity. “The biggest issue is not with the producing countries, it’s with the refiners, it’s with the demand.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s main opposition Labour Party would require large companies to reserve at least one third of the seats on their boards for workers, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday. Labour said in a statement that the current corporate governance structure which gives priority to shareholder interests over others was feeding a short-term corporate culture and holding back economic growth. “In workplaces across the country, working hours have got longer, productivity has nosedived, pay has fallen and insecurity has risen,” Corbyn said in a statement on the first day of Labour’s annual conference. “Businesses have been allowed to get away with such exploitative practices because the balance of power has shifted against workers. That has allowed a reckless corporate culture to fester which is damaging Britain’s economy.” Under the party’s plans if it won power, both public and private companies with more than 250 staff would be legally bound to have worker directors elected by the entire workforce. When she came to power after the 2016 Brexit vote, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to tackle what she called the “unacceptable face” of capitalism, including by putting workers on boards, but her initial proposals were watered down. “Labour will turn the tide and give workers more control and a real say at work. By ensuring businesses reserve a third of board seats for workers, we’ll help transform our broken economic model,” said Corbyn, who has shifted Labour towards the hard left since being elected party chief in 2015. On Saturday, Corbyn said his party would challenge May on any Brexit deal she can strike with Brussels, and called for a national election if the deal fell short. Labour would move to nationalise key industries as a priority if it took office, its finance spokesman John McDonnell, an orthodox socialist, said ahead of the conference.

2019-02-08,"LONDON, England (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would not flinch in an impasse with the European Union about its departure from the bloc, as French and German ministers suggested the next move in the negotiations should come from London. British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday demanded new proposals and respect from European Union leaders, saying after a summit in Austria that talks had hit an impasse and, in a prominent eurosceptic Sunday newspaper, she stuck to her guns. “This is the moment to do what is right for Britain,” May said in the Sunday Express. “Now is the time for cool heads. And it is a time to hold our nerve.” The Sunday Times reported that her aides had begun contingency planning for a November snap election to help save the Brexit talks and her job. May won plaudits in her party and from the press for standing up to the European Union, ahead of her Conservative party’s annual conference, which starts at the end of the month. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt had told BBC radio on Saturday that if EU leaders expected the UK to capitulate, then they had “profoundly misjudged the British people”, even if that meant leaving the bloc next March without a deal. “We may be polite, but we have a bottom line,” he said. “And so they need to engage with us now in seriousness.” Initial reactions from across the English Channel suggested France and Germany were digging in, too. EU leaders and May have said they want to get a deal agreed in October, to be finalised in November.  In Paris, Minister for European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau said that while France still believed a good Brexit deal was possible, it also must prepare for a “no deal” outcome. She said on France Info radio that Britain’s vote to leave “cannot lead to the EU going bust.” In Berlin, German Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Roth said on Twitter the other 27 EU states were striving to achieve reasonable solutions, and that “the blame game against the EU” was “more than unfair”. In London, the pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph reported May faced the prospect of ministerial resignations next week if she failed to come up with an alternative to the “Chequers” Brexit plan that she presented in Austria. The Sunday Telegraph said party donor Jeremy Hosking was mulling backing a new pro-Brexit party. But domestically, even some critics of May’s plan backed the prime minister in her standoff against the EU. “I have a serious difference of opinion with our prime minister. But, even so, I have to tell you that I view the behaviour of the European Union leaders in Salzburg with contempt,” David Davis, the former Brexit minister who resigned in protest at Chequers, said in a speech at a “Leave Means Leave” rally in the northern English town of Bolton. “Disrespect our prime minister and you disrespect our country.” After May’s Friday statement, European Council President Donald Tusk said the results of the EU’s analysis of that plan had been known to Britain for many weeks. But Hunt said there was a difference between rhetoric and substance. “On the substance of the Chequers proposals, we have not had a detailed response,” he said, adding that EU proposals for the Irish border would mean that it was impossible “to leave the EU intact as one country”. May has accepted the need for a “backstop” insurance policy on the Irish border but says the EU’s version of the proposal would see Northern Ireland carved off from the United Kingdom.  The EU says May’s proposal, keeping the province and mainland Britain in the same regulatory space, undermines the single market. Despite the differences, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told RTE radio an Irish backstop was “doable” by an October summit. Hunt said Britain wanted a deal but would be able to withstand a no-deal Brexit. “It would be bumpy, it would be difficult, but we would find a way to survive and prosper as a country,” he said. “We’ve had far bigger challenges in our history.” Should May get a deal, opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would not support it unless it protected jobs and living standards. The Independent reported that Corbyn would try and force a general election within days if lawmakers reject the Brexit deal. “We will challenge this government on whatever deal it brings back,” Corbyn told a rally in Liverpool, northern England, on the eve of Labour’s annual conference. “And if this government can’t deliver, then I simply say to Theresa May the best way to settle this is by having a general election.” Reporting by Alistair Smout; additiional reporting by Elizabeth Piper in Liverpool, Michel Rose in Paris, Michelle Martin in Berlin and Conor Humphries in Dublin; editing by John Stonestreet and Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/may-vows-to-hold-nerve-after-brexit-talks-hit-impasse-idUKKCN1M20E6,2019-02-08,,May vows to hold nerve after Brexit talks hit impasse

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court is before a Senate committee that is struggling to advance it after a woman alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school in 1982.  Trump, dropping his earlier restraint, on Friday in Twitter posts impugned California professor Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations, raising the stakes for Republicans. The full Senate must approve Kavanaugh and Republicans hold only a slim majority there. Most Democrats were expected to oppose the nominee. As of yet, there are no clear signs of Republican defections but here are key senators to monitor ahead of any action. ** Jeff Flake. A frequent Trump critic who will retire from the Senate in January, Flake was complimentary towards Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. However, on Wednesday, after the president’s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. made light of Ford’s allegations on Instagram, Flake replied in a tweet, “This is sickening. No one should make light of this situation,” USA Today reported. ** Susan Collins. A moderate who sometimes breaks from party ranks, Collins earlier this week said she wants both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify under oath to the committee. She told reporters that if Kavanaugh has lied about allegations of sexual misconduct, “that would be disqualifying.” It was still unclear on Friday whether Ford would testify. After Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, Collins said generally positive things about him. In 2017, she voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first nomination to the court. Collins told the Portland Press-Herald in Maine that she was “appalled” by Trump’s tweets on Friday saying that if the attack on Ford had been as bad as she said, it would have been reported. ** Lisa Murkowski. Another occasional party renegade, she has promised to be “rigorous” in her review of Kavanaugh. She has not said how she will vote. Collins also backed Gorsuch. ** Dean Heller. Heller is the only Republican senator up for re-election on Nov. 6 whose state was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 and he is seen as vulnerable in his race. Trump flew to Las Vegas in Heller’s home state of Nevada on Thursday to campaign for him. Heller said in a statement after meeting with Kavanaugh in July that had “no reservations in confidently supporting him.” ** Rand Paul. Another Republican maverick on some issues, Paul said in July he will support Kavanaugh. ** Bob Corker. He has clashed with Trump and is not running for re-election but he has described Kavanaugh as a “superb nominee” whom he plans to vote for. On Tuesday, he said in a tweet, “If we don’t hear from both sides on Monday, let’s vote.” ** Ben Sasse. Another senator who has clashed with Trump, Sasse has said he will vote for Kavanaugh. ** Heidi Heitkamp. Facing a re-election campaign in North Dakota, a heavily pro-Trump state, she was one of three Democrats who voted for Gorsuch. On Kavanaugh, she has called for further investigation of Ford’s allegations. ** Joe Manchin. Also up for re-election in the pro-Trump state of West Virginia, he says healthcare is his test of whether to support Kavanaugh, whose critics say will rule against Obamacare the first chance he gets on the Supreme Court. Manchin voted for Gorsuch. ** Joe Donnelly. Non-committal thus far on Kavanaugh, Donnelly, too, is up for re-election in the red-leaning state of Indiana. On Monday, he said the allegations against Kavanaugh “serious and merit further review.” ** Doug Jones. The first Democratic senator elected from Alabama in over 20 years, he must show he can be independent-minded to stay in office. The Kavanaugh vote could be a test.  ** Jon Tester. He opposed Gorsuch but has not come down firmly on Kavanaugh. ** Bill Nelson. He has not stated explicitly whether he would vote for Kavanaugh but he said in a July fundraising email that Democrats need to stop Republicans’ “plans to put another right-wing extremist on the Supreme Court.” Nelson opposed Gorsuch.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) apologised for outages that hit its online and mobile banking services on Friday, the latest in a string of such failings at British banks which have drawn criticism from customers and members of parliament. RBS later on Friday said it had fixed the problems, which followed similar outages on Thursday that hit Barclays (BARC.L), the Co-operative Bank (42TE.L) and fintech firm Cashplus. MPs on Britain’s Treasury Select Committee, in letters published on Friday, called on Barclays and RBS to explain what caused the problems and set out how they would compensate customers who suffered financial losses as a result. The outages come when Britain’s lenders have been driving customers towards such services as the banks cull branch networks to cut costs. Regulators and politicians are increasing scrutiny over banks’ cyber resilience. “High street banks justify the closure of their branch networks on the basis that they are providing a seamless online and mobile phone banking service. These justifications carry little weight if their banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon,” Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said. Morgan gave the banks until Friday Sept. 28 to respond to her questions about the outages. Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Ross McEwan told LBC Radio that the outage may be related to regular changes it had made to its technology, such a change to its firewall, but the cause was not clear yet.  “The team are working flat out…  We feel the pain for our customers every time this happens,” he said. The RBS outage on Friday also affected NatWest, RBS’s most highly rated brand among customers. The lender used Twitter to apologise to customers and said telephone banking and ATMs were working as normal.  Many customers took to social media to complain about the outage. “So how do you expect me to pay my bills today when I work 9-5,” Natalie Wilkinson said in a tweet to NatWest, asking other users to recommend a more reliable bank. The consequences for banks of online banking problems and the subsequent scrutiny of those failings by politicians can be severe. Earlier this year a major outage at mid-sized lender TSB, owned by Spain’s Sabadell (SABE.MC), left thousands of customers unable to access their money or make vital payments for long periods. TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester resigned this month, following heavy criticism by the Treasury Committee and the bank’s customers for his handling of the crisis. British banks do not have long to strengthen their contingency plans for when online banking services fail. The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in July set a deadline of Oct. 5 for British lenders to explain how they can avoid damaging IT breakdowns and respond to the growing threat of cyber attacks.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Since U.S. President Donald Trump made his debut at the United Nations a year ago pushing an “America First” policy, he has quit the Iran nuclear deal, the U.N. Human Rights Council and lashed out at some of the closest allies of the United States. Next week at the United Nations, Trump plans to stay on message, touting his drive to protect U.S. sovereignty before world leaders, some of them worried about America’s commitment to the multilateralism that has governed the United Nations since the end of World War Two.  “It is not saying multilateralism can’t work. But it’s saying sovereignty is a priority over all of that,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said, previewing Trump’s address on Tuesday at the annual U.N. General Assembly. “All of these things that we felt like were mandating things on the United States, those aren’t things we want to be involved in,” she said, citing the Paris climate agreement Trump pulled out of in 2017 and global talks on a migration pact that Washington quit before they started. In the past year, the United States has also left the U.N. cultural agency, cut funding for the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees and sparked a trade war with China. At a NATO summit in July, Trump threatened that the United States would “go its own way” if members did not spend more on defence. Trump is now surrounded by hawkish advisers more in tune with his world view, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, after the departure of their predecessors Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster, along with former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn. While some leaders and diplomats have voiced concern about the future of multilateralism since Trump took office in January last year, they rarely name and shame.  “I don’t like to personalize things,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters this week when asked if Trump was a threat to multilateralism. “In different areas and for different reasons, the trust of people in their political establishments, the trust of states among each other, the trust of many people in international organizations has been eroded,” he said. “Multilateralism has been under fire and so this is a concern.” Haley said Trump would “lay down a marker” on U.S. foreign aid.  “While the U.S. is generous, we’re going to be generous to those that share our values, generous to those that want to work with us and not those that try and stop the U.S. or say they hate America and are counterproductive,” she said. Trump has long been sceptical of the value of the United Nations, though Haley told Reuters that she has shown him the world body’s worth by pushing the Security Council several times to toughen sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration now has its sights on Iran, but a bid by Washington to use the United Nations to call out Tehran over accusations of meddling in the Middle East has failed. In May, Trump pulled Washington out of a 2015 international agreement to put controls on Tehran’s nuclear programme. Trump is set to chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction on Wednesday that will allow him to attack Iran and flaunt the latest developments in his attempt to get North Korea to denuclearize.  Trump touted his role in a post on Twitter on Friday, writing: “I will Chair the United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran next week!” A senior U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the approach of the Trump administration to several  foreign policy issues during the past year as “if you want things to change, you’ve got to cause trouble.” “Throw the pieces up in the air and see where they land. And the president is quite masterful at claiming victory, even if the pieces, when re-arranged look a lot like the pieces did before they were thrown up in the air,” the diplomat said.  One such issue, say diplomats, is North Korea. Last year, Trump drew gasps by threatening from the U.N. podium to “totally destroy” North Korea. Now he is talking to leader Kim Jong Un.  While there have been some gestures of goodwill by the reclusive Asian nation, including the release of U.S. prisoners and return of the remains of American Korean War dead, Pyongyang has not yet taken steps towards denuclearisation.  North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho is due to speak at the United Nations on Sept. 29. Haley said Ri and Pompeo had agreed to meet but it had not yet been confirmed if that would happen on the sidelines of the gathering. Trump is planning to meet privately with the leaders of South Korea, Egypt, France, Israel, Japan, and Britain. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has a close relationship with Trump, will stress the importance of “collective action” and multilateralism when he addresses the United Nations shortly after Trump on Tuesday.  “We don’t see it as two opposing dialogues,” a French presidential source said. “We will continue to encourage the U.S. to join this multilateralism even if it’s difficult on some subjects like trade, Iran or climate.” Reporting by Michelle Nichols; additional reporting by Steve Holland and Susan Heavey in Washington, and John Irish in Paris; Editing by Grant McCool and Alistair Bell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-un-trump/at-u-n-podium-trump-to-tout-protecting-u-s-sovereignty-idUKKCN1M114V,2019-02-08,,"At U.N. podium, Trump to tout protecting U.S. sovereignty"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s budget deficit unexpectedly widened in August, driven by subdued tax receipts, a rise in the state pension and higher EU budget payments, but Chancellor Philip Hammond probably still has room to ease his grip on spending later this year. The deficit last month stood at 6.753 billion pounds, almost double the median forecast in a Reuters poll and higher than a shortfall of 4.345 billion pounds in August 2017, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday.  While this marked the first year-on-year increase in net borrowing for the month of August in three years, the shortfall is unlikely to ring alarm bells for Hammond. The deficit for the first five months of the current 2018/19 financial year was down 30.5 percent from the same point a year ago at 17.8 billion pounds, helped by a cut in the estimated size of the shortfall in previous months of the year. Hammond reiterated his focus on cutting Britain’s high debt levels in order to allow him to spend more. “This is good progress but we need to keep up our efforts so we can invest in our public services and our future,” he said on Twitter. Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the slowdown in tax receipts in August might make Hammond a little nervous as he prepares his annual autumn budget statement. But he would probably be able to avoid raising taxes to pay for an increase in spending on the health service promised by Prime Minister Theresa May. “We expect the chancellor to ease off austerity measures in other areas too, ensuring that fiscal policy doesn’t dampen GDP growth next year” when Britain is due to leave the European Union, Tombs said. The deficit for August alone was exacerbated by a 0.6 billion pound increase in European Union budget contributions, compared with an unusually small outflow this time a year ago.  The ONS also pointed to a 3.0 percent annual increase in the state pension. Overall, tax receipts last month edged up by an annual 1.6 percent while spending rose 5.4 percent.  For the April-August period, however, receipts were up 4.0 percent while expenditure was up by only 1.9 percent. Britain’s economy has slowed as it heads for Brexit in March next year, but not by as much as feared at the time of the 2016 referendum decision to leave the bloc. Britain’s budget deficit stood at nearly 10 percent of GDP when Hammond’s predecessor, George Osborne, started a multi-year programme of public spending cuts in 2010.  It is expected to fall below 2 percent this year, leading to calls on Hammond from within his Conservative Party to allow more spending. Public support for increased levels of tax to fund more public spending has hit a 15-year high, the National Centre for Social Research survey showed earlier on Friday.

2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain’s anti-European Union UK Independence Party (UKIP)  launched a set of populist policies on Friday hoping to revive their dwindling political influence and capitalise on outrage over the government’s handling of Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to sell her plan for a Brexit that would continue to see Britain abide by many EU rules. Growing unrest among pro-Brexit groups could scupper her leadership and thrust Britain into political crisis.   UKIP played a defining role in recent British history as the force that pressured former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on leaving the EU, and then stoked the anti-establishment uprising behind the 2016 ‘leave’ vote.  But, since finding itself on the winning side of the Brexit vote UKIP has struggled to influence the exit process, seeing its voter support evaporate and undergoing two years of inner turmoil to find a leader to replace the talismanic Nigel Farage. On Friday, current leader Gerard Batten published a manifesto document that sought to rediscover the everyman appeal that once made the party a threat to larger rivals from across the British political spectrum.  “These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners,” Batten, a member of the European Parliament, said in a statement launching the 17-page manifesto.  “Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.” The policies included a “complete and total” withdrawal from the EU, arguing that Britain should end all payments to the EU and adherence to the bloc’s rules - a much more radical break than May is proposing. Batten has been criticised, including by some former UKIP members, for engaging with causes championed by far-right groups, and he has described Islam as a “death cult”.  Other policies, much of which are similar to previous UKIP positions, include selective and limited immigration, scrapping overseas aid, lower domestic taxes and a tougher approach to taxing multinational companies. UKIP currently has no elected representatives in parliament and it gathered only 600,000 votes in a 2017 general election, compared to 3.8 million in 2015 - a fall from more than 12 percent of the total vote to less than 2 percent.  Nevertheless, in many marginal seats it has the power to influence which major party can win and, with no party clearly ahead in opinion polls, has the potential to affect the outcome of any future national election. Although an election is not scheduled until 2022, May’s government remains fragile.

2019-02-08,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said on Thursday that it would no longer dispatch employees to the offices of political campaigns to offer support ahead of elections, as it did with U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2016 race.  The company and other major online ad sellers including Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) have long offered free dedicated assistance to strengthen relationships with top advertisers such as presidential campaigns.  Brad Parscale, who was Trump’s online ads chief in 2016, last year called onsite “embeds” from Facebook crucial to the candidate’s victory. Facebook has said that Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton was offered identical help, but she accepted a different level than Trump.  Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests to comment on whether they also would pull back support.  Facebook said it could offer assistance to more candidates globally by focusing on offering support through an online portal instead of in person. It said that political organizations still would be able to contact employees to receive basic training on using Facebook or for assistance on getting ads approved.  Bloomberg first reported the new approach. Facebook, Twitter, and Google served as “quasi-digital consultants” to U.S. election campaigns in 2016, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and University of Utah found in a paper published a year ago.  The companies helped campaigns navigate their services’ ad systems and “actively” shaped campaign communication by suggesting what types of messages to direct to whom, the researchers stated.  Facebook’s involvement with Trump’s campaign drew scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers after the company found its user data had separately been misused by political data firm Cambridge Analytica, which consulted for the Trump campaign.  In written testimony to U.S. lawmakers in June, Facebook said its employees had not spotted any misuse “in the course of their interactions with Cambridge Analytica” during the election.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea’s Kim Jong Un wants a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump soon to hasten denuclearisation, but a key goal is declaring an end this year to the 1950-53 Korean War, the South’s President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday. Moon said he and Kim spent most of a three-day summit discussing how to break an impasse and restart nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington, which are at odds over which should come first, denuclearisation or ending the war.  Kim, who recently proposed another summit with Trump after their unprecedented June talks in Singapore, said the North was willing to “permanently dismantle” key missile facilities in the presence of outside experts, and the Yongbyon main nuclear complex, if the United States took corresponding action. The joint statement from the summit stipulates his commitment to a “verifiable, irreversible dismantlement” of the nuclear programmes, and ending the war would be a first U.S. reciprocal step, Moon said.  “Chairman Kim expressed his wish that he wanted to complete denuclearisation quickly and focus on economic development,” Moon told a news conference in Seoul, shortly after returning from the summit with Kim in Pyongyang. “He hoped a second summit with Trump would take place in the near future, in order to move the denuclearisation process along quickly.” Moon said Kim was also open to inspection of a nuclear test site in the northwest town of Punggye-ri, which he called the North’s sole existing facility for underground detonations.  While Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests this year, it failed to keep its pledge to allow international inspections of its dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in May, stirring criticism that the move could be reversed. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday he had invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet in New York next week and other Pyongyang officials to Vienna for talks with nuclear envoy Stephen Biegun. Asked on Thursday if those meetings would take place, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said invitations had been sent and added: “We certainly stand ready to meet if they are able to.”   Nauert said Washington looked forward to a formal readout of the North-South talks in meetings with the South Koreans next week, which will include one between Trump and Moon on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Asked about Pompeo’s statement on Wednesday welcoming plans for the dismantlement of all facilities at Yongbyon in the presence of U.S. and IAEA inspectors, Nauert said Moon and Kim had talked about inspectors. “Having IAEA inspectors and United States inspectors be a part of anything is really just a shared understanding,” she said.  “Any time you have a nuclear situation like this where there is a dismantlement, the expectation is that the IAEA would be part of that, so that would be just the normal course of doing business. We have that shared understanding with the countries.” Asked why this detail was not in the document signed by Moon and Kim, Nauert replied: “We have had conversations ... with the government of North Korea and that is our mutual understanding; that is also the understanding between (South) Korea and North Korea. That was one of the things discussed, according to my understanding of it, over the past few days.” Nauert did not respond when asked if the United States was willing to take “corresponding measures,” except to say: “Nothing can happen in the absence of denuclearisation; denuclearisation has to come first.” The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, did not reply when asked by reporters on Thursday if his foreign minister would meet Pompeo on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly next week.   Kim pledged to work towards the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” during two meetings with Moon and his encounter with Trump, but follow-up negotiations on how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered. Washington calls for concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities, before satisfying Pyongyang’s key demands, including an official end to the war and the easing of international sanctions.  The war ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led United Nations forces, including South Korea, are technically still at war with the North.  But there have been concerns in South Korea and the United States that ending the war would ultimately prompt China and Russia, if not North Korea, to demand that the United Nations Command (UNC), which overlaps with U.S. forces in South Korea, be disbanded and leave. Seoul aims to jointly announce with the United States an end to the war within this year, a measure Moon said he would discuss with Trump when they meet next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  An end-of-war declaration would not affect the presence of U.S. troops and the UNC in the South, Moon said, adding that Kim shared his view.  “It would be a political declaration that would mark a starting point for peace negotiations,” Moon said. “A peace treaty would be sealed, as well as normalisation of North Korea-U.S. relations, after the North achieves complete denuclearisation.” Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Joyce Lee; additional repotring by David Brunnstrom in  Washington and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; editing by Soyoung Kim, Clarence Fernandez and Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-southkorea-summit-moon/north-koreas-kim-wants-another-trump-summit-to-speed-denuclearisation-south-koreas-moon-idUKKCN1M01GW,2019-02-08,,North Korea's Kim wants another Trump summit to speed denuclearisation - South Korea's Moon
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States said it was ready to resume talks with North Korea after Pyongyang pledged on Wednesday to dismantle its key missile facilities and suggested it would close its main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took unspecified actions. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had invited North Korea’s foreign minister to meet in New York next week, with the aim of completing its denuclearisation by January 2021, after a Pyongyang summit between the leaders of the two Koreas. The United States appeared eager to seize on commitments by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at his talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in even as critics said the steps did little to put Pyongyang on a course for irreversible denuclearisation. North Korea will allow experts from “concerned countries” to watch the closure of its missile engine testing site and launch pad at Tongchang-ri, Moon said at a joint news conference with Kim after their meeting in the North Korean capital. North Korea will also take additional steps such as closing its main Yongbyon nuclear complex if the United States undertook unspecified reciprocal measures, Moon added.  The sudden revival of diplomacy followed weeks of doubts in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration’s about whether North Korea was willing to negotiate in good faith after a June summit between Trump and Kim yielded few tangible results. The January 2021 completion date was the most specific deadline set in what is expected to be a long process of trying to get the North to end its nuclear programme, which may threaten  U.S. allies South Korea and Japan as well as the U.S. homeland. In addition to inviting North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho to meet when both are in New York next week for the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders, Pompeo said Washington invited Pyongyang’s representatives to meet the U.S. special representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, in Vienna at the “earliest opportunity.” China, North Korea’s most important economic backer and diplomatic ally, said it warmly welcomed the agreement reached in Pyongyang and strongly supported it. “We absolutely cannot let this hard to come by opportunity for peace slip away once again,” the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said in a statement. Some U.S. officials were deeply sceptical. Speaking before Pompeo’s announcement, two senior U.S. officials involved in U.S.-North Korea policy voiced fears Kim was trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul. At the summit, the two Koreas agreed on plans to resume economic cooperation, including working to reconnect rail and road links. They agreed as well to restart a joint factory park in a border city of Kaesong and tours to the North’s Mount Kumgang resort, when conditions are met.  U.S. officials suggested Kim was trying to ease the economic pressure on him to curb his nuclear programs and to undercut the rationale for U.S. troops being based in South Korea by improving relations with Seoul. The United States has some 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter North Korean attack. Pyongyang has long sought their withdrawal and Trump has questioned their rationale and cost. “There is nothing the North has offered so far that would constitute irreversible movement toward denuclearisation, however you define that, by January 2021 or any other time, or even a reduction of the military threat it poses to the South and the region,” said a U.S. intelligence official. “Everything that’s out there now is conditional on U.S. actions that would reduce the pressure on the North to cooperate or (is) filled with loopholes and exit ramps,” added the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. officials said the ambiguity about what Washington was supposed to do for the North to close its nuclear complex at Yongbyon gave Kim room to argue that Washington had not done enough for North Korea to follow through on its pledges. Even if North Korea were to shut down Yongbyon, officials and experts believe it has other secret nuclear facilities. South Korea’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said the reciprocal U.S. steps could include an end-of-war declaration. South Korea and the United States remain technically at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Though Wednesday’s inter-Korean agreement failed to stipulate the North’s commitment to declare nuclear and missile facilities for inspection and eventual decommissioning, Seoul has been in talks with both Pyongyang and Washington over the issue, a senior South Korean official said.  “What North Korea really wants and their priorities may be different from ours,” the official told reporters on Thursday on condition of anonymity.  “We’re talking about a package that would carry many elements, including the declaration of the facilities, Yongbyon and Tongchang-ri, which are of U.S. interest, and from the North side, the issues of normalizing relations, ending the war and easing sanctions.” Despite the doubts of U.S. officials and outside analysts, North Korea’s pledge at the summit with the South Korean president drew an enthusiastic response from Trump. Speaking before Pompeo’s comments, Trump‏ welcomed Kim’s pledges, calling them part of “tremendous progress” with Pyongyang on a number of fronts, and hailing “very good news” from the summit between the Koreas.  “He’s calm, I’m calm - so we’ll see what happens,” Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, told reporters. Kim pledged to work toward the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” during two meetings with Moon earlier this year and at his summit with Trump. But discussions over how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered and North Korea has consistently refused to give up its nuclear arsenal unilaterally. Washington has demanded concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities, before agreeing to Pyongyang’s key goals, including an easing of international sanctions and an official end to the Korean War. While North Korea has stopped nuclear and missile tests in the past year, it did not allow international inspections of its dismantling of its Punggye-ri nuclear test site in May, drawing criticism that its action was for show and could be reversed. The day after the June 12 Trump-Kim summit, Pompeo said he hoped to achieve “major disarmament” by North Korea by the end of Trump’s first term in January 2021. His latest statement that the process “should be completed by January 2021” may be a signal Washington will not wait forever. “The statement clearly implies that inter-Korean summits and theatrical promises to dismantle the odd facility simply can’t substitute for a negotiating process on the nuclear issue,” said the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Daniel Russel. “Invoking the end of Trump’s term in January 2021 is another way of saying to the North that American patience is not unlimited and that Kim Jong Un won’t be able to sidestep denuclearisation indefinitely,” Russel added.

2019-02-08,"SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May told Ireland’s Leo Varadkar that she would make new proposals on the post-Brexit Irish border but presented nothing in writing, the Irish prime minister said on Thursday.  Speaking after two days of talks with EU leaders in Austria, Varadkar said other states offered him their full support in the Brexit talks.  “All of the EU leaders ... gave me their absolute support in standing behind Ireland, saying that an agreement that doesn’t work for Ireland, doesn’t work for the EU,” the Irish premier told reporters.  “Next step is further negotiations with a view to the next summit to be held in October and then a summit after that in November,” he said, adding he would want a deal “in principle” next month so it can be formalised at the following meeting. “Time is running out, people need to know what is going to happen after (Brexit day on) March 29,” the Irish leader said. “I really think we have to redouble and intensify our efforts.” Varadkar reiterated that the emergency “backstop” solution for the Irish border after Brexit had to be “workable and legally operative”. He said he was waiting for a new proposal to come from London.  “Nobody is trying to dispute the constitutional status of Northern Ireland,” Varadkar said. “We need to get away from the idea of anyone trying to create a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s not the EU’s objective.” He said the EU was reworking the existing backstop proposal by the bloc to say that agriculture and phytosanitary checks would be the only physical controls that would need to take place between Northern Ireland and Britain’s mainland.  He also spoke in favour of offering London a declaration as detailed as possible on post-Brexit ties. While he said the remaining EU states did not want to punish Britain, they were determined to defend their single market.  “The whole Brexit project is full of risks. I believe we can come to a deal between the European Union, including Ireland, and the UK. But of course that deal has to go through the British parliament, the European Parliament. There are risks at all steps of this,” Varadkar said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The next James Bond film will be directed by American Cary Joji Fukunaga, the man behind the first season of U.S. drama “True Detective” and the Netflix comedy “Maniac,” the 007 producers said on Thursday. Fukunaga, 41, replaces British director Danny Boyle, who pulled out of the as yet untitled film last month due to “creative differences”. Filming of the 25th Bond movie will begin at Britain’s Pinewood studios in March 2019 with the worldwide release slated for Feb. 14, 2020, three months later than the original guidance given when Boyle was director.  The Bond franchise is one of the movie world’s most lucrative with 2015’s “Spectre,” directed by Sam Mendes, raking in $880 million at the box office worldwide, while “Skyfall” in 2012, also directed by Mendes, grossed more than $1 billion globally. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said of their new director: “His versatility and innovation make him an excellent choice for our next James Bond adventure.” Fukunaga directed the 2015 war film “Beasts of No Nation” starring Idris Elba. He will direct Bond star Daniel Craig who plays Bond for a fifth time, in what is expected to be his last stint as the secret agent created by author Ian Fleming in 1953.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Carmaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) rejected on Thursday a report suggesting it had decided against doing business in Iran after coming under pressure from Donald Trump’s ambassador to Germany, saying its position on the country had not changed. U.S. sanctions against Iran, introduced by President Trump after his decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, have forced companies in Germany and across Europe to reconsider their investments there. Ambassador Richard Grenell has appeared to take credit for this shift in a series of tweets and interviews over the past weeks, announcing the withdrawal of German blue chips like Siemens (SIEGn.DE), BASF (BASFn.DE) and now Volkswagen, to the surprise of the companies themselves. A Bloomberg News story on Thursday, quoting Grenell, said he had led talks with Volkswagen over the past weeks, hammering out the final details of its new Iran stance on Tuesday. However, a company source said there had been no talks with Grenell on Iran. And a VW spokesman told Reuters that the company’s position had not changed in recent weeks. Asked about the VW response, U.S. embassy spokeswoman Christina Higgins said: “The U.S. ambassador has been speaking for quite some time to CEOs and industry leaders urging that they comply with U.S. sanctions.” VW has no major investments in Iran, although it had been considering establishing a sales network for imported cars. Its Spanish division Seat announced last year that it had abandoned exploratory plans to enter Iran. Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations and outspoken defender of Trump, has ruffled feathers since arriving in Germany in May. Within hours of landing he sent a tweet warning German firms to halt all activities in Iran. Weeks later he drew fire from German politicians for telling right-wing website Breitbart News that he wanted to empower “other conservatives” in Europe. His remarks on Thursday about Volkswagen’s Iran plans triggered more criticism. Bijan Djir-Sarai, foreign policy spokesman for the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) in parliament, said it was ridiculous to think that German companies would make decisions based on pressure from the U.S. ambassador. “The policies coming out of Washington are having an impact. But this has nothing to do with the ambassador,” he said, urging Grenell to be more careful in his choice of words. “The German and European economies are strong. We don’t need to take orders as if we were an occupied zone.” Reporting by Noah Barkin, Jan Schwartz and Sabine Siebold; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-volkswagen-iran/vw-rejects-trump-envoys-take-on-iran-pullout-idUKKCN1M0054,2019-02-08,,VW rejects Trump envoy's take on Iran pullout
2019-02-08,"HAWTHORNE, Calif./TOKYO (Reuters) - SpaceX, Elon Musk’s space transportation company, on Monday named its first private passenger on a voyage around the moon as Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, the founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo.   A former drummer in a punk band, Maezawa is tentatively planning to make his moon flight in 2023 aboard SpaceX’s forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, taking the race to commercialise space travel to new heights. Only 24 astronauts have flown beyond Earth’s protective magnetic shield, in missions spanning a four-year period from December 1968 to December 1972. Maezawa’s identity was revealed at an event on Monday evening at the company’s headquarters and rocket factory in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne. “He’s a very brave person to do this,” Musk said of the Japanese entrepreneur.  Most famous outside Japan for his record-breaking $110 million purchase of an untitled 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat painting, Maezawa said he would invite six to eight artists to join him on the lunar flyby.  The billionaire chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc, Musk said the Big Falcon Rocket, or BFR, the super heavy-lift launch vehicle that he promises will shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars, could be conducting its first orbital flights in two to three years. Musk has previously said he wants the rocket to be ready for an unpiloted trip to Mars in 2022, with a crewed flight in 2024, though his ambitious production targets have been known to slip. “It’s not 100 percent certain we can bring this to flight,” Musk said of the lunar mission.  The amount Maezawa is paying for the trip was not disclosed, but he told Reuters the total sum was “much higher” than the cost of a Basquiat painting.  Musk said Maezawa had outlaid a significant deposit and would have a material impact on the cost of developing the BFR, which he estimated at about $5 billion. The 42-year-old Maezawa is one of Japan’s most colourful executives and is a regular fixture in the country’s gossipy weeklies with his collection of foreign and Japanese art, fast cars and celebrity girlfriend.   Maezawa made his fortune by founding the wildly popular shopping site Zozotown. His company, Zozo, officially called Start Today Co Ltd, also offers a made-to-measure service using a polka dot bodysuit, the Zozosuit.. In a country known for its staid corporate culture, the businessman is one of a small group of mould-breaking billionaires widely recognised by the general public.  With SpaceX, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and entrepreneur Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic battling it out to launch private-sector spacecraft, Maezawa will join a growing list of celebrities and the ultra-rich who have secured seats on flights offered on the under-development vessels.      Those who have signed up to fly on Virgin Galactic sub-orbital missions include actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000 (190,085 pounds). Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. These trips were not attractive given the limited amount of time spent in zero-gravity, Maezawa told Reuters.  “If I’m going to go to space, I’d rather go as far as I can,” he said. Maezawa has already shown his penchant for fast machines, splashing out on vehicles including the Bugatti Chiron sports car and the Mercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet SUV. And last month he tweeted that his new jet’s interior is being fashioned by luxury label Hermes. He is also looking to acquire his own baseball team, telling Reuters an announcement could come this year - a move that would mark Zozo’s place in the corporate big leagues along with team-owning tech giants such as SoftBank and Rakuten. While space flight is a more risky proposition - with Maezawa in his late 40s by 2023 - he said there are no training plans yet in place.  “SpaceX is going to be doing many, many test flights to ensure safety and we will wait for that to happen before we go,” Maezawa told Reuters.  Zozo shares fell as much as 4.7 percent and closed down 2.4 percent. Still, a jaunt around the moon would provide publicity for Zozo, which has ambitious overseas sales targets to be driven by its custom-made private clothing line.  The diminutive Maezawa, who as a young man struggled to find clothes that fit, hopes to revolutionise the fashion industry through his Zozosuit, which, once donned, allows users to upload their body measurements and order a growing number of made-to-measure items. SpaceX has already upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. The company has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars’ worth of contracts, including deals with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. When asked about Boeing Co CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s prediction that the first humans will be carried to Mars on a Boeing rocket, Musk responded, “Game on,” to the sound of cheers from employees assembled at the event.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Bank (LLOY.L) is looking to set up a third European Union subsidiary in Luxembourg to serve longstanding life insurance customers after Britain quits the bloc, a source told Reuters, in its latest overhaul aimed at Brexit-proofing its business. The UK’s largest mortgage lender is seeking a licence in Luxembourg to ensure continuity of service for customers based in the EU, the source familiar with the matter said. Initial discussions with regulators in Luxembourg - home to one of Europe’s most thriving insurance communities - have already taken place, with further talks planned over coming weeks, the source added. Lloyds declined to comment. If its application is successful, Lloyds will have legal bases in Britain, Berlin, Frankfurt and the Duchy, underlining the scale of reorganisation underway at UK-based banks as Brexit draws nearer. The bank has no plans to relocate UK-based employees to run the subsidiary. It is planning instead to hire around a dozen people to provide the necessary services to its EU-based Scottish Widows policyholders, the source said. These are holders of ‘closed book’ policies no longer being sold. The bulk of Scottish Widows policyholders will continue to be served by its Edinburgh-based British business.  Like its main German subsidiary, the Luxembourg entity will also need its own pool of capital but the total sum required is still to be discussed with local regulators.  News of Lloyds’ bid to set up a third base in the EU comes as Prime Minister Theresa May steps up efforts to secure a so-called ‘business-friendly’ Brexit deal with the EU before the end of 2018. Britain’s financial and related professional services sector, which employs 2.3 million people and represents nearly 10 percent of the UK’s total economic output, is broadly considered the industry with most to lose in the event of a chaotic Brexit.   Many global banks who have run European businesses from London for decades have begun to scatter senior executives and staff to a welter of new offices across the EU, amid fears they won’t be able to serve EU-based consumers or companies easily after Brexit Day on March 29. Swiss bank UBS UBSG.N said in March it would pursue a “decentralized” model, echoing moves by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N). Sources told Reuters in February 2017 that Lloyds will locate its main European subsidiary in Berlin, after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following its takeover of HBOS a decade ago. In July, Reuters reported that the bank, a more than 250-year-old institution that has always concentrated its operations in Britain, will set up two additional hubs to better support its EU-based bond trading and insurance customers, and to comply with British regulations aimed at reducing bank risk. Lloyds declined to give details on the amount of money it would need to capitalize its Frankfurt entity, but the sum required by the main Berlin subsidiary is expected to run to the “low hundreds of millions of pounds”, representing less than 1 percent of the bank’s overall capital. Lloyds employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain, the source said. The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking licence but Lloyds has applied to Germany’s financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm licence, the source added.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A nearly two-year battle to take over UK-based broadcaster Sky SKYB.L could finally be settled in a quick auction this weekend, Britain’s Takeover Panel said on Thursday. Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O), which already owns 39 percent of Sky, and rival Comcast CMSCA.O are locked in a contest for control of the European pay-TV operator in a deal worth at least 25.9 billion pounds ($34.3 billion). Comcast currently has the upper hand in the bidding war after it made a 14.75 pound a share offer for Sky in July, which trumped an earlier 14 pound a share bid by Fox.  Sky’s independent directors are currently recommending Comcast’s higher offer to shareholders. If neither bidder has admitted defeat by 1600 GMT on Friday, Sept. 21, then an auction will kick off. Below are the details of how the auction will be conducted. * The auction begins at 1600 GMT on Friday, Sept. 21. From this point, neither party may make a revised offer, nor may they change any other conditions of their existing offers. * A maximum of three rounds of bidding will take place on Saturday, Sept. 22.  * In the first round, the bidder with the lowest offer, or the last bidder to revise its offer if both are the same, may make an increased bid. As things stand, that would be Fox. * In the second round, the other bidder may make an increased bid. They will do so knowing what their rival has done in the previous round, a source close to the process said.     * If there is no increased bid in the second round, the auction ends here. * Otherwise, both parties may increase their bids in a third and final round. * In the final round, each party may make its bid conditional on the other party also making a bid in that round. * Bids may only be made for a fixed cash price in pounds sterling. * All three parties are forbidden from publicly announcing any increased bids during the process. * By the evening of Saturday, Sept. 22, the Takeover Panel will announce the offers of the two parties. The rules allow for the suitors’ final bids to be equal. * By 0600 GMT on Monday, Sept. 24, each bidder must make an announcement of its latest bid. * By Thursday, Sept. 27, the bidders must publish a revised offer document, if they have revised their offers. * By Oct. 11, the offers must be declared unconditional as to acceptances. * The Panel did not set any rules or deadlines for Sky’s independent directors to decide whether to change their recommendation to shareholders following the end of the auction on Saturday.  *Hypothetically, if the auction concludes with Fox and Comcast making equal offers for Sky, Fox’s bid could be more attractive to Sky’s minority investors because the U.S. giant already owns 39 percent of Sky and would have the better chance of taking control of the broadcaster.

2019-02-08,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Wednesday they had fired the top prosecutor in Jalisco state, the second official to lose his job after the discovery of a container truck holding the bodies of hundreds of victims of the country’s drug war. Authorities are struggling to manage the death toll in the western state, which is home to one of the country’s most powerful drug gangs and has already seen a record number of killings this year.  With morgues at capacity, a refrigerated semi-trailer truck filled with corpses was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of the state capital and, later, near a residential neighbourhood, touching off an uproar. During a press conference Wednesday evening, authorities said the truck held 273 bodies, up from the previous count of 157. Another truck was found with 49 bodies inside. Speaking to reporters, Governor Aristoteles Sandoval attributed the problem to poor planning and insensitivity on the part of state officials. The state will ensure all the bodies are stored adequately by Oct. 15, Sandoval said. “We can’t accept acts of indifference, of a lack of sensitivity,” Sandoval told reporters. “There is no way I will tolerate them.” Authorities said they had dismissed the state’s top prosecutor, Raul Sanchez. Sanchez could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday evening.  On Tuesday, the state fired Luis Octavio Cotero, who had headed the forensic institute. Cotero told Reuters that his agency was not responsible for storing the unclaimed bodies, and accused the government of making him a scapegoat.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) may face sanctions because it has yet to comply with EU consumer rules while Airbnb has made the necessary changes in response to regulatory demands, EU sources said on Wednesday. Online platforms are under pressure in Europe because of their dominance and anti-competitive business practices, which have resulted in hefty fines handed down to some companies. Privacy and consumer concerns have also aggravated the situation.  Seven months after Europe’s Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told Facebook and other tech companies to bring their user terms in line with EU consumer laws, the social media giant has yet to address all her concerns, the sources said. “There is only limited progress and this has been going on for too long,” the sources said.  Jourova had previously voiced concerns about the companies’ liability and how users are informed about content removal or contract terminations. Consumer protection authorities across the 28-country bloc, which requested the changes last year, have the power to fine the companies for breaching EU rules.  Facebook has previously said it worked with EU authorities to amend its terms and ensure greater transparency. Three months after being told to revise its terms and conditions, Airbnb has made the necessary changes, the sources said. “This is good news for consumers who will benefit for instance from more transparency on prices, so they can compare offers upfront,” the sources said. The European Commission had told Airbnb to state whether accommodation is offered by a private individual or a professional, provide details of prices in a clear way and offer fairer terms to consumers. Founded in 2008 in San Francisco, Airbnb matches people wishing to rent out all or part of their homes to temporary guests, via a website. Jourova will hold a news conference on the issue at 0815 GMT on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May, arriving at an EU summit dinner in Austria on Wednesday, called on fellow European Union leaders to follow her lead and adapt their Brexit negotiating stance to get a good deal. “If we’re going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too,” May told reporters on arrival in Salzburg. “I’m confident that with goodwill and determination we can agree a deal that right for both parties.” She defended her Chequers proposals on a future customs and trade arrangement with the bloc, saying: “It maintains frictionless trade. It’s the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland and also delivers on the vote of the British people.” Asked about comments from EU negotiator Michel Barnier that he would improve a proposal on the Northern Ireland border, she said that was positive but she still saw difficulties with EU calls for checks on trade between the province and the British mainland if the “backstop” were ever activated:  “I welcome the fact that Michel Barnier is recognising the need to find a new solution. The original proposal put forward by the European Commission was unacceptable to us,” May said. “We’ve always recognised that there are unique circumstances that apply in Northern Ireland, for example in relation to checks for some agricultural products. But what we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away effectively from the United Kingdom’s customs territory. “Regardless of where the checks will be, what that would mean is that there would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.” She criticised some members of the opposition Labour Party for pressing for a vote to reverse the 2016 Brexit referendum: “There are prominent Labour members like the mayor of London who are now trying to take us back to square one and are backing a second referendum and postponing the Brexit date, the exit day. I want to be absolutely clear - this government will never accept a second referendum.  “The British people have voted to leave the European Union and we will be leaving on the 29th of March, 2019. “I now call on the Labour leadership to rule out a second referendum and stop trying to frustrate the Brexit process.

2019-02-08,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank’s (DANSKE.CO) chief executive Thomas Borgen resigned on Wednesday after an investigation revealed payments totaling 200 billion euros ($234 billion) through its small Estonian branch, many of which the bank said were suspicious. The Danish bank detailed compliance and control failings amid growing calls for a European Union crackdown on financial crime after a series of money laundering scandals which have attracted the attention of U.S. authorities. “Even though I was personally cleared from a legal point of view, I hold the ultimate responsibility. There is no doubt that we as an organization have failed in this situation and did not live up to expectations,” Borgen, who will stay on until a new CEO is appointed, told a press conference. Borgen, 54, was in charge of Danske Bank’s international operations, including Estonia, between 2009 and 2012. While the report shed some light on the bank’s activities in Estonia, investors are concerned whether the United States, which has placed sanctions on Russia, will punish it. “As this is the largest money laundering scandal in European history, and Danske Bank is a major bank that sends dollars around the world, I imagine that this will certainly get the attention of the U.S. authorities,” Bill Browder, the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management who has campaigned against corruption in Russia, told Reuters. Danish politicians were critical of Danske Bank for not revealing exactly how much money was allegedly laundered and not saying who was legally responsible for the lapses. “It is deeply embarrassing that for so many years there have been transactions that should not have taken place. Much of it is expected to be money laundering, and that is simply not good enough by Danske Bank,” business minister Rasmus Jarlov, who oversees Denmark’s banking sector, told a press conference. Danske Bank said in its summary of a report covering around 15,000 customers and 9.5 million payments between 2007 and 2015 that Borgen, Chairman Ole Andersen and the board “did not breach their legal obligations”. Andersen said the bank had made an assessment of whether it violated U.S. laws but declined to share its conclusion when asked at a press conference. The Estonian non-resident portfolio’s around 10,000 customers were registered in 90 different countries, with  Russia, Britain, the British Virgin Islands and Finland the main ones, Danske Bank said, adding that around a third of them became clients of the branch in 2007. Danske Bank, whose already battered shares fell by nearly 8 percent, said some 6,200 customers had been examined and it expected “a significant part of the payments to be suspicious”. Shares in Danske Bank had doubled in value from when Borgen took over in 2013 to July 2017, but have since lost more than a third as allegations of suspicious transactions increased and Denmark and Estonia began criminal investigations.  The bank said it had taken action including “warnings, dismissals, loss of bonus payments and reporting to the authorities” against current and former staff, as well as overhauling systems found to have failed. In an indication of the costs such lapses can have, Dutch bank ING (INGA.AS) agreed to pay 775 million euros ($900 million) this month after admitting criminals had been able to launder money through its accounts. And earlier this year U.S. authorities accused Latvia’s ABLV of covering up money laundering, leading to the bank being denied U.S. dollar funding and its swift collapse. While Danske does not have a banking license in the United States, banning U.S. correspondent banks from dealing with it would amount to shutting it out of the global financial network.  GRAPHIC: Danske Bank share price performance - reut.rs/2plB6Om The report found that Danske Bank failed to take proper action in 2007 when it was criticized by the Estonian regulator and received information from its Danish counterpart that pointed to “criminal activity in its pure form, including money laundering” estimated at “billions of rubles monthly”. And when a whistleblower raised problems at the Estonian branch in early 2014 the allegations were not properly investigated and were not shared with the board, Danske said, adding that measures to get its business there under control had been insufficient. Danske Bank also said the Estonian branch did not employ its anti-money laundering procedures because it had not migrated its Baltic banking activities onto the bank’s IT platform as this would have been too expensive.   “The report describes serious shortcomings in the organization of Danske Bank, where risk-appetite and risk control were not in balance,” the head of Estonia’s FSA financial regulator Kilvar Kessler said in a statement.  Danske Bank, which cut its forecast for annual net profit to 16-17 billion Danish crowns, from a previous 18-20 billion, has successfully overcome previous traumas. The government had to step in when international markets froze in 2008 and in 2012 it was criticized for an advertising campaign that sought to improve its image, borrowing symbols linked to anti-establishment movement Occupy Wall Street. Prior to the money laundering scandal, Borgen had managed to improve the bank’s image and earnings in part by cutting costs, shifting its focus to wealthier clients and expanding in Sweden and Norway to rival the Nordic region’s biggest bank, Nordea NDA.ST.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A woman who has accused President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault decades ago wants her allegations to be investigated by the FBI before she appears at a U.S. Senate hearing, her lawyers said on Tuesday. The development further roiled a confirmation process that once seemed smooth for Kavanaugh, whose confirmation to the lifetime post could consolidate the conservative grip on the top U.S. court. Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor in California, has accused Kavanaugh of attacking her and trying to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a suburban Maryland party in 1982 when they were both high school students, allegations Kavanaugh has called “completely false.” The Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing the nomination, had called a hearing for Monday to examine the matter, and the White House had said Kavanaugh was ready to testify. In a letter to the committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, Ford’s attorneys said an FBI investigation needed to come first. ""A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions,"" the lawyers wrote. A copy of the letter was posted on the committee's website. (bit.ly/2OAJWD0)  Grassley said there is no reason to delay Ford’s testimony and an invitation for her to appear before the committee on Monday stands.  “Dr Ford’s testimony would reflect her personal knowledge and memory of events. Nothing the FBI or any other investigator does would have any bearing on what Dr Ford tells the committee, so there is no reason for any further delay,” Grassley said in a statement.  Democrats, already fiercely opposed to the nominee, have also been seeking an FBI investigation, a request that Republicans have rebuffed. Trump and other Republicans said they did not think the FBI needed to be involved. A hearing would represent a potential make-or-break moment for the conservative federal appeals court judge’s confirmation chances, as Trump pursues his goal of moving the federal judiciary to the right. “The Supreme Court is one of the main reasons I got elected President. I hope Republican Voters, and others, are watching, and studying, the Democrats Playbook,” Trump tweeted late on Tuesday. Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow margin, meaning any defections within the party could sink the nomination and deal a major setback to Trump. Earlier on Tuesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the committee’s Republicans, said the panel would vote on the nomination next week whether or not Ford testified. A vote in committee would be a precursor to action in the full Senate. “If she does not want to come Monday, publicly or privately, we’re going to move on and vote Wednesday,” he told Fox News Channel. In a statement on Monday, a representative for the Justice Department said the FBI had followed protocol forwarding information about the allegation to the White House.  “The FBI’s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers,” the statement said. Trump earlier on Tuesday stepped up his defence of Kavanaugh and expressed sympathy towards his nominee, who met with officials at the White House for a second straight day, although not with the president. “I feel so badly for him that he’s going through this, to be honest with you,” Trump told a news conference. “This is not a man that deserves this.” “Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then they will vote,” Trump added. Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, appeared to cast doubt on Ford’s allegations. “We just don’t know what happened 36 years ago and there are gaps in her memory. She doesn’t know how she got there, when it was, and so that would logically be something where she would get questions,” Cornyn told reporters. Cornyn’s fellow Republicans have generally avoided criticizing Ford, instead castigating Democrats for not revealing her allegations earlier. The confirmation fight comes just weeks before the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are seeking to take control of Congress from Trump’s fellow Republicans, which would be a major blow to the president’s agenda. Ford detailed her allegation in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat. The letter’s contents leaked last week and Ford identified herself in an interview with the Washington Post published on Sunday that included details about the alleged assault. In a statement, Feinstein, said the committee should accede to Ford’s wishes and postpone Monday’s hearing. “A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date,” she said in a statement. Lisa Banks, an attorney for Ford, told CNN her client was dealing with “hate mail, harassment, death threats” and that her immediate focus was protecting herself and her family.  Democrats have objected to the proposed hearing format, with Feinstein arguing there should be more than just two witnesses, possibly to include people in whom Ford previously confided. The committee’s Democrats said witnesses should include Kavanaugh’s friend Mark Judge, who Ford has said witnessed the alleged incident. A lawyer representing Judge sent a letter to Grassley saying Judge did not want to speak publicly about the matter. “In fact, I have no memory of this alleged incident. Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr Ford’s letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr Ford describes,” the letter quoted Judge as saying. Judge is the author of a 1997 memoir titled “Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk,” which recounts his experiences as a teenage alcoholic. One Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, said Kavanaugh should withdraw his nomination. “I believe Dr Ford. I believe the survivor here,” Blumenthal said. “She has come forward courageously and bravely, knowing she would face a nightmare of possible and vicious scrutiny.” The showdown has echoes of current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ contentious confirmation hearings in 1991 involving sexual harassment allegations lodged against him by a law professor named Anita Hill. Thomas, the court’s second black justice, was ultimately confirmed, but only after a nasty televised hearing in which Hill faced pointed questions from Republican senators and the nominee said he was the victim of “a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks.” Reporting by Lawrence Hurley and Eric Beech; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan, Roberta Rampton, Steve Holland, Andrew Chung, Amanda Becker and Mohammad Zargham; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Will Dunham and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-court-kavanaugh/kavanaugh-accuser-wants-fbi-investigation-before-she-will-testify-idUKKCN1LY2F5,2019-02-08,,Kavanaugh accuser wants FBI investigation before she will testify
2019-02-08,"CHATTERIS, England (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) is going head-to-head with fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl on price with a new grocery store it says will be the cheapest in town.  Chief Executive Dave Lewis unveiled Tesco’s new Jack’s format on Wednesday, saying it would sell 2,600 essential items including 1,800 Jack’s-branded products.  That compares with the thousands of goods on sale in its traditional supermarkets, and mimics the German chains’ focus on simplicity and own-brands to keep costs down - a strategy that has seen them grab 13 percent of Britain’s grocery market.  Some 10-15 Jack’s stores will open over the next six months, with the first two on Thursday - at Chatteris and Immingham in eastern England.  Jack’s is named after Jack Cohen, who in 1919 founded the business that became Tesco, and is a significant move by Lewis, who has rebuilt Tesco after a 2014 accounting scandal capped a dramatic downturn in trading. But the limited number of openings and initial capital expenditure of about 25 million pounds disappointed some analysts, as media reports had said that up to 60 existing Tesco outlets could be converted. “This is first and foremost about how we celebrate the centenary,” Lewis told reporters at the Chatteris store, which was built as a Tesco supermarket but mothballed in 2015 when the group was in crisis.  “We only have plans for 10-15. If we feel that customers are absolutely supportive of what we’re doing then yes of course we have optionality going forward,” he said. And he played down Jack’s’ financial significance to the group: “It’s not a calculation that we’re currently doing,” he said. Shares in Tesco were up 0.5 percent at 1515 GMT. Patrick O’Brian, research director at GlobalData, had expected a bolder store opening schedule. “Aldi and Lidl are unlikely to be too concerned about this opening salvo,” he said. Some Tesco investors were, however, thrilled. “Jack’s fits perfectly into the current consumer zeitgeist and will drive revenues as well as protecting margins across the Tesco group,” said Freddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management. Aldi and Lidl have steadily grown market share in Britain since the 2008 financial crisis, chipping away at Tesco and its three biggest rivals Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Asda (WMT.N) and Morrisons (MRW.L). “The intention is for us to be the cheapest in town,” said Lewis, adding Jack’s could benefit from Tesco’s buying power. Eight out of ten of Jack’s food and drink products are grown, reared or made in Britain. A large chicken is priced at 3.19 pounds, while four pints of semi skimmed milk will cost 1.09 pounds. The stores will also stock some familiar major brands, such as Coca Cola, as well as a range of general merchandise on a “When it’s Gone, It’s Gone” basis. Jack’s stores will be a mixture of entirely new sites, sites adjacent to existing Tesco stores, and converted Tesco stores. Tesco currently has a 27.4 percent share of Britain’s grocery market, according to the latest industry data, although it could be overtaken by Sainsbury’s proposed 7.3 billion pound takeover of Asda. The tie-up between Tesco’s two nearest competitors, which regulators on Wednesday said would be scrutinised in depth, is also driven, at least in part, by the rise of the discounters. Britain’s “big four” grocers are trying to adapt to changing habits, including the declining popularity of big weekly shops and the growth of online shopping. They have cut prices and improved service, but analysts say that with sales at Aldi and Lidl growing at 10 percent each year it makes sense for Tesco to try to capture some of that growth.  Analysts do, however, have concerns that Jack’s could take sales from Tesco’s existing stores - fears played down by Lewis.  “I’d rather cannibalise myself than somebody else cannibalise me,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shale gas developer Cuadrilla will start fracking at its Preston New Road site in northwest England in the next few weeks, it said on Wednesday as it announced government approval for a second well. Hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure and was halted in Britain seven years ago after causing earth tremors. But the British government, keen to cut its reliance on imports as North Sea supplies dry up, has tightened regulation of the industry and gave consent in July for Cuadrilla to start fracking a first well at Preston New Road. After approval for a second well at the site, Cuadrilla said on Wednesday that it would begin work “in readiness to start hydraulically fracturing both wells in the next few weeks”. Cuadrilla said it would run an initial flow test of the gas produced from both wells for approximately six months.   The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could amount to 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years. However, attempts to extract the gas have come under fire from local communities and campaigners concerned about the potential effect on the environment and ground water, and arguing that extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with the country’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. British energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said consent for the second well had been granted after the company had met a number of criteria, including showing it had the necessary funds to carry out work at the site until at least June 30, 2019. “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, further enhancing our energy security and helping us with our continued transition to a lower-carbon economy,” she said in an emailed statement. Cuadrilla first attempted to frack gas near Blackpool in the northwest of England in 2011, but the practice led to an earth tremor registering 2.3 on the Richter scale. The company said the quakes were caused by an unusual combination of geological features at the site, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of 0.5 or above on the Richter scale is detected. It has also increased monitoring standards, including checks on ground water. Fracking consent was introduced in 2015 as an additional step to the government’s regulatory regime and ensures environmental, health and safety permits have been obtained. “Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities,” Perry said.

The idea of a joint bid to host the Summer Games in 2032 was floated last week by Seoul’s Sports Minister Do Jong-hwan. Do said that co-hosting the Games would build on the success of this year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where North Korea’s participation helped ease tensions on the peninsula.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed developments on Wednesday at an inter-Korean summit in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang as “very exciting”. “Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts,” Trump said on Twitter, referring to agreements the North Korean leader made in talks with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. “In the meantime there will be no Rocket or Nuclear testing,” Trump added. Referring to the repatriation of remains of U.S. service people killed in the Korean War, which Kim and Moon also discussed, Trump said: “Hero remains to continue being returned home to the United States.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Tuesday his “historic” summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore stabilised regional security, and that he expected further progress at an inter-Korean summit aimed at reviving stalled nuclear diplomacy.  Kim thanked South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in for bringing about the Singapore meeting in June as the two leaders began their third round of talks in Pyongyang. “Thanks to that, the political situation in the region has stabilised and I expect more advanced results,” Kim told Moon, referring to the Singapore gathering, at the start of their talks.  The Kim-Moon summit will be a litmus test for another meeting Kim has recently proposed to Trump, with the South Korean president seeking to engineer a proposal that combines a framework for the North’s denuclearisation and a joint declaration ending the 1950-53 Korean War. Moon expressed gratitude for Kim’s “bold decision to open a new era”. The first session of the talks, which lasted for two hours, were held at the headquarters of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party Central Committee, with party vice chairman Kim Yong Chol and Kim Jong Un’s sister Kim Yo Jong, as well as South Korea’s national security adviser Chung Eui-yong and spy chief Suh Hoon in attendance.  Earlier, the leaders paraded down the streets of Pyongyang in Kim’s black Mercedes limousine to loud cheers from nearly 100,000 North Koreans who waved flowers and chanted “Motherland!Unification!”  Kim greeted Moon with hugs and handshakes as the South Korean leader landed in the North’s capital with a mission to rekindle momentum in faltering talks between Washington and Pyongyang over denuclearisation and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War. As Kim escorted Moon to the Paekhwawon State Guest House, where Moon will stay during his three-day visit, Kim said he wanted to produce a “bigger outcome at a faster pace” than the two leaders have achieved so far. Moon, himself the offspring of a family displaced by the war, has met Kim twice this year at the border village of Panmunjom. “You Mr. President are travelling all around the world, but our country is humble compared with developed nations,” Kim told Moon. “I’ve been waiting and waiting for today. The level of the accommodation and schedule we provide may be low, but it’s our best sincerity and heart.” Moon said it was “time to bear fruit” and thanked Kim for his hospitality, which included a massive welcome ceremony at Pyongyang International Airport featuring a large, goose-stepping honour guard and a military band. During their motor parade through Pyongyang’s landmark Ryomyong Street, a new residential district launched last year under Kim’s initiative to modernise the city, Kim and Moon briefly stepped out of the vehicle to greet and take flowers from members of the crowd. Trump has asked Moon to be “chief negotiator” between himself and Kim, according to Moon’s aides, after Trump cancelled a trip to Pyongyang by his secretary of state last month. Washington wants to see concrete action toward denuclearisation by North Korea before agreeing to a key goal of Pyongyang - declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War.  The conflict ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces including South Korea technically still at war with the North. South Korea is pinning high hopes on Kim’s remarks to Moon’s special envoys earlier this month that he wants to achieve denuclearisation within Trump’s first term in office ending in early 2021. “If North Korea-U.S. dialogue is restarted after this visit, it would have much significance in itself,” Moon said before his departure. Underscoring the challenges ahead, North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun said on Tuesday “the responsibility falls squarely on the United States” for the stalled nuclear discussions. “It is due to its nonsensical, irrational stubbornness that other issues can only be discussed after our country has completely verifiably, irreversibly dismantled our nuclear capabilities... without showing the intention to build trust including declaring the end of war,” the newspaper said in an editorial. On Wednesday, Moon and Kim plan to hold a second day of official talks after which they are expected to unveil a joint statement, and a separate military pact designed to defuse tensions and prevent armed clashes. Moon will return home early Thursday.  Travelling with Moon are South Korean business tycoons, including Samsung scion Jay Y. Lee and the chiefs of SK Group and LG Group. They met North Korean Deputy Prime Minister Ri Ryong Nam, who is in charge of economic affairs, although Seoul officials said they did not expect any specific joint economic projects to be agreed given extensive international sanctions.  The United States is pressing other countries to strictly observe U.N. sanctions aimed at choking off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. North Korea says it has destroyed its main nuclear and missile engine test site and has halted atomic and ballistic missile tests, but U.S. officials and analysts believe it is continuing to work on its weapons plans covertly. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Russia on Monday of “cheating” on U.N. sanctions on North Korea.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index barely budged on Tuesday as investors took in their stride an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war., and losses among tobacco stocks were balanced by gains in miners and oil companies. The FTSE 100 .FTSE ended the day down 0.03 percent, while mid-caps .FTMC rose 0.4 percent, tracking higher European markets after Washington decided to slap 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods, and Beijing retaliated. Beijing’s retaliation was less harsh than feared and caused just a temporary blip in stock markets which recovered fast. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said in a note: “A less-than-proportional round of retaliation would likely be taken positively by the market, reducing the risk of a significant tit-for-tat escalation in the conflict.” The FTSE 100 remains down 5.1 percent so far this year, however, as a recovery in sterling on growing expectations of a Brexit deal has weighed on the exporter-heavy index. The biggest drag on the FTSE on Tuesday was tobacco firm BAT (BATS.L), which fell 1.9 percent after Morgan Stanley started covering the stock with an equal-weight rating. Its rival Imperial Brands (IMB.L) also fell 1.8 percent.   “At these low levels, at this discount valuation, after this period of underperformance, BAT should be a full-house buy. It certainly ticks a lot of boxes. However, a combination of new challenges and some familiar ones leaves us on the sidelines,” said an analyst at the U.S. investment bank. Serviced offices provider IWG (IWG.L) fell 6.6 percent after Credit Suisse analysts downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “neutral”, citing risks to earnings from the implementation of new accounting standards and the departure of the CFO. Broadcaster ITV (ITV.L) dropped 3 percent after its CEO declined to say whether it had bid for Netherlands-based production company Endemol Shine. Ocado (OCDO.L) rose 0.6 percent after the online supermarket said retail sales growth slowed a touch in the latest quarter, though it was in line with the group’s guidance for the full year. “As commerce migrates online, the winners will be those with access to advanced tech and logistics platforms,” said Peel Hunt analysts, affirming their buy rating on the stock. “Ocado’s proprietary technology provides better customer service, higher efficiency, greater margin potential, and is now being licensed to third parties across the globe as a pick and shovel play on ecommerce,” they added. Miners were broadly higher, with shares in Glencore (GLEN.L), Anglo American (AAL.L), and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) trading up between 1.8 and 2.8 percent. Fresnillo (FRES.L) was up 1 percent, supported by an RBC double upgrade to “top pick”.  Among mid-caps, Jardine Lloyd Thompson (JLT.L) soared 30.7  percent after U.S. financial services group Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC.N) agreed to buy the UK broker for about 4.3 billion pounds. “JLT has been fiercely independent in the past and so we are surprised to see a recommended bid from Marsh & McLennan and uncertain about JLT’s motivations behind the headlines,” wrote KBW analyst William Hawkins.  “But our knee-jerk response is that this is a good deal for JLT shareholders with the key governance parties already behind it and so closure is highly likely at the 19.15 pounds price.” Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s September fund manager survey showed global investors growing more optimistic on UK stocks, while they cut exposure to euro zone stocks further.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares shuddered, then recovered, on Tuesday after Beijing retaliated with new tariffs on $60 billion (45.61 billion pounds) worth of U.S. goods, less than 24 hours after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  Having shrugged off the U.S. move in morning trading, the pan-European STOXX 600 tumbled to a session low after China's retaliatory blow, down as much as 0.2 percent while the leading index of euro zone stocks .STOXX50E fell 0.1 percent. Both indices recovered rapidly, though, as it became clear the tariff levels announced by China were lower than previously expected - imposing 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. goods it had previously listed for 10 to 20 percent tariff rates.  The STOXX50E ended the day up 0.3 percent with the STOXX 600 up 0.1 percent. Investors and analysts had been perplexed by early market moves which shrugged off Washington’s escalation of the tit-for-tat tariff spat waging between the U.S. and China. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, highlighted how important Chinese retaliation was to the outlook for markets.  “A less-than-proportional round of retaliation would likely be taken positively by the market, reducing the risk of a significant tit-for-tat escalation in the conflict,” he wrote in a note.  Explaining the market’s sanguine reaction earlier, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com said on Tuesday the fine print of the new tariffs could also be seen as providing some relief.  “Exemptions have turned this into something of a sell the rumour, buy the fact type scenario for investors”, he said. Thomas Costerg, senior U.S. economist at Pictet, said ahead of the U.S. trade announcement that investors might well take the view that the Trump administration had shown some restraint as it could have imposed even higher tariffs. “Ten percent could actually come as a relief”, he said, adding that such a figure would be “bad but manageable”.  On the corporate front, dealmaking prompted steep moves across European bourses.  The top gainer was Norway’s Schibsted (SBSTA.OL), up 9.1 percent after it said it would spin off its international online classifieds. Denmark’s Pandora (PNDORA.CO) jumped as much as 10 percent, ending the day up 6.8 percent after a media report that private equity funds are studying a potential takeover bid. “While we acknowledge that the decelerating top-line performance ... continues to be worrying, Pandora is still a relatively strong cash-generative business which we believe could be turned around should management be replaced,” commented Berenberg analysts. Swiss chemical group Clariant (CLN.S) was up 8 percent after it announced it would merge its high-performance materials business with that of new anchor shareholder Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) 2010.SE, to focus on higher-value speciality chemicals. Zalando (ZALG.DE) Europe’s biggest pure online fashion retailer, was the worst performer, down 14 percent after blaming a long, hot summer for cutting its 2018 outlook. Its main shareholder, Kinnevik (KINVb.ST), which holds about a 31 percent stake in Zalando, fell 7 percent. Shares in Dutch digital mapping firm TomTom (TOM2.AS) lost nearly a quarter of their value, ending the day down 24 percent after Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi announced a partnership with rival Google. European stocks remain unpopular with investors who show a marked preference for U.S. equities.

2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - Britain will support Zimbabwe to get on to an interim IMF staff programme to help the country quickly clear its foreign arrears, Britain’s ambassador in Harare said on Tuesday, Clearing the $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank is seen as a major step for Zimbabwe to start accessing foreign credit, especially for the private sector as well as foreign direct investment. Ambassador Catriona Laing said an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme would help Britain’s former colony expedite the clearance of its arrears.   “We are here to give that support to try and encourage a process back to an IMF programme, perhaps through an interim staff monitoring programme as soon as possible,” Laing told reporters. She said this would enable Zimbabwe “to start a serious dialogue” around the clearance of the arrears. Zimbabwe’s finance minister Mthuli Ncube said President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government was still deciding whether to follow the Highly Indebted Poor Country route or a commercial deal to clear the arrears. Only then would it come up with a timeline to pay the arrears, he said, adding that he would launch an economic stabilisation programme next month. Zimbabwe, which is trying to shake off its international pariah tag, started defaulting on its foreign debt in 1999. The West put sanctions on the country in 2002 as punishment against former President Robert Mugabe’s government, which was accused of vote fraud and rights abuses. Mugabe, whose near four-decade rule ended after a coup last November, has maintained he was punished for seizing white-owned commercial farms to resettle blacks. Laing said along with economic measures such as reducing the country’s fiscal deficit, Britain also wanted Harare to carry out political reforms, including aligning the country’s laws to a 2013 constitution. “We will be tracking both pathways, the economic pathway and political pathway. We want Zimbabwe to succeed,” Laing said.

2019-02-08,"TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - The United State’s trade actions against China will not work as China has ample fiscal and monetary policy tools to cope with the impact, a senior securities market official said on Tuesday. Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said at a conference in Tianjin that he hopes the two sides can sit down and negotiate on trade and that he looks forward to good China-U.S. trade relations over the long term. “President Trump is a hard-hitting businessman, and he tries to put pressure on China so he can get concessions from our negotiations. I think that kind of tactic is not going to work with China.” President Donald Trump escalated his trade war with China on Monday, imposing 10 percent tariffs on about $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The tariffs on the $200 billion (£152.14 billion) list will start on September 24, according to a senior U.S. administration official.  Trump also threatened to “immediately pursue” tariffs on another $267 billion of imports if China retaliates. “If he puts tariffs on all Chinese exports to the United States - which he says he will - even in that scenario, the negative impact on China’s economy is about 0.7 percent,” Fang said. He did not specify on whether he was referring to the impact on the amount of gross domestic product (GDP) or the growth rate of GDP.  The U.S. has “poisoned” the atmosphere for negotiations, Fang said, but added that the two sides can talk about how to cut the U.S. trade deficit with China.  Vice Premier Liu He is set to convene a meeting in Beijing on Tuesday morning to discuss the government’s response to the U.S. decision, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person briefed on the matter. The Chinese government may decline to participate in proposed trade talks with the United States later this month if the Trump administration moves forward with additional tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing Chinese officials.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - A second trial between Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) before the U.S. International Trade Commission began Monday in Washington, D.C., with the iPhone maker squaring off against the world’s biggest mobile chipmaker over whether Apple should be banned from importing several recent iPhone models to the United States. Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world’s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement. Monday’s trial is the second of two Qualcomm is pursuing against Apple at the ITC in which it is asking trade judges to ban the import of certain iPhone models containing Intel Corp (INTC.O) modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks. Import bans are rare, and Apple would have time potentially to change the design of its devices to avoid any patent infringement the courts may find. But Apple has come to rely more heavily on Intel for modem chips, with Qualcomm officials telling investors in July that its chips are not in the newest iPhone models. At the first trial, which concluded in June, a U.S. staff attorney recommended that the judge find Apple infringed at least one Qualcomm battery-saving patent and that some Intel-chipped phones should be blocked from coming into the U.S. market. But the attorney said that models with so-called 5G, the next generation of wireless network, should be allowed to keep the market for 5G chips competitive.  The ITC staff acts as a third party in such trade cases. The staff lawyers’ opinions are not binding, but judges often follow them. A decision in that case is expected later this month. Monday’s trial began concerns three patents. Two of them relate to how Intel’s modem chips handle radio signals, and one relates to how Apple’s processor chips put its iPhones to sleep. While blocking iPhones is a drastic step, Apple would have several chances to appeal the decision, including to U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama overturned a ban on some Apple iPads and iPhones that arose out of a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). The more consequential outcome of the ITC cases is for Qualcomm to test whether its patents are upheld under court scrutiny. It is suing Apple over many of the same patents in civil lawsuits that take longer to process, and the ITC case may give an early indication of how those civil lawsuits could ultimately play out.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares recovered from a weak start on Monday and closed in positive territory after a choppy session amid reports U.S. President Trump plans new 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports.  The pan-European STOXX 600 reversed early losses to rise 0.1 percent at the close, while Germany’s DAX, home to large exporters and carmakers, was down 0.2 percent.  Wall Street opened slightly lower but the dip did not change the mood across European bourses.  “I think the market has digested more or less all this rollercoaster with tariffs,” said Dimitrios Stefanopoulos, portfolio manager at AlphaTrust in Athens, adding that investors believe Trump will seek a deal ahead of U.S. mid-term elections. While the potential tariffs on China were reported to be lower than the 25 percent the administration had previously said it was considering, economists said this would still have a significant impact on markets.  “Our U.S. economists expect that even a 10 percent tariff rate will slow growth in Q4, resulting in the Fed skipping a December hike,” wrote UBS strategists.      The market was buoyed by strong defensive telecoms and utilities stocks. Cyclicals sectors, which are more sensitive to trade and economic growth, have lagged as the trade war ramped up over the past months. “If the trade war hits the economy, then defensives will be better off,” Stefanopoulos said. Several stocks shone after results on Monday, helping support risk appetite.  Forecast-beating sales from H&M (HMb.ST) sent the shares up 16.6 percent, an encouraging result for the world’s second-biggest fashion retailer whose shares are still down a third of their value from a year ago. The large amount of H&M shares being shorted by investors makes any positive news a significant boost for the stock as short sellers are “squeezed” to unravel their position.  Casino (CASP.PA) shares jumped 7.6 percent after the French supermarket’s parent Rallye, through which Jean-Charles Naouri exercises control of the firm, got a new 500 million euro credit facility. Rallye (GENC.PA) shares - which are highly shorted - jumped 13.8 percent. Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) shares rose 0.6 percent after Swiss regulator Finma said the lender had failed in its duty to combat corruption in cases linked to FIFA and Venezuelan and Brazilian state oil companies. The stock was likely supported by an interview with CEO Tidjane Thiam in Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag, in which he said Credit Suisse was aiming for an annual profit of 5 to 6 billion francs for the next two years. And on the M&A front, reinsurer Scor (SCOR.PA) rose 1.5 percent after sources told Reuters unlisted French cooperative insurer Covea was working on a new approach for Scor after its friendly 8.2 billion euro offer was rejected last month.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Russia on Monday of “cheating” on U.N. sanctions on North Korea and said Washington has “evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations.” The showdown between the United States and Russia over North Korea publicly showed cracks in the unity of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which has unanimously boosted sanctions since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Haley told the U.N. Security Council that Russia was helping North Korea illegally obtain fuel through transfers at sea, had refused to expel a North Korean who the council blacklisted last year and had pushed for changes to an independent U.N. report on sanctions violations to cover up breaches by Russians. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow had not pressured the authors of the U.N. report and blamed Haley for heightening tensions. He also pointed out that the report had determined that a specific ship-to-ship transfer of fuel by a Russian ship, cited by Haley, was not a violation. Haley said Washington has tracked some 148 cases this year of oil tankers delivering fuel to North Korea obtained through ship-to-ship transfers at sea in breach of a U.N. cap. She did not say how many transfers may have received Russian help.  “Russia must cease its violations of North Korea sanctions. It must end its concerted effort to cover up evidence of sanctions violations,” she said. “Its violations are not one-offs. They are systematic.” Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work towards denuclearisation. Haley said that while “difficult, sensitive talks” between the United States and North Korea are ongoing, it was the wrong time to start easing sanctions on Pyongyang. “It is impossible to come to an agreement if you offer nothing in return for your demands,” said Nebenzia, suggesting that a confidence-building measure could be for North and South Korea to sign a peace treaty.  Chinese U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu said Beijing implements sanctions on North Korea and warned that confronting Pyongyang would be a “dead end.” He called for progress in negotiations and urged the Security Council to remain united on the issue. “Resorting to force will bring nothing but disastrous consequences,” Ma told the council.   U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council that while there had been some recent positive developments, “there continue to be signs the DPRK (North Korea)is maintaining and developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.” Reporting by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-sanctions-un/at-u-n-u-s-accuses-russia-of-cheating-on-north-korea-sanctions-idUKKCN1LX1PD,2019-02-08,,"At U.N., U.S. accuses Russia of 'cheating' on North Korea sanctions"
2019-02-08,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M’s (HMb.ST) sales bounced back in the third quarter, helped by a new logistics system, as the world’s second biggest fashion retailer said a revamp to meet growing online and budget competition was paying off.  The Swedish company’s shares, which have lost nearly two thirds of their value since record highs in 2015, jumped as much as 13 percent in early Monday trade.  Dealers said the stock was also boosted by a report in Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper that H&M chairman and main owner Stefan Persson had talked to banks about “a massive debt financing package for further share purchases and a mega deal to take the firm private”. H&M declined to comment. H&M has seen profits shrink and inventories pile up over the past couple of years as its core budget brand has lost sales to low-price rivals like Primark and Forever 21 as well as online competitors such as ASOS (ASOS.L) and Zalando (ZALG.DE). However, the company has invested heavily in digitalisation, cut prices and launched a review of its mix of stores and brands, closing some H&M stores and expanding its newer brands more quickly. It is also working on a new H&M store concept. The firm, which will report full fiscal third-quarter figures on Sept. 27, said the steps it had taken “to face the major shift within the industry” had contributed to gradually improved sales and increased share in many markets. “We are in a transition year and see that things are starting to go in the right direction,” Nils Vinge, head of H&M investor relations, told Reuters. H&M’s local-currency sales including value added tax (VAT)rose 4 percent in the June-August period, against a mean Reuters poll forecast for a 1.9 percent increase. They were flat in the second quarter.  Reported sales excluding VAT were up 9 percent to 55.8 billion Swedish crowns ($6.2 billion), beating a forecast 5.5 percent rise to 54.0 billion crowns. Bigger rival Inditex (ITX.MC), the owner of Zara, last week reported 3 percent sales growth for the six months to the end of July, and forecast second-half like-for-like sales growth of 4-6 percent as well as improved profitability. “We think H&M has done the right thing in lowering entry point prices and investing in its offer for the long term, but expect this to lead to margin pressure in the short term,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Lars Soderfjell, portfolio manager at Alandsbanken, agreed, noting like-for-like sales were probably still down 1 to 2 percent in the quarter: “There is a headline surprise, which is enough to lift an underowned stock significantly.” H&M shares have been heavily shorted recently, which traders said exacerbated Monday’s recovery. The stock has gyrated this year as the founding Persson family has made large stock purchases, stoking rumours of buyout plans. Persson dismissed the talk in June. H&M shares have also lagged Inditex, which has been helped by a more flexible supply chain and earlier integration of online and stores with services such as click-and-collect. H&M is rolling out a new logistics system to make its supply chain faster and more efficient and better integrate its more than 4,700 stores with its website, which Vinge said had overall been helpful in the quarter. However, the retailer said the introduction of the system had hit sales and raised costs in important markets such as the United States, France, Italy and Belgium. Vinge said the logistics problems should be over after the fourth quarter. “We have solved the fundamental problems. It will have an impact on the fourth quarter as we have a backlog with the supply of new fashion garments especially in the U.S., but it will be smaller for each and every day,” he said. H&M has forecast a continued slowdown in comparable sales at its physical stores this year, and a return to growth in 2019.

2019-02-08,"KIEV (Reuters) - A volunteer medic and the man whose life he saved. A lawmaker whose Facebook post calling for protests in Kiev’s Maidan square helped bring down a president.  These are some of the characters featured in a virtual reality reconstruction of the bloodiest day in the 2013/2014 street demonstrations in Ukraine, when dozens of protesters were killed in the final moments of Viktor Yanukovich’s rule. Ahead of the fifth anniversary of the protests, a group of fourteen journalists, designers and IT engineers developed a programme allowing the user to walk through the area around Maidan square. Videos of people who were there on February 20 - the bloodiest day of violence - pop up to relate their experiences and explain the significance of particular spots. A transparent blue wall marks where Yanukovich’s forces lined up to repel the protesters.  For Alexey Furman, co-founder of New Cave Media, who covered the protests as a photojournalist, the experience of recreating the event was cathartic. “For me especially it was a very traumatic morning, as it was for hundreds of other people,” he said. “I saw people getting killed.”   “I think the project actually helped fight the PTSD that I had because I’d been on Maidan dozens of times in 2013 and 2014,” he said in an interview, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder.  He used to avoid Instytutska street, which runs on a hill down to Maidan and was the scene of much of the bloodshed,  because of the painful memories.  “But now to be honest, I come to Instytutska and go like ‘Oh, we still don’t have that 3D-model, we have to work on it.’” The team says it took around 200,000 images to build the virtual reality model, a project which was part-funded with a $20,000 grant from Google Labs. More than 100 people were killed during the protests, who came to be known locally as the ‘Heavenly Hundred”. A small strip of Instytutska was subsequently renamed after them.   From exile in Russia, Yanukovich has denied Ukrainians’ widespread belief that he ordered his special forces to open fire.  At the end of the experience, the user meets two people whom fate threw together on February 20 - a wounded protester and a medical volunteer who held his hand over the wound “for a good twenty minutes maybe even more,” said co-founder of New Cave Media Sergiy Polezhaka in an interview. “Hiding in a tiny place under the tree ... waiting for danger to calm down a little bit, to save this protester’s life, this is the iconic image from that morning for me.”  The user will also meet the journalist turned MP Mustafa Nayyem, whose Facebook post in November 2013, calling for demonstrations against Yanukovich’s decision to pull out of a deal with the European Union, triggered the Maidan revolt.  The protests in turn lit the fuse for Russia seizing and annexing Crimea in March 2014 and the outbreak of Russian-backed separatist fighting in the Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 despite a notional ceasefire.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain still have work to do to settle a range of issues in Brexit negotiations including avoiding a “hard” border in Ireland, the EU said before its negotiator Michel Barnier briefs ministers from member states. Barnier will update the ministers from the 27 countries that will remain in the EU on progress of the negotiations on Tuesday, the note said. This will precede an EU summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Wednesday and Thursday. “Some parts of the draft withdrawal agreement have already been agreed in principle by the UK and the EU negotiators, although nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” the note, seen by Reuters, said.  “There are still parts of the withdrawal agreement that require further negotiation. One of them is the issue of how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.” Both sides are keen to avoid controls on the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Irish republic, which will become the only land frontier between the UK and EU after Brexit day six months from now. However, agreement on a practical solution has remained elusive so far. The note said other outstanding issues included policing of the deal, protecting data and special local goods. “An agreement on a future relationship can only be negotiated and concluded once the UK has become a third country. However, an overall understanding on the framework for the future relationship will be set out in a political declaration accompanying... the withdrawal agreement,” it added. Visiting Madrid on Tuesday, Barnier said separately the negotiations were continuing in “spirit of good cooperation” as the International Monetary Fund warned Britain’s economy would shrink if the country left the EU without a Brexit deal. Separately, British Prime Minister Theresa May defended her Brexit strategy as the only realistic one, saying the country otherwise risked the most bruising no-deal Brexit.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British households’ confidence about their financial situation held at its highest since 2015 this month, as their concern about inflation eased and they were relaxed about prospects for the year to come, a survey showed on Monday. In contrast to business surveys — which often show worries about how Britain’s government will handle European Union withdrawal next March — household expectations for the year to come were the second-strongest since August 2016. Overall, the IHS Markit Household Finance Index held unchanged at 45.9 in September, the strongest reading since a series high of 46.2 recorded in January 2015. “UK households’ assessment of their current and future finances, despite ongoing Brexit uncertainty and sustained inflationary pressures, were relatively buoyant in September,” IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said. Separate figures from Visa, released slightly earlier on Monday, showed modest year-on-year growth in the volume of consumer spending for August, as Britons continued to make the most of an unusually warm summer. The IHS Markit data did show some increased worries about employment prospects, unlike the picture painted by official data which records the lowest level of unemployment since 1975 and a record number of job vacancies. Hayes said this was concentrated in manufacturing and was “likely reflective of the current ambiguity towards future customs arrangements with the EU”. There is, so far, no full exit agreement between Brussels and London and some rebels in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one. The IHS Markit survey showed 49 percent of people expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next six months — up by 5 percentage points on the month — and 73 percent expect an increase within a year. The BoE last raised rates in August, for only the second time since the global financial crisis, and most economists polled by Reuters do not expect rates to go up until after Brexit. The IHS Markit data was based on a survey of 1,500 adults conducted by market research company Ipsos MORI between Sept. 6 and Sept. 10.

2019-02-08,"YANGON (Reuters) - At least 100 Myanmar youth activists and journalists called for the release of two jailed Reuters journalists on Sunday, warning that the seven-year prison terms handed to the pair this month threaten the public’s right to information. Demonstrators including high-school students gathered peacefully in the heart of Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, held signs and chanted slogans denouncing the guilty verdict against the two journalists. A small contingent of police looked on as the protesters released black balloons printed with the words “Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo”. Reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case that was seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar. Thar Lun Zaung Htet, a journalist involved in organising the protest, said the verdict against reporters who were “just doing their job” would stifle reporting in Myanmar. “Losing press freedom means our democratic transition is going backwards,” he said. The verdict drew calls from senior United Nations officials, political figures including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and human rights advocates around the world for their immediate release. Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for comment on Sunday. The country’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi said at a forum in Hanoi last week the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The reporters had been sentenced for handling official secrets and “were not jailed because they were journalists”, the Nobel laureate said. On Friday six Myanmar journalist organisations published a rare statement from groups within the country criticising the country’s leader, saying they were “disappointed” with her comments. The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed rolled papers by police shortly before they were detained last December, and a police witness testified in court that they had been set up. The reporters had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists amid a military response to insurgent attacks last August. Some 700,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh fleeing the crackdown, which U.N.-mandated investigators said last month was launched by senior Myanmar generals with “genocidal intent”. Signs held by the protesters on Sunday included the messages “Murder is not a state secret” and “revealing the truth is not a crime”. One organiser, Maung Saung Kha, performed a short play where he put on a military jacket over the orange traditional Burmese jacket worn by lawmakers of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. He then rolled up a copy of the state-run daily The Mirror and began hitting members of the press with it. Activist Htet Khine Soe said the “injustice” of the case against the reporters had led him to design a T-shirt with an illustration of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo’s faces. The design was worn by some demonstrators and was also used on stickers placed around Yangon. “We need to know what’s happening in the world. We need journalists for that,” he said. “Without that, we will be stupid people without ears and eyes.” (This September 16 story has been refiled to change word in paragraph 10 to “pleaded” from “plead”) Reporting by Shoon Naing and Simon Lewis, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-journalists-protests/myanmar-youth-journalists-demonstrate-against-jailing-of-reuters-reporters-idUKKCN1LW0B3,2019-02-08,,"Myanmar youth, journalists demonstrate against jailing of Reuters reporters"
2019-02-08,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lewis Hamilton felt a mixture of elation and exhaustion after converting his stunning pole position into a victory at the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday as the Briton tightened his grip on a fifth Formula One world championship title. Once Hamilton got a clean start at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, he could control the race from the front and although he stretched his advantage over Sebastian Vettel to 40 points with six races remaining, the Briton admitted he was shattered. “I’m spent! That was a tough race, I have such great support here and we had a great start,” Hamilton said after claiming victory at the 23-turn floodlit circuit for the fourth time in his career.  “The team had never given up faith and belief in me and (team mate) Valtteri (Bottas). That was the longest race in my life and its a blessing. I’m just blessed. “It was long, but it was still fun. Driving this track is incredible, especially with these cars.” Mercedes have long regarded Singapore as a “bogey track” and were fearing the worst as Vettel’s Ferrari team and the Red Bulls dominated practice, but Hamilton drove a perfect lap to qualify first and was never really threatened in the race. “I got a great start and was able to control the pack, control the tyres and push where I needed to push,” he said after crossing the line almost nine seconds ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen with Vettel way off the pace in third. “We knew they (Ferrari) were going to be spectacular here this weekend and we knew it was going to take something quite special to beat them. “It was quite a monumental moment for us as a team. I definitely didn’t think I’d come to Singapore with 10 points more (in the lead of the title), but I’m very grateful. “The Ferraris put a good fight this weekend but I’m not sure where their pace went in the race.” Hamilton did have one minor scare on lap 38 when he got caught up behind some back markers and Verstappen closed right up behind him. He held off a brief challenge from the Dutchman and raced away once he had clear track in front of him. “I was a little but unlucky with the traffic, these guys (Haas’ Romain Grosjean and Williams’ Sergey Sirotkin) were moving and it was difficult to follow,” Hamilton added.  “Max was lucky I think, and the guys wouldn’t let me by, my heart was in my mouth but once I got past I could put the pedal down and just had to go.” The next round is in Sochi, Russia on Sept. 30, where Hamilton has won twice before and Mercedes all four races since it was added to the Formula One calendar in 2014.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The two suspects in the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal have nothing to do with Russian President Vladimir Putin or the government, a Kremlin spokesman was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying on Sunday. Britain has charged two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with attempting to murder Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal’s front door in the southern English city of Salisbury in March. “The fact is that neither Petrov nor Boshirov have nothing to do with Putin, and the Kremlin of course,” Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying.  Putin said on Wednesday that the two men were civilians and that there was “nothing special and criminal” about them. The duo appeared on Russia’s state-funded RT television station on Thursday, insisting they were innocent tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral. Britain has said the two men were Russian military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state. Russia has vehemently denied any involvement in the incidents. Skripal - a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence service - and his daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in Salisbury in March.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said he supports Prime Minister Theresa May and his opposition was not to her but to her proposals for exiting the European Union, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday.  Following a week in which reports surfaced of a plot by Johnson’s fellow eurosceptic colleagues to oust May, Johnson, bookmakers’ favourite to succeed her, was quoted as saying he wanted her Chequers Brexit plan dropped, not her. “It’s not about the leadership. It’s about the policy. It’s not about changing prime minister. It’s about chucking Chequers,” he is reported to have told the newspaper at an event in Washington D.C. in the United States.  Johnson quit as foreign secretary in July after May’s Chequers proposal, named after a country house where it was put forward. It called for the free trade of goods with the EU, with Britain accepting a “common rulebook” that would apply to those goods.  Opponents of the plan, like Johnson, say that would leave Britain subject to decisions made in Brussels without any input. Since May’s botched bet on a snap election in June 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament, she has faced persistent talk of a leadership challenge which has weakened her as she tries to clinch a Brexit deal with the EU. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29. The EU and Britain hope to clinch a deal later this year so parliaments on both sides can ratify it before Brexit. The Labour Party created another headache for May on Friday, when one of its senior lawmakers told the Financial Times that the party would vote against any Brexit deal she reaches, predicting that the lack of a viable exit from the EU would force May from office before Christmas.

2019-02-08,"MAR DEL PLATA (Reuters) - Trade and investment ministers from G20 countries meeting in Argentina said there was an “urgent need” to improve the World Trade Organization, a joint statement said on Friday.     With U.S. President Donald Trump readying tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, the ministers said they were “stepping up the dialogue” on international trade disputes, according to the statement issued at the summit. [nL2N1W017T] It did not provide any details of possible WTO reforms or how dialogue on trade was being increased. “Obviously the new tariff measures are not positive,” Argentina’s Production and Labor Minister, Dante Sica, said in a news conference at the end of the one-day meeting. “But we need to see how things evolve.” German Deputy Economy Minister Oliver Wittke said the joint declaration sent a powerful signal about the importance of strengthening WTO “especially in times of ‘America first’ and increasing global protectionism,” with next steps to follow when G20 leaders meet in Argentina at the end of November. “We have to use this momentum,” Wittke said in a statement released by the ministry after the summit. Outside the meeting, smoke filled the air in the normally tranquil seaside city of Mar Del Plata where the conference is being held. Protesters burned makeshift American flags and chanted against free trade orthodoxy and Trump’s support of Argentina’s cash-strapped President Mauricio Macri, whose fiscal belt-tightening has garnered a backlash from the country’s working-class. “We’re standing here in solidarity with the workers of Latin America. While those politicians sleep in fancy beds, communities starve because of trade and adjustment policies that hurt the most vulnerable,” protester Maralin Cornil, 30, said.  Argentina holds the G20’s rotating presidency this year, and is re-negotiating a $50 billion stand-by financing deal with the IMF, cutting its fiscal deficit targets and reducing costs to ensure it can continue paying its international debts. Trump has said he would attend the summit’s final meeting with other heads of state, in Buenos Aires on November 30.  The Trump administration has demanded that China cut its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States, end policies aimed at acquiring U.S. technologies and intellectual property, and roll back high-tech industrial subsidies. While Trump has threatened to pull the United States from the WTO, China has called for WTO reform to make the global trade system fairer and more effective.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers on Friday accused Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Chief Executive Ross McEwan of withholding information when he gave evidence to their committee in January, a charge the CEO disputes. Nicky Morgan, chair of Parliament’s Treasury Committee, said McEwan failed to disclose, when asked whether there had been any criminal activity at the state-controlled bank, that one of its former employees was under investigation by police, despite RBS (RBS.L) having been aware of this since 2017.  McEwan said in a statement he did not disclose the information because he did not consider it related to the subject under discussion with lawmakers.  The CEO was called before the Treasury Committee to discuss allegations of malpractice at RBS’s restructuring unit in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority investigated the unit for the period from 2008 to 2013 and concluded that many aspects of its culture, governance and practices were “deficient,” although there had not been criminal activity. As the police investigation into the employee related to a later period, McEwan did not consider it relevant to the committee’s inquiry. “I replied to the committee’s questions in good faith,” he said in a statement. However, Morgan said his explanation in a letter to the committee was unconvincing.  “If the committee decides to ask Mr McEwan to provide further oral evidence, it will expect him to tell the whole truth, not an edited version to suit him,” she said in a statement.  The Treasury Committee is an influential group of lawmakers. In June, the committee said it had “lost confidence” in TSB bank boss Paul Pester after an IT crisis. Under widespread pressure, Pester stepped down this month. Morgan said RBS had displayed a “pattern of defensiveness” and “failure to acknowledge mistakes” throughout its handling of the problems at the restructuring group.  “McEwan’s letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS’s culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.” Reporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-rbs-lawmakers/rbs-ceo-edited-the-truth-in-evidence-session-mps-idUKKCN1LT3H8,2019-02-08,"British lawmakers on Friday accused Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Chief Executive Ross McEwan of withholding information when he gave evidence to their committee in January, a charge the CEO disputes.",RBS CEO 'edited' the truth in evidence session - MPs
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has told Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet that the economy could expect a 16 billion pound bounce if May negotiates a Brexit deal based on her Chequers compromise plan, the Financial Times reported on Friday.  Carney told ministers that if May succeeded in negotiating a deal similar to the Chequers plan — which foresees a free trade area in goods and agriculture — there would be an economic bounce, the FT said.  The optimistic assessment of the Chequers deal came from “a pick-up in investment, more people to move jobs, and a pick-up in consumer confidence and underlying activity”, the report said citing Carney. British newspapers had earlier reported Carney told ministers Britain’s property market would crash and mortgage rates spiral up in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit, with house prices falling 35 percent over three years. The Bank of England did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Orthodox Church said on Friday it would no longer participate in structures chaired by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, deepening a row in Orthodox Christianity over the Ukrainian Church’s bid to break away from Moscow’s orbit.  The Russian Orthodox Church’s Holy Synod ruling body convened on Friday to consider how to respond as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has courted Constantinople to formally make it a self-governing body independent of Moscow.  Ukraine’s pro-Western political leaders have sought step by step to take the former Soviet republic out of Moscow’s orbit after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and a Moscow-backed insurgency broke out in eastern Ukraine. Vladimir Legoida, a Russian Church spokesman, said the Holy Synod had decided to suspend its participation in all structures chaired or co-chaired by representatives of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.  It is also suspending all services with top priests of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and will not commemorate the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in its services, Legoida wrote on social media, summarising the outcome of the meeting.  “Essentially this is a breakdown of relations. To take an example from secular life, the decision is roughly equivalent to cutting diplomatic ties,” the Russian Church’s Metropolitan Ilarion was quoted by RIA news agency as saying.  The Moscow Patriarchate is part of the Russian Orthodox Church and has a sizeable following in Ukraine.  Kiev considers it a tool for the Kremlin to wield influence, while the Moscow Patriarchate sees itself as the only legitimate Orthodox Church in Ukraine.  The Kremlin said it was following the situation closely and opposed any split in Orthodoxy, adding that the state should not intervene in church matters.  “Of course for Moscow and indeed for the entire Orthodox world the single preferable scenario is the preservation of unity of this Orthodox world,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.  The Moscow Patriarchate vies for influence in Ukraine with the Kiev Patriarchate - a branch of the Orthodox Church that broke away from Moscow in 1992 after the fall of the Soviet Union - and with other Orthodox and Catholic denominations. The Kiev Patriarchate’s leader has been sharply critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and in 2014 suggested he was possessed by Satan. The Ecumenical Patriarch does not wield the power enjoyed by the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church but is traditionally regarded as the ‘first among equals’ among the patriarchs of the self-governing Orthodox churches and also as the spiritual leader of the roughly 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The Ecumenical Patriarch, currently Bartholomew, also holds the title of Archbishop of Constantinople, the old Greek name for Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city. The city fell to the Muslim Turks in 1453 but has remained the historic seat of Orthodoxy. However Russia has long been home to the world’s largest Orthodox Christian Church.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party is set to vote against any Brexit deal reached by Prime Minister Theresa May and the lack of a viable exit from the European Union will force May from office before Christmas, a senior Labour lawmaker told the Financial Times. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and yet little is clear. There is, so far, no full exit agreement and some rebels in May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one. If rebels in her party do vote against a deal, the fate of May’s government and the whole exit process would depend on Labour because she would not command the 320 votes needed to carry parliament. Emily Thornberry, Labour’s foreign secretary in waiting, told the FT that a workable deal was “just not going to happen” under May. Labour has set six tests for supporting any Brexit deal but Thornberry said she saw little chance of any May deal satisfying them. “I can’t see them coming back with a deal that is going to meet our six tests and I can’t see them coming back with a deal that will unite the Tory party, for Heaven’s sake ,” Thornberry told the FT. Thornberry said there would need to be a national election within months given the likelihood that the prime minister would be defeated on the crucial vote on any Brexit deal. “They are not capable of governing . . . We’re either going to have a general election in the autumn or we’re going to have it in the spring,” she said. Thornberry said she wanted a national election rather than another referendum.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s property market would crash and mortgage rates spiral up in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit, with house prices falling 35 percent over three years, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told ministers, The Times newspaper reported. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 and yet little is clear. There is, so far, no full exit agreement between Brussels and London and some rebels in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one. Details of Carney’s briefing to the cabinet on Thursday  were reported by British newspapers including the Financial Times, The Times and the Guardian. The Bank of England declined to comment and the exact context of Carney’s remarks is unclear. According to The Guardian, Carney warned the ministers, including May, that the impact of a chaotic no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the 2008 financial crisis. Speaking at the Irish central bank on Friday, Carney did not directly address the media reports but reiterated that the BoE had tested banks against “very severe” scenarios including “dramatic house price falls” and much higher interest rates. “That’s not a prediction of what’s going to happen, but that (stress testing) is what we need to do in order to make sure that ... the system is ...  able to continue to lend,” he said. “Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst.” The BoE has long said its bank stress tests represent worst-case scenarios rather than forecasts of likely outcomes. Many business chiefs and investors fear politics could get in the way of Brexit, thrusting the world’s fifth largest economy into a “no-deal” divorce they say would weaken the West, spook financial markets and clog up the arteries of trade. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was due to speak by phone to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Friday.  In recent months, May’s government has stepped up planning for a no-deal Brexit and has underscored the disruption that such a move would cause to businesses and the public. Without a deal, the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the EU to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals. In one note of optimism, Carney said that if May struck a Brexit deal on the basis of her “Chequers” proposals then the economy would outperform current forecasts because it would be better than the bank’s assumed outcome, the FT said. Carney, whose term of office was this week extended until the end of January 2020 to deal with Brexit disruption, told ministers a chaotic exit would lead to a plunge in sterling that would drive up inflation and interest rates, The Times said. Further, the Bank of England would be unable to soften the crisis by cutting interest rates because of the inflationary impact of such a move, Carney told ministers, according to the Financial Times. If Carney’s worst-case scenario were to come to pass then such a crash in house prices would spell political death for any prime minister, though there was scepticism about the reports from his opponents and some economists. “Carney has made himself a laughing stock in the City with such an outrageous warning,” said Richard Tice, a Brexit supporter who is co chair of the “Leave Means Leave” group. “Carney is a political central banker who is talking down the country and talking down Brexit in the hope that people accept a really bad Brexit deal - May’s Chequers deal.” Carney, sometimes nicknamed the “unreliable boyfriend” due to mixed signals about the future path of interest rates, gained respect from some investors for his actions to calm markets in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote. Britain’s central bank stress-tested lenders against a 33 percent house price fall last year and some economists questioned whether Carney’s comments to ministers had been reported accurately. “Carney reported comments on UK house prices not remotely credible BUT I also think highly unlikely they were made as reported,” said Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon merchant bank in London. UK house prices fell 19 percent peak to trough during the 2008 financial crisis but then rose by 38 percent from their low in March 2009 to June 2016, the month of the shock Brexit referendum result.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Moscow on Thursday of seeking to cover up breaches of U.N. sanctions on North Korea by Russians after it pushed for changes to an independent report on sanctions violations.  The U.N. Security Council will meet on Monday over the implementation of sanctions on North Korea at the request of Washington, the U.S. mission to the United Nations said.  The report, submitted to the Security Council’s North Korea sanctions committee last month, said Pyongyang had not stopped its nuclear and missile programs and was violating U.N. sanctions on exports. Diplomats said Russia pressured the independent sanctions monitors to amend the report. The Security Council has to agree by consensus on whether to publish the report and the United States objected to releasing the amended document.  “Russia can’t be allowed to edit and obstruct independent U.N. reports on North Korea sanctions just because they don’t like what they say. Period,” Haley said in a statement. “The full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions remains mandatory for all member states – including Russia.” The Russian mission to the United Nations and the chair of the independent panel of U.N. sanctions monitors did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The amended report removed some references to Russians accused of breaching sanctions on North Korea, said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work towards denuclearisation. The United States and other council members have said there must be strict enforcement of sanctions until Pyongyang acts.     Washington on Thursday imposed sanctions on a China-based tech firm, its North Korean chief executive and a Russian subsidiary, accusing them of moving illicit funding to North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions.

2019-02-08,"NEW BERN, N.C. (Reuters) - Junia MacDaniel just wants to get home to her Chihuahuas.  All 14 of them are back in the double-wide trailer MacDaniel shares with her husband in New Bern, North Carolina. The MacDaniels are seeking shelter from the monster storm Hurricane Florence, and they decided it was best to leave their little dogs behind. They were among 12,000 North Carolinians staying in shelters after being displaced by the slow-moving storm that is expected to bring powerful storm surges and dozens of inches of rain to the eastern part of the state.  “This has been a really large evacuation and sheltering operation, probably the largest we’ve done, so that has not been an easy lift. I think it’s working,” said Keith Acree of North Carolina’s Department of Emergency Management.     North Carolina began feeling the effects of Florence’s wind and heavy rain on Thursday afternoon but the storm was not expected to make landfall until late night or early on Friday.     Avis Miner, 57, brought her friend and five grandchildren to a shelter in Washington, about 100 miles east of Raleigh, after leaving their trailer home in Aurora. She worried that if they stayed home “we’d be blown away.” In shelters on Thursday, people crowded on cots, inflatable mattresses and blankets on the floors and in hallways of gymnasiums, clustering in corners to talk and outside to smoke. More than 200 people had arrived at Wilmington’s Trask Middle School by Wednesday afternoon, along with 20 dogs, nine cats and a bird. More sought safety at another shelter in the city.  “It wasn’t safe,” said David Sullivan, a 76-year-old retired tow boat captain who evacuated his downtown Wilmington apartment. “I just figured come here and be safe.” Debbie Green, director of social services for Pamlico County, said she is always worried about people being too isolated and vulnerable to make it to a shelter and, she said, “There are always people that are not willing to leave.” Still, the shelter she is overseeing in Grantsboro, about 130 miles east of Raleigh, was 81 percent full by noon on Thursday and Green expected that number to swell. “People will come in the middle of a storm,” she said. MacDaniel, who has sat out previous storms, said everyone told her that Florence would be different.  “All the other storms we stayed put. But they told us this storm was the doozy,” MacDaniel said. “We have never flooded before but we didn’t really want to take no chances.” Now, she’s counting the hours until she can return home to her Chihuahuas.  “When it clears up just a little bit, momma’s going home ... I just miss my dogs.” Additional reporting By Ernest Scheyder in Wilmington, North Carolina; Editing by Frank McGurty, Toni Reinhold",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-storm-florence-shelters/gimme-shelter-north-carolinians-take-refuge-from-florences-fury-idUKKCN1LU02M,2019-02-08,,Gimme shelter - North Carolinians take refuge from Florence's fury
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 16 U.S. lawmakers asked Alphabet Inc’s Google on Thursday if it would comply with China’s internet censorship and surveillance policies should it re-enter the Chinese search engine market. The questioning added to the pressure on Google to disclose precautions it would take to protect the safety of its users if Chinese regulators allow its search engine to operate. More than 1,000 Google employees, six U.S. senators and at least fourteen human rights groups have written to the company expressing concern about its China ambitions. On Thursday, Jack Poulson, a research scientist who had worked for Google for more than two years, said he resigned because he felt the company was not honouring its commitment to human rights norms in designing the search app.  Poulson told Reuters that executives would not specify to him where the company would draw the line on agreeing to Chinese demands.  “Unfortunately, the virtually unanimous response over the course of three very vocal weeks of escalation was: ‘I don’t know either,’” Poulson said.  He was among a handful who resigned, he told the Intercept online publication, which first reported on his action. Google declined to comment directly on the lawmakers’ letter or the resignations but said in a statement it had been “investing for many years to help Chinese users” and described its “work on search” for China as “exploratory” and “not close to launching.” Reuters reported last month that Google planned to seek government clearance to provide a version of its search engine in China that blocks some websites and search terms. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, said in their letter on Thursday they had “serious concerns” about the potential step. The letter asked if Google would “ensure that individual Chinese citizens or foreigners living in China, including Americans, will not be surveilled or targeted through Google applications.”  Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and signer of the letter, wrote on Twitter that “Google should not be helping China crack down on free speech and political dissent.” Other signers include Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. The company could face questions about China when it testifies on privacy issues before a Senate panel on Sept. 26.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said on Tuesday that Google would be invited to testify on a number of issues. He wrote on Twitter that Google had worked with China and Russia on censorship but no longer wanted to do a technology deal with the U.S. Defense Department. Google’s main search platform has been blocked in China since 2010, but it has been attempting to make new inroads into the world’s largest smartphone market by users.  Google’s re-entry is not guaranteed as China has stepped up scrutiny of business dealings involving U.S. tech firms including Facebook Inc and Apple Inc amid intensifying trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair faces a one-day walkout by cabin crew across five countries on Sept. 28 as unions step up pressure on Europe’s biggest budget airline to accept local contracts. The threatened strike in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain is aimed at pressuring shareholders set to meet on Sept. 20 to address Ryanair’s labor agreements, union officials said on Thursday. They said unions would strike once a month until their demands are met. “It is time the company accepted to employ us with local contracts under local conditions in accordance with local law,” Didier Lebbe, a spokesman for the CNE union in Belgium, told a news conference in Brussels. “We need shareholders to change Ryanair’s employment model,” he said, and called for European political mediation.  Ryanair employs staff across Europe under Irish contracts, but some unions want the ability to negotiate terms under the employment laws of their own country. Belgian unions forecast most flights out of Ryanair’s two airports in Belgium will be canceled, challenging the company’s pledge to minimize disruptions. Some pilots in Italy will also join the industrial action on the day, the Uiltrasporti union said. A spokesman for Ryanair said “there will be no pilot strike in Italy”, adding that Ryanair had already signed a collective labor agreement with the ANPAC union and does not recognize the “small” Uiltrasporti union. Unions representing three of the airline’s Italy-based cabin crews said in a statement on Thursday they had agreed in principle to a three-year collective labor agreement. Fit Cisl, Anpac and Anpav unions signed Thursday’s agreement, but Uiltrasporti was not mentioned. Ryanair has struggled to curb an industrial relations revolt in recent months and was forced to cancel 150 of its 400 German flights on Wednesday after a walkout by pilots and crew. Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said in response that the airline, which flies some 2,500 flights a day, was willing to accept strikes if that was the cost of defending its low-cost business model. Amid management’s clashes with unions, shares in Ryanair have fallen 13 percent this year. Unions across the five countries set to walk out on Sep. 28 told a news conference on Thursday that the strike could be averted if shareholders were able to force change to labor contracts at their annual meeting on Sept. 20. “Shareholders need to take responsibility and change the management, at least in human resources,” CNE’s Lebbe said. Ryanair said that even if there is a strike, it expects a significant majority of its cabin crew in Spain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal to work normally, as they have during previous strikes. “As we demonstrated in Germany yesterday, Ryanair will pre-advise customers of a small number of flight cancellations,” Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement.  Ryanair suffered its worst ever strikes this summer after slow progress in negotiating collective labor agreements with pilots and cabin crew.  In August it reached a deal with striking Irish pilots, but unions representing pilots and cabin crew in Germany have threatened further walkouts if Ryanair does not improve offers on terms and pay.

2019-02-08," (Corrects paragraph 3 to show interceptions were for all NATO airspace in 2016, not just the Baltics) By Robin Emmott ON BOARD A BELGIAN AIR FORCE PLANE (Reuters) - British, French and German fighter jets simulated flight interceptions over Western Europe on Wednesday as part of NATO drills to deter Russian planes from entering allied airspace and to showcase European efforts to integrate their air defences. Fighter pilots carrying air-to-air missiles from 10 NATO nations took turns to simulate the interception of a Belgian air force transport plane en route to Spain, performing visual inspections of the aircraft’s status by hovering off the wings at speeds of 900 km/hour (560 mph). Some 60 NATO jets, mainly from European allies, are on alert to defend alliance airspace, as NATO deals with a dramatic increase in Russian air activity on its borders since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, with a record 870 interceptions across NATO airspace in 2016. This month, Moscow is holding its largest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union, with some 1,000 aircraft. “NATO is relevant. This is not theoretical,” said Spanish Air Force Lieutenant General Ruben Garcia Servert on board the Belgian military transport plane, as Italian Eurofighters flew close to the cockpit to simulate interceptions. They later included British Typhoons and French Mirages. “We have not always been successful in showing the taxpayer that we have the means and the capabilities to protect the population,” he told Reuters during a rare mid-air public display of flight interceptions. European allies hope such displays highlight how their air forces are defending Europe in the face of sharp criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who at a summit in July railed against Europeans for not spending enough on defence and ports. Able to divert, force to land or potentially even shoot down combat aircraft, NATO says its so-called air policing is not directed at Russia. But showdowns between rival warplanes in the Baltic and Black Sea are intensifying. Two U.S. jets escorted two Russian bombers over the Arctic Ocean on Sept. 7 in the latest incident, while Russia has scrambled fighter jets to intercept nuclear-capable U.S. bombers in interceptions that have echoes of the Cold War. Analysts warn that any collisions in the air over the Mediterranean, Baltic or Black Sea could risk the start of a wider conflict with Russia.  Both sides accuse the other of dangerous pilot behaviour, but NATO says Russian warplanes regularly fly without respecting international safety norms, such as responding to air traffic control and requests to identify themselves. Russia says all its flights are conducted in accordance with international law. “We have seen aircraft coming to our borders without flight plans, without any kind of controls ... safety regulations, entering into our area,” Garcia Severt said.  “We have seen frequent activities in the Black Sea, but not only, sometimes we have seen aircraft flying around Europe,” he said, referring to Russian bombers off Portugal’s coast. NATO will hold its biggest exercise since 2002 in October and November in Norway, called Trident Juncture, and involving non-NATO Finland and Sweden, with more than 40,000 troops.  While tensions with Russia have already prompted NATO to deploy multinational land battalions in Poland and the Baltics, NATO is also pushing to integrate its air forces, despite political resistance over issues of sovereignty. Under an agreement being negotiated, individual NATO countries’ air forces would defend each other’s airspaces, regardless of the country they are in, under a “single sky” concept that could see Portuguese planes defending Spanish airspace, for example.  Today, each nation defends its own airspace, unless, as in the case of the Baltics, it does not have fighter planes.

2019-02-08,"PYONGYANG (Reuters) - Packed into Pyongyang’s giant stadium this week with thousands of other tourists, Australian Mitchell Hamilton marvelled at the return of North Korea’s “Mass Games,” a huge pageant that has produced some of the most iconic images of the isolated country. “My thought sitting there was that it was a show fit for a god,” Hamilton told Reuters on Tuesday atop the Juche Tower, a 560-foot (170-metre) obelisk in downtown Pyongyang. “You can’t help but get swept up in the spectacle.” A sobering reminder of the power of the state in North Korea, however, was the realisation that many of the thousands of performers on the field were young children. “What brought me back down to earth was when the kids ran out,” Hamilton said, leaning in to speak out of ear shot of the North Korean guides and minders who were accompanying both tourists and media. “It reminded me where I am.” North Korea’s first Mass Games in five years has provided a chance for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to raise foreign currency, at a time when tourism remains one of the few remaining reliable sources of income amid tough U.N. sanctions. Since a reduction in tensions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme this year, tour operators say tourism has increased.  Exact numbers are not available, but tour operators say flights and accommodation in Pyongyang booked up so fast after the Mass Games were announced that North Korean authorities put holds on some tour groups from China. Thousands of children participate in the performances, either as dancers or as one of the “human pixels” who use coloured flipbooks to form an ever-changing backdrop of images and slogans. That practice has been criticized by rights groups as tantamount to forced child labour, and testimonies collected by defector groups describe harsh training regimes. For this month’s Mass Games, elementary, middle and high school practiced from early morning until late at night, the defector-run website Daily NK said citing an unnamed source.  Past reports from Daily NK describe students taking bladder infection medicine due to the long hours of sitting required, while training in all weather for months. Beyond the sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme, North Korea is an impoverished state, where some 40 percent of the population, or more than 10 million people, need humanitarian assistance and about 20 percent of children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. estimates. Under Kim’s one-man rule, the country has also been accused of widespread human rights abuses, with a U.N. report last year estimating between 80,000 and 120,000 people are held in prison camps. Still, the Mass Games performances, expected to run into early October, are a major drawcard for tourists, most of whom come from China.     “I think I’ve wanted it for like five years, or even more,” Tia Nousiainen from Finland told Reuters as she visited tourist sites in Pyongyang. “Since I saw the first mass games on the TV or the internet, I wanted to see them by myself. And every year, I’ve been asking the travel agency if they are arranging them, and this year, I got the answer that ‘yes,’ they are arranging it.” Personally attended by Kim, Sunday’s premiere at the stadium North Korea says can hold 150,000 featured new high-tech displays by glowing drone formations, lasers, and light projections. Thousands of dancers, gymnasts, martial artists and singers acted out scenes addressing familiar themes from North Korean propaganda.  The show, however, dropped most of the typical anti-American themes, instead focusing on Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic engagement with international leaders. Joel Goh, a visitor from Singapore, said the Mass Games made him want to see for himself the country behind so many of the headlines. “It was a very special experience… I thought it was as good as any other show I’ve seen,” he said, adding that the scenes of Kim embracing South Korean President Moon Jae-in at their first summit in April were “quite moving.” “We’ve come to realize it’s a bit different from what we hear outside,” Goh said of North Korea. “It’s an amazing place. I’m not regretting my trip at all.” Reporting by Josh Smith in PYONGYANG; Additional reporting by Joyce Lee in SEOUL.

2019-02-08,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented step that left Prime Minister Viktor Orban isolated from powerful allies. Hungary said it would seek legal ways to challenge the 448-197 vote it described as “petty revenge”. Delivering more than the two-thirds majority required as many of Orban’s allies in the conservative party deserted him, the vote, however, has little chance of ending up with the ultimate penalty of Hungary being suspended from voting in the EU. If nothing else, its Polish ally would veto that. But the 197 votes cast against the parliament’s first bid to launch the punitive process of the EU treaty’s Article 7 highlighted the substantial minority of European opinion who see Orban as a crusader for the rights of nation states and ethnic majorities against rules of civic behaviour agreed in Brussels. Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban, once a campaigner against Hungary’s Soviet Communist overlords, has used his parliamentary majority to pressure courts, media and non-government groups in ways his opponents say breach EU rules.  He has also led opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others who want Europe to take in more Muslim refugees. “Today’s European Parliament decision was nothing else but a petty revenge of pro-immigration politicians against Hungary,” Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference in Budapest. “The decision was made in a fraudulent way, and contrary to relevant rules in European treaties.” As abstaining votes had not been counted, he said that changed the outcome of the vote. With Britain about to leave the bloc altogether in March and Europeans voting in European Parliament elections in May, the row over Hungary — and Poland, which faces a similar sanctions procedure launched by the executive European Commission in 2017 — highlights tensions between nationalist and federalist camps. In France, where President Emmanuel Macron is campaigning for next year’s European elections in direct opposition to Orban, an Elysee source said the vote “was a good signal”. Judith Sargentini, the Dutch Greens lawmaker who steered the proposal through, said after the historic vote: “Viktor Orban’s government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash.  “Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers,” she said. “The Hungarian people deserve better.”  Sargentini praised support for her motion from much of Orban’s European People’s Party in the chamber — the EPP includes Merkel’s Christian Democrats — and she called on governments in the EU’s Council to now take the unprecedented step of sanctioning a fellow member. Orban had flown to Strasbourg personally on Tuesday to intervene in the debate, delivering a fiery speech that he would not give in to “blackmail” and describing the motion as an insult to Hungarians. But his failure to offer any compromise cost him support within the EPP, party officials said.  The group may now consider whether to suspend Orban’s Fidesz party. Szijjarto said Fidesz was committed to staying in the EPP but would seek ways to transform its stance from the inside. All the applause for the Hungarian leader on Tuesday came from the far right of the chamber, notably among supporters of France’s Marine Le Pen and the UK Independence Party. Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party, called the vote - which also weighed on Hungarian assets - “a bloody shame”.  “Orban is a hero,” he said. “He closed the borders for Islamic fortune seekers. He protects his citizens against terror and defends the identity of his country.” The Commission has preferred to pressure Budapest through standard legal powers, but the head of the EU executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, also an EPP member, said he would have voted for the move if he were a lawmaker.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday promised to strengthen the army and supply it with new generation weapons, as he travelled to watch Russia’s biggest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union. The Vostok-2018 (East-2018) drills taking place in eastern Siberia close to the border with China involve 300,000 Russian troops as well as joint exercises with the Chinese army.  “This is the first time our army and fleet have undergone such a difficult and large-scale test,” Putin said in comments published on the Kremlin website.  The exercises, that involve over a thousand military aircraft as well as up to 36,000 tanks, come amid tense relations between Russia and the West that have fallen to a post-Cold War low. Addressing a gathering of the soldiers, Putin said Russia was a peaceful country ready for cooperation with any state interested in partnership, but that it was a soldier’s duty to be ready to defend his country and its allies.  “Therefore we are going to further strengthen our armed forces, supply them with the latest generations of weapons and equipment, develop international military partnership,” Putin said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned xenophobic attacks and the use of Nazi slogans in a robust speech to parliament on Wednesday after the most violent far-right demonstrations in decades exposed deep divisions in the country. In an unusually rowdy session in the Bundestag (lower house) later, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) deputies stormed out of the chamber after a Social Democrat (SPD) accused them of being “unsavory” right-wing radicals.    Protests by right-wing militants in the eastern city of Chemnitz two weeks ago after the fatal stabbing of a German blamed on two migrants have reignited a fierce debate about Merkel’s 2015 decision to let in more than a million refugees. “There is no excuse or reason for hunting people down, using violence and Nazi slogans, showing hostility to people who look different, who have a Jewish restaurant, for attacks on police officers,” Merkel told the Bundestag. “We will not allow whole groups in our society to be quietly excluded,” she said, adding that Jews, Muslims, Christians and atheists all belong in German society, and stressing that human dignity was paramount. Before Merkel took the podium, the head of the AfD group in the Bundestag said Germany’s “domestic peace” was at risk. “As disgusting as Hitler salutes are, I would like to remind you that the really serious event in Chemnitz was the bloody deed (committed) by two asylum seekers,” said Alexander Gauland.  He accused Merkel of spreading fake news about the protests and supported Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV intelligence agency who is under fire for questioning whether video footage showing rightist gangs hounding migrants were real. “The truth is, there was no hunting down of people in Chemnitz... The citizens who demonstrated were criminalised,” said Gauland.  “Mrs Chancellor, you have nothing more to offer the people of this country than obstinacy, dogmatism and insults. Barricade yourself up in the chancellery away from reality!” After Maassen took questions from a parliamentary committee behind closed doors about his comments on event in Chemnitz, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said he saw no reason to dismiss the BfV chief. But the SPD said that after examining a BfV report on the violence and hearing Maassen’s defence of his disputed views that he should resign, saying it remained unconvinced he was the right person to lead the agency. The centre-left SPD is the junior member of Merkel’s conservative-led coalition. The AfD, some of whose members joined right-wing militants in the Chemnitz marches, is the third biggest party in Germany. Its lawmakers’ presence in parliament, which they entered after the 2017 election, has generated a more confrontational climate. Senior Social Democrat Johannes Kahrs launched a verbal attack on the AfD: “Right wing radicals in parliament are unsavory. Hate makes you ugly - look in the mirror!” At that, all AfD deputies stood up and left the chamber. In a statement, the party said Kahrs had compared them to Nazis and described his insults as “unacceptable”. Earlier, former Social Democratic leader Martin Schulz also condemned the AfD, ending up by saying, “You belong on the dungheap of history,” to loud applause.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron’s government plans to spend 8 billion euros (7.1 billion pounds) to tackle poverty, its spokesman said in a newspaper interview released on Wednesday. Macron, who has come under fire as a president of the rich after implementing tax cuts for the wealthy and for companies, is set to outline his anti-poverty strategy on Thursday. “Our poverty plan is worth 8 billion euros, spread over four years,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told the free newspaper 20 Minutes. “It’s a very strong political choice at a time when we are paying very close attention to public spending.” The INSEE statistics agency estimates that in 2016 some 8.8 million people in France were living in poverty, defined as 60 percent of the median income. That was equivalent to 14 percent of the population. Griveaux did not say whether the money would come from fresh funds or existing cash reallocated from other budgets. Macron’s poverty plan, which has already been delayed once, has been much anticipated as he seeks to convince voters that his reform agenda does not benefit only the wealthy and businesses. Griveaux did not specify how the money would be spent but said the government planned several measures to get people either back to work or into better jobs. While various welfare programmes have been expanded over the last two decades, Griveaux said they had failed to root out the causes of poverty.

2019-02-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has summoned senior Catholic bishops from around the world to the Vatican to discuss the protection of minors, in his latest attempt to come to grips with a spreading sexual abuse crisis. The heads of the national Catholic bishops’ conferences will meet with Francis from Feb. 21-24, a Vatican spokeswoman said. The announcement came at the end of a three-day meeting of the “C-9”, a group of nine cardinals from around the world who members meet about four times a year to advise the pope. The spokeswoman said the sexual abuse crisis was a main topic at the meeting, which six of the members attended. The Catholic Church is facing sexual abuse scandals in the United States, Chile, Australia and Germany, among others. Der Spiegel magazine reported on Wednesday that a study commissioned by the German Bishops’ Conference had revealed that 1,670 clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors, mostly males, in Germany over a 70-year period. In the United States, a Grand Jury has found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania sexually abused minors over a similar period. Francis meets on Thursday with U.S. Church leaders to discuss that report as well as a scandal involving a former American cardinal and demands from an Italian archbishop, Carlo Maria Viganò, that the pontiff step down over that case. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. bishops’ conference, asked for the meeting after Viganò last month accused the pope of knowing for years about sexual misconduct by former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick and doing nothing about it.. Viganò said he had told Francis soon after the pontiff’s election in 2013 that McCarrick, former archbishop of Washington D.C., had engaged in sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians.  McCarrick resigned in July over separate allegations - which U.S. Church officials said were “credible and substantiated” - that he had abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago. McCarrick, whom the pope ordered to live a life of seclusion and penitence, has said he has “absolutely no recollection” of such an incident. He has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the adult seminarians.  Hours after Viganò’s statement was published, Francis told reporters that he would “not say a word” about it because it “speaks for itself”. However, the Vatican is now preparing a response. Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who succeeded McCarrick as archbishop of Washington D.C., told priests on Tuesday that he would travel to Rome to discuss his future with the pope. Wuerl, 77, who was bishop of Pittsburgh between 1988 and 2006, has been under scrutiny over his handling of sexual abuse cases during the period addressed by the Pennsylvania Grand Jury. Wuerl has defended his overall record in Pittsburgh, but has also been accused of knowing about sexual misconduct by McCarrick, which he denies.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A new Bank of England regulator said she had “really terrible” memories of her time at Switzerland’s UBS during the financial crisis and would resist any attempt to loosen financial regulations brought in since. Jill May joined the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Committee (PRC), which regulates banks, in July and was a managing director at UBS between 2001 and 2012, during which it required three bailouts from the Swiss government. “Having lived through the financial crisis — and believe me it was a deeply shaming and searing experience — I would always be in favor of ensuring the highest possible global financial standards,” she told British legislators. “I have really terrible memories,” she added, saying she recalled Swiss pensioners who had lost money on UBS shares hurling eggs at the bank’s staff. More recently May served on a British government body which approves company takeovers. Her term at the BoE will last until July 2021. She said she was relatively optimistic about the prospects for Britain’s financial industry after Brexit and that most firms were well prepared, but the BoE would need to be prepared for all eventualities. Also speaking to parliament’s Treasury Committee was another new PRC appointee, London School of Economics law professor Julia Black, who starts her three-year term at the central bank on Nov. 30. Black highlighted as potential concerns the rapid developments in consumer-facing financial technology and the extent to which detailed information provided to regulators genuinely reflected the risks faced by financial institutions. “All financial services firms face risks arising from the highly febrile national and international political environment,” she said in written evidence. “This includes not only Brexit, but the growing disputes in global trade and the unpredictable nature of various countries’ foreign policies.” Reporting by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe-pra/new-boe-regulator-has-really-terrible-memories-of-2008-crisis-idUKKCN1LS2DY,2019-02-08,,New BoE regulator has 'really terrible memories' of 2008 crisis

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has recommended changes to banking supervision following a series of high-profile money laundering cases but stopped short of setting up a new agency to tackle financial crime as called for by the European Central Bank.  The move comes after Dutch giant ING last week admitted it had failed for years to prevent money laundering, the latest in a string of incidents involving banks in Malta, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, Spain and Luxembourg. The European Banking Authority (EBA) has for a long time said it has neither enough powers nor staff to combat money laundering at banks in the 28 European Union states.     EU officials said the EBA should add 10 money laundering officials to its current count of just 2 out of its nearly 170 staff. It will also have a bigger say on the activities of bloc’s national banking supervisors, and could force investigations into banks suspected of breaching money laundering rules.  National supervisors would effectively be subject to money laundering “stress tests” on their application of the rules, a Commission official said, adding that the EBA would have to publish the results.  Local authorities two years ago took little action against a Maltese lender suspected of money laundering.  The EBA only opened an investigation on the Maltese supervisory system after extensive media pressure and in July said there were “general and systematic shortcomings” in the island’s application of EU anti-money-laundering rules. The Commission’s proposal, which needs the approval of EU states and lawmakers, comes close to the end of its five-year mandate and ahead of European Parliament elections in May.  As a result, EU regulators and finance ministers do not envisage any concrete action before next year. Last week the ECB called for the establishment of a single agency to tackle money laundering in Europe but the proposal does not include this bolder measure which would allow centralised supervision similar to that exercised by the central bank over the financial stability of euro zone banks. The Commission also stopped short of proposing to harmonise existing rules to investigate and punish money laundering, which currently give broad discretion to member states, causing what EU regulators called “gaps” in the bloc’s legal framework. States are for instance not obliged to name banks that are found to have money laundering failings, despite international guidelines saying the negative publicity surrounding the imposition of fines is one of the most effective tools in combating financial crime.  Judicial sources told Reuters last year that Luxembourg had imposed a fine of 3.8 million euros on a branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in the Grand Duchy after an investigation in Spain exposed wrongdoings. But Luxembourg is still declining to name the bank.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order as soon as Wednesday that will slap sanctions on any foreign companies or people who interfere in U.S. elections, based on intelligence agency findings, two sources familiar with the matter said. Trump’s decision coincides with intelligence agencies, military and law enforcement preparing to defend the Nov. 6 congressional elections from predicted foreign attacks even as Trump derides a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. The White House declined to comment. Sanction targets could include individual people or entire companies accused of interfering in U.S. elections by cyber attacks or other means, a U.S. official told Reuters.  “The administration is keen to set a new norm in cyberspace,” the official said. “This is a first step in stating boundaries and publicly announcing our response for bad behaviour.”  The order represents the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to look tough on election security before voting in November that will decide whether Trump’s Republican Party can keep its majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. The order will put a range of agencies in charge of deciding if meddling occurred, led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and including the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Homeland Security Department, the sources said. Based on a recent draft of the order reviewed by the U.S. official, it will require any federal agency aware of election interference by foreigners to take the information to the office of Director of National Intelligence. Election interference will be defined in the order as hacking attempts against “election infrastructure,” and efforts to sway public opinion through coordinated digital propaganda or systematic leaks of private political information. U.S. intelligence officials have found that in the campaign leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russian hackers breached the Democratic National Committee and leaked confidential information. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal previously reported on earlier drafts of the executive order.      Congress has been purposefully left out of the executive order drafting process, the official said, because the administration wants to preempt legislation being considered in the House and Senate that addresses similar issues. U.S. lawmakers have introduced various pieces of Russia-related legislation, including the “Deter Act,” to set out punishments for election meddling, and what one lawmaker called a sanctions bill “from hell” to punish Moscow for cyber crime and its activities in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere.  Both Democrats and Republicans are looking to redress what they consider Trump’s weak stance on accusations of Russian interference in 2016 when he met Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in July. Trump stunned the world by accepting Putin’s denials over the word of his own intelligence agencies. Congress passed a Russia sanctions bill more than a year ago. Some lawmakers - including some Republicans as well as Democrats - have chafed at what they saw as the administration’s reluctance to implement it. Trump signed the bill only after Congress passed it with huge majorities. Acting on that law, the U.S. Treasury imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians, striking at allies of Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow.

2019-02-08,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that North Korea was taking a lot of steps towards denuclearising the Korean Peninsula but Washington was not responding and was making endless demands for full disarmament instead. Washington and Pyongyang have been discussing North Korea’s nuclear programme since their leaders met in Singapore in June,  though that summit’s outcome was criticised for being short on details about how and whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was willing to give up weapons that threaten the United States.  Putin, speaking at an economic forum in the Russian port city of Vladivostok, said Pyongyang had taken positive steps and was now waiting for a response. He said it was counter-productive if one side did a lot and the other did nothing. “If North Korea does something towards denuclearisation it expects reciprocal steps and not endless demands for full disarmament,” said Putin. Putin said it was also important that North Korea received international guarantees about its own security and said Kim Jong Un was welcome to visit Russia at any time that was convenient for him.

Kulsoom Nawaz Sharif, 68, died after months in a coma. She was diagnosed with lymphoma last year, barely a month after Nawaz Sharif was removed from office by the Supreme Court, which ordered him to face trial in an anti-corruption court.  “The wife of Mian Nawaz Sharif is no more among us. May God rest her in peace,” Shehbaz Sharif, the former prime minister’s brother, said on Twitter. New Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a statement offering condolences, and said the government “as per law” would provide assistance to the family. “She was a courageous woman of great dignity and confronted her disease with fortitude,” Khan said on Twitter. Nawaz Sharif was in London with Kulsoom earlier this year when the anti-graft court handed him a 10-year jail term and sentenced his presumed political heir, Maryam, to seven years in prison over the purchase of luxury flats in London in the 1990s. The father and daughter left her bedside to return to Pakistan to rally their followers ahead of July 25 elections, which their party lost to the former cricket star Imran Khan’s party. Both were arrested on arrival and have been imprisoned since. Kulsoom Sharif was briefly a member of parliament from September 2017 to July 2018 when she won her husband’s former seat in a by-election after the Supreme Court disqualified him. Three-time-premier Sharif, who was removed from office in each of his elected terms, has maintained that his most recent ousting in July 2017 and subsequent conviction were part of a plot against him by the powerful military and the judiciary. The army has repeatedly denied any interference in politics, while the courts insist justice is carried out impartially. Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa expressed “grief and heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family”, said the official military spokesman. Up until her husband’s ousting last year, Kulsoom Sharif had never been a politician, but she memorably led protests after a 1999 military coup that ended a previous Sharif administration. With her husband jailed by General Pervez Musharraf, she broke through a police barricade that had been set up around her home in Lahore in July 2000 in an attempt to prevent her from leading a public rally. She managed to get away in a car, which was chased by the police for several miles. When police finally surrounded the car, she locked herself in for several hours in a standoff until police finally towed the vehicle away. The Musharraf regime eventually allowed Nawaz and Kulsoom Sharif to leave the country, and they spent years in exile until returning in 2007 to contest new elections after Musharraf stepped down in the face of mass protests.

2019-02-08,"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told the European Parliament on Tuesday he would not bow to EU “blackmail” as lawmakers prepared to vote on whether to punish Budapest for eroding democracy. Some momentum might have been building against Orban during the evening ahead of the Wednesday vote. But it was still unclear whether the 751-strong European Parliament would be able to muster the two-thirds majority needed to pass the censure motion, which accuses Hungary of breaching core EU values.  Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban has pressured Hungary’s courts, media and non-governmental groups, as well as refusing to take in asylum seekers arriving in Europe. Though the European Union has often protested, it has largely failed to stop what his critics decry as his growing authoritarianism. If approved, the motion would go to the EU’s national leaders, theoretically opening the way for sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary’s voting rights in the bloc.  But in practice that is sure to be blocked by Orban’s ally, the nationalist government in Poland that is locked in its own dispute with the EU over undercutting the rule of law. Directly addressing EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, Orban cast Wednesday’s vote as an act of revenge for his refusal to host refugees who have fled to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa since 2015. “Hungary shall not bow to blackmail,” said Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party was re-elected with a landslide majority last April.  “Hungary shall continue to defend its borders, stop illegal immigration and defend its rights – against you, too, if necessary,” he said, drawing applause from the eurosceptic, far-right lawmakers in the assembly. Orban has said the mostly Muslim refugees pose an existential threat to Europe’s Christian civilisation. He has also waged a vociferous campaign against Hungarian-born, Jewish American billionaire philanthropist George Soros and the liberal causes he backs in formerly-communist eastern Europe. The motion against Orban’s Hungary goes well beyond the migration issue. The deputy head of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, said on Tuesday he shared its authors’ concerns about “fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma and the independence of the judiciary” in Hungary under Orban. Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a leading liberal, said Hungary would never have been allowed to join the EU in 2004 had it been back then as it has now become under Orban. The group of leftists and greens in the assembly said “Orban’s authoritarian moves must be curbed”. Dutch lawmaker Sophie in ‘t Veld urged the EU to consider cutting generous subsidies to Hungary, asking: “Why are we giving Mr Orban 87 million euros a week in order to destroy the European Union?”  Even Orban’s fellow migration hardliner, Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, unexpectedly said his party’s five European lawmakers would vote against Budapest. “We believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy,” Kurz told ORF television. Greek members of the group were planning to do the same. But Italy’s anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said his League party’s six EU lawmakers would support Orban. The parties of Kurz and Orban both belong to the biggest faction in the European Parliament, the conservative European People’s Party (EPP), which also includes lawmakers from the party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The EPP membership has muted EU reaction to Orban’s policies over the years and the big question mark is what the group’s 217 members will now do. The vote represents a particular challenge for EPP’s German head Manfred Weber since he announced his bid for the presidency of the EU’s executive Commission next year. On Tuesday Weber said the EU might need to consider launching the sanctions procedure, under Article 7.1 of the bloc’s Lisbon Treaty, if Budapest did not address the criticisms. The EPP decided on Tuesday evening that its lawmakers would vote freely without a unified stance from the whole group. Orban might have lost some key allies as EPP lawmakers said their caucus meeting showed many would vote in favour of Article 7. But the vote was still hard to call. To become the first-ever case of the European Parliament asking EU capitals to launch the punitive mechanism against one of their own, it must win the backing of at least 376 lawmakers and two thirds of the votes cast.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - England captain Joe Root predicted there was a lot more to come from James Anderson after he became the most successful fast bowler in the history of test cricket on Tuesday. Anderson was made to wait until the final delivery of his 143rd test match but eventually took his wicket tally to 564 as he knocked back the middle stump of India tailender Mohammed Shami to clinch a 118-run victory for his side. The 36-year-old Lancastrian had begun the day level on 563 with Australian great Glenn McGrath, having taken two wickets the previous evening at the end of a day in which his best friend Alastair Cook made an emotional farewell century. He is now fourth on the all-time list behind a trio of spinners — Muttiah Muralitharan (800), Shane Warne (708) and Anil Kumble (619). “To achieve what Jimmy has achieved to date has been unbelievable, and the scary thing is he believes he’s got a couple of years left,” Root said at The Oval where England sealed a 4-1 series victory. “In my opinion he’s bowling the best he’s ever been.” Anderson was given a standing ovation as he left the field alongside Cook, England’s most-capped test player, record run scorer and century-maker. They have been mainstays of the England side for more than a decade, playing key roles in four Ashes series wins. Former skipper Cook, who announced his retirement from international cricket after the fourth test, described Anderson as a “freak”. “To see Jimmy pass Glenn McGrath’s record was brilliant,” Cook, who captained Anderson for 49 tests, said. “We’ve lived in each other’s pockets for 12 years and it’s been a privilege to play with England’s greatest cricketer. “No disrespect to any other guys, his skills to do it time and time again, you almost take it for granted that’s he’s going to hit a length. “I can’t describe what he must go through, physically and mentally, to do what he does. He’s a freak. It’s been a pleasure standing at first slip for his bowling.” Anderson was close to tears after finishing the series as the leading wicket-taker with 24 in five tests. “I’m trying not to cry,” Anderson said. “It’s been a special achievement for me. It’s not something I’ve aimed for. I’ve just enjoyed playing for England — it’s an amazing job.” Anderson said he wanted to keep going as long as possible. “I feel pretty fresh considering how many overs I’ve bowled. I’m thoroughly enjoying playing,” he said. “As long as I keep my fitness in a good place, as long as I keeping enjoying turning up to practice and working on my skills, I’ll keep going.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris and Toby Davis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cricket-test-eng-ind-anderson/anderson-still-getting-better-says-root-idUKKCN1LR20N,2019-02-08,,"Anderson still getting better, says Root"
2019-02-08,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Former Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) boss Martin Winterkorn was slow to address emissions test cheating that led to huge U.S. fines, a judge hearing a damages case brought by investors against the German carmaker said on Tuesday.  The question of who knew what, and when, will be vital in determining the outcome of the suit in which investors are seeking 9.2 billion euros ($10.6 billion) in damages for share price losses suffered when the scandal became public. Separately, a consumer rights group said it would file a class-action lawsuit on Wednesday against VW over the manipulation of emissions software, seeking compensation for up to 2 million owners of affected diesel models. The plaintiffs in the first case say Volkswagen (VW) failed in its duty to inform them about the financial impact of the scandal, which broke when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a so-called notice of violation on Sept. 18, 2015. Judge Christian Jaede said then-CEO Winterkorn had dragged his feet after a top-level management meeting two months earlier discussed how to deal with U.S. regulators who were threatening to ban VW because of excessive pollution levels. The plaintiffs say that from this moment, Winterkorn was aware of the cheating.  “Anyone acting in good faith would have followed up on this information,” Jaede said on the second day of hearings into the case at the Braunschweig higher regional court. “This appears not to have happened.” It was not clear, the judge added, why the company had not put out a statement after establishing that engine software had been manipulated to get around emissions tests. The judge also said it was reasonable to take the view that Winterkorn knew about the emissions cheating far earlier. However, Thomas Liebscher, a lawyer for VW, said it would be unfair to assume the chief executive knew how the company’s engine management software worked. Winterkorn resigned in the days after the scandal broke. He told German lawmakers in early 2017 that he did not find out about the cheating any earlier than VW had officially admitted. His lawyer was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. The 71-year old faces U.S. criminal charges, filed in May, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the ‘dieselgate’ scandal. VW has also said it may seek damages from him. The plaintiffs say VW failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines so far. Had investors known about VW’s cheating, they might have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue. VW shares lost up to 37 percent in value in the days after the scandal broke.  The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities.  Jaede said this would only have been legitimate if a settlement could have been reached quickly and VW had cooperated with the U.S. authorities to the best of its efforts.  The judge told the opening day of the trial that VW’s decision between 2005 and 2007 to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal, but it was not clear that the intent was to deceive investors. Fund manager Deka Investment brought the case, known in German as a Musterklage, or specimen claim. The outcome of the case could apply to a further 1,670 similar shareholder claims. It’s possible that claims covering incidents prior to 2012 may not be valid under the statute of limitations, the judge said on Monday. The case is expected to continue into next year and may end up before a higher court. ($1 = 0.8645 euros) Reporting by Jan C.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A Brexit deal can be agreed in the next 6-8 weeks, British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Tuesday, but there would not be enough time to have a legally precise text on the UK’s future relationship with the bloc once it leaves. Asked about comments from the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier that a deal was realistic in 6-8 weeks, Hammond  told lawmakers in Britain’s upper house of parliament: “I think it is doable.”  He added that although the withdrawal agreement would be a legal text, the declaration on a future relationship could be less detailed. “There’s merit in having quite a bit of detail, but clearly we don’t have enough time to negotiate the full draft legal text in what will be quite a complex future partnership agreement,” he said.

Hammond had earlier said that Carney would stay on as governor of the central bank until the end of January 2020 to help navigate the turbulence of Brexit, with Britain due to depart the bloc in March 2019. “If we leave the European Union without a deal... we could expect a period when there would be some turbulence and when there would be some issues arising for financial services businesses,” Carney told lawmakers in Britain’s upper house of parliament. “A governor who was leaving at the end of June, with his bags already packed, would be in a poor position to represent the UK in what might be some quite critical - and time critical - negotiations over that period.” Reporting by David Milliken and Andy Bruce, writing by Alistair Smout",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-hammond-carney/extension-for-boes-carney-will-help-response-to-possible-no-deal-brexit-hammond-idUKKCN1LR1TX,2019-02-08,,Extension for BoE's Carney will help response to possible no-deal Brexit - Hammond
2019-02-08,"JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM (Reuters) - The U.S. military has identified the first two American troops from 55 boxes of human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War that North Korea handed over in July, the agency leading the analysis said on Monday. The identities are expected to be officially announced in the coming days after the troops’ relatives are informed. “We will notify the family first,” said John Byrd, director of scientific analysis at the U.S. Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency, as he stood among the remains undergoing review in Hawaii. President Donald Trump’s administration has hailed the handover of the remains as evidence of the success of his summit with North Koran leader Kim Jong Un in June. The White House said on Monday it was looking at scheduling a second meeting. Critics, however, say the summit has so far failed to deliver on promised steps to get Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme. The identifications will chip away at the 7,699 U.S. troops who the U.S. military says remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. About 5,300 were lost in what is now North Korea. Forensic anthropologists are combing through the remains at a secure facility on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.  Byrd and Jennie Jin, who leads the agency’s Korean War Project, explained the painstaking identification process which includes methods for finding DNA in bone fragments. Sampling for DNA analysis has been carried out so far on about half of the boxes of remains, they said. Some bone fragments are as small as a quarter. Other bones have decayed so much that they are little longer than a pencil. However, the sets of bones from the two soon-to-be-identified troops are far more complete.  “We noticed ... within a few seconds of opening up the box, and pulling him out, that we think this individual is African American and tall and slender,” Byrd said. “And that kind of realization that we have was made possible because of the relatively more complete condition (of the remains).”    The remains of both servicemembers came from the same 1950 battlegrounds near the Chongchon River in what is present-day North Korea. U.S. troops suffered heavy casualties there against Chinese forces that had intervened in the war. “It’s a huge battle,” said Jin, who estimated that 1,700 of the missing U.S. forces from the war came from that fight alone. She spoke above tables of bone fragments, still separated with numbers corresponding with the 55 boxes. Other tables included personal objects from soldiers that don’t have any identification on them, including buttons, canteens and old boots. Byrd acknowledged that it could take months for the next round of identifications. “There could be some more and maybe right after Christmas,” he said.  Jin, a South Korean-born American citizen, said the work has a personal connection. Her grandfather, now 90, is a survivor of the war who came from one of the areas of present-day North Korea that saw some of the heaviest fighting. He was evacuated south on a U.S. Navy ship, she said. “It’s really personal to me,” Jin said. The July transfer coincided with the 65th anniversary of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting between North Korean and Chinese forces and South Korean and U.S.-led forces under the U.N. Command. The two sides remain technically at war because a peace treaty was never signed. The United States and North Korea conducted joint searches for remains from 1996 until 2005, when Washington halted the operations citing concerns about the safety of its personnel as Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear programme.

2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - A recovery in European shares stalled on Tuesday as a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing weighed on the market and investors seized on China’s demand for sanctions from the World Trade Organisation as a reason to take the market lower. The STOXX 600  turned down after a positive open, down 0.2 percent by the close, as trade-sensitive autos and mining stocks buckled under pressure from rising tensions between the U.S. and China.  Autos .SXAP and miners .SXPP both fell 1 percent.  Germany's DAX .GDAXI, heavy in industrials and exporters, fell 0.8 percent, while strength in the pound on bets of a Brexit deal dragged Britain's FTSE 100 down 0.3 percent. China told the WTO it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the U.S. in retaliation for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute, initiated in 2013, over U.S. dumping duties. Despite the dispute being unrelated to the most recent trade conflict, trade-sensitive stocks fell further on the news, showing how sensitive the market is to any suggestion that U.S.-China relations are souring further. The pan-European index was still up 0.9 percent from the five-month lows hit last week. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days. Among single stocks, Amer Sports (AMEAS.HE) shone after a takeover approach sent the Finnish sports equipment maker soaring up 18.8 percent. Trading in its shares was halted before Amer said it had received a 4.6 billion euros ($5.3 billion) takeover approach from China’s Anta Sports Products and private equity firm FountainVest.       Video game developer Ubisoft (UBIP.PA) was another strong gainer, up 4.3 percent after JP Morgan analysts upgraded the stock to “overweight” from “neutral”, saying secular growth in the gaming industry and the shift to digital would drive margins up. “Ubisoft has a strong portfolio of established franchises with recurring revenues,” they wrote.  “We see further potential upside from China, mobile market growth and share gains from a low base and a longer-term shift to cloud-based services and subscription bundles.” Solid updates pushed industrial equipment rental firm Ashtead (AHT.L) and asset manager Partners Group (PGHN.S) up 2.6 and 3.8 percent respectively. The Swiss asset manager reported strong first-half results, with revenues and earnings up more than expected. Partners Group fared better than troubled peer GAM (GAMH.S), which fell 4 percent. Semiconductor stocks fell after Japan’s Renesas sealed a deal to buy auto chipmaker IDT (IDT.N) for $6.7 billion, with some analysts saying the deal was symptomatic of a top in the chipmakers industry.  “A quick look at recent history of M&A in the sector (Microchip’s disastrous acquisition of Microsemi) and the risk that the semiconductor industry is reaching a cyclical peak is cause for concern,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.  A drop in the U.S. semiconductor stocks index .SOX amplified the fall in European chipmakers Siltronic (WAFGn.DE), BE Semiconductor (BESI.AS), AMS (AMS.S), ASM International (ASMI.AS), Infineon (IFXGn.DE) - all down between 1.9 and 4.4 percent.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Tuesday called for U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet to respect its sovereignty, after she urged it to allow monitors into the restive far western region of Xinjiang and expressed concern about the situation there. China has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tension between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority. Last month, a United Nations rights panel said it had received credible reports that up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention in Xinjiang, and called for them to be freed. In Bejing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang signalled that China did not want the United Nations to get involved. “China urges the U.N. human rights high commissioner and office to scrupulously abide by the mission and principles of the U.N. charter, respect China’s sovereignty, fairly and objectively carry out its duties, and not listen to one-sided information,” he told a daily news briefing. The government has previously blamed anti-China forces for being behind criticism of its policies in Xinjiang. During the past two years, authorities have dramatically stepped up security and surveillance there, likened by critics to near martial law conditions, with police checkpoints, re-education centres and mass DNA collection. Bachelet’s appeal for access came as New York-based Human Rights Watch said the Turkic Uighur minority faced arbitrary detentions, daily curbs on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination” in a mass security crackdown. [L3N1VW3DV] In her maiden speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Bachelet said the panel had brought to light “deeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang”. Reports had been received of “patterns of human rights violations in other regions”, added Bachelet, a former Chilean president, calling for Beijing to permit access for her staff across China, saying she expected discussions to start soon.

2019-02-08,"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican is preparing a response to bombshell allegations made by an Italian archbishop who asked Pope Francis to step down, accusing him of covering up sexual misconduct by an American cardinal, his top advisers said on Monday. The statement came at the end of the first day of a three-day meeting of the “C-9”, a group of nine cardinals from around the world who meet with the pope at the Vatican several times a year to advise him on Church matters. In an 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials. The cardinals’ statement said they had expressed their “total solidarity with the pope over events of the last few weeks” and added that the Holy See was preparing “eventual and necessary clarifications”. Viganò said he had told Francis soon after the pontiff’s election in 2013 that Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington D.C., had engaged in sexual misconduct. Viganò, who is in hiding and communicating through the same conservative journalists who helped him prepare, edit and distribute his broadside, said the pope had done nothing and even lifted sanctions that had been imposed on McCarrick by Benedict, the previous pope. Francis in July accepted the resignation of McCarrick, 88, who became the first cardinal in living memory to lose his red hat and title. American Church officials had said allegations that McCarrick had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated. McCarrick has said he has “absolutely no recollection” of the alleged abuse of the teenager. Critics say Viganò’s statement has holes and contradictions and is his vendetta for not being made a cardinal by Francis. They say McCarrick disregarded any sanctions, appearing in public often, even alongside Benedict, in the years after Viganò says the former pope acted against McCarrick. Hours after Viganò’s statement was printed in conservative media outlets, Francis told reporters on his plane returning from a trip to Ireland that he would “not say a word” about the statement because it “speaks for itself”. He did not, however, rule out an institutional response, such as the one the cardinals said the Vatican was preparing. The cardinals’ statement gave no indication when the clarification would be issued.  The cardinals also said they had asked the pope to “reflect” on the work, structure and make-up of the group that was formed five years ago, taking into consideration “the advanced age of some of its members.” Francis spoke of his intention to make changes to the C-9 in an exclusive interview with Reuters in June, saying he wanted to “renew it a bit”. Two of the members of the current C-9, Australian Cardinal George Pell and Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa, are under a cloud for allegations related Church sexual abuse scandals in their countries. Both have denied any wrongdoing.

2019-02-08,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden faces a political impasse after its mainstream centre-left and centre-right blocs virtually tied in an election on Sunday, while the far-right - which neither wants to deal with - made gains on a hardline anti-immigration platform. With nearly all votes counted on Monday, the ruling centre-left Social Democrats and Greens and their Left Party parliamentary ally had 40.6 percent of the vote, while the opposition centre-right Alliance was on 40.3 percent. That translates into a single-seat advantage in the 349-member Riksdag. The Sweden Democrats, a party with white supremacist roots, won 17.6 percent, about 5 percentage points more than four years ago. It was the biggest gain of any party and in line with conventional opinion polls but fell short of the 20-30 percent their leader Jimmie Akesson had predicted. The Sweden Democrats’ success follows a rise in popularity of other far-right parties in Europe amid growing anxiety over national identity, the effects of globalisation and fears over immigration boosted by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Akesson was adamant his party holds the balance of power.    “We won’t participate in letting through a government which doesn’t give us influence,” he told TV4. “On the contrary, we will do what we can to bring down any such government.” Akesson’s overtures found few takers with a letter inviting the right-wing Moderates and Christian Democrats to talks being instantly and publicly rebuffed. Unless parties on the centre-left and centre-right break ranks with their blocs, it is likely to be impossible to form a stable government without some kind of support from the Sweden Democrats, who want the country to leave the European Union and freeze immigration. Liberal Party leader Jan Bjorklund said he wanted to form a centre-right minority government and seek cooperation with the Social Democrats or the Greens.  He said the complicated situation meant he could not completely rule out supporting a Social Democrat-led government but said he would rather leave the Alliance than work with the Sweden Democrats. “Should any party in the Alliance start cooperating with the Sweden Democrats then the Alliance will fall, but it will not happen,” he said in an interview for Swedish Television. Many online surveys, which in the last election had gauged the Sweden Democrats’ vote better than conventional polls, had signalled they could dethrone the Social Democrats as the nation’s biggest party - a position the centre-left has held for a century. In the end, the Sweden Democrats were beaten by Prime Minister Stefan Lofven’s Social Democrats by a 10 percentage point margin and eclipsed also by the Moderates of Ulf Kristersson, the Alliance’s candidate for the premiership. “In some sense we’re happy the Sweden Democrats didn’t grow more than they did,” Liberal Party lawmaker Allan Widman told Reuters. “The bigger they become, the more hard pressed all other parties become.”  GRAPHIC - Election result  tmsnrt.rs/2CDMT4e Sweden saw itself as a “humanitarian superpower” for years, but a rise in gang violence in immigrant-dominated, deprived city suburbs has also won support for the Sweden Democrats. After the arrival of 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 - the most in Europe in relation to the country’s population of 10 million - the government suspended many of its liberal asylum policies. There was a sense of relief among supporters of mainstream parties about the far-right’s less dramatic gains. That was shared in Brussels. “It is clear that the claim that the far-right is on an inexorable roll and will devour everything that stands in its way is false,” said one EU official. Still, the Swedish election underscored a broader shift to the right in one of Europe’s most socially progressive nations. Senior figures in the mainstream parties headed into meetings on Monday to produce a strategy for forming a government. But the process could take weeks and possibly fail. Akesson challenged Kristersson to choose between seeking support from the Sweden Democrats for an Alliance government or accepting four more years of Lofven as prime minister. Kristersson called on Lofven to resign, but also rebuffed Akesson. “We have been completely clear during the whole election. The Alliance will not govern or discuss how to form a government with the Sweden Democrats,” he said. Both sides laid claim to being best placed to form a government, although votes from Swedes living abroad are not due to be declared until Wednesday and these could still sway the final outcome slightly. Yet in the same breath, leaders of both sides called for bipartisan accommodation to avoid gridlock in parliament. The scenario of a bipartisan coalition is highly uncertain. Centre-left and centre-right parties have ruled together only a handful of times since the mid-1930s. Also, a 2014 accord to neutralise the Sweden Democrats and let the biggest bloc rule proved deeply unpopular among centre-right grassroot members and rapidly unravelled.  The Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and any such deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability. Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country’s only opposition party. A new election will be called if parliament doesn’t agree on a prime minister after four attempts.

2019-02-08,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish political parties face weeks of haggling to form a government after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats saying they hold the balance of power. A preliminary allocation of parliamentary seats gave the centre-left bloc - uniting the minority governing Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party - 144 seats versus 143 for the centre-right Alliance bloc. The Sweden Democrats, who want to leave the European Union, won 62 seats, up from 49 in the 349-seat Riksdag where 175 seats are needed to form a majority. Doing a deal with them would give either bloc a majority but the mainstream parties have ruled out cooperating with a party which has roots in the white supremacist fringe. Both blocs have declared themselves victors in the election, but need additional support to form a viable government without the Sweden Democrats, who want influence over immigration policy.  There are a number of ways out of the tangle. CENTRE-RIGHT MINORITY RULE  The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats looks set to be slightly smaller than the centre-left. But it will hope for backing from the Sweden Democrats to oust Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and to install Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson as his replacement.  However, a formal agreement with the Sweden Democrats would very likely see the Centre and Liberal parties, who want looser immigration policies, jump ship. It is not clear whether the Centre and Liberal parties would take part in a government that had no formal support from the Sweden Democrats but in practice relied on their votes to install a prime minister.  On Monday, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson invited the Moderates and Christian Democrats to formal negotiations but was quickly rebuffed.  Akesson said his party would vote against any government that did not give it a say in policy. The Social Democrats and Greens could retain power in the unlikely event that Prime Minister Lofven survives a mandatory vote on whether to replace him. Lofven said he would remain in office in the coming weeks and called for cooperation across the political divide. When voting for a prime minister in parliament, a proposal is passed unless a majority of all 349 lawmakers vote against. This has allowed minority governments to rule. The Alliance would need the Sweden Democrats to back a vote to oust Lofven and install Kristersson.   The Alliance could join a grand coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens to exclude the Sweden Democrats. The Left Party, Sweden’s former Communist party, would also be left out.  But the Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and such a deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability. Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country’s only opposition party.  MODERATE ONE-PARTY RULE      The Moderates could form a one-party government but that would require support from the Sweden Democrats as well as the smaller centre-right parties.   Moderate leader Kristersson has ruled this out, and the Centre and Liberal parties would probably not go along with the idea if the Sweden Democrats were given any significant say over policy while remaining outside the government.  Parliament opens on Sept. 25. If Lofven is ousted, the speaker is allowed to give a maximum of four prime ministerial candidates the opportunity to form a government. If they all fail, fresh elections must be called. There is no formal time limit for negotiations, but the deadline for the budget is Nov. 15.  If no new government is in place by then, the current government, continuing as caretakers, would put forward a budget until a new cabinet can take office.

2019-02-08,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. In the first attack of its kind against the top managers of Libya’s state oil industry, two of the gunmen were also killed and at least 10 NOC staff wounded, officials said. Security forces said they had regained control of the landmark glass-fronted building in the centre of the city.  The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands but the NOC headquarters had so far been spared the violence. The NOC provides the vast bulk of Libya’s state income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state institutions still functioning well amid chaos. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack. But the interior ministry said in a statement initial indications showed the gunmen belonged to Islamic State, which has previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities. Gunfire rang out in the morning as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived. “The death toll so far is two killed from NOC staff and two attackers,” said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of the most powerful factions in Tripoli. Security forces smashed windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager were seen safely leaving the building. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.  However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya’s southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials.   In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s biggest migrant camp faces closure next month unless authorities clean up “uncontrollable amounts of waste”, the regional governor said, citing public health risks. The Moria camp, on the Greek island of Lesbos, has long been described by the United Nations and other human rights organisations as overcrowded and unfit for humans.  More than 8,300 refugees and migrants are currently in the former military camp in a collection of shipping containers and flimsy tents, more than double its 3,100-person capacity, according to the latest government figures. In a notice published on Monday, Christiana Kalogirou, governor of the north Aegean to which Lesbos belongs, said the island’s public health inspectors had declared Moria “unsuitable and dangerous for public health and the environment”. It said inspectors found “uncontrollable amounts of waste”, broken sewage pipes and overflowing garbage bins. In addition, living quarters were inadequately cleaned, there was a high risk of disease transmission due to overcrowding and stagnant water and flies were found in the toilets. “We are issuing a 30-day deadline ... to remedy all of the problems,” the notice addressed to the migration minister and camp director says. “Once it expires we will ban its operation over even just one of the aforementioned problems.” Last month the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR urged Greece to speed up transfers of eligible asylum-seekers from Aegean islands to the mainland. It said conditions at Moria were “reaching boiling point”. Greece has moved asylum seekers to the mainland in recent months and a migrant ministry official it would speed up efforts to reduce numbers at the camps. “We expect to see results soon,” said the official, declining to be named. Lesbos, not far from Turkey, was the preferred entry point into the European Union in 2015 for nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis. Small numbers of boats continue to arrive.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Novak Djokovic’s year got off to a less-than-ideal start, the Serbian set off on a five-day hike in the French Alps that proved transformative.    Since his June trek with his wife up Mont Sainte-Victoire, the mountain that famously also served as an inspiration for Paul Cezanne, the 31-year-old has added a pair of Grand Slam titles to his resume. “I remember one moment particularly when we climbed that mountain. It was pretty high. We reached the top after three hours,” Djokovic recalled after landing the U.S. Open title by beating Juan Martin Del Potro on Sunday.  “We sat down and we just looked at the world from that perspective, just kind of breathed in the new inspiration, new motivation. “I thought of tennis, thought of the emotion that tennis provokes in me in a way. It was all positives. I just felt like I had a new breath for this sport. “The rest is history in terms of results, in terms of how I felt. I just felt like a whole wave of energy that I was kind of thriving on from that moment onwards.” After missing the second half of the 2017 season because of an elbow problem, Djokovic played the Australian Open before having surgery on the joint only for the disappointing results to continue until his quarter-final exit at Roland Garros. Something in the Alpine air clearly agreed with him, though, and he went on to triumph at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open tune-up in Cincinnati and then in New York to grab his 14th career Grand Slam title, putting him third on the all-time list. “I had to kind of disconnect a little bit,” said Djokovic. “We just isolated ourselves and took things from a different perspective. “Ever since then, the tennis is completely different for me. In terms of results, I played finals of Queen’s, won Wimbledon, won Cincinnati, and won U.S. Open.  “I guess we’ll be hiking some more very soon,” he added with a smile. In New York, while some of his fiercest rivals fell by the wayside over a bruising fortnight, Djokovic did not let the intense heat or any of his opponents push him off his path to a third title at Flushing Meadows .  Djokovic will now set his sights on conquering a different summit by reclaiming his place atop the world tennis rankings for the first time since October 2016. Admitting it would have been hard to believe back in February that he would go on to collect such prestigious titles this year, he also felt the barren spell had actually helped get him back on track. “I learned a lot about myself, learned to be patient, which was never really a stronger side of me,” Djokovic said.  “But at the same time, life showed me that it takes time for good things, it takes time to really build them, for things to fall into place, so you can centre yourself, balance yourself and thrive. “The last two months have been terrific.” Reporting by Frank Pingue, editing by Nick Mulvenney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-usopen-djokovic-delpotro-comme/djokovic-finds-secret-to-grand-slam-success-in-french-alps-idUKKCN1LQ09V,2019-02-08,"When Novak Djokovic's year got off to a less-than-ideal start, the Serbian set off on a five-day hike in the French Alps that proved transformative.",Djokovic finds secret to Grand Slam success in French Alps
2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Serena Williams’ behaviour in Saturday’s U.S. Open final divided the tennis world after she called the chair umpire a “liar” and a “thief” and said he treated her differently than male players during her loss to Naomi Osaka. Williams, who was seeking a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam singles title on Saturday, was handed a warning for a coaching violation before being deducted a point for smashing her racquet. She then had a heated argument with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, which cost her a game. The six-times U.S. Open champion, who has since been fined $17,000 by the United States Tennis Association for the violations, vigorously disputed each during the match. In the wake of Osaka’s first Grand Slam triumph, there were messages of support for Williams as well as those condemning her behaviour and agreeing with the umpire’s calls.  Tennis great Billie Jean King wrote on Twitter: “When a woman is emotional, she’s “hysterical” and she’s penalized for it. When a man does the same, he’s “outspoken” and there are no repercussions. Thank you, @serenawilliams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same.” Yet Australian Margaret Court, whose tally of Grand Slam singles titles is being chased by Williams, had little sympathy for the 36-year-old American former world number one. “We always had to go by the rules,” Court, who dominated tennis during the 1960s and early 1970s, said according to a report in The Australian. “It’s sad for the sport when a player tries to become bigger than the rules. “Because the young player outplayed her in the first set, I think pressure got her more than anything.” The drama started when Ramos handed Williams a coaching violation early in the second set because of hand gestures made from the stands by her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. He later admitted to coaching, which is an offence in the sport, though one rarely called. When the violation was announced Williams approached Ramos to say she never takes coaching and would rather lose than “cheat to win”. Things seemed to settle down as Williams went on to break Osaka for a 3-1 lead, but she gave the break right back in the next game with a pair of double faults, prompting the former champion to smash her racquet on the court. That resulted in a second violation, meaning Osaka was awarded the first point of the sixth game.  Williams, who was under the impression the first violation had been rescinded, returned to Ramos to seek an apology for saying she had received coaching earlier. During a changeover, Williams resumed her argument with the umpire, this time saying he was attacking her character and was a “thief”. That triggered a third violation, which resulted in a game penalty that gave Osaka a 5-3 lead. From there, Williams summoned the tournament referee to the court and said male tennis players were not punished for similar offences. Tennis great John McEnroe, one of the game’s most tempestuous characters in his playing days, said the sport must find a way to allow players to express feelings and inject their personality into the game while adhering to the rules. Ramos should not have given Williams a violation for breaking her racquet and should have warned her early on about what would happen if she did not move on, he said. “I’ve said far worse,” McEnroe, a seven-times Grand Slam singles winner, said on ESPN. “She’s right about the guys being held to a different standard, there’s no question.” However, Richard Ings, a former professional chair umpire who also used to be the ATP Tour Executive Vice-President, Rules and Competition, felt it was Williams who needed to apologise. Ings once issued a warning, point penalty and a game penalty against McEnroe at the 1987 U.S. Open for obscenities directed at the umpire.  “We should not let her record, as glowing as it is, overshadow the fact that on this day, in this match Williams was wrong,” Ings wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. “The decisions made by Ramos had nothing to do with sexism or racism. They had everything to do with observing clear breaches of the grand slam code of conduct and then having the courage to call them without fear or favour.” A spokeswoman for Williams did not immediately respond when asked to comment on the remarks from Court and Ings, while the USTA said it does not make chair umpires available to the media. According to the official Grand Slam rule book, a first infraction gets a warning, a second offence results in a point penalty while a third brings about a game penalty. The rule book also states that players who receive coaching during a match or intentionally destroy a racquet shall be penalised in accordance with the point penalty schedule. In the rule book, verbal abuse is defined as “a statement about an official, opponent, sponsor, spectator, or other person that implies dishonesty or is derogatory, insulting or otherwise abusive.” Editing by Toby Davis/Peter Rutherford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-usopen-williams-osaka/williams-u-s-open-treatment-divides-tennis-world-idUKKCN1LP0R6,2019-02-08,,Williams' U.S. Open treatment divides tennis world
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The leader of the liberal group in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt said on Sunday he is seeking an alliance with French President Emmanuel Macron’s political party for the European elections in May in a bid to counter populists. In an interview published by French newspaper Ouest France, the former Belgian prime minister said he is ready for the European liberals and La Republique en Marche, the party created by Macron, to build an alternative to populism. Asked about an alliance, Christophe Castaner, the head of La Republique en Marche, dismissed Verhoftsadt’s comments. “We are not ready for an alliance,” he told Reuters on Sunday. As Italian and Hungarian leaders have met and stressed their common vision, pro-European liberal parties intend to fight back ahead of European Parliament elections in May.  “The fight in 2019 will be a fight between the nationalist populists on one side and a pro-European alternative,” Verhofstadt told Ouest France. The liberal leader said each party would campaign together with common proposals but keep their own identities. “The goal is to create a decisive group in the future parliament, that would be a tool to stop the nationalist tide,” he said. The fourth largest group in the European Parliament, with 68 MPs out of 751, is courting the newcomer on the European stage to join its ranks and gain clout after the May elections. This summer, Castaner toured Europe to seek allies ahead of the elections. He had a meeting with Verhofstadt last Tuesday. Eight months ahead of the vote, Macron has positioned himself as the main opponent to European nationalists. On Thursday he called on the European Popular Party, the conservative group in Parliament to clarify its position, saying it cannot have Angela Merkel and Hungary’s Viktor Orban under the same banner.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Spies usually operate in the shadows. Hans-Georg Maassen, chief of Germany’s domestic spy agency, has done just the opposite and taken centre-stage in a heated debate about the far-right that is shaking Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to its core. In comments to Friday’s edition of mass-selling daily Bild, Maassen said he was sceptical about reports that migrants had been hounded in the city of Chemnitz after the fatal stabbing of a German man there, for which two asylum seekers were arrested. The violence in the eastern city has shaken Germany deeply.   But Maassen said his BfV domestic intelligence agency had “no reliable information about such hunts taking place”, and that a video circulating showing that happening could have been faked.  Those comments put him at odds with Merkel, who said images from Chemnitz “very clearly” showed hate. She has also accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using violent protests over the stabbing to stir up ethnic tension. The upshot is that senior politicians are calling for 55-year-old Maassen to go. He will likely have to explain himself to a parliamentary committee this week. His own stance towards the far-right is also being questioned. “Will the AfD soon have a new hero?” the Bild am Sonntag newspaper asked in a headline next to a picture of Maassen, whose face was plastered across German weekend newspapers and television bulletins. Questions have been raised before about how aggressively Maassen has taken on the far-right, including the AfD, which he has resisted putting under surveillance. A former leader of the AfD’s youth wing, Franziska Schreiber, wrote in her book published this year - “Inside AFD: The report of a drop-out” - that Maassen had advised ex-AfD leader Frauke Petry on how the party could avoid being put under surveillance by his office. He has denied giving such counsel. A trained lawyer who forged his career in the Interior Ministry, Maassen has generally stayed out of the spotlight during his six years in charge of the BfV, though he has clashed with other more circumspect government officials for calling out Russia as the likely culprit behind cyber attacks on Germany. In a 2016 interview with Reuters, Maassen said far-right extremists in Germany were increasingly ready to commit violent acts - a risk he has since flagged again. On Friday, Maassen’s BfV intelligence agency said it would make further checks on information available about the Chemnitz protests as “there are always fake news and attempts at disinformation” on social media.  “Checks, in particular with regard to possible ‘hounding’ of migrants by right-wing extremists, will continue,” it added. Maassen’s Chemnitz comments have aggravated tensions about whether politicians and the authorities are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in Germany, where many thought the lessons of its Nazi history had long been learned. The remarks have also split Berlin’s political class and re-opened fissures over immigration in Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’, only two months after she closed a painful row with her Bavarian sister party on the same issue. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has backed Maassen. Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the anti-immigrant AfD, told the Bild am Sonntag: “All accusations against him are politically motivated.” But Malu Dreyer, a senior figure in the Social Democrats, junior partner in Merkel’s coalition, said he had created uncertainty and “destroyed” trust in the state. “So I do not think he is still the right man for this position,” she added.

2019-02-08,"CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - Rebuilding Genoa’s collapsed motorway bridge will cost 150 to 200 million euros (£134 million - £179 million), a local authority official said on Sunday. The work will be undertaken by state-controlled Fincantieri, in cooperation with Autostrade per l’Italia, Giovanni Toti, the governor of the Liguria region, which is centred on Genoa, told a business conference in northern Italy. Last month’s collapse of the bridge operated by motorway group Autostrade, which is controlled by infrastructure company Atlantia, killed 43 people. “The reconstruction will cost between 150 and 200 million euros, while 10-12 million will be necessary for the demolition of the old one and more funds should be granted to families and shopkeepers affected by the disaster,” said Toti. The regional governor has been appointed as the coordinator for the bridge disaster relief, giving him a powerful voice in the reconstruction initiative. Italy’s ruling coalition, which comprises the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has accused Autostrade of serious oversights in its maintenance of the bridge and said it wants to revoke its motorway concessions.  Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of 5-Star, has said Autostrade must pay for the rebuilding work, but should not be involved in any other way. But Toti appeared to reject that line. “Fincantieri will have the leadership of the reconstruction, together with a group of companies that will also include Autostrade,” he said. Toti said he had asked the government to issue a decree to waive European Union tender rules for public works to fast-track the reconstruction. A consortium including Fincantieri and Autostrade would be the quickest way to rebuild the viaduct, a key piece of infrastructure for both Genoa and the country, he said. “The port of Genoa generates 1.5 percent of Italy’s gross domestic product ... we have to focus to give the bridge back to Genoa and its citizens,” said Toti, who is a member of the conservative, opposition group Forza Italia! (Go Italy!). Toninelli took to Twitter to criticise Toti’s drive to put together a consortium, saying he was using the disaster to win political consensus. But Toti dismissed the attack: “A ministry that was not able to supervise infrastructure as it should have cannot block local authorities who are working efficiently on behalf of their citizens,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Labour Party will make private companies employing more than 250 people set up “ownership funds” to give workers financial stakes in their firms if the party comes to power, its finance spokesman told the Observer newspaper. John McDonnell said in an interview published on Sunday that he would introduce such legislation in the first year of a Labour government - part of the opposition party’s drive to “shift wealth and power in favour of working people”. Britain is not due to hold a new election until 2022, but with Brexit rows deeply dividing the governing Conservative Party and Prime Minister Theresa May under increasing pressure, some MPs suggest a vote could come sooner. “What this will ensure is that in large companies, in addition to rewarding workers with wages, they will reward them with shares that will go into a pool that will allow them to have an ownership role,” McDonnell said. “The opportunity is there for us. I think the government will fall apart in the next six months almost certainly.” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Socialist who was unexpectedly elected the party’s head in 2015, has moved Labour to the left, often clashing with his MPs in parliament but gaining thousands of new party members, often among the young. His manifesto for the 2017 election, which promised the renationalisation of some services, measures to curb corporate excess and an end to healthcare cuts, is credited with helping Labour gain seats and see the Conservatives lose their majority.

2019-02-08,"CERNOBBIO, Italy (Reuters) - Britain believes an orderly, agreed exit from the European Union is still the most likely outcome but time is running out and a deal should be done by November at the latest, cabinet office minister David Lidington said on Saturday. Speaking on the sidelines of Italy’s annual Ambrosetti conference on European affairs, Lidington said London wanted a deal that satisfied all EU member states but its contingency plan for a ‘no-deal’ Brexit was well developed. “We remain very much committed to getting a good deal and believing that that is not just the right outcome but the most probable outcome,” he told Reuters in an interview. He said it was important to wrap up negotiations by November in order to give British and European parliaments enough time to review and approve the text of any agreement. “This is not something that can simply be left to the 11th hour,” Lidington added. The UK is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear. If the world’s fifth largest economy leaves the EU without a detailed agreement, financial markets fear a chaotic divorce that would disrupt trade flows across Europe. There is, so far, no full exit deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some MPs are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum. May recently outlined proposals on economic and trade policy in a white paper, which Lidington said would ensure frictionless trade, especially across the UK’s only post-Brexit land border with the EU, between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has criticised the proposals, saying they imply Britain wants a “kind of à la carte single market, a kind of cherrypicking approach”.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Serena Williams said she did not know her coach was giving her instructions and had “never cheated in her life” after her hopes of winning a 24th Grand Slam title ended in extraordinary scenes at the U.S. Open on Saturday. The American received three code violations, including a game penalty for verbal abuse, from chair umpire Carlos Ramos in the final, where she was beaten by Japan’s Naomi Osaka 6-2 6-4. After Williams lost the first set to the Japanese 20th seed, Ramos gave Williams the first code violation in the form of a warning early in the second set for getting instructions from her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. Mouratoglou later said he had been giving her instructions, but added he did not think Williams had looked in his direction. He said Osaka’s coach Sascha Bajin had also been giving his player advice. “If I’m honest I was coaching, I don’t think she looked at me,” Mouratoglou told ESPN. “Sascha was coaching every point too.” Out on court, an unsettled Williams protested her innocence, telling Ramos: “I don’t cheat to win. I’d rather lose. I’m just letting you know.” She added in her post-match news conference that she had asked Mouratoglou why he said he was coaching her. “I just texted Patrick, like, ‘What is he talking about?’” Williams told reporters. “I’m trying to figure out why he would say that.” Williams continued protesting to Ramos during a changeover but returned to break Osaka’s serve to go 3-1 up in the second set. But Osaka broke back in the next game and the American smashed her racket in frustration, earning a second code violation and a one-point deduction from Ramos. The deduction enraged Williams and she screamed at Ramos at the next changeover, drawing the game penalty after she called him a thief. “I have never cheated in my life,” she said. “I have a daughter and I stand for what’s right for her. I’ve never cheated, and you owe me an apology.  “You will never be on another court of mine as long as you live. Say it. Say you’re sorry. “And you stole a point from me. You’re a thief.” Afterwards, Williams said Ramos had never taken a game from a man for calling him a thief and referenced Alize Cornet being given a code violation for changing her shirt on court earlier in the tournament as an another example of double standards within the game. “I can’t sit here and say I wouldn’t say he’s a thief, because I thought he took a game from me,” she said. “But I’ve seen other men call other umpires several things. “I’m here fighting for women’s rights and for women’s equality and for all kinds of stuff. For me to say ‘thief’ and for him to take a game, it made me feel like it was a sexist remark. “He’s never taken a game from a man because they said ‘thief’. For me it blows my mind. But I’m going to continue to fight for women and to fight for us to have equal — like Cornet should be able to take off her shirt without getting a fine. “This is outrageous.” Editing by Peter Rutherford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-usopen-williams-osaka-controve/serena-defends-her-integrity-after-grand-slam-controversy-idUKKCN1LP009,2019-02-08,,Serena defends her integrity after Grand Slam controversy
2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in France’s main cities on Saturday to demand action against climate change and to show support for former environment minister Nicolas Hulot who quit in frustration over the government’s approach. Police said as many as 18,500 protesters took the streets in Paris joining a global campaign dubbed “Rise for climate” and a French one launched in support to Hulot who quit on Aug. 28. Non-governmental organisations estimated turnout at as many as 50,000. Hulot said he felt lonely at the ministry. “Who would be efficient on his own? Where are my troops? Who is behind me?,” he said in a radio interview in which he announced his resignation. Thousands also marched in cities including Marseilles, Strasbourg and Toulouse. The departure of Hulot, who was one of the most popular ministers, was a blow to President Emmanuel Macron, whose popularity has slid in recent weeks after a post-election honeymoon period.  Hulot’s inclusion in the cabinet in mid-2017 was seen as a way to sustain the green image France had earned 18 months earlier by brokering the Paris Agreement to combat greenhouse gas emissions. Macron, however, has watered down Hulot’s initiatives on issues such as reducing reliance on nuclear energy and the banning of the weed killer glyphosate. Opposition leaders such as former left-wing presidential candidates Jean-Luc Melenchon and Benoit Hamon joined the protests in Paris and in Marseilles. Hulot himself has thanked supporters via his twitter account.  “Citizens gathering everywhere in France and in the world have the power to drive change for our children’s future,” he said on his twitter account.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Pressure grew on Germany’s domestic spy chief on Saturday after he expressed scepticism that migrants had been hounded in Chemnitz after the fatal stabbing of a German man - remarks that are reviving strains in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. Germany has been deeply shaken by the most violent right-wing protests in decades after the Aug. 26 killing of the German man in Chemnitz, in the eastern state of Saxony, for which two immigrants were arrested. Friday’s comments by Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, aggravated tensions about whether politicians and the authorities are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in Germany, where many thought the lessons of its Nazi history had long been learned. Maassen said he was sceptical about “media reports on right-wing extremists hunting down people in Chemnitz”, adding that a video circulating showing that happening could have been faked. The mass-selling daily Bild, in its Saturday edition, called Maassen’s remark “the most explosive quote of the year”. His comments undermined Merkel, who had said pictures had shown “hate and ... the persecution of innocent people”. After a batch of opposition politicians called on Friday for Maassen to go, members of the ruling parties - Merkel’s conservatives and the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) - raised doubts about him on Saturday. Stephan Weil, SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony, questioned whether Maassen was still up to his job. “For me, the question marks are growing,” Weil told the Funke media group. Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker with Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), said Maassen would have to explain himself to a parliamentary committee that oversees Germany’s spy agencies, which meets behind closed doors on Wednesday. “President Maassen will now have to explain how he came to his assessment and why he made it known via the media,” Sensburg told the Handesblatt business daily. The row over whether or not migrants were hounded in Chemnitz has inflamed tensions over immigration in Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’ only two months after she reached a truce with her Bavarian sister party on the same issue. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), said on Friday he had no reason to doubt Maassen’s assessment. On Wednesday, Seehofer said: “Migration is the mother of all problems.”  Merkel’s spokesman, asked on Friday about her trust in Maassen, said: “Mr Maassen has an important and responsible role.” Merkel on Thursday accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using violent protests over the Chemnitz stabbing to stir up ethnic tension.

2019-02-08,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the New York Times after the news outlet published a column this week by an anonymous administration official questioning his fitness for office. Trump also said he was considering taking action against the Times, whose shares moved briefly lower after his comments were made public. “We’re going to see. I’m looking at that right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Attorney General Jeff Sessions “should be investigating who the author of that piece was because I really believe it’s national security.” The Times issued a statement saying it was confident the Justice Department “would not participate in such a blatant abuse of government power.” “The President’s threats both underscore why we must safeguard the identity of the writer of this op-ed and serve as a reminder of the importance of a free and independent press to American democracy.” Trump did not indicate what sort of action he was considering against the Times and it was unclear what legal grounds he could act on.  A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department does not confirm or deny investigations. The Times could not be immediately reached for comment.  A number of top Trump advisers have disavowed the piece, which was published on Wednesday without a name in what the Times said was a rare but necessary move to protect the writer. In the column, the writer slammed Trump’s “amorality” and leadership style. The official said there were a number of U.S. officials who were part of an “quiet resistance” inside the administration who was “working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.” Trump regularly attacks the media for focussing on negative news about his administration and decries what he perceives as “fakes news.” He repeated on Air Force One that he believes libel laws should be strengthened. Trump had threatened to sue the Times when he was running for president in October 2016 because of its story about allegations of sexual assault against women. The Times stood by its story and dismissed a Trump attorney’s demand for an apology and retraction. No suit was filed. Earlier this week the Justice Department said is set a meeting with state attorneys general to discuss concerns social media platforms are stifling conservative voices.

2019-02-08,"VIENNA (Reuters) - A European Union tax overhaul to raise levies on large digital firms needs a thorough debate although an agreement could still be found by the end of the year, Germany’s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Saturday. Under a proposal from the European Commission in March, EU states would charge a 3 percent levy on digital revenues of large firms like Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) that are accused of routing their profits to the bloc’s low-tax states. The plan is opposed by smaller states like Ireland, who fear losing revenues, and by Nordic governments who think the tax could stifle innovation and trigger retaliation from the United States, which is home to most of the firms who could be hit by the proposed tax. “It is necessary to take some time for debate,” Scholz told reporters at a Vienna meeting of EU finance ministers, adding that he aimed at reaching a compromise by the year end.  After having pushed for the tax, Berlin took a more cautious approach after Scholz took office in March and his latest remark will be closely scrutinized by European Union governments who oppose the new tax, as it may be perceived as showing Germany’s little appetite to the project. EU officials said Germany wants to make sure the tax does not damage its carmakers, who could face retaliatory measures from international partners, or fall within the scope of the new taxation if their digital revenues increased.  French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, one of the main supporters of the new levy, tried to facilitate a compromise by offering to add “a sunset clause” to the European Union tax. Under his proposal, the new tax would end once a deal is reached at global level on the taxation of digital companies. The clause was seen as a progress by EU partners. “There will be a sunset clause,” Austrian Finance Minister Hartwig Loeger said at the end of the EU meeting. The EU plan already foresees that the 3 percent levy would be only a temporary solution until a global deal is reached. Le Maire’s proposal makes clearer that the tax has an expiry date. France is also willing to consider ways to compensate Ireland for possible lost revenue, French officials said on Saturday. However, asked about this offer and other possible compensations, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe remained cautious and insisted on a global deal as the best solution. An overhaul of digital taxation has been for long under discussion at global level, but no compromise is in sight as large differences remain among rich nations. EU tax reforms require the backing of all its 28 member states to be adopted. Austria, who is holding the EU’s rotating presidency is working to find a compromise by the end of the year.   It has proposed reducing the scope of the tax, which would no longer be applied to the sale of users’ data as in the Commission proposal. Only revenue from online advertising services, in which Google and Facebook excel, and from virtual marketplaces, such as Amazon (AMZN.O), would be subject to the new tax. Eleven EU states are already planning national web taxes, which are likely to be adopted if no EU solution is agreed.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - A “wide range” of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) products including the Apple Watch would be affected by proposed U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, the company told U.S. trade officials, but gave no sign of an impact on its iPhone cash cow. Apple did not disclose specific revenues for most of the affected products, but of those the Apple Watch may be the biggest seller. It brought in about $6.1 billion(4.72 billion pounds) in revenue last year, according to an estimate from analyst firm Bernstein. That represents a small portion of Apple’s $229 billion in overall sales. Apple laid out the impact on its products of the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in an unsigned letter it submitted on Wednesday to U.S. officials as part of a public comment period. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking aboard Air Force One, said that he has tariffs on an additional $267 billion in Chinese goods “ready to go on short notice if I want.”  Cell phones, the biggest U.S. import from China, have so far been spared, but would be hit if Trump activates the new $267 billion tariff list. AirPods headphones, some of Apple’s Beats headphones and its new HomePod smart speaker also face levies as part of the proposed tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to the letter submitted on Wednesday. “Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,” Apple said in the letter. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. The letter did not mention the iPhone, which accounted for about two-thirds of Apple’s $229 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. The letter also made no mention of the iPad, which brought in $19.2 billion in sales in the most recent year, or most of its Mac computers, which generated $25.8 billion.  Apple did say its MacMini, a low-priced computer that comes without a keyboard or mouse, would be affected. Many Apple accessories, such as mice, keyboards, chargers and even leather covers for iPhones and iPads would face tariffs, Apple said. Reuters reported in July that the Apple Watch was likely to be affected by the tariffs. Shares of Apple closed down 0.8 percent in regular Nasdaq trade on Friday, and slipped another 1 percent in extended trading. Apple also said that computer parts for its U.S. operations would be hit by the tariffs. The company said that “main logic boards with microprocessing units” could face levies, along with equipment used for research and development. On Apple’s most recent earnings call in July, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company could face such tariffs “related to data centers.” In its letter, Apple argued that the way U.S. trade officials calculate the U.S. trade balance - attributing the entire value of a product to a country like China where final assembly happens - fails to reflect the true value that Apple generates in the United States. The company noted it spent $50 billion with 9,000 U.S. suppliers in its most recent fiscal year, including Texas-based chip firm Finisar Corp and Kentucky-based Corning Inc. “Given the balance of Apple’s economic footprint, the burden of the proposed tariffs will fall much more heavily on the United States than on China,” Apple said in its letter. The technology sector is one of the biggest potential losers in the proposed $200 billion tariff list. Fitness tracker maker Fitbit (FIT.N) said it would be hit by tariffs, and chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) said the levies could slow down the adoption of 5G networks, the next generation of wireless data technology for phones and other devices.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, was sentenced on Friday to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI during the agency’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has long denounced the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a witch hunt. Moscow denies interfering in the election. (The court documents related to Mueller's investigation are at www.justice.gov/sco) Mueller told Trump’s attorneys in March he was continuing to investigate the Republican president but did not consider him a criminal target “at this point,” the Washington Post reported in early April. The following is a list of people who have been indicted or convicted or are being investigated: * Papadopoulos, who was sentenced in federal court in Washington, had pleaded guilty in October to lying to FBI agents about the timing and significance of his contacts, including a professor who told him the Russians had “dirt” on Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. According to documents released with his guilty plea, Papadopoulos offered to help set up a meeting with then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.   * On Aug. 21, Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to campaign finance violations and other charges, saying he made payments to influence the 2016 election at the direction of a candidate for federal office. The deal included a possible prison sentence of up to five years and three months. * Also on Aug. 21, a jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, found former Trump election campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty on eight of 18 charges of filing false tax returns, failing to disclose his offshore bank accounts and bank fraud. The judge declared a mistrial on the remaining 10 counts, and prosecutors have yet to decide whether to retry him on the deadlocked charges. A second trial of Manafort, on separate charges brought by Mueller, is set to start on Sept. 17 in federal court in Washington. * Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump who was also a close campaign aide, pleaded guilty in December to lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia and agreed to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation. Mueller and Flynn’s defence team last month asked for more time before Flynn is sentenced. * Rick Gates, a former deputy campaign chairman for Trump, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy against the United States and lying to investigators, and agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation. * Alex Van der Zwaan, a lawyer who once worked closely with Manafort and Gates, pleaded guilty in February to lying to Mueller’s investigators about contacts with an official in the Trump election campaign. Van der Zwaan, the Dutch son-in-law of one of Russia’s richest men, was sentenced on April 3 to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000. * Twelve Russian intelligence officers were indicted by a federal grand jury on July 13, accused of hacking Democratic Party computer networks in 2016, in the most detailed U.S. accusation yet that Moscow meddled in the presidential election to help Trump. The Russian government has repeatedly denied meddling in the election. * Thirteen Russians and three Russian entities were indicted in Mueller’s investigation in February, accused of tampering in the 2016 election to support Trump. * Richard Pinedo, who was not involved with the Trump campaign, pleaded guilty in a case related to the Mueller probe in February to aiding and abetting interstate and foreign identity fraud by creating, buying and stealing hundreds of bank account numbers that he sold to individuals to use with large digital payment companies. Pinedo “made a mistake” but “had absolutely no knowledge” about who was buying the information or their motivations, his lawyer said. Sources familiar with the indictment said Pinedo was named as helping Russian conspirators launder money as well as purchase Facebook ads and pay for rally supplies. * Konstantin Kilimnik, a Manafort aide in Ukraine and political operative with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, was charged on June 8 with tampering with witnesses about their past lobbying for Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.

2019-02-08,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish centre-left bloc holds a slim lead over the centre-right ahead of Sunday’s national election, a survey showed, but both are short of a majority and the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats could yet emerge as the largest single party. The ruling Social Democrats and Greens, and their parliament ally the Left Party, were backed by 39.5 percent, according to Friday’s poll by Novus for public service broadcaster SVT.  The other of the two blocs that have defined Swedish politics for a decade, the four-party centre-right Alliance coalition, trailed close behind on 38.5 percent. The nationalist Sweden Democrats scored 19.1 percent, well above the 12.9 percent they won in the previous election in 2014.  Those figures suggest political gridlock may be hard to avoid after Sunday’s vote. “I think we are facing an extremely complicated process to form a government, maybe the most complicated in modern times,” said political scientist Niklas Bohlin at the Mid Sweden University.  Either some form of cooperation between the centre-left and Alliance or an accommodation with the Sweden Democrats is likely to be necessary. But the two blocs have never governed in tandem, and so far all other parties have shunned the Sweden Democrats. While most pollsters see the two blocs winning roughly equal support, the figures for the Sweden Democrats differ widely between surveys.   Ranging at about 16-19 percent in the traditional polls based on phone calls, the nationalists score as high as 25 percent in some online surveys, which have often been seen as at greater risk of being skewed. But the traditional polls greatly underestimated support for the Sweden Democrats before the previous election, while the online surveys were far closer to the result. “It’s not that they are shy voters, but that they are distrustful of the polling agencies,” said Henrik Ekengren Oscarsson, a professor in political science at Gothenburg University. “So the Sweden Democrats’ sympathisers are not participating in these kinds of surveys.” Traditional pollsters have said they have altered their methods to better reflect the level of support for the Sweden Democrats.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways apologised on Friday after the credit card details of hundreds of thousands of its customers were stolen over a two-week period in the most serious attack on its website and app. The airline discovered on Wednesday that bookings made between Aug. 21 and Sept. 5 had been infiltrated in a “very sophisticated, malicious criminal” attack, BA Chairman and Chief Executive Alex Cruz said. It immediately contacted customers when the extent of the breach became clear. Around 380,000 card payments were compromised, the airline said, with hackers obtaining names, street and email addresses, credit card numbers, expiry dates and security codes - sufficient information to steal from accounts. The attack came 15 months after the carrier suffered a massive computer system failure at London’s Heathrow airport, which stranded 75,000 customers over a holiday weekend. Shares in BA’s parent, International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), were down 2 percent in afternoon trading on Friday. Cruz said the carrier was “deeply sorry” for the disruption caused by the attack which was unprecedented in the more than 20 years that BA had operated online. He said the attackers had not broken the airline’s encryption but did not explain exactly how they had obtained the customer information. “There were other methods, very sophisticated efforts, by criminals in obtaining the data,” he told BBC radio. IT security company Avast said that based on the limited information available the attackers had probably targeted a gateway between the airline and a payment processor because no travel details had been stolen. “Quite often, when it’s just a hack of a database somewhere it is hard to identify when something has been compromised,” Avast’s consumer security expert Pete Turner said. “This feels much more like a transaction-type attack, where data is moving about within the system.” Britain’s government said authorities including the National Cyber Security Centre and the National Crime Agency, part of the country’s police, were piecing together what happened. “Specialist officers from the NCA’s National Cyber Crime Unit are managing the ongoing investigation and are on site working with BA to gain a better understanding of the incident,” the NCA said. The country’s Information Commissioner’s Office said it had been alerted by BA and it was making enquiries. Under new GDPR data regulations companies must inform regulators of a cyber attack within 72 hours.  BA advised customers to contact their bank or credit card provider and follow their recommended advice. It also took out ads in national newspapers on Friday. Cruz said anyone who lost out financially would be compensated by the airline. Data security expert Trevor Reschke said that like any website which sees large volumes of card transactions, BA was a ripe target for hackers.   “It is now a race between British Airways and the criminal underground,” said Reschke, head of threat intelligence at Trusted Knight. “One will be figuring out which cards have been compromised and alerting victims, whilst the other will be trying to abuse them while they are still fresh.” NatWest, one of Britain’s biggest card issuers, said it was receiving higher-than-usual call volumes because of the breach. It said in a recorded message that its security systems would likely stop any fraud as a result of the hack but anyone affected should look out for unusual activity on their accounts. American Express said clients did not need to take any action and the company would alert anyone with unusual activity on their cards. IAG said the data breach had been resolved and the website was working normally, and that no travel or passport details were stolen. After the computer system failure in May 2017, BA said it would take steps to ensure such an incident never happened again, but in July it was forced to cancel and delay flights out of the same airport due to problems with a supplier’s IT systems.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson, Britain’s former foreign secretary, said on Friday he had separated from his wife Marina Wheeler and the couple will divorce, the Press Association reported. Johnson is the bookmakers’ favourite to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May and is seen as someone who would lead Britain to a more radical departure from the European Union after being the figurehead of the “Leave” campaign in 2016. In a joint statement, Johnson and Wheeler said they separated some time ago and divorce proceedings had started. Johnson’s former adviser confirmed that a statement had been issued to the Press Association. The statement came after the Sun newspaper ran a front page story saying the couple, who have four children, had separated. “Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate. We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way,” the statement said, according to the Press Association.  Reuters attempted to contact Johnson, a former mayor of London, directly through phone calls to his office and by email. Johnson is one of the most recognisable figures in British politics thanks to his shock of blonde hair and colourful turn of phrase. Advocates of Brexit say he is the man who should succeed May, and he is popular with the party’s grassroots. “He’s still the favourite,” said bookmaker William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly, commenting on the odds of Johnson being the party’s next leader. “Over the years Boris has been very Teflon ... we think he’s got more than a couple of lives left yet.” Johnson served as foreign minister under May for two years until July, when he quit in protest at her Brexit negotiating strategy, saying it would leave Britain as a “colony” of the European Union. Since then, he has repeatedly criticised the strategy in parliament and through his regular newspaper column. May’s future and the direction the country will take at its most significant strategic juncture since the end of World War Two is subject to intense scrutiny as Britain enters the final phases of Brexit negotiations ahead of a March 2019 EU exit.  Her plan has little support in Brussels, which says she needs to agree to further concessions to make the plan workable, and within her party, where eurosceptics say she has already conceded too much ground by seeking a “common rule book” to permit free trade in goods.    “I think if the government was to fall then he would probably prosper at the point of maximum chaos but if she gets through Brexit I cannot see him becoming leader,” Giles Kenningham, a former adviser to 2010-2016 Prime Minister David Cameron, told Sky News.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways contacted affected customers as soon as it found out data from its website and mobile app had been breached, its boss said on Friday. BA, part of the International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), said late on Thursday financial data had been stolen from potentially hundreds of thousands of its customers who made online bookings in recent weeks. “The moment we found out that actual customer data had been compromised that’s when we began an all-out immediate communication to our customers, that was the priority,” Alex Cruz, BA’s chief executive and chairman, told BBC radio. He said any customers who lose out financially will be compensated by the airline. Cruz said the hack was not a breach of the airline’s encryption. “No, our data is encrypted,” he said. “There were other methods, very sophisticated efforts, by criminals in obtaining the data,” he said. “It was having access to our systems in an illicit way, it was very sophisticated.” Reporting by James Davey, Editing by Paul Sandle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iag-cybercrime-british-airways-commen/ba-says-notified-customers-as-soon-as-possible-after-data-breach-idUKKCN1LN0QQ,2019-02-08,"British Airways contacted affected customers as soon as it found out data from its website and mobile app had been breached, its boss said on Friday.",BA says notified customers as soon as possible after data breach
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uber launched a new app for its drivers in Britain on Friday with features to help them track their earnings, calculate driving time and avoid speeding, in the latest change to the way it operates.  The Silicon Valley-based company unveiled the app earlier this year and it is being rolled out globally.  Uber won a probationary licence to operate in London in June after it modified its business model to ease strained relations with the city’s transport authority, which had previously stripped the company of its right to operate in the capital. “Over the last few months we’ve introduced dozens of new features to improve things for licensed drivers, including sickness, injury, maternity and paternity payments,” said the company’s General Manager in Britain Tom Elvidge.  “The new, redesigned app is the next step - informed by drivers, for drivers - to make the Uber experience more transparent and a little less stressful,” he said.

2019-02-08,"PYONGYANG (Reuters) - North Korea’s celebrations marking its 70th anniversary on Sunday are expected to showcase a country that has secured a nuclear arsenal and is now focusing on developing its economy and cultivating international relations. Sunday’s events will kick off about a month of performances, as well as a trade show and other visits designed to drum up foreign investment and tourism spending in the sanctions-strapped country. Having declared his nuclear programme “complete,” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will use Sunday’s events to highlight his renewed focus on economic development, and possibly his diplomatic campaign that has netted him historic summits with the United States, China and South Korea this year, analysts say. “It is a day Kim Jong Un should reminisce the past 70 years of the republic, and it is an event where he has the pressure to offer a long-term statecraft vision that looks into more than 10 years that follow,” said Hong Min, senior researcher of Korea Institute for National Unification. “However, it won’t be easy for him this weekend, because he did not really achieve anything ground-breaking after he changed the national policy line to economy-first.” Economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons development have been squeezing the impoverished state, where some 40 percent of the population, or more than 10 million people, need humanitarian assistance and about 20 percent of children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. estimates. Under Kim’s one-man rule, the country has also been accused of widespread human rights abuses, with a U.N. report last year estimating between 80,000 and 120,000 people are held in prison camps. State media have called for the day to be “a celebration of the victor and continuously expand the results of the big economic development march.” For the first time in five years, Pyongyang is organising “Mass Games,” a huge, nationalist pageant performed by up to 100,000 people in one of the world’s largest stadiums. In downtown Pyongyang on Thursday, thousands of children in school uniforms could be seen practicing marching and playing music in Kim Il Sung square, and on street corners throughout the city.  Posters on major roads commemorated the anniversary and crews were seen patching the road between the airport and the city centre. One Air Koryo flight from Beijing to Pyongyang observed by Reuters was fully booked, mostly with foreign tourists and media. The events, especially the photogenic Mass Games, offer North Korea a chance to raise foreign currency from thousands of international visitors pouring into the capital, at a time when tourism remains one of the few remaining reliable sources of income amid U.N. sanctions targeting 90 percent of its $3 billion annual exports. While ticket prices for past Mass Games topped out at 300 euros (270.90 pounds), this year VIP seats cost 800 euros, said Simon Cockerell, general manager for the Koryo Tours agency. The cheapest seats are 100 euros, with several other pricing brackets in between. Despite the costs, demand is strong, he said. “There’s very high interest,” Cockerell said. “All the flights are full, all the hotels are full. It’s quite telling that Chinese tour companies were banned by the North Korean side from taking in any tourists until the middle of September, simply for capacity reasons.” The Korea Maritime Institute, a South Korean think-tank, estimates tourism generates $44 million a year for the isolated country, with Chinese tourists making up about 80 percent of foreign visitors to the North. So far, only one head of state, from Mauritania, is known to be visiting North Korea for the celebrations, something North Korea blames the United States for. “The U.S. is ... forcing other countries not to send high-level delegations to the celebrations of the 70th founding anniversary of the DPRK,” the North’s foreign ministry said in a statement published by state media KCNA last month.  After weeks of speculation that Chinese President Xi Jinping may make his first visit to Pyongyang on Sunday, Beijing announced on Tuesday the Chinese delegation would instead be led by parliament chief Li Zhanshu. North Korea is also hosting a trade show and other trips aimed at attracting foreign investors later in September, but many will remain wary of sanctions that still block many aspects of trade with the North. Michael Spavor, a Canadian business consultant who heads Paektu Cultural Exchange, said he is working with the North Korean government to bring about 25 Chinese investors and entrepreneurs to tour potential projects in Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampho. “We will attend matchmaking sessions with various government officials and stakeholders as well as visiting existing and future development zones,” Spavor told Reuters. Also on the expected schedule for Sunday is a torchlight procession, as well as a military parade, which will be closely watched for signs of new ballistic missiles or other advanced weaponry. North Korea routinely uses major holidays to showcase its military capabilities and the latest developments in missile technology. The website 38 North says satellite imagery suggests the military component of Sunday’s parade could be bigger than one held earlier this year, although no long-range ballistic missiles or their launchers have been spotted. “Display of military prowess has always been crucial in North Korean statecraft,” Hong, the researcher, said. “But North Korea does know that if they do display ICBMs, the international society will doubt their willingness for denuclearisation. It’s highly unlikely that North Korea would be risking it.” Reporting by Josh Smith; Additional reporting by Jeongmin Kim and Joyce Lee, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Lincoln Feast.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-anniversary-analysis/north-koreas-founding-anniversary-a-chance-for-kim-to-raise-cash-project-new-image-idUKKCN1LN0J1,2019-02-08,,"North Korea's founding anniversary a chance for Kim to raise cash, project new image"
2019-02-08,"SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has given his first time line for denuclearisation, aiming for the end of U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term, Seoul officials said on Thursday, prompting thanks from Trump who said they would “get it done together”. Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will meet in Pyongyang on Sept. 18-20 for a third summit and discuss “practical measures” towards denuclearisation, Moon’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said a day after meeting Kim. The summit could provide renewed momentum to talks over denuclearisation between North Korea and the United States, after Trump cancelled a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month citing lack of progress. Kim told South Korean officials his faith in Trump was “unchanged” and that he wanted denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and an end to hostile relations with the United States before Trump’s first term ends in early 2021, Chung said. But there was no indication that Kim had offered concrete steps towards giving up his nuclear arsenal, something some U.S. officials have said privately they doubt he is willing to do. “He particularly emphasised that he has never said anything negative about President Trump,” Chung said. Trump welcomed Kim’s remarks in a trademark Tweet. “Kim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims ‘unwavering faith in President Trump.’ Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!” Trump wrote. Trump had previously hailed his landmark June 12 summit with Kim as a success and said the North Korean nuclear threat was over, despite little evidence to back that assertion. In previous, failed talks, North Korea has said it could consider giving up its nuclear programme if the United States provided security guarantees by removing troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from the South and Japan. U.S. officials involved in the latest negotiations have said North Korea has refused to even start discussions about defining denuclearisation and has insisted the United States must first agree to simultaneous steps to reduce sanctions pressure. Some analysts suggested Kim was flattering Trump in hopes of dividing the president from advisers who have advocated a tougher U.S. stand. “Kim just owns Trump. He knows his mark,” Vipin Narang, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in nuclear issues, said in a message on Twitter. Pompeo, on a trip to New Delhi, said there was still “an enormous amount of work to do” on the denuclearisation issue. He visited Pyongyang in July, after which North Korea accused him of making “unilateral and gangster-like demands for denuclearisation”. Asked about U.S. intelligence that North Korea was still advancing its weapons programmes, Pompeo noted Pyongyang had ceased its nuclear tests and test-firing missiles, which he said was a “good thing.” “But the work of convincing Chairman Kim to make this strategic shift that we’ve talked about for a brighter future for the people of North Korea continues,” Pompeo said. The State Department later said Pompeo was sending his newly appointed North Korea envoy, Stephen Biegun, to South Korea, China and Japan from Sept. 10-15. Signalling that Washington’s concerns extend beyond Pyongyang’s nuclear programme, the U.S. government on Thursday charged and sanctioned an alleged North Korean hacker over the 2017 global WannaCry ransomware cyberattack, the 2014 cyber assault on Sony Corp. and other “malign cyber activities.”  Chung said Kim had stressed the need for the United States to reciprocate North Korea’s initial moves, which have included dismantling a nuclear test site and a missile engine facility. “We support progress in inter-Korean relations and President Moon’s statements that such progress must go hand-in-hand with denuclearisation,” a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council (NSC) said when asked about the meeting North Korea’s official KCNA news agency said Kim told the South’s envoys that his “fixed stand” was to turn the Korean peninsula into “a cradle of peace without nuclear weapons, free from nuclear threat”. Chung said Kim showed “frustration over the doubt raised by some parts of the international community about his willingness to denuclearise, and asked us to convey his message to the United States”. “He expressed his strong will to carry out more proactive measures towards denuclearisation if action is taken in response to the North’s preemptive steps,” Chung said. Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said: “Looks like Kim is trying to wash away worries that talks could stall or fail, knowing well that Washington is losing patience.” U.S. officials have previously said they have already made conciliatory gestures, such as suspending joint military exercises with South Korea. During his meeting with Kim, Chung delivered a message from Trump and will relay comments from Kim to U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, Moon’s spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told reporters. Chung later spoke to Bolton, the NSC official said. Trump spoke to Moon on the evening before Chung’s trip and asked Moon to act as “chief negotiator” between Washington and Pyongyang, the spokesman said. However, a three-way summit between Trump, Kim and Moon - an idea that South Korea has floated - is not expected on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York this month, Chung said, suggesting that Kim is not likely to become the first North Korean leader to attend the gathering. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised the Koreas for their trust-building efforts and expressed hope for further progress towards “complete and verifiable denuclearisation,” his spokesman said. Kim and Trump held an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June, in which the North Korean leader made a broad, vague commitment to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But negotiations have stalled, while signs North Korea has maintained work on its weapons have emerged. Under discussion is whether North Korean denuclearisation or declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War should come first. The war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led U.N. forces are technically still at war with the North. “The United States shouldn’t delay any further an end-of-war declaration, which the U.S. president promised at the Singapore summit,” the North’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said. U.S. officials have said such a declaration could weaken North Korea’s incentive for denuclearisation, and create uncertainty about the purpose of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.

2019-02-08,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s government on Thursday moved to prevent people convicted of serious corruption from ever working with the state again with a bill it says will save billions of euros. The so-called “bribe destroyer” or “spazzacorrotti” bill is a brainchild of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which took office after campaigning against the rampant corruption that has characterised Italian politics in the past.  Five-star has governed in a coalition with the far-right League party since June.  Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who is also 5-Star leader, told reporters the bill would save the state “billions” of euros. He did not specify how that figure had been calculated. Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede, also 5-Star member, hailed the bill as a “revolution in the fight against corruption,” after the cabinet approved it. “This is the first in a series of measures that should make the country competitive again,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.  The bill now goes to parliament. The coalition has a majority in both houses, but Italian legislation is often amended by deputies before becoming law. Under the government’s draft, anyone convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than two years in prison will never be able to hold public office or seek a state contract again, Bonafede said. Those convicted of corruption crimes carrying sentences of less than two years will be shut out of public business for five to seven years, he said. The legislation would also allow undercover agents to work on corruption investigations for the first time.  Another component of the bill is that it will require full transparency on private and corporate contributions to political parties and foundations, Di Maio said. “This will allow us to finally understand why over the years we’ve seen some policy choices made that went against the interests of citizens,” he said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) of using violent protests over a fatal stabbing blamed on migrants to stir up ethnic tension. Far-right groups clashed with police and chased people they deemed to be migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz on Aug. 26 after police said a Syrian and an Iraqi had been detained as suspects in the killing of a 35-year-old German man. AfD leader Alexander Gauland had earlier this week urged a “peaceful revolution” against Merkel’s liberal immigration policy and said this required banishing politicians and members of the media who support the “Merkel system”. Asked about the role of the AfD in the events in Chemnitz, Merkel told the RTL broadcaster: “The AfD is stirring up the mood and this has to be said clearly. I view some of their remarks very critically.” The protests in Chemnitz have set off a debate about whether politicians are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in a country where many had thought the lessons of Germany’s Nazi history had been learned. The protests, during which some members of an 800-strong crowd performed the illegal Hitler salute, laid bare the divisions in Germany over Merkel’s decision in 2015 to take in around one million, mostly Muslim asylum seekers. A survey of 1,002 voters for broadcaster ARD, conducted on Monday and Tuesday and published on Thursday, showed just 27 percent believed the integration of refugees into society had been successful, with 69 percent believing it had gone badly. Some in Germany blame Merkel’s liberal immigration policy for the rise of the AfD, which entered parliament for the first time in an election last year as the third-largest party. After the violence in Chemnitz, German politicians urged intelligence agencies to start monitoring the far-right party, some of whose members marched with supporters of the anti-Islam PEGIDA group in the city last weekend to protest the stabbing. Merkel repeated her position in the RTL interview that only intelligence chiefs can decide whether to monitor the party. “We first want to deal with the AfD politically,” Merkel said. The state intelligence agency in Thuringia on Thursday said it would examine whether the AfD’s state chapter was pursuing anti-constitutional goals, a possible step towards putting the group under official surveillance. Merkel’s immigration policy has also caused a rift within her conservative bloc, which includes her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Christian Social Union (CSU) Bavarian allies, that almost toppled her coalition government in June. Interior Minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer had threatened to pull out of the coalition government over immigration. In an interview with the Rheinische Post published on Thursday, Seehofer said: “People are annoyed and outraged because of such homicides and I understand that. “If I had not been a minister, I would have taken to the streets as a citizen, but of course not with the radicals.” He added: “I understand it when people protest, but this doesn’t make them Nazis.” Seehofer has taken an increasingly hardline stance on immigration as his party tries to fight off a strong challenge from the AfD in October’s regional election in Bavaria. Seehofer was rebuked by politicians and Germans on social media for telling CSU members in the eastern state of Brandenburg on Wednesday: “Migration is the mother of all problems.” Asked what she thought about Seehofer’s remark, Merkel said: “I say it differently. Migration presents us with challenges and here we have problems but also successes.” Additional reporting by Andreas Rinke, Hans-Edzard Busemann and Paul Carrel; Editing by Michelle Martin and Janet Lawrence",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-protests/merkel-accuses-far-right-party-of-stoking-ethnic-tension-idUKKCN1LM1VF,2019-02-08,,Merkel accuses far-right party of stoking ethnic tension
2019-02-08,"LONDON/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - One in three news articles shared online about the upcoming Swedish election come from websites publishing deliberately misleading information, most with a right-wing focus on immigration and Islam, Oxford University researchers say. Their study, published on Thursday, points to widespread online disinformation in the final stages of a tightly-contested campaign which could mark a lurch to the right in one of Europe’s most prominent liberal democracies.  The authors, from the Oxford Internet Institute, labelled certain websites “junk news”, based on a range of detailed criteria. Reuters found the three most popular sites they identified have employed former members of the Sweden Democrats party; one has a former MP listed among its staff. It was not clear whether the sharing of “junk news” had affected voting intentions in Sweden, but the study helps show the impact platforms such as Twitter (TWTR.N) and Facebook (FB.O) have on elections, and how domestic or foreign groups can use them to exacerbate sensitive social and political issues. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, whose centre-left Social Democrats have dominated politics since 1914 but are now unlikely to secure a ruling majority, told Reuters the spread of false or distorted information online risked shaking “the foundations of democracy” if left unchecked. The Institute, a department of Oxford University, analysed 275,000 tweets about the Swedish election from a 10-day period in August. It counted articles shared from websites it identified as “junk news” sources, defined as outlets which “deliberately publish misleading, deceptive or incorrect information purporting to be real news”.  “Roughly speaking, for every two professional content articles shared, one junk news article was shared. Junk news therefore constituted a significant part of the conversation around the Swedish general election,” it said. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on the results of the study. Facebook, where interactions between users are harder to track, said it was working with Swedish officials to help voters spot disinformation. It has also partnered with Viralgranskaren - an arm of Sweden’s Metro newspaper - to identify, demote and counterbalance “false news” on its site. Joakim Wallerstein, head of communications for the Sweden Democrats, said he had no knowledge of or interest in the party sympathies of media outlets. Asked to comment on his party’s relationship with the sites identified by the study, he said he had been interviewed by one of them once. “I think it is strange that a foreign institute is trying to label various news outlets in Sweden as ‘junk news’ and release such a report in connection to an election,” he said.      Swedish security officials say there is currently no evidence of a coordinated online attempt by foreign powers to sway the Sept. 9 vote, despite repeated government warnings about the threat. But Mikael Tofvesson, head of the counter influence team at the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), a government agency tasked with safeguarding the election, said the widespread sharing of false or distorted information makes countries more vulnerable to hostile influence operations.  “Incorrect and biased reporting promotes a harder, harsher tone in the debate, which makes it easier to throw in disinformation and other deceptive tools,” he said. Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute’s Project on Computational Propaganda, said most of the “junk news” in Sweden supported right-wing policies, and was largely focused on issues around immigration and Islam. The top three “junk news” sources identified by the study - right-wing websites Samhallsnytt, Nyheter Idag and Fria Tider - accounted for more than 85 percent of the “junk news” content. Samhallsnytt received donations through the personal bank account of a Sweden Democrat member between 2011-2013 when it operated under the name Avpixlat. A former Sweden Democrat member of parliament, who also previously ran the party’s youth wing, is listed on the Samhallsnytt website as a columnist. Samhallsnytt often publishes articles saying Sweden is under threat from Islam. In June, for example, it said a youth soccer tournament in the second-biggest city had banned pork as “haram” - or forbidden under Islamic law. The article is still online with the headline: “Islam is the new foundation of the Gothia Cup - pork proclaimed ‘haram’”. A tournament organiser told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper that caterers had not served pork for more than 10 years for practical reasons, and there was no ban against eating or selling pork at the event.  Samhallsnytt and Fria Tider did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Commenting before the Oxford study was published, Nyheter Idag founder Chang Frick disputed the “junk news” label and said his website followed ethical journalistic practices, citing its membership of Sweden’s self-regulated Press Council body. “Yes, we put our editorial perspective on news, of course, like everyone else,” he said. “If you are doing a tabloid you cannot have dry, boring headlines, it should have some punch to it. But we do not lie, we do not make false accusations.” Social media companies have come under increasing pressure to tackle disinformation on their platforms following accusations that Russia and Iran tried to meddle in domestic politics in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Moscow and Tehran deny the allegations. A report by the Swedish Defence Research Institute last week said the number of automated Twitter accounts discussing the upcoming election almost doubled in July from the previous month. Such so-called “bot” accounts shared articles from Samhallsnytt and Fria Tider more frequently than real people, the report said, and were 40 percent more likely to express support for the Sweden Democrats. Facebook said its work with Viralgranskaren to fact check content on its sites helped it quickly identify “false news.”  The company declined to give specific figures about the amount or sources of false news it had recorded around the Swedish election, but said any flagged content is given a lower position on its site, a practice known as “downranking” which it says cuts views by 80 percent. Users who see disputed articles are also shown other sources of verified information, it said. In a blog post on its website, Twitter says it “should not be the arbiter of truth”. But the MSB’s counter influence team’s head Tofvesson said there had been a “positive increase” in the work of Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies to help safeguard the election, largely via better communication and coordination with local authorities.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Sweden holds a parliamentary election on Sunday dominated by immigration and its effects on the welfare system. The Social Democrats, who lead a minority coalition government, are campaigning on a promise to boost welfare spending if elected for a four-year term.   The Alliance, which groups four centre-right parties, promises income tax cuts and more spending on welfare. The far-right Sweden Democrats are campaigning on a platform of law and order and tighter policies on immigration. The Social Democrats and the centre-right Moderates, the biggest party in the Alliance, have vowed to get tough on crime and keep in place temporary immigration restrictions introduced in 2015.   A coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens, backed by the Left Party, is polling at around 40 percent. The polls put the Alliance, grouping the Moderates, the Christian Democrats, the Centre Party and the Liberals, on around 38 percent. The Sweden Democrats have just under 20 percent. Below are their policies on the main issues.   - Boost spending by more than 70 billion Swedish crowns ($7.70 billion) in the next four years to strengthen the welfare system.    - Give local authorities an extra 20 billion crowns over four years. - Raise pensions and reduce income taxes for retirees, costing the state around 14.6 billion crowns over four years. - Give schools an extra 7.3 billion crowns and raise military spending by 7 billion crowns over four years. - Provide an additional 4.4 billion crowns for the police over the same period. - Impose a tax on banks and increase taxes on capital to bring in 5.0 billion crowns a year. - Make changes to rules on tax deductions that companies can make and increase taxes on private healthcare insurance and on new, heavily polluting cars to bring in an additional 5 billion crowns annually. - Total spending in the government budget was 941 billion crowns in 2017. - Increase spending during over four years by around 37 billion crowns and cut taxes by 50 billion crowns. - Give an extra 20 billion crowns to local authorities over the same period but with certain conditions. - Provide the police with an extra 6.5 billion crowns, and increase defence spending by 10.5 billion crowns during the term.  - Make income tax cuts - through higher in-work credits and lower taxes on pensions - totalling 43 billion crowns over four years.  - Make other tax cuts, including reducing fuel taxes and making minor changes to company taxes, bringing the total to around 50 billion crowns over four years. - Make tax increases, including of VAT on food and restaurant meals, to bring in around 13 billion crowns over four years. - Cut spending, for example to employment schemes, to save 20 billion crowns over the next four years.

The Social Democrats have said these will remain in place until there are Europe-wide rules, including on asylum quotas. - The Moderates support extending the current asylum regulations.  - They want tougher rules for acquiring citizenship.  - The Sweden Democrats say recent restrictions do not go far enough. - They say Sweden should only take asylum seekers who come from its neighbours — Denmark, Norway and Finland — and call for the introduction of tougher requirements for citizenship, including a language and culture test. - They also want to limit labour migration and hold a referendum on Sweden’s EU membership. Both parties want a more liberal immigration policy than their partners in the Alliance, particularly in relation to reuniting refugee children with their families. Both also want a common EU asylum policy. - The two parties want to return to a more generous immigration policy. The Greens were close to quitting the coalition over tighter rules introduced in 2015.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will announce plans next week to strengthen its external borders and push foreign states to do more to deter migrants.  The plans are a last effort by the European Commission led by Jean-Claude Juncker to toughen policy on an issue that has divided Europe since 2015 when more than a million refugees and migrants arrived across the Mediterranean. But disagreements between EU states make a comprehensive deal on migration unlikely before the new Commission and parliament arrive next year. Juncker will also propose more pathways for migrants to get to the EU legally including on study or work visas as he makes his last State of the Union speech in the European Parliament next Wednesday before stepping down. The Commission will release proposals including to enhance the mandate of the bloc’s Frontex agency for external borders, diplomats and officials said. At the same time Austria, which currently holds the bloc’s presidency, is trying to break a deadlock between member states over how to handle refugees and migrants who arrive by sea. Under Vienna’s proposal of “mandatory solidarity”, EU states could accept refugees and migrants, provide experts or equipment for the bloc’s external borders or make other contributions. The plan does not require all member states to host new arrivals. The EU’s ex-communist eastern members oppose hosting these people - just one issue that has damaged the bloc’s unity. This year, sea arrivals stand at some 70,000 people, a fraction of the mass influx in 2015 that overwhelmed EU states and stretched services, precipitating a rise in the bloc’s populist, nationalist and anti-immigration parties.  “We are still handling an acute political crisis in the EU, even though the arrivals are next to none,” a senior diplomat in Brussels said.  Italy remains opposed to Austria’s plan. Rome has pushed more rigid anti-immigration policies and denied several rescue ships access to its ports. It says other EU states should take in the migrants.  EU leaders will discuss migration again at a summit in Salzburg on Sept. 19-20.  They will also discuss stepping up returns and deportations of people who make it to the EU but fail to win asylum.  The EU is entering a campaign season with European Parliament elections due next May and a new Commission to be installed in late 2019.  As a result, member states would have to agree a new migration package this year to give the Parliament a chance to approve it before its final session in mid-April, diplomats say. The Commission’s new measures further develop policies implemented since 2015 that have contributed to a sharp decrease in migration by sea. Rights groups say the policies leave migrants vulnerable to abuses and death on land and at sea. The bloc’s idea for “regional disembarkation platforms” around the Mediterranean aimed to open EU ports for rescue ships and then spread the migrants on board across the bloc.  The plan was honed after an EU summit last June that saw Italy and Germany face off through the night. But it appears stillborn as member states remain reluctant to take immigrants in, let alone through an obligatory scheme.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, embraced judicial independence on Wednesday but sidestepped Senate Democrats’ questions on whether a president can pardon himself or fire a prosecutor investigating him. Kavanaugh faced a grueling session of more than 12 hours of questioning before a Senate panel that was disrupted repeatedly by shouting protesters. Senators pressed the conservative federal appeals court judge on his views about presidential power, abortion, gun rights and race issues.  All four issues deeply divide Americans and could come before the Supreme Court, with Kavanaugh likely to tip the court in an even more conservative direction.  Kavanaugh signalled respect for the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, calling it an important legal precedent that had been reaffirmed by the justices over the decades. He condemned the spate of U.S. school shootings but defended an opinion he wrote questioning whether semi-automatic rifles could be banned. He also defended his record on race issues. Senate Democrats have vowed a fierce fight to block Kavanaugh’s nomination. However, with Trump’s fellow Republicans holding a slim Senate majority and no sign of defections in Republican ranks, it remains likely Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the lifetime job on the top U.S. judicial body. With Trump’s presidency clouded by a widening probe into Russian election meddling, Kavanaugh declined to pledge to step aside from any cases that might come before the court involving Trump’s conduct. Kavanaugh said in reply to a question from Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal he could not commit to recusing himself from any cases involving investigations or civil lawsuits relating to the president. “To be consistent with the principle of the independence of the judiciary, I should not and may not make a commitment about how I would handle a particular case,” Kavanaugh said. Trump has often criticized the judiciary. Some liberals have expressed concern Kavanaugh could be a rubber stamp for Trump and protect him from lawsuits and investigations. Asked by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican, whether he would have any trouble ruling against Trump or the executive branch, Kavanaugh replied: “No one is above the law in our constitutional system.” “I think the first quality of a good judge in our constitutional system is independence,” Kavanaugh said. Kavanaugh dodged Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein’s question about whether a sitting president can “be required to respond to a subpoena,” a query that could come into play as Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigates potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. “I can’t give you an answer on that hypothetical question,” Kavanaugh said. He sidestepped Democratic Senator Christopher Coons’ query on whether he still believed, as he wrote 20 years ago, that a president could fire a special prosecutor investigating him. “All I can say is that was my view in 1998,” Kavanaugh said. He also avoided Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy’s question about whether a president could pardon himself, or someone else, in exchange for a promise not to testify against him. Trump claimed in a Twitter post in June “the absolute right to PARDON myself.” Kavanaugh said: “The question of self-pardons is something I have never analyzed.” In citing examples of judicial independence, Kavanaugh lauded a 1974 ruling that ordered President Richard Nixon to hand over subpoenaed materials during the Watergate scandal and a 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ended racial segregation in public schools. Feinstein asked Kavanaugh about his 2009 article that concluded sitting presidents should be free from the distractions of civil lawsuits, criminal prosecutions and investigations. Kavanaugh promised a “completely open mind” if such issues came before him as a Supreme Court justice.  Trump told reporters at the White House he was pleased with the hearing and said: “The other side is grasping at straws.” Liberals are concerned Kavanaugh could provide a decisive fifth vote on the nine-justice court to overturn the 1973 abortion ruling. Kavanaugh called the Roe v. Wade decision “an important precedent of the Supreme Court that has been reaffirmed many times.” He highlighted the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling that reaffirmed Roe, calling it a “precedent on precedent.” While stopping short of saying the Roe case correctly decided, Kavanaugh’s remarks suggested he might be cautious toward overturning it. But that may not preclude him from joining the court’s other conservatives in restricting its scope by upholding abortion restrictions enacted in conservative states. Pressed by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, Kavanaugh defended a ruling he took part in that issued an order preventing a 17-year-old illegal immigrant, detained by U.S. authorities in Texas, from immediately having an abortion. The ruling was later overturned and she had the abortion. On gun rights, Feinstein pressed Kavanaugh on his 2011 dissent in an appellate ruling upholding a District of Columbia gun law banning semi-automatic rifles. Kavanaugh said then that such guns were covered by the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms.  “Of course the violence in the schools is something we all detest and want to do something about,” Kavanaugh said. Responding to questions from Democratic Senator Cory Booker on race issues, including promoting diversity in education, Kavanaugh cited cases in which he ruled in favour of minorities and his efforts to hire law clerks from diverse backgrounds “I have done my best to understand the real world and apply the law fairly.” Kavanaugh said. Trump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron’s popularity has hit a record low following the resignation of a popular minister and a summer scandal over his bodyguard, a poll showed on Thursday. Only 23 percent of those surveyed reported a favourable opinion of Macron in September, down from 27 percent last month, the YouGov poll for Le Huff Post and CNEWS found. Macron’s popularity is low in most polls but the YouGov survey pegged it worse than others and indicated poor ratings across the political spectrum. The former investment banker has sold his pro-business reform drive on promises that it will boost growth and jobs, but many voters ranging from conservative pensioners to low-income workers complain his policies mostly benefit companies and the rich. He was dealt a blow last week with the surprise resignation of his environment minister, a popular former activist and TV presenter, during a live radio interview. In July his leadership was put to the test when a scandal broke out as video emerged showing his top bodyguard beating May Day protesters. Meanwhile, soft economic data has raised questions about whether he has the right recipe for growth while hesitation over a tax collection reform has painted him as unusually indecisive. His government has repeatedly shrugged off poor poll ratings, insisting it will not waver on the reform agenda as politically sensitive overhauls of unemployment insurance and pensions loom in the months ahead. The YouGov poll was conducted on Aug. 29-30 with a sample of 1,099 people.

2019-02-08,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian military shelled the last stronghold of active rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday as a war monitor said insurgents blew up another bridge in anticipation of a government offensive.  Damascus, backed by allies Russia and Iran, has been preparing an assault to recover Idlib and adjacent areas of the northwest, and resumed air strikes along with Russia on Tuesday after weeks of lull. Idlib’s fate now appears likely to rest on the results of Friday’s Tehran summit between the leaders of Russia, Turkey and Iran - a meeting that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov on Wednesday said would make the situation “clearer”. Russia’s Defence Ministry said Tuesday’s air strikes had only targeted militants and not struck populated areas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said they had killed 13 civilians, including children, but no fighters.  The ministry said it had targeted buildings used to store weapons and explosives including a facility used to assemble explosive-packed drones that rebels have used to attack Russian planes stationed at Hmeymim air base.  Syrian state media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that pro-government forces focused their shelling overnight and on Wednesday on the western and southern edges of the rebel enclave.  The countryside around Jisr al-Shughour in the west of the enclave was also the main target for Tuesday’s air strikes, rescue workers, a rebel source and the British-based Observatory said.  Turkey, which has a small military presence in observation posts it has erected along the frontlines between rebels and government forces, reiterated its warnings against an offensive. Its president, Tayyip Erdogan, was quoted by a Turkish newspaper saying an attack on Idlib would be “a serious massacre” and he hoped for a positive outcome from a summit with Russian and Iranian leaders on the matter on Friday. The prospect of an offensive in Idlib has alarmed humanitarian agencies. The United Nations has said displaced people already make up about half of the 3 million people living in rebel-held areas of the northwest.  The human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement on Wednesday that the lives of “millions of people in Idlib are now in the hands of Russia, Turkey and Iran”, and urged all parties not to attack civilians.  Idlib’s rebel factions are divided, with a jihadist alliance that includes al Qaeda’s former official Syrian affiliate holding most ground. The alliance, Tahrir al-Sham, is designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations.  Russia has described Idlib as a “nest of terrorists” and a “festering abscess” that must be resolved. The United Nations Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura on Tuesday urged Russia and Turkey to find a solution and avert a bloodbath.  Several other factions in Idlib, including some that fought under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, this year joined together into a new alliance backed by Turkey.  This grouping, known as the National Liberation Front, also holds several important areas in and around Idlib. On Wednesday, one of the factions in it, the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham group, destroyed a bridge on the western side of the enclave, the Observatory said.  Two other bridges were destroyed last week in anticipation of a government offensive, which a source close to Damascus has said is ready, and will be carried out in phases.

2019-02-08,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday, saying he was hopeful of “a reset of relations” long strained over the war in Afghanistan. Pompeo’s visit, along with the U.S. chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was the first high-level U.S. mission to the new government. It aimed to smooth over tensions after President Donald Trump took a tough new line towards Pakistan over longstanding accusations it is not doing enough to root out Afghan Taliban fighters on its territory. Pompeo met with Khan as well as Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and the country’s powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa. “We talked about their new government, the opportunity to reset the relationship between our two countries across a broad spectrum,” including business ties and ending the war in Afghanistan, Pompeo told reporters before leaving for India. “And I’m hopeful that the foundation that we laid today will set the conditions for continued success as we start to move forward.” Khan, a former cricket star who swept to power in the July elections, also struck a positive tone. “I’m a born optimist. A sportsman always is an optimist. He steps on the field and he thinks he’s going to win,” Khan told reporters.  Pompeo expressed confidence in a new beginning in relations with nuclear-armed Pakistan, but conceded: “We’ve still got a long way to go.” “We made clear to them that – and they agreed – it’s time for us to begin to deliver on our joint commitments,” Pompeo said, without specifically mentioning the Taliban. The meetings come against a backdrop of tense ties and U.S. military aid cuts over Islamabad’s alleged reluctance to crack down on militants. Washington has accused Islamabad of turning a blind eye to, or helping, Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network fighters who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so. Pompeo landed in Islamabad minutes after the plane carrying U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Ahead of the talks, Dunford said Trump’s South Asia strategy set clear expectations for Pakistan, including help to drive the Taliban to a peace process in neighbouring Afghanistan. “Our bilateral relationship moving forward is very much going to be informed by the degree of cooperation we see from Pakistan in doing that,” he told reporters. The United States has withheld $800 million in overall assistance this year, cuts Pakistan says are unwarranted as it incurs expenses in fighting militants who threaten U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Pompeo was also expected to discuss Pakistan’s possible plans to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease currency pressures and avert an economic crisis.  In July, Pompeo said there was “no rationale” for the IMF  to give money to Pakistan that would then be used to pay off Chinese loans, comments that further rattled Islamabad. Pompeo is next due to visit India, Pakistan’s neighbour and bitter foe, where he is expected to put pressure on New Delhi over its purchases of Iranian oil and Russian missile systems. He and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet their Indian counterparts in New Delhi on Thursday and are expected to finalise defence pacts that could bring their militaries closer amid growing Chinese influence across Asia. The talks come as U.S. hostility rises towards India’s traditional allies Iran and Russia, targets of U.S. sanctions. Iran is a big oil supplier to India, and two-thirds of its military equipment is from Russia. The United States is concerned about India’s planned purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems from Moscow. An Indian defence ministry official said the country had nearly concluded commercial negotiations with Russia for the systems and intended to proceed with them, to boost defences against China. India has said it will not completely halt oil imports from Iran, but will finalise its strategy on crude purchases after this week’s meeting with U.S. officials.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple farmers across the U.S. Northwest fear they will be the next victims of a U.S.-China trade war that left cherry growers in the same region with weak prices and having to scramble for alternative buyers because of prohibitive Chinese tariffs.  U.S. President Donald Trump has dealt a blow to farmers this year with strong-arm trade tactics that have prompted retaliation from key markets for U.S. products, including the sweet cherries and apples that speckle landscapes across the Western United States from summer through autumn.  “We’d like this to be settled right away, but it doesn’t seem like it will be, so we’re just holding on,” said Ray Norwood, director of sales and marketing for Auvil Fruit Co, a Washington grower of cherries and apples. The apple is the state’s top agricultural crop, representing some $2 billion (1.56 billion pounds)to $2.5 billion in sales each year, according to the Washington Apple Commission. While the bulk of these apples are consumed domestically, about 30 percent are exported and are vulnerable to tariffs. China is the world’s largest producer of the fruit, but it has also become a major destination for U.S.-grown varieties like Red Delicious and Gala apples, according to industry experts. Cherry producers, which ship about a third of their fragile and highly perishable crop overseas, saw shipments held up at Chinese ports and ultimately slapped with prohibitive duties in the harvest, which ran through mid-August. That had a notable impact on Auvil’s bottom line, Norwood said.  Auvil had to lower prices and find alternative destinations as China is one of the top three export markets for about 80 percent of the farm’s cherry sales.  One Shanghai-based fruit retailer said many cherries went to Hong Kong instead of Mainland China. Prices there dropped from an average of HK$50 (US$6.40) per pound to as low as HK$30 per pound in a landmark century-old fruit market in Kowloon’s Yau Ma Tei district.   Growers of apples and other speciality crops are worried they may experience the same fate that cherry growers and shippers already faced: having to scramble for alternative buyers at lower prices because steep duties imposed by China, India and Mexico make their products too expensive for those markets. The governments of those key destinations have countered Trump’s tariffs with hefty levies of their own. The same uncertainty is plaguing growers of almonds, pistachios, pears, peaches and other produce and high-value crops. The direct impact of the tariffs on U.S. fruit, vegetable and tree nut sales is expected to swell to more than $2.6 billion, according to a recent study conducted by University of California Davis economists. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a $12 billion aid package last week that included $1.2 billion for the  purchase of apples, pears, pistachios and other such crops, but farmers said it likely would not be enough.  Dennis Nuxoll, vice president of federal affairs for the Western Growers in Washington, DC, said the group never expected U.S. Department of Agriculture to make up for growers’ losses but had hoped for more direct assistance.  The group said in a statement that the aid program “will fall substantially short.” Auvil is based in Orondo, a town nestled in Washington state, home to about 60 percent of U.S. fresh apple production.  Apple sellers like Auvil are bracing for the same downturn that hit cherries, just as U.S. orchards ramp up harvesting of some 4.7 million tonnes.  “I don’t know just how much it’ll be down, but we do think it’ll be drastic,” said Rebecca Lyons, international marketing director of the Washington Apple Commission in Wenatchee, Washington, noting effective 50 percent levies on U.S. apples in China. Mexico, India and China, which are expected to have duties in place during the shipping season, represent about half of total U.S. export volumes of the fruit, she said. “The global apple market is very competitive ...

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - An exit deal between Britain and the European Union is within sight, Brexit minister Dominic Raab told parliament on Tuesday, as lawmakers from all sides told him the current negotiating plan had little hope of winning their approval. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019 but has yet to secure an agreement to define future relations with Brussels and manage the economic impact of ending over four decades of integration with the world’s largest trading bloc. Brussels has dismissed key elements of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy, formulated in July at her Chequers country retreat, and it has been widely criticised by both those who want a more radical break from the EU and those who want even closer ties.  Nevertheless, Raab was upbeat when delivering a summary of progress in the negotiations to parliament on its first day back after the summer break. “We have made significant progress, we are making significant progress every week ... and a deal is within our sights,” he said. However, other lawmakers were less positive, indicating that May’s minority government will struggle to find support for whatever deal it strikes with Brussels. May must win parliamentary approval on a deal, or risk leaving the EU without any formal agreement. “Chequers is a dead as a dodo. The secretary of state (Raab) knows that and so does everyone else in this House,” said Tom Brake, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrat party. Raab said he disagreed, describing the negotiations as “positive”.  Earlier, May’s spokesman said Britain had to step up efforts to get a deal, describing talks as at a “crucial and intense phase”. Nevertheless, with an October deadline for a deal expected to slip into November and little sign of breakthrough on fundamental disagreements with the EU, financial markets remain nervous about the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal.    A senior official at the Brexit ministry said he was confident that plans were in place for the possibility of  a no-deal exit. Raab said that while ‘no deal’ was not what the government wants, there would be some “countervailing opportunities”. But the main opposition Labour Party’s Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer said Raab had failed to reassure anyone, and that May’s Brexit negotiating strategy would not survive intact.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council will hold a meeting on Friday on the situation in Syria’s Idlib province, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday, warning Syria’s government not to use chemical weapons ahead of a widely expected military offensive there. Russian and Syrian planes pounded areas on the western edge of Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, on Tuesday, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a rebel source. A Syrian government minister also said the siege of Idlib would probably be resolved by force. “This is a tragic situation, and if they want to continue to go the route of taking over Syria, they can do that,” Haley said at a news conference, referring to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as well as its allies Russia and Iran. “But they cannot do it with chemical weapons. They can’t do it assaulting their people and we’re not going to fall for it,” she added. The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has documented systematic use of banned munitions in Syria’s civil war, including nerve agent sarin and sulfur mustard gas. But the body, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,  has not assigned blame for the attacks. “If there are chemical weapons that are used, we know exactly who’s going to use them,” Haley said.

2019-02-08,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey told the United States on Tuesday that Kurdish militants must completely abandon Syria, the Turkish defence ministry said, as violence in the rebel-held northern Syrian enclave of Idlib escalated. Earlier on Tuesday, Russia resumed its air strikes against insurgents in Idlib after 22 days, following weeks of aerial bombardment and shelling against rebels by pro-Syrian government forces in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has sworn to recapture every inch of Syria and has made big gains against rebels since Russia joined his war effort in 2015.  Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran, which also backs Assad, was making efforts to remove militants from Idlib with the least human cost. Turkey, which has backed some rebels against Assad, has previously said that a military operation into Idlib, the last major rebel enclave in the country, would be disastrous.  U.S. President Donald Trump warned Assad and his allies on Monday not to “recklessly attack” Idlib, saying hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Russia, however, dismissed the comments and said the area was a “nest of terrorism”. During talks in Ankara on Tuesday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told U.S. special representative for Syria, James Jeffrey, that Turkey wanted Kurdish militants to fully abandon the region, the ministry said in a statement. It said Akar and Jeffrey also discussed recent developments in Syria and the minister conveyed Turkey’s discomfort with the presence of Kurdish militants in the region. The request comes as Turkish and U.S. forces are carrying out joint patrols in the northwestern Syrian city of Manbij as part of a roadmap to clear the area of YPG militants. Turkey has been infuriated with Washington’s support for the YPG militia, which Ankara sees as an extension of the insurgent Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Turkey has also carried out two-cross border operations against the YPG in Syria. In a move long sought by Turkey, the NATO allies agreed in June to implement a roadmap for the northern Syrian city of Manbij, where Ankara had threatened to push its ground offensive despite the U.S. troops stationed there.  Ankara and Washington have more recently been at a stand-off over the fate of a U.S. evangelical pastor being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges that he denies. The widening row has sent Turkey’s lira currency plunging some 40 percent this year.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria could be spared its bloodiest battle yet if the Russian and Turkish presidents talk to each other urgently about resolving the situation in the rebel-held region of Idlib, U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Tuesday.  De Mistura said that talks between Russia and Turkey held the key to averting an assault on the region of 2.9 million people, but six reported air strikes on Tuesday suggested the Ankara talks were not going well. Media reports had said the Syrian government might wait until Sept. 10 before launching an assault, making a summit to be held between Russia, Turkey and Iran on Friday “crucial”, he said. “If true, the rumour we are hearing — there is a plan to actually start moving and increasing the escalation militarily on the 10th, the time is of essence,” he said. De Mistura made an appeal via the media to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Tayyip Erdogan. “A telephone call between the two of you would make a big difference,” he said. “We therefore ask for more time to be given for negotiations especially between Russia and Turkey, who are the main stakeholders who are talking ...and do hold in my opinion the key for a soft solution,” he added.   De Mistura called for “protected civilian evacuation routes” to allow Idlib residents to leave the city voluntarily, accompanied by U.N. personnel. U.S. President Donald Trump warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies Iran and Russia on Monday not to “recklessly attack” Idlib, warning that hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. De Mistura, noting that Trump’s tweet used the word “humanitarian” twice, said it sent “the right message”. The top U.S. military officer warned on Tuesday that a major Syrian military assault on Idlib would lead to a “humanitarian catastrophe” and instead recommended more narrowly tailored operations against militants there “There is indeed intense humanitarian and political diplomacy now surrounding Idlib,” said Jan Egeland, de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser. “And if it succeeds we will have hundreds of thousands of lives spared. If it fails in the next days and hours we could see a battle more cruel than any previous battle in this the cruellest war of our generation,” he added.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron appointed a former Green lawmaker as his new environment minister on Tuesday, hoping to inject new life into his rattled administration after a summer of problems and before another round of reforms.  Macron was forced into the move after Nicolas Hulot, a popular eco-campaigner, resigned live on radio last week over what he felt were hollow commitments on environmental policy.  The nomination of Francois de Rugy to replace him reflected Macron’s desire to give the sensitive portfolio, which includes energy, to a thick-skinned career politician with experience balancing ideals with political realities, energy analysts said. The 40-year-old president also named Roxana Maracineanu as sports minister to replace former Olympic fencing champion Laura Flessel, who said she was quitting for personal reasons. Maracineanu is an Olympic swimming silver medalist. Hulot’s resignation was a blow for Macron, who is still reeling from a bodyguard scandal in July just as he prepares to embark on reforms to cut public sector jobs, tame the budget deficit and streamline the pension system. For much of Macron’s first year in power, the former investment banker appeared untouchable, self-assured and unphased by his falling popularity as he pushed through investor-friendly reforms with business-like efficiency. Recently, however, Macron has looked more vulnerable. Economic growth is slower than forecast, undermining his deficit-busting credentials. Unemployment is no longer coming down. Usually decisive, Macron is wavering on an impending tax collection reform. Meanwhile, voters are growing impatient with his monarchical style and sharp tongue.  “It wasn’t supposed to happen to this president. He promised to be audacious in his reforms, efficient in the exercise of power, and the embodiment of dignity. In his first few months the promise was kept, but now everything is going wrong,” the right-leaning Le Figaro said in an editorial on Monday. Even so, Macron’s minimalist reshuffle, with just two changes, points to a president determined to pursue his reforms and not be seen to react to the latest poll numbers, analysts said. He has sold his pro-business overhaul on promises that it will boost growth and jobs, but voters spanning typically conservative pensioners to low-income workers complain his policies mostly favour big business and the wealthy.  Next up for his centrist government is tackling social spending — a delicate balancing act as he seeks to restore credibility with the left — just as weaker-than-forecast growth puts pressure on the budget deficit. Macron’s election victory, which blew apart France’s mainstream parties and halted the march of the far-right National Front party, delighted French business and urban, liberal voters. But prone to haughty and at times condescending remarks, he has struggled to connect with common folk.  An IFOP-Fiducial survey on Tuesday showed just 31 percent of respondents were happy with his performance, with support eroding across all ages on both the political left and right. The headline number was down 10 percentage points.  That is lower than his predecessor Francois Hollande was at the same stage in the socialist’s presidency. Hollande went on to become so unpopular he was the first president in France’s Fifth Republic not to run for re-election.  “It’s something of a ‘year zero’ for Emmanuel Macron. The slate is being wiped clean, even his popularity is starting at zero again. Everything has to be rebuilt,” said Philippe Moreau Chevrolet of the Sciences Po political school in Paris. In a rare moment of humility, Macron on Monday acknowledged the challenges to a class of young school students: “There are some days which are easy, and others which are not.” Reporting by Richard Lough; additional reporting by Ardee Napolitano; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Jon Boyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-politics-reshuffle/amid-problems-macron-names-new-environment-minister-in-reshuffle-idUKKCN1LK0U9,2019-02-08,,"Amid problems, Macron names new environment minister in reshuffle"

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies Iran and Russia not to “recklessly attack” Syria’s rebel-held Idlib province, warning that hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. “The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don’t let that happen!” Trump wrote in a tweet.  A source has told Reuters that Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain Idlib. The northern province and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by insurgents fighting Assad, who has been backed by both Russian and Iranian forces in Syria’s seven-year-old civil war. They are home to some three million civilians. Trump has sought better relations with Russia since taking office in 2017 but the United States has been unable to rein in Moscow’s military and diplomatic support for Assad. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said Washington views any government assault on Idlib as an escalation of Syria’s war, and the State Department warned that Washington would respond to any chemical attack by Damascus. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter late on Monday: “All eyes on the actions of Assad, Russia, and Iran in Idlib. #NoChemicalWeapons” Iran called for militants to be “cleaned out” of Idlib, as it prepared for talks with Syria and Russia about confronting the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Assad.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif visited Damascus to discuss plans for an upcoming summit between the leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey, which Tehran will host on Sept. 7 to discuss Idlib, Iran’s Fars news agency reported. Turkey, which has long supported anti-Assad rebels, has cooperated with Russia and Iran on talks over Syria in recent years and has troops in the Idlib region on an observation mission.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The CEO of JD.com Inc (JD.O), Richard Liu, has returned to China, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, days after he was arrested by police in the U.S. city of Minneapolis on suspicion of criminal sexual conduct and later released. Police said an investigation was ongoing. JD.com has said that the accusation against Liu, 45, was unsubstantiated.  A Minnesota-based lawyer for Liu, Earl Gray, said Liu denies any wrongdoing, and added he does not expect his client to be charged, noting that Liu was released without charges or bail, and was allowed to return to China. “Under these circumstances based on our substantial experience in the criminal justice system in Minnesota charges are highly unlikely in the future to be brought against our client,” Gray said in an emailed statement.  Minneapolis police said on Sunday that “an active investigation” was under way, although it was possible for the billionaire founder of the firm to leave the United States.  Reuters has not been able to reach Liu for comment. “We don’t know if there will be charges or not because we haven’t concluded an investigation,” John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, told Reuters on Sunday. He declined to provide details of the arrest. In addition to making Liu the highest-profile Chinese businessperson to be accused publicly of sexual misconduct, the case has raised concerns that loss-making Nasdaq-listed JD.com could face difficulties making decisions due to its unusual governance structure. The company is backed by Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google and China’s Tencent Holdings (0700.HK).  JD.com’s rules require Liu, who holds nearly 80 percent of the company’s voting rights, to be present at board meetings for the board to make decisions, although it was not immediately clear if he has to be physically present or could participate by teleconference. “I’m not aware of any other company that has similar rules,” said Chris Leahy, co-founder of advisory firm Blackpeak and a corporate governance expert. “If the board isn’t quorate without Richard Liu, if he is unable to attend, and if there are no other provisions that offer a way round that, the company could become ungovernable,” he said. The Financial Times, citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter, reported that the case involved Liu, who is a student in the University of Minnesota’s doctor of business administration program, and a Chinese student at the university.   While the doctoral program primarily takes place in Beijing in partnership with the prestigious Tsinghua University, the students were in the Twin Cities last week as part of their training. According to its website, the program is designed for top-level executives working in China, and the average age of participants is 50. The complaint against Liu was made just before midnight local time on Friday, and he was released just after 4 p.m. on Saturday, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff website. University spokeswoman Emma Bauer referred questions to the Minneapolis Police Department. China’s foreign ministry said its consulate in Chicago was closely watching the situation. “We are currently seeking information and verification from the relevant U.S. departments,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular Beijing news conference on Monday. SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE Chinese social media was abuzz over the arrest, with a thread on Liu’s police booking photo ranking as the most discussed topic on China’s Weibo platform on Monday morning, read more than 250 million times. JD.com, one of China’s tech heavyweights, competes with larger rival Alibaba Group (BABA.N), and Liu has a net worth of $7.9 billion, according to Forbes. The company, worth some $45 billion, has seen its stock lose 24 percent of its value this year amid concerns of weakening growth momentum. The company has been in and out of the red for the past year and last month reported a second-quarter net loss of $334.4 million - almost twice market estimates - reflecting increased investment. Liu built JD.com from scratch. In 1998, he spent 12,000 yuan  ($1,760) of his savings to lease a four-square-meter retail space in Beijing’s technology hub of Zhongguancun, setting up a firm that would become JD.com. He is also known for his marriage to Chinese internet celebrity Zhang Zetian. Zhang, described by Chinese media as aged 24, shot to fame while a student in 2009 when a photo of her holding a cup of milk tea went viral, giving her the nickname “Sister Milk Tea”. She met Liu while studying in the United States and married him in 2015. In July, a court in Australia denied Liu’s efforts to block the release of his name in association with a sexual assault trial in which he was not accused of any wrongdoing, according to a court document. In that case, Liu had hosted a party in late 2015 at his luxury home in Sydney, after which one of his guests accused another guest of sexually assaulting her at a hotel. The defendant was found guilty of seven offenses, according to a court document.   Trade in JD.com shares is set to resume on Tuesday as U.S. markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday on Monday.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell for a third straight day on Monday, hurt by worries over the escalation of trade disputes between world powers and a deepening sell-off across emerging market currencies. With U.S. markets closed for Labor Day, trading activity was generally subdued. European shares were largely flat  .GDAXI .FCHI, although London's blue-chip FTSE rallied almost 1 percent .FTSE thanks to a weak British pound. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS and Tokyo's blue-chip Nikkei .N225 shed about 0.7 percent each.  MSCI’s All-Country World Index, .MIWD00000PUS, a gauge of 47 markets, dipped 0.2 percent and the main emerging equity index fell 0.7 percent .MSCIEF, bearing the brunt of global trade fears. U.S. President Donald Trump said at the weekend there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle with the trade talks. Worries about U.S. tensions with China were also kept alive by a report last week that Trump had told aides he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday. That would be a major escalation given the United States has already applied tariffs on $50 billion of exports from China. “As we head into a new week and month, trade concerns will remain front and centre of investors’ minds, along with increasing concerns about stability in emerging markets, after the sharp declines seen in Argentina and Turkey’s currency last week,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. There was also bad news on the economic outlook with surveys showing manufacturing activity took a hit from weak orders in August, a sign firms are feeling the pinch from an intensifying global trade war that could derail global growth. The surveys of purchasing managers showed mounting pressure on factories across Europe and Asia, with data later expected to show the United States is in the same grip. GRAPHIC - Share market divergence in August: reut.rs/2Nc9HvN “There are a few existential threats to the world and a broad based trade war is one,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. “We’re in a scary parallel to the 1920s and 1930s when there was piecemeal protectionism as we are seeing now.”  Across emerging markets, turbulence continued.  Turkey's lira led emerging currency losses after data showed inflation spiked to almost 18 percent in August, while the Indonesian rupiah fell IDR=ID to its lowest levels in 20 years. The Brazilian real weakened more than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar BRL=, while the Iranian rial was reported to have hit a record low against the U.S. currency. The lira, at the centre of emerging market turmoil in recent weeks, fell 1 percent to 6.62 per dollar TRY=D3. Central bank comments that the inflation outlook showed “significant risks” to price stability and that it would adjust its monetary stance at its upcoming meeting on Sept. 13 in line with this view helped contain the losses.  “This morning’s inflation number was very high and the authorities still haven’t got a credible strategy to deal with that,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told Reuters that the central bank was independent of government and it would take all necessary steps to combat inflation. Among major currencies, the British pound stood out as the big underperformer, hurt by comments by the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he was “strongly opposed” to British proposals on future trade ties after it leaves the EU. News that British manufacturers had their weakest month in over two years and export orders suffered a rare fall in August exacerbated sterling’s fall. The currency was last down 0.7 percent at $1.2874 GBP=D3 and weakened 0.8 percent against the euro EURGBP=D3 to 90.24 pence, helping lift London's blue-chip FTSE 0.95 percent. Global trade concerns supported the U.S. dollar. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback’s value against a basket of other major currencies, was flat at 95.13 after nearing its highest level since Aug. 27.  But gains were muted - safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc CHF=EBS and the Japanese yen JPY=EBS were supported against higher-yielding rivals. In European bond markets, Italian bond yields edged lower IT10YT=RR after Fitch Ratings left its credit rating unchanged at BBB on Friday, revising only its outlook to negative.  Oil prices meanwhile rose, supported by concerns that falling Iranian output will tighten markets once U.S. sanctions bite from November, but gains were limited by higher supply from OPEC and the United States. Brent crude oil LCOc1 was up 63 cents at $78.27 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 was 26 cents higher at $70.05.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance ministry is in talks with the Bank of England over whether Governor Mark Carney is willing to stay beyond his planned departure date of June 30 next year, amid difficulties finding a successor, the BBC reported on Monday. Carney originally planned to serve just five years of a maximum eight-year term as governor, but in October 2016 he agreed to stay an extra year, until mid 2019, to see Britain past its expected departure from the European Union. Now it appears he is being asked to delay his departure again, albeit possibly by less than a year, the BBC said, without citing a specific source. “I understand that the Treasury is concerned that trying to complete a process to find a new Governor now — in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations — would be difficult,” the BBC’s economics editor, Kamal Ahmed, wrote. “However, it has been made clear to me that no deal has been agreed and the extension might be much less than a year, if it happens,” he added. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said there had been no change to the finance ministry’s plan to start a formal search for Carney’s successor. “The Governor has said that he intends to step down in June 2019 and the Treasury has said they will start recruiting for a new governor in due course, and that is still the plan,” he told reporters. Earlier on Monday the Financial Times cited “people close to the governor” as saying Carney would be willing to serve more of his term than he had previously stated. The BoE declined to comment on the BBC and FT reports. Carney is due to appear before a parliament committee for a regular hearing on Tuesday, when he is likely to be asked about his future plans. The front-runner to succeed Carney is widely seen to be Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and a former deputy governor at the BoE. However, earlier this year finance minister Philip Hammond said he might look abroad again for a successor to Carney.  The announcement of Carney’s appointment in 2012 came as a surprise, as Carney had previously denied interest in the role and the then-deputy governor, Paul Tucker, had been seen as the favorite for the role.

2019-02-08,"MONZA, Italy (Reuters) - French driver Romain Grosjean was disqualified from the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday after stewards upheld a Renault protest against the legality of his Haas car. Grosjean had finished sixth in the race, sending Haas ahead of Renault in the constructors standings.  The disqualification, which is subject to appeal, meant the French carmaker stayed fourth while Force India’s Esteban Ocon was promoted to sixth in the race. Force India’s Sergio Perez moved up to seventh, with Renault’s Carlos Sainz eighth and the Williams pairing of Lance Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin ninth and 10th.  The point was Sirotkin’s first in Formula One.  The governing FIA said in a long explanation of the ruling that Renault had argued that Grosjean’s Haas did not comply with a technical clarification issued to teams in July. All teams had been given until Monza to comply but Haas had not done so, with Renault presenting photographic evidence to back their case. U.S.-owned Haas had provided details of a new solution in an email exchange with the FIA but had asked for more time to implement it, given the August break. “We will endeavour to introduce this upgrade for the Singapore GP, but will be somewhat at the mercy of our suppliers so we would request some flexibility in this matter,” they had written in an email. Haas had thought their solution and timing request had been accepted but the FIA said its head of single seater technical matters had warned them they risked a protest if the car was not corrected by Monza. “While the Stewards are also sympathetic to the difficulties of producing these parts, the Stewards noted that at least one other competitor was able to comply in the time provided,” the statement said. “Further, it was made clear to the competitor from the outset that the FIA Technical Department did not consider their car to be in compliance, and further that they left themselves open to the circumstances they now find.” The stewards ordered Grosjean to be disqualified from the results and the classification amended.

2019-02-08,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A group of Arab lawmakers in Israel on Sunday praised British Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party has been battling accusations of anti-Semitism for months. In a letter to Britain’s Guardian newspaper, Ahmad Tibi, a deputy speaker of Israel’s parliament, and three other members of the Joint Arab List party said Corbyn had a “longstanding solidarity with all oppressed peoples around the world, including his unflinching support for the Palestinian people.” Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups he supports. Corbyn has responded to protests by meeting Jewish community leaders, reassuring Jewish people they are welcome in the party. He has previously apologised for what he has described as “pockets” of anti-Semitism in his party. Israel’s own Labour party suspended relations with Corbyn in April, accusing him of sanctioning anti-Semitism and showing hostility towards Israeli policies. In their letter, the Arab members of Israel’s parliament said they recognise Corbyn as “a principled leftist leader who aspires for peace and justice and is opposed to all forms of racism, whether directed at Jews, Palestinians, or any other group.” Some opinion polls put Labour ahead or level with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives, meaning he is a potential British leader, although the next election is not due until 2022.

2019-02-08,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Saturday it regretted a U.S. decision to halt funding to a United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, saying it would only fuel radicalism and harm prospects for Middle East peace. Foreign Minster Ayman Safadi told Reuters his country, which hosts more than 2 million of the over 5 million registered refugees whom the agency supports, would continue to rally donor support to ease the acute financial crunch faced by the agency.  The U.S. announced on Friday it would no longer support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Earlier this year the United States, long its biggest donor, had slashed funding.  “Disruption of UNRWA services will have extremely dangerous humanitarian, political and security implications for refugees and for the whole region,” Safadi said. “It will only consolidate an environment of despair that would ultimately create fertile grounds for further tension. Politically it will also further hurt the credibility of peacemaking efforts.” Safadi said a meeting on Sept. 27 in New York in the United Nations which the kingdom was co-sponsoring with Japan, the European Union, Sweden and Turkey would seek to “rally political and financial support for the agency”. “We will do everything possible to ensure that UNRWA gets the funds it needs to continue offering its services to Palestinian refugees,” Safadi added. Staunch U.S. ally Jordan lies at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict with many of its citizens refugees or descendants of the roughly 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled the fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. Diplomats say the U.S. decision has stirred fears of a new Middle East policy under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration that seeks to dilute and eventually strike out the right of return for millions of Palestinian refugees.  Safadi said the international community’s support for the agency was inseparable from future talks on the fate of refugees - among the most sensitive issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The issue was agreed to be among final status talks that were stalled in 2014 ultimately over whether Israel would make territorial concessions in return for a lasting peace deal with the Arabs.       “The status of refugees is not determined by any one single country, it is determined under international law and as such no country can take away that status,” Safadi said.

2019-02-08,"SOUTHAMPTON, England (Reuters) - An enthralling fourth test between England and India remained intriguingly balanced at the end of the third day as hosts edged to 260-8 and a lead of 233 on a wearing pitch that should continue to cause problems for the batsmen. A battling 69 from Jos Buttler and an unbeaten 37 from Sam Curran ensured England reached the close just about on target for the win that would clinch the series. But India remain very much in the game, particularly after Mohammed Shami trapped Adil Rashid lbw for 11 in the final over, and will look to knock over the final two wickets cheaply on Sunday. Much will rest on the 20-year-old shoulders of Curran who, after top scoring in England’s first innings, will look to push the lead up towards 300 on Sunday, when conditions are forecast to be overcast and favouring the seamers. “We’ve got plenty to work with already but anything about 250 would be a great number to try and eke out tomorrow morning. That would give us plenty of runs on a challenging pitch,” said Buttler.  For India to win, and level the five-match series 2-2, they will need to improve on their poor record of winning only three tests outside Asia when set a target in excess of 200. England had resumed on six without loss in the morning — a deficit of 21 — with their openers finally hoping to post the sort of partnership that has eluded them all series. Once again they failed but several batsmen dug out valuable contributions each time India’s attack sensed they might be getting on top. After Alastair Cook and the promoted Moeen Ali fell cheaply, Joe Root and Keaton Jennings provided the first resistance before the opener was trapped lbw by Shami for 36 to the final ball of the morning session. Shami claimed another success with the first ball after lunch when he bowled Jonny Bairstow with a delivery the batsman completely misjudged. Shami then ran out Root on 48 with a direct hit from mid-on to reduce England to 122-5. But Buttler has provided terrific value down the order for England, top-scoring in three of his 10 innings since winning a recall this summer. His half-century was his ninth in 24 tests and third of a productive summer during which he also scored a century. After sharing partnerships of 56 with Ben Stokes (30) and 55 with Curran, he fell lbw late in the day to the new ball which Ishant Sharma moved back into his pads.   Sharma proved a real handful after earlier being twice warned for running on the pitch, a transgression that would have led to his removal from the attack if repeated. Clearly concerned, skipper Virat Kohli voluntarily removed him from the attack just when his threat was at his most potent, allowing England to regroup at a key moment. Shami was the pick of India’s bowlers with 3-53.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A British junior minister held talks in Iran on Saturday as Tehran said European states should take action if they wanted to save Iran’s nuclear deal following Washington’s withdrawal from the accord, Iranian state media reported. “It is time for the Europeans to act in addition to voicing their political commitment,” the state news agency IRNA quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as telling reporters. “These measures may be costly, but if countries want to reap benefits and if they believe the nuclear accord is an international achievement, they should be ready to keep these achievements,” he was quoted as saying. Britain and other European signatories are trying to keep the nuclear deal alive, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. UK’s Junior Foreign Minister Alistair Burt, on the first visit by a British minister since Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, earlier met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s state television reported. Zarif said the talks with Burt had involved “access to banking resources and the sale of oil.” Iran has been seeking commitment from European signatories of the nuclear deal that it will be able to access the Western banking system and continue to sell oil despite U.S. sanctions. In a statement before his visit, Burt said: “As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region.”  Zarif later spoke by telephone with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian, state media reported, saying they discussed bilateral ties, the nuclear deal and regional developments. A day earlier, Iran dismissed a call by Le Drian for negotiations on Tehran’s future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. Britain’s Burt was also expected to discuss the cases of dual nationals detained in Iran. Britain is seeking the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation who was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter, now aged four, after a family visit. She was convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran’s clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organisation that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. Accompanying Burt in Tehran, London’s special envoy to Syria Martin Longden later met senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hosein Jaberi Ansari, IRNA reported. IRNA said Longden had expressed concern about the future of Idlib and the possibility of the use of chemical weapons there. The Syrian province of Idlib and surrounding areas are the last major enclave held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a close Iranian ally. A source has told Reuters Assad is preparing a phased offensive to regain the province.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The funeral for Aretha Franklin in Detroit on Friday also briefly became an impromptu forum on the Black Lives Matter movement and other issues critical to the African American community. The Queen of Soul was remembered during a nearly eight-hour service that featured tributes from former U.S. President Bill Clinton and civil rights leaders, as well as often emotional performances by entertainers Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson and Gladys Knight. The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr., pastor at Salem Baptist Church in Atlanta, delivered the eulogy for Franklin and used his time at the podium to raise social issues he said were critical to the black community. “Do black lives matter? Let me answer like this. No. Black lives do not matter, black lives will not matter, black lives ought not matter, black lives should not matter, black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves, black lives can never matter,” Williams said.  Singer Stevie Wonder appeared to respond in part to Williams when he delivered remarks at the end of the service, following his own musical tribute to Franklin. “We can talk about all the things that are wrong and there are many but the only thing that can deliver us is love. So what needs to happen today not only in this nation but throughout the world is that we need to make love great again,” Wonder said. “Because black lives do matter, because all lives do matter and if we love God then we know truly that it is our love that will make all things matter, when we make love great again. That is what Aretha has said throughout her life. Throughout the pain, she gave us the joy and said ‘Let’s make love great again’,” Wonder said.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU and UK negotiators on Friday talked up prospects of agreeing a Brexit deal this autumn, citing recent progress in detailing very close security cooperation to take effect after Britain leaves the bloc.  The European Union’s Michel Barnier said it was “possible” to get an agreement in time for a summit of all the bloc’s leaders in Brussels on Oct. 18-19, though a delay into November was also possible. After his latest talks with Barnier, Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab said he was “stubbornly optimistic” and “as confident as before, if not more” that there would be a deal. The two said they made progress over security cooperation, including on exchanging data. “Europe’s security is the United Kingdom’s security,” Raab told a joint news conference.  Barnier said unresolved issues included geographical indication labels for specialised local products, nuclear cooperation, data protection and the role of the EU’s top court in policing the agreement. After weeks of warning of growing risk of a damaging no-deal Brexit and signalling delay was expected if there is to be any Brexit deal, the EU’s strategy is now to highlight how close cooperation with Britain is possible after Brexit to make London  more willing to accept divorce terms. That goes specifically for the sensitive issue of the EU-UK land border between Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland, where the EU wants a “backstop” solution in case of no deal, which includes terms that are anathema to London. “We must have a detailed backstop solution, which is legally operational in the withdrawal agreement,” Barnier said. “This backstop is critical, it’s essential to concluding these negotiations. With no backstop, there will be no agreement.” Barnier said the EU and UK were working for an “unprecedented partnership” in the future that would include a broad free-trade agreement, as well as sectoral cooperation deals in aviation, security and research, among others. “It’s unprecedented, such a partnership with a third country,” Barnier said. “But the preliminary condition to that is that we have to organise an orderly withdrawal of the UK. That’s the condition of the unprecedented partnership in the future.” Additional reporting by Philip Blenkinsop, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by John Stonestreet and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-security/eu-britain-talk-up-chances-of-autumn-brexit-deal-idUKKCN1LG1N4,2019-02-08,,"EU, Britain talk up chances of autumn Brexit deal"

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to quickly ramp up a trade war with China and has told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The White House declined comment on the Bloomberg report, which cited six unidentified sources, and deflated markets. The S&P hit session lows, and the U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan and U.S. Treasury yields also fell. Trump has credited his electoral success to his hard line on trade, which he has argued hurts U.S. workers and favors foreign competitors. Washington is demanding Beijing improve market access and intellectual property protections for U.S. companies, cut industrial subsidies and slash a $375 billion trade gap. The world’s two largest economies have already applied tariffs to $50 billion of each other’s goods in a tit-for-tat trade war. Talks aimed at easing tensions ended last week without major breakthroughs. “So-called hardline, pressure-exerting methods of the U.S. side won’t work on China and are not helpful to resolving the problem,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday when asked about the report. China’s position is to resolve the issue via pragmatic talks on an equal basis, which is what the international community wants to see, she added.  Washington’s new proposed 25 percent tariffs would affect consumer products including home building supplies, technology products, bicycles and apparel. A public comment period on the proposal is set to end on Sept. 6, and Trump plans to impose the tariffs after that deadline, Bloomberg said.    Some sources said Trump had not made his final decision, the Bloomberg report said. Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to push Beijing. Trump, who has threatened to impose duties on virtually all of the more than $500 billion of Chinese goods exported to the United States each year, told Reuters in an interview earlier this month that resolving the trade war with China would “take time” and that he had “no time frame” for ending it. The report on Trump’s China stance coincides with U.S. negotiators pushing to hammer out a deal with Canadian counterparts to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As analysts crunch trade data and political commentators dissect official statements for signs of how the Sino-American trade war will develop, some ordinary Chinese are using different sources to predict U.S. President Donald Trump’s next moves: fortune tellers. Armed with photos of Trump and his date of birth, the superstitious in China are turning to the divine - from masters on cosmic energy to experts on ancient spirits - for tips on what the president has got up his sleeve in the escalating trade spat between the world’s two largest economies. The trade dispute has not only raised uncertainty over China’s economic growth, it has also unsettled the lives of some ordinary Chinese people, who are seeking advice on things like where to invest, how to run their business and even whether or not they should pursue plans to emigrate to the United States. Victor Ng, a Feng Shui master from a line of famous practitioners in Hong Kong, says he usually analyses the birth date and time of birth of his clients for insights. With the trade row dominating headlines and increasing uncertainty about the future, he has been adding some ingredients to the mix. “Because this time the U.S.-China trade war is ongoing, I will also look at the fate of the leaders of the U.S. and China - for instance, Xi Jinping’s birth date and the birth date of Donald Trump. This is how we analyse the situation,” he said. In the western city of Xi’an, fortune teller Xie Xianglin says he has seen “many, many more” people approaching him for readings on the future of the trade war. Most are entrepreneurs and investors, said Xie, who charges 500 yuan (£56) to analyse the relevant spirits. “Seven people have asked about investment and also about emigration trends,” he said of recent visitors. In Shanghai’s leafy Fuxing Park, for at least three weekends in a row in July, heated debate broke out intermittently between retirees discussing the victims and villains of the trade war. The park is an unofficial meeting ground for retirees at the weekend - and more recently, some have appeared there brandishing photos of Trump and his birth date looking for tips on his next step, said three people who had seen it happen. Chinese people, including the country’s leaders, have a long tradition of putting their faith in soothsaying and geomancy, looking for answers in times of doubt, need and chaos.  Members of the ruling Communist Party, however, are officially banned from participating in what the government dubs superstitious practices, including visiting soothsayers. For investment broker Ricky Fong, readings by Ng, a master of the ancient Chinese belief in a system of laws that governs energy, or Feng Shui, have helped him navigate the impact of the trade war on his business. “When it comes to the U.S.-China trade war, in my view the importance is huge, with regards to investment - really big,” said Fong, in Hong Kong. “Master Ng gives me a lot of very detailed data to work with. When it comes to the traditional financial tools they also provide data, but the Feng Shui master gives me another kind. He can use traditional methods to read my fate, and tell me how to better handle the situation,” Fong added. Recently, amid the trade war, Ng advised Fong to invest in Kuangchi Science Ltd (0439.HK) after a reading of the company stock number and Fong’s birth date, which Ng believes gives an indication of a person’s fortune with a particular firm. Fong says he bought at 0.375 per share and sold at 0.77 per share.  For now, at least some readings on the fate of Trump and the trade war are pointing in the right direction. “The trade war will end up with a reconciliation in the near future,” said fortune teller Xie, who offered a free reading to Reuters.

BlackRock-managed funds voted for a measure requiring the chairman be an independent director, according to BlackRock’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The proposal, which was defeated, would not have affected Musk’s standing as Tesla’s chief executive officer. More than 86 million shares voted against the proposal at a shareholder meeting in June, while fewer than 17 million voted in favour, Tesla said. Some corporate governance activists call for the chairman and CEO roles to be split between two people to improve oversight, and the new filing revealed at least one major investor backed such changes at Tesla. BlackRock’s role in backing the proposal was not previously reported. Musk has been under pressure over the company’s spending and after tweeting on Aug. 7 that he planned to take the company private, only to abandon the idea by Aug. 24. Tesla’s board had said that the company’s success “would not have been possible” without Musk’s “day-to-day exposure to the company’s business.” Yet top proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc supported the proposal, citing concerns about Musk’s pay and board independence. “BlackRock’s approach to investment stewardship is driven by our fiduciary duties to our clients, the asset owners,” a BlackRock spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “Our approach to engaging with companies and proxy voting activities is consistent with our commitment to drive long term shareholder value for our clients.” BlackRock funds are a top-10 Tesla stockholder, controlling nearly 6.5 million of Tesla’s 170 million shares, according to Thomson Reuters data based on public filings.  Vanguard Group Inc-run funds voted against the independent-chair proposal, a recent filing showed. Funds run by Fidelity Investments sided with Tesla on director votes and other controversial items this spring, its filings showed.  BlackRock’s report also showed it voted this year in favour of shareholder proposals at Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) to give each shareholder an equal vote on governance matters. Some companies are structured in a way that gives some shareholders more power than others, regardless of how many shares they hold. BlackRock withheld votes or voted against nearly all management recommendations at Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), including an advisory vote on executive pay.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s FTSE 100 will take until the end of next year to return close to record levels, according to a Reuters poll, held back in the near-term as investors grapple with the possibility that Britain leaves the European Union with no deal. The median forecast of 30 analysts, brokers and fund managers polled by Reuters Aug. 17-30 projects the FTSE 100 reaching 7,900 by the end of 2019, just shy of its record high of 7,903.50 hit in May 2018. In a poll taken three months ago, the panel expected the FTSE 100 to hit 7,900 six months earlier, by the middle of next year. The latest Reuters survey results suggest the FTSE will end this year up just 1 percent and then gain 1.7 percent in 2019, well below the expected overall rate of inflation. Those gains in percentage terms are also just half of those forecast for the pan-European STOXX 600. [EPOLL/FRDE] Worries that Britain could fail to reach a deal with Brussels before it leaves the European Union in March 2019 have been a particular pain point for UK equities and sterling this year. “In the UK the key is clarity on the final outcome of the Brexit negotiations with the EU,” Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said. “If there is no clarity by March next year the market will become increasingly volatile if the prospect of No Deal gets closer,” he added. In the meantime, that lack of clarity has forced businesses to delay investment decisions while investors have shied away from UK equities. So far this year UK equities have lost 1.6 percent. That followed two years of gains, fuelled by a weak currency since  the June 23, 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU. The FTSE 100’s large, dollar-earning constituents have benefited from a revenue boost from a weaker pound.     But allocations to UK equities by fund managers this month had their biggest one-month drop since May 2016, also due to rising worries over a ‘no-deal Brexit’ scenario, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s August fund manager survey.  More than a quarter of fund managers are underweight UK equities. Coupled with the fact the UK market remains cheap compared with euro zone stocks on a forward price-to-earnings basis, some investors see this as an opportunity. “Brexit poses a lot of challenges to UK companies, but it’s certainly not the nail in the coffin,” said Adam Laird, head of ETF strategy for Northern Europe at Lyxor ETF. “Remember the UK market has a lot of international exposure, a lot of mining and energy. Investors would be foolish to write it off completely,” Laird added.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers appear little fazed by the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, but businesses have turned more worried, surveys showed on Friday. Britain’s headline gauge of consumer confidence, compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission, rose to -7 in August from -10 in July, matching 2018 highs struck in March and May. Economists who took part in a Reuters poll had mostly expected the reading to remain at -10. “We are just months away from the Brexit crunch but there is no sign — yet — of any crash in consumer confidence,” Joe Staton, GfK’s client strategy director, said. “The core index continues to muddle along in negative territory, but Armageddon seems a distant prospect,” he said. Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to win fellow EU leaders round to her plan for Britain to keep free trade for goods — something the European Commission opposes — less than seven months before the country leaves the bloc. In July, two of her key ministers resigned in protest at the plan, raising questions about her ability to secure a deal. A separate survey showed a different picture among companies. Lloyds Bank said its measure of business confidence in August fell six points to its lowest this year at 23 percent, dented by concerns about trading prospects for the year ahead and less economic optimism. That compared with levels of around 40-50 percent before the Brexit referendum.  Confidence held steady only among manufacturers, many of whom have seen orders rise this year with the global economy growing more strongly. “Business confidence was resilient in the first half of the year, but has eased back recently,” Hann-Ju Ho, a Lloyds economist, said.  “This reflects changes in perceptions of Brexit risks, which underscores the importance of current EU-UK negotiations.”  The Lloyds survey found a weakening in hiring intentions by companies and softer expectations for pay growth.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Environmental campaigners launched a boat on the River Thames on Thursday made almost entirely of recycled plastic waste, in an effort to raise awareness of growing levels of rubbish in Britain’s waterways. The 12-seater punt was built by Mark Edwards, who also made the Gloriana barge for Queen Elizabeth’s 2012 diamond jubilee. Named the “PET Project,” the boat will run regular trips along the river to fish out plastic rubbish, which in turn will be used to build more such vessels. Edwards used traditional techniques to make the boat. “We went back to the technology inherited from the Vikings,” he told reporters at the launch in Richmond, southwest London. “It took us two men, about six weeks flat out, so it’s quite a lot of work ... but for a craft that’s going to last 100 years it’s nothing.” Each year 300 tonnes of rubbish is cleared from the Thames and a large proportion of it is food and drink packaging that comes from dry land, says the environmental charity Hubbub which is behind the project.  It adds on its website: “Much of the litter is being eaten by birds, fish and other species which is leading to 70 percent of Thames fish found to have plastic in their gut.” PET project is Hubbub’s second boat made of recycled plastic waste.  “I think this ... shows that plastic is not just an issue that’s in far away oceans - it’s present here in London and actually there’s lots we can all do about it,” said its director Gavin Ellis.  “It’s about making sure you don’t put litter in an overflowing bin where it can blow out into the river and it’s obviously about not dropping litter directly into the river.” Reporting by Saeed Haque; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-recycling-boat/campaigners-launch-uk-boat-made-of-recycled-plastic-waste-idUKKCN1LF1PQ,2019-02-08,"Environmental campaigners launched a boat on the River Thames on Thursday made almost entirely of recycled plastic waste, in an effort to raise awareness of growing levels of rubbish in Britain's waterways.",Campaigners launch UK boat made of recycled plastic waste
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Britain’s biggest payday lender Wonga Group collapsed on Thursday, putting its operations in the country into administration. Privately owned Wonga, which initially enjoyed rapid growth via its short-term, high interest lending often to troubled borrowers, fell into difficulty in recent years after scrutiny of its practices led to a cap on interest on payday loans. “A decision has been taken to place Wonga Group Limited, WDFC UK Limited, Wonga Worldwide Limited and WDFC Services Limited into administration,” Wonga said in an email. “The Boards of these entities have assessed all options regarding the future of the Group and have concluded that it is appropriate to place the businesses into administration,” it said.   Wonga said its overseas businesses were not part of the announcement.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - WPP (WPP.L) will name its unassuming former digital boss Mark Read as its new chief executive, tasked with turning around the world’s largest advertising group in the wake of Martin Sorrell’s departure, a city source told Reuters.  Read was seen as the leading internal candidate to become CEO after he spent almost nine years on the board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job in 1989.  The city source, who declined to be named because the decision is not yet public, said Read would be given the job as long as the two sides have agreed terms.  Due to publish results next Tuesday, WPP declined to comment.  Read stepped up to become WPP joint chief operating officer in April after Sorrell, its founder and the world’s most famous advertising man, quit after 33 years in charge following a complaint of personal misconduct which he denied.     He takes over the 16 billion pound company at a difficult time, as the industry goes through a period of unprecedented change as clients seek to save costs by doing some digital marketing themselves and others turn to consultants for advice.  Others are placing ads directly on Google and Facebook, cutting out the middlemen advertising groups. The group had outperformed its peers - Omnicom (OMC.N) and IPG IPG.L in the United States, France’s Publicis (PUBP.PA) and Havas and Japan’s Dentsu (4324.T) - for years but lost its way in 2017 with organic growth disappearing.  Clients have told Reuters they hugely value WPP’s work but they want the group to be streamlined. Operating in 112 countries, WPP has 400 separate agencies that provide everything from pure advertising to media planning strategies, data research and PR.  Those 400 agencies have traditionally competed with each other, meaning clients can deal with multiple different agencies. They now want those agencies to work together to provide a more simplified service.     Read told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry. Some moves are already evident - the group is moving its headquarters, has revamped its website to provide a more sleek message and clients and WPP executives have told Reuters they’ve seen a more collaborative approach from the top. Married with two young children, Read had been the popular option among senior and junior members of WPP staff spoken to by Reuters.   News of his pending appointment was first reported by the Financial Times.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers increased their borrowing at the weakest pace in nearly three years last month, and foreign holdings of British government debt fell by a record amount, Bank of England data showed on Thursday. Twinned with a small fall in mortgage approvals, the consumer borrowing figures are likely to fuel concerns of a soft economy ahead of Brexit, while the net gilt sales may add to worries about the funding of Britain’s current account deficit. Foreign investors’ holdings of UK gilts fell by 17.2 billion pounds in July, up sharply from 1.4 billion pounds in June and the highest since records began in July 1982, driven in part by a large volume of maturing bonds. In July, Prime Minister Theresa May set out her first detailed proposals for the terms on which Britain will leave the European Union in March next year, prompting two of her senior ministers to resign. “This (fall) underlines the importance of managing the UK’s exit from the EU as smoothly as possible, especially given the on-going need to help finance the UK’s current account deficit,” Jefferies economist David Owen wrote in a note to clients. Annual consumer credit growth slowed to 8.5 percent in July from 8.8 percent in June, the weakest since November 2015. In month-on-month terms, net consumer lending rose by 817 million pounds, down from 1.521 billion in June and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. “July’s data reinforces the impression that consumers are currently relatively cautious in their borrowing while lenders have certainly become warier about advancing unsecured credit,” said Howard Archer, economist at consultants EY Item Club. Despite a recent fillip from unusually hot weather and the soccer World Cup, British consumer spending growth has slowed since 2016 due to higher inflation and limited wage growth. Mortgage approvals for house purchases softened to 64,768 from 65,374, slightly below economists’ forecasts of a dip to 65,000 in a Reuters poll. Last week industry body UK Finance reported a fall in the number of approvals for house purchase in July, though gross mortgage lending increased as existing home-owners sought to lock in cheaper interest rates before the BoE raised its main rate in August. British house price growth has slowed this year, mostly due to falling prices in much of central London, where demand has been hit by higher purchase taxes on expensive homes and reduced foreign investor appetite since 2016’s Brexit vote. On Wednesday a Reuters poll of housing market analysts showed that on average they saw a nearly one in three chance of a significant correction in the British capital’s property market before the end of 2019, though their central scenario was for a much smaller fall in prices.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s takeover regulator could take the rare step of intervening in the battle between Comcast and Twenty-First Century Fox for Sky next month by staging an auction for the broadcaster to bring the drawn-out bidding war to an end. The Takeover Panel has the power to instigate a formal auction process for London-listed Sky SKYB.L to help resolve its future if two competing bids that have not been declared final remain on the table for the company on Sept. 22, according to Britain’s takeover code.  There have only been three British takeover situations since 2007 that have involved auctions handled by the regulator, including the 6.2 billion-pound ($8.1 billion) sale of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus to India’s Tata Steel (TISC.NS), according to analysis by Reuters. A fourth battle ended just before an auction was due to start when Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) abandoned its takeover attempt of gas explorer Cove Energy in 2012, allowing Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production to clinch a $1.9 billion deal. That marked the last time the Panel invoked the auction procedure. Cable giant Comcast (CMCSA.O) currently leads Rupert Murdoch’s Fox (FOXA.O) in the fight for Sky with a 14.75 pound a share offer last month that values the broadcaster at 25.9 billion pounds and has been recommended by the pay-television group’s independent directors.  That trumped the 14 pound a share offer made by Fox earlier in July for the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own, and is 37 percent above Fox’s original 10.75 pound a share bid.  Sky’s shares currently trade at 15.44 pounds.  Under the current timetable for a deal, which can be changed by the Panel, Fox and Comcast are free to lift their bids at any point up until the Sept. 22 deadline.   If neither suitor has admitted defeat by then, the regulator can step in and start an auction. The Panel did not comment. The aim of an auction is to bring a protracted bidding war to a close by giving the suitors an opportunity to submit revised offers in an orderly process managed by the Panel, which remains neutral. But it can also serve to drive up the price that the successful suitor ultimately pays.  “I hope it goes to an auction,” said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund is a top-20 shareholder in Sky. “Every day I look at that price and think: ‘Why is it not at 18 pounds?’” In 2007, there were concerns that Tata overpaid for Corus after it became embroiled in a lengthy fight for the steelmaker with Brazilian firm Companhia Siderurgica Nacional. The Panel eventually stepped in and ran an auction that went for nine rounds over the course of about eight hours and finished in the early hours of a Wednesday morning. Tata emerged the winner with a 608 pence a share offer, a third higher than its original 455 pence bid. Tata’s expensive foray into British steelmaking later proved problematic for the Indian group after overcapacity in Europe plunged the UK’s steel industry into crisis in 2015. It subsequently agreed a deal to create a European steel joint venture with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp (TKAG.DE) earlier this year to help their operations withstand the pressures facing the industry.   Since the Corus sale, the Panel has tweaked the rules governing auctions so that unless the bidders and target agree an alternative procedure, the regulator runs a five-round process over five consecutive business days. The suitors can announce revised offers by 5pm each day up until the fifth day, after which no new bids are allowed and the offers become final. The auction ends earlier than the fifth day if there is a round that draws no new offers. The Sky battle is one part of a much broader consolidation sweeping the entertainment industry as the growth of Netflix (NFLX.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) force the world’s traditional media giants to spend tens of billions of dollars to keep pace. Fox’s existing 39 percent shareholding in Sky is part of a host of TV and film assets that Murdoch’s group has agreed to sell to Walt Disney (DIS.N) for about $71 billion. Comcast was also vying to buy those Fox assets until it dropped out of that battle in July to focus on taking control of Sky.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Foreigners’ net holdings of British government debt fell by a record amount last month, a move partly driven by a large volume of maturing bonds but one which also revived concerns about the effect of Brexit on investor appetite. Bank of England data released on Thursday showed a net 17.153 billion pound drop in foreigners’ holdings in July, the largest since records began in 1982, and up sharply from net sales of 1.362 billion pounds in June. The fall in holdings can represent both outright sales and investors deciding not to immediately reinvest the proceeds of gilts that mature, and some analysts played down the move. “I think we have to take those data with a pinch of salt,” said Vatsala Datta, a fixed income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada, a primary dealer in British government debt. “In months with big redemptions we typically see that kind of flow, and it reverses in the following month,” she said, adding that gilt prices had been steady through July. Some 33.5 billion pounds worth of gilts matured last month, and issuance totalled 12.9 billion pounds, giving net redemptions of 20.6 billion pounds for the gilt market overall — the highest for any month since September 2014. That said, other months with heavy net redemptions, such as in March when maturities outstripped new issuance by 20.0 billion pounds, did not see huge falls in foreign holdings. July’s gilt sales may have reflected heightened worries about Brexit, said David Owen, chief European financial economist at U.S. bank Jefferies, another primary dealer. Britain has the largest current account deficit of any major advanced economy, according to IMF data, and BoE Governor Mark Carney warned voters before 2016’s Brexit vote that the country relied on “the kindness of strangers” for its financing needs.     Boris Johnson resigned as UK foreign minister in July in protest at Prime Minister Theresa May’s first detailed proposals for Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. “This underlines the importance of managing the UK’s exit from the EU as smoothly as possible, especially given the on-going need to help finance the UK’s current account deficit,” Owen wrote in a note to clients.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car production fell 11 percent year-on-year in July, hit by model changes, seasonal adjustments and preparations for tougher new emissions standards, an industry body said on Thursday. Output stood at 121,051 units last month, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said, with demand at home slumping 35 percent compared with a drop in exports of 4.2 percent.  The SMMT also said July last year had been a particularly strong month due to the launch of several new models.  “The bigger picture is complex and month-by-month fluctuations are inevitable as manufacturers manage product cycles, operational changes and the delicate balance of supply and demand from market to market,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. The sector, which is heavily reliant on European and global supply chains, is concerned that any Brexit loss of free and unfettered trade with the European Union, its biggest export market, could raise costs and lead to delays at ports. “To ensure future growth, we need political and economic clarity at home, and the continuation of beneficial trading arrangements with the EU and other key markets,” said Hawes.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said on Wednesday he  has resigned from the Scottish National Party, which he led for two decades, days after allegations of sexual misconduct became publicly known. Salmond has denied the allegations and taken legal action against the SNP administration he once ran over the way it has handled the complaints against him.  The driving force behind Scotland’s 2014 independence referendum and still a popular figure in Scotland, Salmond said he was taking the action to protect the SNP from its opponents and avoid any internal division were he to have been suspended from the party. “I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack,” Salmond said in a statement. Salmond said he would reapply to the party if he wins his court action. At the same time he launched a crowd-funding appeal to raise 50,000 pounds ($65,000) to help pay his legal costs against the Scottish government over its handling of the misconduct complaints against him. The Scottish government said last week two allegations of  misconduct against Salmond were filed in January of this year.  Salmond said he rejects any suggestion of criminality. Salmond, who headed the devolved Scottish government for seven years until 2014, is credited with helping to push support for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom to record levels during the referendum campaign. Scots, however, voted 55-45 percent in favour of staying in the UK.  Nicola Sturgeon, his successor as party leader and first minister, has come under pressure from opposition parties to suspend his membership while the claims are investigated. Sturgeon said she felt “a huge sadness about this whole situation” but understood why he decided to resign.  She said that Scotland’s battle for independence is “bigger than any one individual.” Salmond’s relationship with his own party has been more strained since he lost his seat in the Westminster parliament last year. “I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division,” Salmond said. He intended to reapply for party membership “just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name”, which he hoped would be by the end of the year. “For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations,” Salmond said. “Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.”  ($1 = 0.7676 pound) Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik; editing by David Stamp and Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-politics-salmond/ex-scottish-leader-salmond-resigns-from-snp-amid-misconduct-allegations-idUKKCN1LE2KA,2019-02-08,,Ex-Scottish leader Salmond resigns from SNP amid misconduct allegations
2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Andy Murray lived up to his pre-tournament prediction that he would not win this year’s U.S. Open when he was beaten 7-5 2-6 6-4 6-4 by Spain’s Fernando Verdasco in the second round on Wednesday. The former-world number one and 2012 U.S. Open champion, who is still working his way back from hip surgery and had earlier downplayed his chances, battled Verdasco for nearly three hours and 30 minutes before finally surrendering on a fourth match point while trying to force a fifth set. “I think some of the tennis I played today was some of the best I’ve played since I had the surgery or since I came back,” said Murray. “But there were also periods in the match, especially in the first set where I really didn’t play particularly well. “Then kind of at the end when my back was against the wall, I came up with some good tennis to make it close and interesting.” Playing in just his fifth event since hip surgery in January, what Murray lacked in sharpness he more than made up for in gritty determination as the 31-year-old battled through a gruelling opening set that lasted 62 minutes. Drenched in sweat, Murray slowly began to find his comfort zone in the sauna like conditions taking the second to level the match. But Verdasco would not be rattled and dominated large chunks of play until the end of the clash, when Murray dug in and the 31st seeded Spaniard struggled to seal the match. “It was tough of course to close the match,” said Verdasco, after collecting just his second win in 15 matches against Murray and his first in nine years.  “With Andy it is always tough. He is an ... unbelievable fighter.” Verdasco will face yet another former-U.S. Open champion in the third round in big-hitting Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, who was a 6-3 6-1 7-6(4) winner over American Denis Kudla. Murray, meanwhile, leaves Flushing Meadows with all signs pointing he is headed in the right direction. “It’s still quite early in this process for me,” said Murray. “I did all right. I chased balls down right to the end of the match. I wasn’t giving up on points. “But you just don’t know exactly what’s round the corner. “If things keep going smoothly, physically I continue to improve, I believe that I will get back to competing for the biggest competitions because there’s no reason why I couldn’t. “But you don’t know.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-usopen-murray-verdasco/murray-true-to-word-with-second-round-exit-at-u-s-open-idUKKCN1LE2UW,2019-02-08,,Murray true to word with second round exit at U.S. Open
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Luxury carmaker Aston Martin plans to float on the London Stock Exchange, completing a turnaround for the once perennially loss-making company that could now be valued at up to 5 billion pounds ($6.4 billion).  The 105-year old firm, famed for making the sports car driven by fictional secret agent James Bond, would become the first British carmaker to list in London for years, following the sale of brands such as Jaguar and Bentley to foreign owners.  The initial public offering (IPO), which follows Italian rival Ferrari’s New York flotation in 2015, could see Aston valued at up to 5 billion pounds, sources have told Reuters, after it expanded its model line-up and production. The firm, which last year made its first profit since 2010 and has gone bankrupt seven times in its history, said on Wednesday the IPO would involve a sale of shares by its main owners, Kuwaiti and Italian private equity groups, with at least 25 percent of the stock to be floated.    It said it had filed a registration document with Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, a requirement for firms considering an IPO, at a time when the likes of Tesla boss Elon Musk have slammed the additional pressures of being listed. Pending a final decision, a prospectus will be published on or around Sept. 20 as the maker of sports cars that can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds hopes to tap into global demand from wealthy buyers who want a slice of the high-end brand. The carmaker hopes to complete the flotation this year, the same target that British Prime Minister Theresa May is working towards to agree a deal for leaving the European Union.   Aston sells roughly 25 percent of its cars to the EU and operates its only plant in Gaydon, central England, with a second one due to begin operations in Wales in 2019.  “We can demonstrate that Brexit is not a major effect for us,” Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters.  “If there is a tariff into Europe, it’s countered by a tariff into the UK for our competitors so you might lose a little bit of market share in the EU but you pick it up in the UK,” he said.  Niche carmakers such as Aston and McLaren are more concerned about customs checks than tariffs as they believe many of their buyers can absorb a price hike.  Like many British-based carmakers, it imports parts from Europe including German-made engines, which could face delays at ports in the event Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. Palmer said the firm had increased its stock in preparation for any eventuality. Aston Martin, which has licensed its name for use on apartment blocks and even a submarine, hopes to follow Ferrari by using its exclusivity to appeal to investors. Aston, which forecasts full-year volumes will rise to between 6,200 and 6,400 vehicles, aims in 2019 to match its recent sales high of roughly 7,300 cars achieved in 2007, just before the financial crisis.  The firm then languished for several years as sales slumped and it failed to invest adequately in new models, spending most of 2014 without a boss before Palmer’s appointment. Since then, the firm’s main shareholders have invested 200 million pounds as part of a plan to update its model line-up, produce new lower emissions vehicles and make its first sport utility vehicle (SUV), which is due next year.  It projects volumes will reach nearly 10,000 units in 2020.  Italian group Investindustrial, Kuwait’s Investment Dar and five-percent shareholder Daimler, will retain stakes in the firm after the IPO. Aston made half-year adjusted pretax profit of 42 million pounds, as revenue rose 8 percent to 445 million pounds due to strong demand for its DB11 coupe and Volante models.  The company has suggested for years it would eventually go public, but Palmer said now was the right time as the firm gears up for further growth with its move into the popular SUV market.  “We’ve got a very solid balance sheet now, very solid results. As we move into the third phase, which is the portfolio expansion, it also means we’ve got plenty of runway in front of us,” he told Reuters.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French and British fisherman pledged talks to quell a high-seas dispute over access to the scallop-rich seabed in the Baie de Seine after French vessels chased their rivals out of the zone, hurling projectiles and insults.    French vessels rammed British scallop dredgers on Tuesday off the coast of Normandy in an attack English fisherman Ciaran Cardell described as like “a scene out of Vietnam”. “They just came out and surrounded our fleet, throwing petrol bombs. It was mental,” said Cardell, a scallop fisherman from Cornwall who told Reuters his boat was attacked by about 15 French scallop fishing boats in international waters. The French are irritated that British fishermen are allowed to harvest scallops, a key earner for France’s Normandy region, throughout the year, while they are prevented from doing so during the summer. GRAPHIC: Navigating Brexit waters : tmsnrt.rs/2DKUKZD “This is well beyond legal behavior. We have asked the British government to intervene at a diplomatic level but also to provide protection for our vessels,” Barrie Deas, head of Britain’s fishermen’s organizations, told BBC radio. British environment minister Michael Gove said the UK boats were fishing legally. He told BBC television: “We can insist that the French, because they have a legal responsibility to ensure that we don’t have scenes like those we saw earlier this week, ensure that those waters - their territorial waters - are appropriately policed so that legal fishing activity can continue.” The head of Normandy’s fishing organization Dimitri Rogoff said the attack was spontaneous but acknowledged events spiraled out of control. He said he deplored the violence. “There should not be any brawling, that could end badly. Our main UK counterpart has proposed we hold talks quickly in France, we’ll receive a UK delegation in the coming days,” Rogoff said on Wednesday. Scallops - known as Coquille Saint Jacques in France -  are one of just a few species whose catch is governed by national rather than European Union regulation.  France bans all scallop dredging between May 15 and October 1, but Britain allows its vessels to operate year-round.  While British ships have no access to French territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles (22 km) off the coast, they can legally operate in the expansive Baie de Seine that stretches from Cherbourg to Dunkirk.  After the row - dubbed the scallop wars - flared up five years ago, French and UK fishermen brokered yearly agreements that saw British fishermen limit their scallop dredging in the Baie de Seine in exchange for some French scallop permits.  “But in the past two years, we feel our British partners do not want to negotiate, maybe because of Brexit,” Rogoff said.    Rogoff said the root of the problem is different economic models. Normandy fishermen, he said, operate mainly small family-owned boats close to their own shores and sell the scallops live. The British fleet, he said, included company-owned “floating factories” which freeze and process the catch onboard.  French fishermen argue that scallops should not be harvested in summer, when they reproduce.  “If everybody dredges for scallops all year round, soon there will be none left,” Rogoff said.

2019-02-08,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - The Nobel Peace Prize to Aung San Suu Kyi will not be withdrawn in the light of a United Nations report that said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings of Muslim Rohingya, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Wednesday.  On Monday, U.N. investigators said Myanmar’s military carried out mass killings and gang rapes with “genocidal intent”, and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law. Aung San Suu Kyi, who leads the Myanmar government and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, has been criticised for failing to speak out against the army crackdown in Rakhine State. “It’s important to remember that a Nobel Prize, whether in Physics, Literature or Peace, is awarded for some prize-worthy effort or achievement of the past,” said Olav Njoelstad, the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  “Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy and freedom up until 1991, the year she was awarded the prize,” he said. And the rules regulating the Nobel Prizes do not allow for a prize to be withdrawn, he added. The Norwegian Nobel Committee consists of a panel of five Norwegians, mostly former politicians and academics, that reflect the different forces in the Norwegian Parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden. Last year, the head of the Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, also said it would not strip the award after previous criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi’s role in the Rohingya crisis. “We don’t do it. It’s not our task to oversee or censor what a laureate does after the prize has been won,” she said in a television interview. “The prize winners themselves have to safeguard their own reputations.” Reporting by Gwladys Fouche, editing by Alister Doyle, Editing By Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-myanmar-rohingya-nobelpeaceprize/aung-san-suu-kyi-wont-be-stripped-of-nobel-peace-prize-committee-idUKKCN1LE1XZ,2019-02-08,,Aung San Suu Kyi won't be stripped of Nobel Peace Prize - committee

He said Tehran should “give up hope” on Europe to save the deal.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - France has told its diplomats and foreign ministry officials to postpone indefinitely all non-essential travel to Iran, citing a foiled bomb plot and a hardening of Tehran’s attitude towards France, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Any hardening of relations with France could have wider implications for Iran. France has been one of the strongest advocates of salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, which U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of in May. Iran’s economy has been hammered by the prospect of the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. European countries including France have pledged to try to soften the economic blow, but have been unable so far to persuade their firms to defy Washington and stay in Iran. French oil and gas major Total and its carmakers PSA  and Renault have led an exodus of European companies from Iran, fearful of the extra-territorial reach of Washington’s sanctions. The memo cites a foiled plot to bomb a rally held by an exiled Iranian opposition group near Paris that was attended by Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani as a sign of Tehran’s more aggressive stance towards France.  “The behaviour of the Iranian authorities suggests a hardening of their position vis-a-vis our country, as well as some of our allies,” Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, the ministry’s secretary general wrote in the notice dated Aug. 20.  “Given the known security risks ... all departmental officers, whether from headquarters or (overseas) posts, are required to defer until further notice, except for urgent work, any travel plans in Iran,” Gourdault-Montagne added. The instructions were also relayed to officials in government departments outside the foreign ministry to be passed on to staff who intended to travel to Iran, a separate memo obtained by Reuters showed.   The French foreign ministry declined to comment on the memo or say whether embassy staff had been asked to repatriate their families.  Iranian officials at the Embassy in Paris did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday but, reacting on Wednesday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iran should be vigilant against “enemies” trying to affect ties between the countries. “The relations between Iran and Europe, especially Iran and France, have some enemies, and we should be vigilant against their actions,” Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. “The restriction on the French diplomats’ travel (to Iran) is not correct.” France’s latest travel advisory for its citizens, published on May 10, cautions against visitors entering Iran with electronic equipment such as drones and walkie-talkies and taking too many photographs. The memo underscores how confidence in the Tehran government has been eroded in Paris as relations between the two become increasingly strained, even as President Emmanuel Macron talks up preserving the nuclear accord. Iran has said it had nothing to do with the alleged plot to attack a National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) meeting on June 30. Germany has detained an Iranian diplomat based in Austria. Belgium, where the plot was uncovered, has sought the diplomat’s extradition. French officials have not commented on the matter but diplomatic sources have said privately that if Iran’s involvement were proven then it would be difficult for France not to react strongly. Since pulling out of the nuclear accord, Trump has expressed a readiness to negotiate a new deal while warning Tehran of dire consequences “the like of which few throughout history have suffered before” if it made threats against the United States. It was Macron who led efforts to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement, arguing it was the best means Western powers had to check Iran’s nuclear activities. Rouhani on Monday urged the remaining signatories to the nuclear agreement to act to save the pact. Macron reiterated France’s commitment to maintaining the accord, but Europe’s leaders have appeared powerless to prevent the U.S. sanctions inflicting pain on Iran’s economy. The ministry memo said any staffer who travelled to Iran for personal reasons would not be shielded by diplomatic immunity, even if holding a diplomatic passport. It made specific reference to tourism and language classes. Britain’s foreign ministry said its advice on Iran to diplomats was the same as to the British public. It flags the risks of terrorist attacks and arbitrary detentions and advises against all travel to the frontiers with Iraq and Afghanistan.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An apparent Iranian influence operation targeting internet users worldwide is significantly bigger than previously identified, Reuters has found, encompassing a sprawling network of anonymous websites and social media accounts in 11 different languages. Facebook and other companies said last week that multiple social media accounts and websites were part of an Iranian project to covertly influence public opinion in other countries. A Reuters analysis has identified 10 more sites and dozens of social media accounts across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. U.S.-based cyber security firm FireEye Inc and Israeli firm ClearSky reviewed Reuters’ findings and said technical indicators showed the web of newly-identified sites and social media accounts - called the International Union of Virtual Media, or IUVM - was a piece of the same campaign, parts of which were taken down last week by Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc.  IUVM pushes content from Iranian state media and other outlets aligned with the government in Tehran across the internet, often obscuring the original source of the information such as Iran’s PressTV, FARS news agency and al-Manar TV run by the Iran-backed Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah. PressTV, FARS, al-Manar TV and representatives for the Iranian government did not respond to requests for comment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations last week dismissed accusations of an Iranian influence campaign as “ridiculous.”  The extended network of disinformation highlights how multiple state-affiliated groups are exploiting social media to manipulate users and further their geopolitical agendas, and how difficult it is for tech companies to guard against political interference on their platforms.  In July, a U.S. grand jury indicted 12 Russians whom prosecutors said were intelligence officers, on charges of hacking political groups in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. officials have said Russia, which has denied the allegations, could also attempt to disrupt congressional elections in November. Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who has previously analyzed disinformation campaigns for Facebook, said the IUVM network displayed the extent and scale of the Iranian operation.  “It’s a large-scale amplifier for Iranian state messaging,” Nimmo said. “This shows how easy it is to run an influence operation online, even when the level of skill is low. The Iranian operation relied on quantity, not quality, but it stayed undetected for years.” Facebook spokesman Jay Nancarrow said the company is still investigating accounts and pages linked to Iran and had taken more down on Tuesday.  “This is an ongoing investigation and we will continue to find out more,” he said. “We’re also glad to see that the information we and others shared last week has prompted additional attention on this kind of inauthentic behavior.” Twitter referred to a statement it tweeted on Monday shortly after receiving a request for comment from Reuters. The statement said the company had removed a further 486 accounts for violating its terms of use since last week, bringing the total number of suspended accounts to 770. “Fewer than 100 of the 770 suspended accounts claimed to be located in the U.S. and many of these were sharing divisive social commentary,” Twitter said. Google declined to comment but took down the IUVM TV YouTube account after Reuters contacted the company with questions about it. A message on the page on Tuesday said the account had been “terminated for a violation of YouTube’s Terms of Service.” IUVM did not respond to multiple emails or social media messages requesting comment. The organization does not conceal its aims, however. Documents on the main IUVM website iuvm.org said its headquarters are in Tehran and its objectives include ""confronting with remarkable arrogance, western governments and Zionism front activities.""   IUVM uses its network of websites - including a YouTube channel, breaking news service, mobile phone app store, and a hub for satirical cartoons mocking Israel and Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia - to distribute content taken from Iranian state media and other outlets which support Tehran’s position on geopolitical issues. Reuters recorded the IUVM network operating in English, French, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto, Russian, Hindi, Azerbaijani, Turkish and Spanish. Much of the content is then reproduced by a range of alternative media sites, including some of those identified by FireEye last week as being run by Iran while purporting to be domestic American or British news outlets. For example, an article run by in January by Liberty Front Press - one of the pseudo-U.S. news sites exposed by FireEye - reported on the battlefield gains made by the army of Iranian ally Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. That article was sourced to IUVM but actually lifted from two FARS news agency stories. FireEye analyst Lee Foster said iuvmpress.com, one of the biggest IUVM websites, was registered in January 2015 with the same email address used to register two sites already identified as being run by Iran. ClearSky said multiple IUVM sites were hosted on the same server as another website used in the Iranian operation.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military has no plans yet to suspend any more major military exercises with South Korea, the defence secretary said on Tuesday, in the middle of a breakdown in diplomacy with North Korea over its nuclear weapons. Defense Secretary James Mattis told a Pentagon news conference that no decisions had been made about major exercises for next year, but noted that the suspension of drills this summer as a good-faith gesture to North Korea was not open-ended. U.S. President Donald Trump’s June decision to unilaterally suspend the drills caught many American military planners off guard and was broadly criticised as a premature concession to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump wants to give up his nuclear weapons.     “We took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,” Mattis told reporters, referring to the June 12 meeting between Trump and Kim. “We have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,” he said, adding that no decisions had yet been made on major exercises for next year.  Mattis also said smaller exercises deemed to be exempt from the suspension were ongoing. Mattis’ comments on the drills come at a delicate time for negotiations between the United States and North Korea after Trump scrapped plans for a meeting between top officials from both countries. At the June summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim agreed in broad terms to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded.  Since then, diplomats have failed to advance the process.  North Korean officials even warned in a letter to U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week that denuclearisation talks risked falling apart, U.S. officials told Reuters.  In particular, the North wants steps towards a peace treaty.   The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces technically still at war with North Korea. U.S. officials fear North Korea might turn its attention to cutting a separate deal with South Korea and driving a wedge between the U.S.-South Korea alliance. A South Korea presidential spokesman acknowledged that talks between Washington and Pyongyang were at a stalemate. “With North Korea and the U.S. remaining stalemated, there is an even bigger need for an inter-Korea summit,” Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, told a briefing. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said this month his planned third summit with North Korea’s Kim next month would be another step towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and an end to the Korean War. Trump abruptly cancelled his top diplomat’s planned trip to North Korea on Friday, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since his summit with the North’s leader. Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang, led so far by Pompeo, could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. On Sunday, North Korea’s state media accused the United States of “double-dealing” and “hatching a criminal plot,” but did not mention Pompeo’s cancelled visit. U.S. intelligence and defence officials have repeatedly expressed doubts about North Korea’s willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and they had not expected Pompeo’s trip to yield positive results.   Mattis declined to comment on the broader diplomatic efforts, deferring to Pompeo’s State Department.  “We will work very closely, as I said, with the secretary of state and what he needs done we will certainly do to reinforce his effort. But at this time, there is no discussion about further suspensions,” Mattis said. The traditional U.S. calendar for other major drills does not pick up again until next spring, officials say, which could give diplomats and military planners time. The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which take months to plan.  One U.S. defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said preliminary planning for next year’s drills was already taking place. Still, the official acknowledged that would not be indicative of whether the drills will go forward. Max Thunder’s air combat exercises so unnerved North Korea this year that it issued threatening statements that nearly scuttled the June summit between Trump and Kim.  Foal Eagle is designed to simulate war scenarios and involves ground, air, naval and special operations forces.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada’s top trade negotiator praised Mexico’s trade concessions on autos and labor rights on Tuesday as she rejoined NAFTA talks, while U.S. lawmakers warned that a bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade deal would struggle to win approval in Congress. Automotive executives and other sources also told Reuters on Tuesday that the bilateral U.S.-Mexico deal announced on Monday allows President Donald Trump to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports of Mexican-made passenger vehicles and auto parts above certain volumes. If Trump proceeds with the tariffs now under consideration based on national security concerns, Mexican duty-free exports of cars and sport-utility vehicles to the United States would be capped at 2.4 million vehicles annually. Volumes above that level would be subject to tariffs, auto industry officials and other sources said. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said that Mexico’s “difficult” concessions to the United States on Monday would pave the way for productive talks this week as all three countries race toward a Friday deadline for a deal to modernize the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.  “These concessions are really going to be important for workers in Canada and the United States,” she told reporters after meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Freeland, who later met with Mexican officials on Tuesday evening, said she is due to dig into detailed discussions with Lighthizer on Wednesday.   Trump warned on Monday he could proceed with a deal with Mexico alone and levy tariffs on Canada if it does not come on board with the revised trade terms.     After being sidelined from the talks for more than two months, Freeland will be under pressure to accept terms the United States and Mexico worked out on a trade deal announced on Monday. One of the main sticking points for Canada in the revised deal is the U.S. effort to dump the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism that hinders the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases. Lighthizer said on Monday that Mexico had agreed to eliminate the mechanism. Other hurdles include intellectual property rights, such as the U.S.-Mexico 10-year data exclusivity for biologic drug makers and extensions of copyright protections to 75 years from 50, all higher thresholds than Canada has previously supported. Dan Ujczo, a Columbus, Ohio-based trade lawyer who focuses on U.S.-Canada issues, said it would be hard for Freeland to win concessions from Lighthizer on these issues. “I think he’s going to sit there with his arms folded a lot,” Ujczo added. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told Mexican television on Tuesday the three sides would work for a three-way deal. “We are now going to devote long hours to the negotiation with Canada,” he said. Negotiations among the three partners, whose mutual trade totals more than $1.2 trillion annually, have dragged on for more than a year, putting pressure on the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar. Both currencies gained against the U.S. dollar on Monday, but the peso weakened on Tuesday.  If a deal is not reached with Canada, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the Trump administration intends to proceed with a separate trade agreement with Mexico.  The Mexican government has also taken that position, even as it says it wants a trilateral deal. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is keen to sign the agreement before leaving office at the end of November. Some lawmakers said however, that a bilateral pact could lose the benefits of U.S. “fast-track” negotiating authority, which calls for a trilateral deal. A trilateral deal would need only 51 votes in the Senate, while a bilateral pact would need a far more difficult 60-vote threshold, Republican Senator Pat Toomey said. If Republicans retain 51 of the Senate’s 100 seats in November elections, they could approve a new NAFTA agreement next year without the support of Democrats.     Canada’s main stock index opened higher on Tuesday on hopes for a NAFTA trade deal, before ending lower. U.S. stocks edged to record highs for a third consecutive session. Trump said he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Canada did not join its neighbors and warned he expected concessions on Canada’s dairy protections. Canada’s dairy farmers operate under a protectionist system that manages supplies and prices, and imposes high tariffs to limit imports. U.S. demands have ranged from ending those tariffs to scrapping a pricing system for milk ingredients that hurt U.S. exports of milk proteins.   “It seems like a pretty steep challenge to now resolve these issues in three days,” said David Wines, a Manitoba dairy farmer and vice president of industry group Dairy Farmers of Canada. If talks with Canada are not wrapped up by Friday, Trump plans to notify Congress that he intends to sign a deal with Mexico, but would be open to Canada joining, Lighthizer told reporters on Monday. The White House has said Trump will sign the deal 90 days after notification. Congress needs to approve it in a process that will take several months, extending well into 2019.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek authorities have arrested two aid workers and are investigating a total of 30 from the same organisation on the island of Lesbos on suspicion they smuggled migrants into Greece, spied and laundered money, police said on Tuesday. Police said in a statement the suspects, 24 foreign nationals and six Greeks, had been active on the island since at least late 2015 as part of a non-governmental organisation, whose name the authorities would not disclose. Lesbos, not far from Turkey in the northeast Aegean Sea, was the preferred entry point into the European Union in 2015 for nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, and dozens of aid groups operated on Lesbos at the time. Over 19,000 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey so far this year, according to data from the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.  Police said the suspected crime ring allegedly “provided direct assistance to organized migrant trafficking rings.” They said the group obtained “significant amounts of money,” including from donations, without disclosing the amount. The 30 workers are being investigated on a case-by-case basis on suspicion of “establishing and joining a criminal organisation, money laundering, espionage, violating state secrets, counterfeiting and offenses against the immigration code and electronic communication legislation,” police said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s parliament voted on Tuesday to reject President Hassan Rouhani’s explanations for economic hardship after a dramatic grilling on live TV, a sign his pragmatic faction is losing sway to hardline rivals as new U.S. sanctions begin to bite. The vote in parliament came two days after lawmakers sacked the minister of economy and finance and weeks after they sacked the labour minister, blaming them for the collapse of the rial currency and surging inflation. Rouhani won two landslide elections on a platform of economic reform and opening Iran up to the outside world, and his pragmatic supporters have a majority in the parliament. But his reputation and political influence have taken a sharp hit as his promised economic gains have failed to materialise. His highest profile achievement was to negotiate the lifting of financial sanctions on Iran in a 2015 deal with world powers over its nuclear programme, but U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out in May and Washington has re-imposed sanctions. Rouhani spoke out in parliament in defence of his economic record, blaming the country’s woes on the U.S. sanctions rather than his team’s management. But a majority of lawmakers voted to reject his explanation in four out of five areas. There were conflicting reports about what would follow from the vote: several Iranian news agencies said Rouhani’s case would now be referred to the judiciary, although the spokesman for the parliamentary leadership, Behrouz Nemati, said lawmakers must hold further discussion before that would take place. The action in parliament is a further sign of how the Trump administration’s decision to re-impose sanctions could affect Iran’s leadership and its relationship with the outside world, potentially for decades to come. Iran’s rulers have been divided between a pragmatic faction that aims for better international relations, and hardliners who are wary of reforms. Trump’s decision to abandon the nuclear deal was opposed by U.S. allies in Europe, who argued that he  undermined Rouhani and strengthened the hands of the hardliners. While Rouhani and his cabinet run Iran’s day-to-day affairs, ultimate authority lies with the Supreme Leader, 79-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in power since 1989. Weakening the pragmatists now could affect the choice of Khamenei’s successor. For now, Rouhani’s own position appears safe. The judiciary could determine that he broke the law and parliament has the power to impeach him, but experts on Iranian politics say power struggles are more likely to play out indirectly. “The parliament’s move is politically motivated and indicates that tensions would increase in the Islamic Republic in coming months,” Saeed Laylaz, an Iranian economist, told Reuters by telephone from Tehran. “Iranian political factions have always used international issues to pursue their domestic gains,” he added. After the sacking of the two ministers this month, Tasnim news agency reported that 70 lawmakers had signed a motion to impeach a third: the Minister of Industry, Mines and Business. Rouhani has bowed to pressure and fired the head of the central bank. A deputy central bank governor was arrested by the judiciary on corruption charges in a crackdown that also saw foreign exchange dealers rounded up. The lawmakers asked Rouhani on Tuesday about five subjects: unemployment, slow economic growth, the fall of the rial, cross-border smuggling, and the lack of access by Iranian banks to global financial services. The parliament found only Rouhani’s answer about banks satisfactory. “I want to assure the Iranian nation that we will not allow the U.S. plot against the Islamic Republic to succeed,” Rouhani told parliament. “We will not let this bunch of anti-Iranians in the White House be able to plot against us.”   Iran’s official unemployment rate is 12 percent, with youth unemployment as high as 25 percent in a country where 60 percent of the 80 million population is under 30. The rial has lost more than two-thirds of its value in a year. Iran’s economy has suffered not only from sanctions but also from pervasive corruption and the concentration of its wealth and trade in the hands of big firms controlled by the hardline Revolutionary Guards military force. Washington imposed a new round of sanctions in August targeting Iran’s trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. Worse is yet to come, with a new round of sanctions to be imposed in November that Washington says aims to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting slogans against both the government and Supreme Leader Khamenei. Rouhani said such anti-government protests had encouraged Trump to try to provoke more unrest by harming Iran’s economy. “The protests tempted Trump to withdraw from the nuclear deal,” he said, asking lawmakers to support his cabinet and not add to anti-government sentiment. Although the economic problems were critical, Rouhani said: “More important than that is that many people have lost their faith in the future of the Islamic Republic and are in doubt about its power.” Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; Editing by Alison Williams and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-iran-economy-rouhani/iran-parliament-censures-rouhani-in-sign-pragmatists-losing-sway-idUKKCN1LD0AC,2019-02-08,,Iran parliament censures Rouhani in sign pragmatists losing sway
2019-02-08,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Sizzling weather this summer will put pressure on almost 200 governments to reach a deal in Poland in December on the details of a global plan to limit climate change, the incoming president of the U.N. talks said. Environment ministers will meet in Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal-producing region, Silesia, to agree rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord. That accord set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, but the text was vague on details. “Paris is empty without Katowice,” Michal Kurtyka, a former deputy energy minister of Poland who will preside at the Dec. 3-14 talks, told Reuters.  Poland, which generates most of its electricity from coal, is hosting the annual U.N. climate talks for the third time. “The Paris agreement includes certain principles. However, the way they will be implemented will be described in the Katowice package. So the more detailed and concrete it is, the better,” Kurtyka said. Hot weather this summer that set off wildfires from California to Greece has made officials more determined to reach a detailed deal in Katowice, he said.  “For sure this is something that affected millions of people all over the world.(...) Societies in particular countries will act on politicians. I think that this will increase political determination for the solutions to be as concrete and as detailed as possible,” Kurtyka said.   Many issues remain to be discussed at an extra session in Bangkok next month, he said, where “a vision of the whole should be built”.  Some of the sticking points include the way the countries report on their emission reductions, adapting to climate change and financing tools, he said. Environmentalists have complained about foot-dragging by the countries involved. French Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot resigned on Tuesday in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals.  Writing the “rule book” - formally known as “implementation guidelines” - is the biggest test of the international commitment to the Paris Agreement since U.S. President Donald Trump said in June last year that he would pull out. “If some countries, such as for example the U.S., conclude that they are not ready to follow the Paris agreement direction, then I’d assume that all other countries will seek to keep their presence so that they are part of the agreement,” Kurtyka said.  “I will strive for all parties to become signatories,  whereas the question I will ask at the end will be: Do I hear a voice of objection? I hope not”. The choice of Poland for the climate talks is itself a point of contention, because of its dependence on coal. In February, the European Union’s top court said the country had failed to uphold air-quality standards, one of several environmental conflicts between Poles and the EU. “The opinions that Poland is not a reliable climate talks host due to the significant share of coal in power production, are formulated from the EU perspective. The world is more diverse than that,” Kurtyka said. Kurtyka was appointed the climate talks president in April. He replaced the former Environment Minister Jan Szyszo, who had been initially named to preside at the conference in Katowice.  Szyszko had approved the increased logging in the ancient Bialowieza Forest back in 2016, another of Poland’s conflicts with the European Union.

The sector has undergone a wave of consolidation in recent years as companies bulk up product ranges and businesses in other markets, but the European Commission said that a preliminary review of the deal found no serious issues. “The transaction gives rise to a limited number of horizontal overlaps for which the Commission found, following its market investigation, that sufficient competition will remain after the transaction,” the Commission said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"CHEMNITZ, Germany (Reuters) - Far-right demonstrators clashed with leftist protesters in the eastern German city of Chemnitz on Monday after an Iraqi and a Syrian were arrested over a fatal stabbing that had triggered violent demonstrations. Police said they brought in water cannons after fireworks were thrown from both sides, causing injuries. State and local officials appealed for calm as thousands of people took to the streets and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said Germany would not tolerate “vigilante justice”. The unrest reflected a growing schism in German society after Merkel’s government allowed about 1 million asylum seekers to enter the country in 2015, triggering a shift to the right in German politics. Over a thousand leftist protesters massed near a giant statue of Karl Marx in Chemnitz on Monday evening to protest attacks on foreigners that occurred during an impromptu demonstration on Sunday after reports spread on social media about the stabbing of a 35-year-old German man. “The scenes of people going after those who look like foreigners scare us. We want to show that Chemnitz has another side that is cosmopolitan and opposes xenophobia,” Tim Detzner, the head of the radical Left party in Chemnitz, told the rally. Nearly the same number of demonstrators waving German and Bavarian flags gathered nearby, some breaking through police barriers aimed at keeping the two sides apart. Many chanted “We are the people,” a slogan used by far-right supporters. The police in Saxony, the eastern state where Chemnitz lies, said on Twitter at around 1930 GMT that the demonstration had ended and they were accompanying participants to the train station. Tensions were running high after some 800 demonstrators - including about 50 that police described as ready to commit violence - had taken to the streets on Sunday after the stabbing, which police said occurred after a row. Local prosecutors said they had arrested two suspects, a 22-year-old Syrian man and a 21-year-old Iraqi man.  Television news channels broadcast amateur footage of  skinheads chasing a man through the streets at Sunday’s protest. Police said they were still investigating reports of injury filed by Syrian, Afghan and Bulgarian people, and at least four demonstrators had been charged. “We don’t tolerate such unlawful assemblies and the hounding of people who look different or have different origins, and attempts to spread hatred on the streets,” Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news briefing. “That has no place in our cities and we, as the German government, condemn it in the strongest terms,” he said. “Our basic message for Chemnitz and beyond is that there is no place in Germany for vigilante justice, for groups that want to spread hatred on the streets, for intolerance and for extremism.” Roland Woeller, interior minister of the state of Saxony, which includes Chemnitz, said authorities would not allow “anarchists” to run rampant. He warned against “misinformation and lies” circulating in social media. The arrival of huge numbers of migrants from the Middle East three years ago has fuelled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), now the main opposition party in parliament. Tweeting about Sunday’s incident, AfD politician Markus Frohnmaier said: “If the state is no longer to protect citizens then people take to the streets and protect themselves. It’s as simple as that!” Martina Renner, a Left party lawmaker, accused the far-right of trying to exploit a murder for its own political ends. “A terrible murder, the background to which is still unclear, is being instrumentalised in the most repugnant way for racist riots in Chemnitz,” she tweeted. The violence in Chemnitz is likely to put further pressure on Merkel’s conservatives, who last week faced accusations of ignoring the rise of far-right groups in Saxony.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The slaying of two competitors at a Jacksonville video game tournament on Sunday has stirred the long-simmering gun rights debate in Florida on the eve of its hotly contested state and federal primary elections. With Florida voters scheduled to pick candidates for governor and Congress on Tuesday, some Democratic contenders said the shooting was further evidence of the need for stricter gun legislation while other hopefuls cancelled campaign appearances. “We as society have to come together and say enough of this,” Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson told reporters in Jacksonville, near the site of the shooting at a Madden 19 online football game tournament. The violence, which also injured 11 people, was the latest in a series of high-profile shootings in the state, following the killing of 17 students and educators at a high school in February and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016. The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office identified the shooter, who took his own life, as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore. Witnesses told local media Katz was angry because he lost the tournament. Katz was hospitalized twice as a teenager for mental illness and prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, the Baltimore Sun reported, citing his parents’ divorce filings. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Nelson’s re-election campaign is facing a November challenge by the state’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, in one of the key races that will determine the balance of power in the Senate. Gun rights, which are covered by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are one of the most contentious themes of American politics. The debate breaks along party lines, with Republicans typically arguing that better enforcement of existing gun laws is the best way to deter shootings, while Democrats call for more restrictions on weapons ownership. Given the partisan breakdown, the shooting may not change outcomes in Tuesday’s primaries where people will pick candidates from within their own parties. State Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, one of the Republicans seeking to succeed Scott as governor, cancelled a campaign event in Jacksonville and on Twitter said his “prayers continue to be with the victims and their families.” Democratic front-runner Gwen Graham called on Putnam and his leading Republican rival, U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, to offer a stronger policy response. “@AdamPutnam and @RonDeSantisFL are avoiding Jacksonville because they are scared to answer questions on gun violence,” Graham said in a Monday Twitter post. DeSantis spokesman Stephen Lawson said it was not the time to talk policy. “We chose not to politicize a tragedy,” Lawson said. “This is a sad attempt to score a quick political point while families are still grieving. Shame on you.” One of the people slain was Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, a representative of his family told reporters on Monday. The other was Taylor Robertson, 27, of Ballard, West Virginia, local media reported, citing family members. Robertson, a husband and father, won the tournament last year and Katz won it the year before, according to Madden publisher EA Sports, the unit of Electronic Arts Inc, which sponsored Sunday’s tournament. Katz had two handguns and extra ammunition but appeared to have fired only one gun, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference. Katz bought the guns, at least one of which was equipped with a laser sight, legally in Maryland, Williams said. Williams said the shooter targeted other gamers. “The suspect walked past patrons who were in other parts of the business and focussed his attention on the gamers,” he said.

2019-02-08,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador welcomed a deal between Mexico and the United States to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that he said preserved Mexican “sovereignty” in the energy sector. The U.S.-Mexico deal was announced by U.S. President Trump on Monday, putting pressure on Canada to agree to new terms and details that were only starting to emerge. Lopez Obrador said it was important that Canada be part of the deal. Lopez Obrador, who is scheduled to take office on Dec. 1, said Trump “understood our position” and accepted his incoming administration’s proposals on the energy sector. The text of the new agreement has not yet been made public. “We put the emphasis on defending national sovereignty on the energy issue and it was achieved,” Lopez Obrador told reporters after arriving in the southern state of Chiapas. “We are satisfied because our sovereignty was saved. Mexico reserves the right to reform its constitution, its energy laws, and it was established that Mexico’s oil and natural resources belong to our nation,” he said. Lopez Obrador opposed a constitutional change pushed through by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that opened production and exploration in the energy sector to private capital. Mexico has already awarded more than 100 oil exploration and production contracts to private companies. Lopez Obrador has said he would pour resources into state oil company Pemex while still respecting private sector contracts, as long as a review does not find evidence of corruption. He is expected to slow down or stall the process of offering more contracts to private players. Jesus Seade, Lopez Obrador’s designated chief NAFTA negotiator, participated in the latest talks between the current Mexican administration and the U.S. Trade Representative to strike the new NAFTA agreement. Seade said on Monday that both Pena Nieto’s team and the United States had agreed to change language in a draft proposal of the NAFTA overhaul on energy that had previously been a “cut and paste” from the text of Mexico’s energy reform. The new language still preserved the same ideas and was consistent with Pena Nieto’s reform, Seade said, adding that Lopez Obrador was not seeking to change the legal framework for private energy projects in Mexico. While the new administration planned to increase production at Pemex, Seade told a news conference in Washington “there will be areas where cooperation with the private sector is needed.” Reporting by Diego Ore Additional reporting by Sharay Angulo in Washington; Editing by Toni Reinhold",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-trade-nafta-mexico/mexicos-next-leader-says-nafta-deal-preserves-energy-sovereignty-idUKKCN1LC2BR,2019-02-08,,Mexico's next leader says NAFTA deal preserves energy 'sovereignty'

2019-02-08,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s antitrust watchdog expects to take first steps this year in its probe against Facebook (FB.O) after finding that the social media giant abused its market dominance to gather data on people without their knowledge or consent. The probe is being closely watched in Europe amid mounting concerns over leaks of data on tens of millions of Facebook users, as well as the extensive use of targeted ads by foreign powers seeking to influence elections in the United States.  The Federal Cartel Office objects in particular to how Facebook acquires data on people from third-party apps - including its own WhatsApp and Instagram services - and its online tracking of people who aren’t even members. “We are conscious that this should, and must, go quickly,” cartel office President Andreas Mundt told a news conference on Monday, adding that he hoped to take “first steps” this year. He declined to elaborate. The German probe is not expected to end in fines for Facebook, in contrast to European Union probes into Google that have ended in multi-billion-dollar penalties, most recently over the preinstallation of its apps on Android smartphones.  Sources familiar with the matter say, however, that the cartel office could require Facebook to take action to address its concerns if the company fails to do so voluntarily. Facebook responded earlier this year to the cartel office’s request for information, and the authority was reviewing whether new features - such as a “clear history” option announced by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in May - would address its concerns. “We need to establish whether this affects our investigation and addresses our concerns,” Mundt said. Separately, Mundt confirmed comments he made in a newspaper interview earlier this month that he may launch an investigation into the e-commerce industry under new powers that enable the cartel office to launch sector-wide probes. The focus would be on so-called “hybrid” platforms such as U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O) that sell their own products and services, but that also host third-party traders. “Our question is: what is the relationship between the platform, which itself is a very powerful trader, and the traders who use the platform?” said Mundt. He added that Amazon was the best-known of the e-commerce platforms but his interest in the matter extended to other players. The cartel office would not be looking at suspected tax evasion by third-party traders on e-commerce platforms - an issue that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has vowed to tackle - saying this was a matter for economic policy makers.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran for president in 2008 as a maverick Republican and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday. He was 81.     A senator from Arizona for more than three decades, McCain had been suffering from brain cancer since July 2017 and had not been at the U.S. Capitol this year. He died on Saturday afternoon at his ranch in Arizona with his wife, Cindy, and other family members at his bedside.  McCain frequently battled with Trump and his family has said he did not want the president to attend his funeral. Flags flew at half-staff at the White House on Sunday. Trump has tweeted his “deepest sympathies and respect” to McCain’s family, although he added no words of praise for McCain himself All five living former presidents - Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter - paid tribute to McCain’s courage and character. Cindy McCain said her husband had “passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.” McCain will lie in state in the Arizona Capitol on Wednesday and in the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Friday. There will be a memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral on Saturday, with U.S. and international leaders invited to attend, and McCain will then be buried in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday. McCain’s death brings to 50 the number of Republican-held seats in the 100-member U.S. Senate, with Democrats controlling 49. Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey will appoint a member of his own party to succeed McCain after the funeral. That could also give Republicans a slight edge in the battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court because McCain had been too ill to vote this year. Alternatively affable and cantankerous, McCain had been in the public eye since the 1960s when, as a naval aviator, he was shot down during the Vietnam War and tortured by his North Vietnamese Communist captors.     He was edged out by George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but became his party’s White House candidate eight years later. After gambling on political neophyte Sarah Palin as his running mate, McCain lost to Obama, who became the first black U.S. president. Obama said in a statement that he and McCain, despite their different backgrounds and political views, shared a belief in American ideals. “We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world,” Obama wrote. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was a frequent critic and target of his fellow Republican Trump, who was elected president in November 2016. McCain denounced Trump for, among other things, his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders the senator described as foreign “tyrants.”     “Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity,” McCain said of Trump in his memoir, “The Restless Wave,” which was released in May. McCain castigated Trump in July for his summit with Putin, calling their joint news conference in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.”  Defense Secretary James Mattis saluted McCain as a figure who “always put service to the nation before self.” In Germany, whose government has clashed with Trump over a range of issues including trade and defense, Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “John McCain was guided by the firm conviction that the value of all political work could be found in serving freedom, democracy and the rule of law.”      French President Emmanuel Macron called McCain “a true American hero (whose) ... voice will be missed” and British Prime Minister Theresa May said he “embodied the idea of service over self.” THUMBS-DOWN McCain, a traditionally Republican foreign policy hawk, was admired in both parties for championing civility and compromise during an era of acrid partisanship in U.S. politics.  But he also had a famous temper and rarely shied away from a fight, including several with Trump. He was the central figure in one of the most dramatic congressional moments in Trump’s presidency when he returned to Washington shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis for a middle-of-the-night vote in July 2017. Still bearing a black eye and scar from surgery, McCain gave a thumbs-down signal in a vote to scuttle a Trump-backed bill that would have repealed the Obamacare healthcare law and increased the number of Americans without health insurance by millions. Trump was furious about McCain’s vote and frequently referred to it at rallies. After Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, McCain condemned his hardline rhetoric on illegal immigration and said Trump had “fired up the crazies.” Trump retorted that McCain was “not a war hero,” adding: “I like people who weren’t captured.”     After Trump became president, McCain blasted what he called the president’s attempts to undermine the free press and rule of law and lamented the “half-baked, spurious nationalism” of the Trump era.  McCain, the son and grandson of U.S. Navy admirals, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 after more than two decades of Navy service.     Arizona next elected him to the U.S. Senate in 1986 to replace Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee revered by conservatives. In running for president in 2008, McCain tried to succeed fellow Republican Bush at time when the United States was mired in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and stuck in a financial crisis.     It was a stark contrast between McCain, then a 72-year-old veteran of Washington, and the 47-year-old Obama, who was offering a “Yes, we can” message of change.     McCain tried to inject some youth into his campaign with his selection of Palin, Alaska’s governor, as his running mate. But her political inexperience and shaky interview performances raised concerns about her qualifications. McCain voiced regret in his new memoir for not choosing then-Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned independent, as his running mate.  McCain flew attack planes off aircraft carriers during the Vietnam War. In October 1967, his A-4 Skyhawk was shot down on a bombing mission over North Vietnam’s capital and he suffered two broken arms and a broken leg. A mob dragged him from a lake, broke his shoulder and stabbed him.     Held at the notorious “Hanoi Hilton” prison and other sites, McCain was beaten and tortured, suffering broken bones and dysentery. He was released on March 14, 1973, but left with permanent infirmities.     Several U.S. citizens living in Vietnam adorned a monument erected at the site of the plane crash with flowers on Sunday in tribute. “Not only did Senator McCain actively contribute to Vietnam-U.S. ties, he was a friend of Vietnam who won huge love from Vietnamese people at many levels,” Vietnam’s ambassador to the United States, Ha Kim Ngoc, told the state-run Voice of Vietnam radio service. In Congress, McCain prided himself on his history of working across party lines on immigration, climate change and campaign finance reform.     He supported Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq but also spoke out against the Bush administration’s use of waterboarding, a type of simulated drowning widely considered torture, and other extreme interrogation tactics in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at an American naval installation in the Panama Canal Zone - U.S. territory at the time - where his father was stationed.     McCain divorced his wife Carol after 15 years of marriage in 1980 and weeks later married the then Cindy Henley, daughter of a wealthy beer distributor in Arizona.     A dark period for McCain came as one of the “Keating Five” group of senators accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators to help political contributor and bank executive Charles Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan failed in 1989, costing taxpayers $3.4 billion.      McCain was cleared of wrongdoing in 1991 but the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked him for poor judgment.     On July 25, 2017, McCain delivered a Senate floor speech not long after his cancer diagnosis that was widely seen as his farewell address. It called on fellow Republicans to stand up to Trump and for all lawmakers to work together to keep America as a “beacon of liberty” in the world.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - North Korea’s state-controlled newspaper on Sunday accused the United States of “double-dealing” and “hatching a criminal plot” against Pyongyang, after Washington abruptly cancelled a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Negotiations have been all but deadlocked since U.S. President Donald Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June.  Pompeo has pressed for tangible steps toward North Korea’s abandonment of its nuclear arsenal while Pyongyang is demanding that Washington first make concessions of its own.      North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said U.S. special units based in Japan were staging an air drill aimed at “the infiltration into Pyongyang”, citing a South Korean media outlet.  “Such acts prove that the U.S. is hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK and commit a crime which deserves merciless divine punishment in case the U.S. fails in the scenario of the DPRK’s unjust and brigandish denuclearisation first,” the paper said.  “We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the U.S. as it is busy staging secret drills involving man-killing special units while having a dialogue with a smile on its face,” it noted. A spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said he had no information on the drill alleged in the newspaper. The U.S. military spokesman in South Korea was not immediately available to comment.      The editorial, which did not mention the Pompeo visit, urged Washington to give up the “pointless military gamble” and implement the Singapore agreement, in which the leaders pledged to work towards a complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.  Since the summit, the two sides have struggled to narrow differences over the North’s nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang is calling for a declaration of peace as part of security guarantees designed to encourage it to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, while the Trump administration says a peace deal and other concessions will only come after more progress on denuclearisation. In part to reassure North Korea, Trump cancelled or delayed joint military drills with South Korea, but smaller exercises continue.  Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. China expressed “serious concern” about Trump’s comments, which it called “irresponsible”.

2019-02-08,"YANGON (Reuters) - A court in Myanmar is set to hand down verdicts on Monday in the case of two Reuters journalists accused of obtaining secret state documents. Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, are charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. The court in Yangon has been holding hearings since January. The reporters and one police witness for the prosecution have testified that they were set up by police to block or punish them for their reporting of a mass killing of Rohingya Muslims. The verdict will be delivered amid growing pressure on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government over an army crackdown that began last August. Around 700,000 Rohingya have since fled the western state of Rakhine to neighbouring Bangladesh, according to United Nations agencies.  Soldiers are accused of mass killings, rape, and arson in a campaign the U.N. has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.  Myanmar denies most of the allegations, but has acknowledged the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys by troops and Buddhist civilians in the village of Inn Din that the two Reuters reporters had been investigating when they were arrested. During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up inside a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers. In April, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing testified that a senior officer had ordered his subordinates to plant secret documents on Wa Lone to “trap” the reporter. Other police witnesses have told court the reporters were searched at a routine traffic stop by officers who were unaware they were journalists and found to be holding secret documents from an unknown source. The verdict is due on the same day that a U.N mandated fact-finding mission will release its report on the Rohingya crisis. On Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council will hold a briefing on Myanmar in New York.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - John McCain, who died on Saturday, spent more than five years as a prisoner of war and more than three decades in the U.S. Senate representing Arizona, earning a reputation as a maverick who did not always follow the Republican Party line.      Following are some facts about McCain. * He was an unruly and even combative student at his Washington-area boarding school. As the son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals, McCain followed in their footsteps by attending the U.S. Naval Academy, where he continued to rebel against regulations and graduated near the bottom of his class. * McCain’s plane was shot down during a combat mission over Vietnam in 1967. He spent 5-1/2 years in captivity, including two years in solitary confinement, and was subjected to frequent beatings and torture that left a permanent disability. In the Senate, he was a critic of harsh interrogation techniques such as “waterboarding” or simulated drowning of terrorism suspects. * Among the military medals McCain earned were three Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, two Legion of Merit awards, a Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross. * McCain was working for an Arizona beer distributor - the father of his second wife, Cindy - when he entered politics. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 and won the first of six Senate terms in 1986. * McCain was seen as a maverick in his campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination when he gave then-Texas Governor George W. Bush a scare by decisively winning the first of the state nominating contests. Later he fared poorly in the “Super Tuesday” nominating races and eventually conceded to Bush after a bitter campaign. * After winning the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, McCain lost the popular vote to Democrat Barack Obama, 53 percent to 46 percent. * In Congress, McCain was a pro-business conservative, free-market advocate and abortion foe but he voted against the Republican majority on several high-profile bills. After being cleared in the 1980s in the “Keating Five” campaign donation scandal, he made election campaign finance reform a signature concern.  * In 2017 doctors found an aggressive brain tumour during surgery in Arizona to remove a blood clot behind McCain’s left eye. He returned to Washington less than two weeks later and went against his party’s wishes by casting a dramatic late-night vote that doomed Republicans’ efforts to repeal Obama’s healthcare plan. Afterward, McCain spent much of his time in Arizona undergoing treatment and resting. * McCain was a prominent critic of President Donald Trump. After McCain criticized Trump’s harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration, Trump disparaged McCain’s military service by saying he preferred “people who weren’t captured.” McCain, out of party loyalty, later endorsed Trump once he had secured the Republican nomination. McCain withdrew his support in October 2016 after a tape emerged in which Trump boasted of grabbing women by the genitals. McCain would go on to be a regular critic of Trump’s presidency.

2019-02-08,"LIMA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Venezuelan migrants entered Peru on Saturday to seek refugee status or for other humanitarian reasons, Peruvian authorities said, despite a new rule prohibiting Venezuelans without passports from crossing into Peru from Ecuador taking effect. Peru implemented the passport requirement on Saturday due to a four-fold increase in migrants fleeing economic collapse in Venezuela in the past eight months, in a move authorities said would help them register entrants. Many Venezuelans struggle to obtain passports and arrive only with national identity cards. “There are hundreds that have entered with a petition for refugee status, a procedure that is allowing people without passports to enter,” said Abel Chiroque, the director of the public defender’s office in the border town of Tumbes. “We must act humanely with this vulnerable population.” Other migrants - namely children, pregnant women, the ill and the elderly - had been allowed entry for humanitarian reasons, he added. Both Ecuador and Peru tightened border restrictions for Venezuelan migrants earlier this month in response to the growing influx. This week, the United Nations migration agency said the exodus was building toward a “crisis moment” and called on Peru and Ecuador to ease the restrictions. Chiroque said he had received reports of possible human trafficking, and was concerned about cases of children and adolescents travelling alone or accompanied by adults who were not direct family members.  He pointed to the case of seven children who were travelling without parents, and were currently being held in a state-run shelter in Tumbes until authorities can “resolve their situation.” The growing numbers fleeing economic meltdown and political turmoil in Venezuela, where people scrounge for food and other necessities of daily life, threaten to overwhelm neighbouring countries. Officials from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will meet in Bogota next week to seek a way forward.

Those who met the pope included Marie Collins and Paul Redmond, two leading campaigners. Some victims of abuse had wanted for Francis to meet such campaigners who they said would challenge him on the Vatican’s role in the scandals. Redmond, who was born in one of Ireland’s church-run “Mother and Baby Homes” and adopted at 17-days-old, said in a statement the meeting was cordial and polite and that the pope apologised for what happened in the homes.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA/CARACAS (Reuters) - The exodus of migrants from Venezuela is building toward a “crisis moment” comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean, the United Nations migration agency said on Friday. Growing numbers are fleeing economic meltdown and political turmoil in Venezuela, where people scrounge for food and other necessities of daily life, threatening to overwhelm neighbouring countries. Officials from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru will meet in Bogota next week to seek a way forward. In Brazil, rioters this month drove hundreds back over the border. Peru this month tightened entry rules for Venezuelans, requiring them to carry passports instead of just national ID cards, though a judge in Ecuador on Friday rolled back a similar rule enacted there. Describing those events as early warning signs, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Joel Millman, said funding and means of managing the outflow must be mobilized. “This is building to a crisis moment that we’ve seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,” he told a news briefing. On Thursday, the IOM and U.N. refugee agency UNHCR called on Latin American countries to ease entry for Venezuelans, more than 1.6 million of whom have left since 2015. Peru’s top immigration official, Eduardo Sevilla, said Peru will exempt some Venezuelans from the passport requirement, including parents with children seeking to join the rest of their family, pregnant women and the gravely ill. But Sevilla said authorities would also be vigilant of attempts to evade the new rule by claiming refugee status. “Is UNHCR going to take responsibility if that person commits a crime?” Sevilla said to Reuters on Friday. “Our priority is to contribute to security and internal order by clearly identifying people.”     UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said on Friday that governments had made “commendable” efforts even though some reception capacities and services were overwhelmed. But he said “some disturbing images” had emerged from the region in the past week that risked stigmatizing Venezuelans who had fled and complicating efforts to integrate them. An Ecuadorean judge, Judith Naranjo, on Friday lifted an order requiring that Venezuelans hold passports to be allowed entry, in response to a lawsuit filed by Ecuador’s state ombudsman together with local human rights groups. “The judge accepted the request for the precautionary measures requested by the ombudsman,” the agency wrote on Twitter. Ecuador’s government said it would respect the decision to allow migrants to enter on their Venezuelan identification cards. But it said that the identification cards would have to be accompanied by a “certificate of validation” issued by Venezuela or an international agency recognised by Ecuador. Ecuador said the measure was intended to protect its own citizens. It did not say when it would take effect. Venezuela’s information minister, Jorge Rodriguez, said on Friday that a new package of economic measures meant to address hyperinflation would win over Venezuelans who had left the country. Venezuela on Monday cut five zeros from prices and pegged the country’s currency to an obscure state-backed cryptocurrency. Critics slammed the plan as inadequate in the face of inflation that topped 82,000 percent in July and is expected to reach 1 million percent this year. “The conclusion is that Venezuelans are going to return and furthermore we invite them to return because we need them for this recovery plan,” Rodriguez told a news conference.

2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s Constitutional Court confirmed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s disputed July 30 election victory on Friday, dismissing an opposition challenge that had held up his inauguration, which will now be held on Sunday. Before the vote, Mnangagwa had said a credible election could pull Zimbabwe out of its diplomatic isolation under former president Robert Mugabe, ending international sanctions and prompting an economic recovery.  Instead, the vote left the nation polarised, with Nelson Chamisa, who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), mounting the legal challenge and violence flaring on the streets of Harare. In a unanimous ruling of the nine judges of the country’s top court, Chief Justice Luke Malaba said Chamisa had failed to prove allegations of fraud during the presidential vote. “Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa is duly declared the winner of the presidential elections held on the 30th of July 2018,” Malaba said in his ruling. Chamisa had earlier said he reserved the right to take alternative actions, including peaceful protests, if he lost the legal case.  On Friday, he did not spell out his next step but told his supporters on Twitter that he would consult them on the “course of action to be taken to rescue our beautiful Zimbabwe from the jaws of poverty, corruption & dishonesty”. The election, in which Mnangagwa and Chamisa were the main contenders, was touted as a crucial step towards shedding Zimbabwe’s pariah reputation and securing international donor funding to revive an economy suffering chronic shortages of investment and cash, as well as high unemployment. An army crackdown in response to post-election violence by opposition supporters left six people dead on Aug. 1, recalling the heavy-handed security tactics that marked the 37-year rule of Mugabe, who was removed in a coup last November. Mnangagwa now faces the challenge of persuading the international community that the army crackdown and lapses in the election process will not derail his promise of reforms to overcome corruption and mismanagement under Mugabe. After the ruling was delivered, the president called for peace on his Twitter feed.  “Nelson Chamisa, my door is open and my arms are outstretched, we are one nation, and we must put our nation first. Let us all now put our differences behind us,” he said. Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa told Reuters that Mnangagwa would be inaugurated on Sunday. At ZANU-PF’s offices, hundreds of supporters in the party’s green and yellow colours followed Malaba’s judgment on television, erupting into song and dance after their candidate was confirmed as president.  “He won the battle,” a supporter told Reuters TV, adding that while Mnangagwa’s enemies were trying their best, “they fail”.  MDC Secretary General Douglas Mwonzora told reporters outside the court that “whatever we do as MDC we are going to act within the law ... We want Zimbabweans who want to demonstrate to be allowed to demonstrate.” Outside the party’s office, one MDC member questioned the judges’ verdict. “It was not fair, they were favouring one side - ZANU-PF. The MDC had enough evidence but it was not considered,” he said. Police blocked roads around the court, a 19th century British colonial building just opposite Mnangagwa’s offices in central Harare. Vehicles carrying water cannon reappeared on streets near the court house while riot police patrolled the city centre in groups. A Reuters witness said Harare was calm immediately after the ruling, with people going about their usual business. In separate statements, the European Union urged all parties to “call for calm and restraint” after the court ruling, while the United States called for the parties to respect the “constitution and the rule of law.” “It is important that the new government engages all stakeholders in substantive discussions on the necessary reforms, including on further electoral reforms,” the EU said. The U.S. State Department made a similar appeal. Before the ruling, the head of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches told Reuters it was speaking to senior leaders from ZANU-PF and the MDC to facilitate negotiations. “We have been reaching out to both political parties to their highest level of leadership for us to explore a possibility of some form of dialogue,” General Secretary Kenneth Mtata said.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Pope Francis will arrive in Ireland on Saturday to find a society transformed since the last papal visit 39 years ago and beset by the kind of abuse scandals that have mired the Catholic Church in crisis again. More than three-quarters of the Irish population flocked to see Pope John Paul II in 1979 at a time when divorce and contraception were illegal. Today, Ireland is no longer staunchly Catholic and over the past three years, voters have approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums, defying the will of the church. Numbers lining the streets or joining Francis in prayer are expected to be about a quarter of the 2.7 million who greeted John Paul II, marking how the rock that was once Irish Catholicism has eroded since child abuse cases came to light in the 1990s. “The Catholic Church is still very much part of our society but not at the centre of it as it was 40 years ago,” Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who last year became Ireland’s first gay leader, told the BBC. “Ireland has become a very different place in the last 40 years and our relationship with the church has changed principally because of so many revelations that have occurred around child sex abuse.” Varadkar, who remarked how some his predecessors would have consulted bishops about public policy in decades past, will meet Francis at the start of the two-day visit and has promised to challenge the pope to do more in dealing with the abuse crisis. Francis, facing sexual abuse crises in several countries, wrote an unprecedented letter to all Catholics this week asking each one of them to help root out “this culture of death” and vowing there would be no more cover ups. He will also travel to Knock, a small western village steeped in Catholicism that welcomes 1.5 million pilgrims a year, before finishing his trip by saying mass in Dublin’s Phoenix Park where a large cross erected for the 1979 visit still dominates the skyline. The 500,000 tickets issued for the mass were quickly snapped up, although an unknown number have been booked by a boycott group called ‘Say Nope To The Pope’ which encouraged protestors to order tickets and not use them.  Abuse survivors and their supporters plan to gather elsewhere in Dublin during the mass, while a silent vigil will also be held at the site of a former church-run home for unwed mothers where an unmarked grave with the remains of hundreds of babies was found in 2014. The Vatican has said Francis will meet Irish victims of clergy sexual abuse, but the pope will also be under pressure to address the recent scandals that have led to the church’s worst credibility crisis in more than 15 years.  A damning report last week into abuse in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, combined with scandals in Australia and Chile, have formed what one Vatican official called “a perfect storm” and already overshadowed a trip where the main purpose is to close a week-long international Catholic gathering. “Each time a local church has found itself facing a scandal, it is as if the church must start all over again to understand the depths of this heart of darkness,” Barbara Thorp, the former head of the office for pastoral support and child protection in the U.S. Archdiocese of Boston, where the first abuse crisis erupted in 2002, told the gathering on Friday. “We have a raging fire within the church. Inexplicably church leaders have shown callous indifference to the suffering of children and the vulnerable and the fire rages on.”  Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pope-ireland/pope-travels-to-transformed-ireland-as-abuse-crises-rage-idUKKCN1L9294,2019-02-08,,Pope travels to transformed Ireland as abuse crises rage
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could force European Union banks operating in London to start holding capital against inventory of riskier EU government bonds in the case of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit. At part of preparations for Britain’s departure from European Union next March, the finance ministry has published a “statutory instrument” or ‘SI’ to help transfer EU rules like financial regulation into national law to avoid a legal void on the first day of Brexit. Banks in the EU don’t have to hold capital against holdings of their own government’s bonds, a rule known as zero risk weight, as such domestic debt is considered “risk free”. The government said in its SI published on Tuesday that if Britain leaves the bloc with no transition deal next March, the EU would automatically become a “third country”. This means that the zero risk weight rule would no longer apply to EU banks in Britain. “Therefore, this SI will remove preferential treatment for EU27 exposures,” the document said. The SI acknowledges that the same change would be made by the EU when regulating British banks operating in the bloc after Brexit. The finance ministry said it plans to put the SI to parliament in the autumn. “The intention of this SI is not to make policy changes, other than to reflect the UK’s new position outside the EU, and to smooth the transition to this position,” the finance ministry said. The zero risk weight rule is based on a global standard from the Basel Committee of banking supervisors. It became discredited when a sharp deterioration in Greek, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish government bonds during the euro zone debt crisis showed that such debt can be risky and feed a “doom loop” to drag down lenders. Efforts to change the rule at the global level have dragged on as the issue is seen as politically sensitive in the euro zone, where introducing capital charges could prompt lenders to ditch the bonds of governments with lower credit ratings to minimize capital requirements.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (RYA.I) is to end its long-standing practice of allowing passengers to take a 10-kilogramme piece of hand luggage for free and will charge between 6 and 10 euros (£9)for the service from November.  Under the new rules, passengers will still be allowed to take one “small personal bag” on board, to be placed under the seat in front.  But if a passenger wants to bring a medium-sized suitcase of up to 10-kiogrammes, they will now have to pay. They can pay between 6 and 8 euros to take it on board and put it in the overhead locker or pay between 8 and 10 euros to check it in. The airline said it was making the change as planes were being delayed as passengers brought too much hand luggage.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British banks approved fewer mortgages last month, despite a boost from existing home-owners seeking to lock in cheaper interest rates ahead of the Bank of England’s rate rise in August, industry data showed on Friday. The number of mortgages approved for new house purchases dropped by 4.3 percent on the year to 39,584 on a seasonally adjusted basis, figures from trade association UK Finance showed, and net mortgage lending was the weakest since February. “The broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation,” UK Finance director Peter Tyler said. “July saw steady growth in gross mortgage lending, driven largely by remortgaging as homeowners locked into attractive deals in anticipation of the recent base rate rise,” he added. Annual consumer credit growth slowed to 3.7 percent, its weakest since December 2014, though a narrower measure of credit card purchases was more robust, which UK Finance linked to the World Cup and unusually warm weather boosting spending.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese officials ended two days of talks on Thursday with no major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with activation of another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country’s goods. “We concluded two days of discussions with counterparts from China and exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a brief emailed statement. The discussions included “addressing structural issues in China,” including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies, Walters said. The mid-level Trump administration officials participating in the talks would brief the heads of their agencies on the discussions, she added. Implementation of the latest 25 percent tariffs on Thursday did not derail the talks, led by U.S. Treasury Under Secretary David Malpass and Chinese Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen. They were the first face-to-face U.S.-China meetings since early June to try to find a way out of a deepening trade conflict and escalating tariffs. (GRAPHIC: U.S. trade with China - tmsnrt.rs/2KAT34a) Earlier, a senior Trump administration official downplayed chances for success, saying China had yet to address U.S. complaints about alleged misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property and industrial subsidies. “In order for us to get a positive result out of these engagements, it’s really critical that they (China) address the fundamental concerns that we have raised,” the official said on a press call on the new U.S. security review law for foreign acquisitions. “We haven’t seen that yet, but we are going to continue to encourage them to address problems that we have raised.” In a brief statement on Friday, the Chinese commerce ministry said both sides had a “constructive” and “candid” exchange over trade issues, and will stay in touch on the next steps. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China did not like providing a running commentary while talks were under way, and preferred to quietly do the work. “This round of trade negotiations is the same. If you want to seriously talk for a good outcome then you should do so earnestly, there’s no need to speak out loudly,” he told a daily news briefing. China’s Commerce Ministry said in Beijing that it has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the latest round of U.S. tariffs. The two countries have now targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods and threatened duties on most of the rest of their bilateral trade, raising concerns that the conflict could dent global economic growth. Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to press Beijing, but the White House appears to believe it is winning the trade war as China’s economy slows and its stock markets tumble. Economists reckon that every $100 billion of imports hit by tariffs would reduce global trade by around 0.5 percent. They have assumed a direct impact on China’s economic growth in 2018 of 0.1 to 0.3 percentage point, and somewhat less for the United States, but the impact will be bigger next year, along with collateral damage for other countries and companies tied into China’s global supply chains. Business groups expressed hope that the meeting would mark the start of serious negotiations over Chinese trade and economic policy changes demanded by Trump. However, Trump on Monday told Reuters in an interview he did not “anticipate much” from this week’s talks. His hard line has rattled Beijing and spurred rare criticism within the highest levels of China’s ruling Communist Party over its handling of the trade dispute, sources have said. Beijing has denied U.S. allegations it systematically forces the unfair transfer of U.S. technology and has said it adheres to World Trade Organization rules. Washington’s latest tariffs apply to 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has said benefit from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial plan to make China competitive in high-tech industries. China’s list of 333 U.S. product categories hit with duties includes coal, copper scrap, fuel, steel products, buses and medical equipment. Though it is too early for trade damage to show up in much economic data, tariffs are beginning to increase costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Pacific, forcing companies to adjust supply chains and pricing, with some U.S. companies looking to decrease reliance on China.  John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the tariffs would hurt U.S. companies more than Chinese firms, since most semiconductor products imported from China started out as chips fabricated in the United States. “Putting tariffs on semiconductors specifically doesn’t give the administration additional leverage. The Chinese don’t sell their own semiconductors to America so Chinese enterprises won’t be hurt by this,” Neuffer said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has opened its digital consumer savings platform Marcus to its own staff in Britain ahead of a wider roll-out to the public in the coming weeks, according to an internal memo sent to staff on Thursday and seen by Reuters. Since its launch in the United States in 2016 the digital bank has accumulated more than $20 billion (£15.7 billion) in deposits, as Goldman seeks to diversify its sources of funding and compete with rival U.S. lenders that have full retail banks. The bank will offer an online savings account to customers in Britain, Goldman Sachs told staff in the memo, and forms part of the bank’s strategy to grow its consumer business. The move pits the U.S. investment banking giant against incumbent British lenders such as HSBC (HSBA.L) and Barclays (BARC.L), as well as startup digital players such as Atom Bank and Tandem, which also offer savings accounts via mobile apps.  Goldman has said it may seek to expand its consumer bank through acquisitions or even buying a traditional lender. The U.S. bank got into consumer banking much later than big U.S. banking peers, and analysts have said over the years that acquiring a big retail lender would help even out volatile results from businesses such as trading and investment banking.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton said on Thursday he had warned Moscow against meddling in the U.S. midterm elections in November during talks with the head of Russia’s National Security Council. Bolton said he had also raised with Nikolai Patrushev the issue of tightening economic sanctions against Iran and said they had discussed a phased withdrawal of Iran’s presence in Syria, but gave no details. “I made it clear we wouldn’t tolerate (election) meddling in 2018 and that we were prepared to take necessary steps to prevent it from happening,” Bolton told a news conference after more than five hours of talks with Patrushev in Geneva. The United States has already imposed economic sanctions against Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Moscow denies the allegations. Bolton said differences over the alleged meddling had prevented the two sides from issuing a joint final statement after the first high-level meeting of its kind since Trump met President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July. In answer to a question, Bolton said that he had not raised the statement by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday that hackers linked to Russia’s government had sought to launch cyber attacks on U.S. political groups. He noted Microsoft was not a U.S. governmental institution.  “I think we made a lot of progress, we identified certain areas where lines of communication could be restored and more work done by the affected agencies - State Dept, Defense Department, other agencies as well,” Bolton said. Patrushev was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying they had broadly agreed to re-open communication lines between their respective foreign and defence ministries. Bolton, one of the Trump administration’s leading hawks in  dealing with Iran’s nuclear programme, held talks with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem this week. Bolton said on Thursday that following the U.S. decision to withdraw from a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, the Trump administration’s objective was to “put maximum pressure on the regime” by making sanctions “more extensive and more effective”. Patrushev had not sought Russian waivers on sanctions during their talks, he added. Commenting on Iran’s role in Syria’s long-running conflict, Bolton said: “Our objective is that all Iranian forces return to Iran ... And we talked about a variety of ways in which it might be accomplished through a series of steps.” Bolton, a critic of the New START treaty agreed during Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, said the two sides did not set a date for deciding what to do about the treaty due to expire in 2021. “We are very very early in the process of considering what we are going to do with New START or the INF treaty,” he said, referring to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces pact.

2019-02-08,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel still hopes the United States will recognise its claim to sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday, after a top U.S. official said the issue was not currently under consideration by Washington. Israel captured much of the Golan from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed it, a move not endorsed internationally. Netanyahu raised the possibility of U.S. recognition in his first White House meeting with President Donald Trump in February 2017. Trump reversed a long-standing U.S. policy by recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December 2017. Few other countries have followed the move, which angered Palestinians who want East Jerusalem as capital of their own future state. Last May, Netanyahu’s intelligence minister said that U.S. recognition on the Golan issue could be forthcoming within months. But in a Reuters interview during a visit to Israel this week, Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton said “there’s no discussion of it, no decision within the U.S. government”.  Netanyahu was asked by reporters whether Israel, in light of Bolton’s remarks, had dropped expectations of U.S. recognition of Israel’s Golan claim. He replied: “Would I give up on such a thing? No way.” In the interview, Bolton said that while the United States understands Israel’s position regarding the Golan, “there’s no change in the U.S. position for now”.  Once willing to consider returning the Golan for peace with Syria, the Israelis have argued in recent years that the country’s civil war and the presence of an Iranian garrison backing Damascus showed they had to keep the strategic plateau. Yoav Gallant, an Israeli security cabinet minister, suggested on Thursday that the priority for Israel and its U.S. ally was the removal of Iranian forces and Tehran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas from Syria.  Bolton discussed the matter with his Russian counterpart in Geneva on Thursday. Moscow, which backs Damascus, wants Syrian territorial integrity restored.  “As Syria is rebuilt, we have two significant interests. The first is Iran and Hezbollah each going back where they belong,” Gallant told Israel’s Channel 13 television. “And the second interest is unequivocal Israeli sovereignty on every metre of the Golan Heights.”  “I think that if we work the right way, we will get this.” Russia has said that it cannot compel Iran to quit Syria. Bolton, in his Reuters interview, said Russia was “stuck” in Syria and seeking alternative sources of reconstruction funds. This gave Washington leverage in urging an Iranian withdrawal, the prerequisite for resolving the Syria crisis, Bolton said. Moscow disputed those remarks.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has called off plans for the domestic and international listing of state oil giant Aramco, billed as the biggest stock flotation in history, four senior industry sources said on Wednesday. Financial advisers working on the planned listing have been disbanded as Saudi Arabia shifts its attention to a proposed acquisition of a “strategic stake” in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp, two of the sources said. [nL8N1UE4VF] “The decision to call off the IPO was taken some time ago, but no-one can disclose this, so statements are gradually going that way - first delay then calling off,” a Saudi source familiar with the IPO plans said. “The message we have been given is that the IPO has been called off for the foreseeable future,” said a second source, a senior financial adviser. “Even the local float on the Tadawul Stock Exchange has been shelved,” that person said. Early on Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister issued a denial that the IPO had been called off. “The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the Government,” Khalid al-Falih said in a statement. Falih said Riyadh had taken measures to prepare for the listing and the timing would depend on factors including favorable market conditions.  The proposed listing of the national champion was a central part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom’s economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. The prince announced the plan to sell about 5 percent of Aramco in 2016 via a local and an international listing, predicting the sale would value the whole company at $2 trillion or more. Several industry experts questioned whether a valuation that high was realistic, which hindered the process of preparing the IPO for the advisors. A third industry source said the IPO had been called off for the time being but that it could be revived in future, if appropriate. “It has been postponed until further notice,” the source said. Stock exchanges in financial centers including London, New York and Hong Kong have been vying to host the international tranche of the share sale. An army of bankers and lawyers have competed to win advisory roles in the IPO, seen as a gateway to a host of other deals they expect to flow from the kingdom’s wide privatization program. International banks JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, were working as global coordinators, boutique investment banks Moelis & Co and Evercore were chosen as independent advisers and law firm White & Case as legal adviser, sources had previously told Reuters. More banks were expected to be named but no bookrunners were formally appointed despite banks pitching for the deal. Lawyers, bankers and auditors are all essential in the drafting the prospectus, a formal document that provides essential details on the company. Aramco had a budget which it used to pay advisers until the end of June. This has not been renewed, one of sources said. “The advisers have been put on standby,” a fourth source, a senior oil industry official, said. Sources have previously told Reuters that in addition to the valuations, disagreements among Saudi officials and their advisers over which international listing venue to be chosen had slowed the IPO preparations.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (RYA.I) reached an agreement with the trade union representing its Irish pilots on Thursday, a breakthrough that sent its shares sharply higher as the budget airline strives to quell staff protests around Europe. Ryanair passengers have suffered hundreds of flight cancellations this summer because of protests by pilots over slow progress in negotiating collective labour agreements, hitting average fares at Europe’s largest low-cost carrier. The Irish airline endured its worst one-day strike earlier in August after a walk-out by pilots in five European countries disrupted the plans of an estimated 55,000 people at the height of the summer holiday season. That included a fifth 24-hour walkout of the summer by around a quarter of its pilots in Ireland that prompted Ryanair to propose fresh talks with the help of a mediator that began last week and ended early on Thursday after a 22-hour session.  “The proposed agreement will now go to ballot, with a recommendation for acceptance from Forsa and its Ryanair pilot representatives,” pilots’ union Forsa said in a statement, adding the talks’ mediator asked that neither side makes further comment while the ballot is conducted. Ryanair said it would take the proposals to its board after the Irish-based pilots had voted on the agreement. Some of the other trade unions stuck in negotiations around Europe have said they are watching the Irish talks closely, although Dutch pilots’ union VNV saw little read across, saying the Irish agreement did not appear to cover all the issues at stake, and was limited to base transfers and promotions. “We shall have to study the details, but for now we don’t see much in this agreement for us to build on, as we have different priorities,” VNV spokesman Joost van Doesburg said, basing his assessment on documents the union had seen so far. Dutch pilots were among those that took part in the Aug. 10 strike. Ryanair employs more than 4,000 pilots, with around 350 of them based in Ireland. Negotiations in the country have been among the most difficult, the company has said. Shares in Ryanair were 5.9 percent higher at 13.93 euros at 1005 GMT, top of the regional STOXX 600 benchmark index. The stock is still down 15 percent since the strike action ramped up in mid-July and remains below the 14.21 euros it slumped to in December when Ryanair shocked markets by agreeing to recognise unions for the first time in its 30-year history.

2019-02-08,"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi grandmother Sana Ibrahim al-Taee has a full-time job feeding and clothing her 22 grandchildren after Islamic State killed their fathers - her sons - a struggle in a cramped flat with little help from the state. Al-Taee and her husband, who has Alzheimer’s, share their four-room apartment in eastern Mosul with the children, aged between two and 16, their daughter and two of their sons’ widows. Rent, food, clothes and schooling depend on donations and charity handouts. Al-Taee is waiting to hear if the government will provide pensions of 500,000 dinars (£325.2) a month for her sons, who worked in the military and police. “I hope that the authorities will give pensions and housing for those orphans, because I am not going to live for 100 years,” the 60-year-old told Reuters. Al-Taee, who is in poor health with vocal cord paralysis, has provided death certificates for three sons but said the other two were buried in mass, unmarked graves and she has not been able to find their bodies. That means they are classed as missing rather than dead so she has no death certificates for them and cannot apply for their pensions - a common problem for families in the north and west of the country where Islamic State controlled vast swaths of territory in 2014. The militants were driven out by U.S.-backed Iraqi troops in December, but the government has said it will need up to $100 billion (£77.4 billion) to rebuild the cities with Mosul’s mosques, churches, markets and other landmarks left in ruin. “When Daesh (Islamic state) militants seized our areas, they destroyed us. By God, the militants humiliated us. They killed our sons and nothing has remained,” al-Taee said. The two widows living in the cramped home had been working for local civil organisations but left after not being paid. They are now looking for work as servants.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - The jury in the trial of Paul Manafort would have convicted the former Trump campaign chairman on all 18 criminal charges if not for one juror who had questions about the reasonable doubt standard of guilt, a juror told Fox News on Wednesday. “There was one holdout,” the juror in the trial, Paula Duncan, said in an interview.  “We all tried to convince her to look at the paper trail. We laid it out in front of her again and again and she still said that she had a reasonable doubt.” The jury on Tuesday found Manafort guilty on two counts of bank fraud, five counts of tax fraud and one charge of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts, giving Special Counsel Robert Mueller a victory in the first trial arising from his investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election. But the jury of six men and six women could not reach a consensus on 10 other counts. Judge T.S. Ellis, who oversaw the three-week trial in a U.S. federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, declared a mistrial on those 10 counts. In the first public comments by a juror in the case, Duncan said that 11 members of the jury were in agreement that Manafort was guilty on all 18 felony charges but that they could not get the one holdout to change her mind after nearly four days of deliberations. “We didn’t want it to be hung so we tried for an extended period of time to convince her. But in the end she held out and that’s why we have 10 counts that did not get a verdict,” she said. Duncan said she was speaking out to inform the public and that she was not concerned about her safety. Ellis said that he had received threats and he has not released juror names, citing worries about their safety. “I thought that the public, America, needed to know how close this was and the evidence was overwhelming,” she said.  Duncan said she was a Trump supporter and wanted to believe that Manafort was innocent. She noted that even his critics had described him as a brilliant political consultant and that Trump had trusted him with overseeing his campaign. “I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty. But he was and no one is above the law.” Duncan said some of the jurors had a problem accepting the testimony of Rick Gates, Manafort’s former right-hand man, because he was testifying as part of a plea deal and “would have done anything that he could to preserve himself.” She said the jury decided to not consider Gates’ testimony and focus instead on the documentary evidence. Duncan had tough words for attorneys on both sides.  She said the prosecution looked bored at times and that she saw two of them napping. Manafort’s lawyers, on the other hand, gave short cross-examinations, rarely objected and gave off an “easy going” vibe, she said. “I think I expected a little more,” Duncan said. Duncan said the deliberations were heated at times, leading some jurors to tears at one point, but that politics did not influence their decision-making. “I think we all went in there like we were supposed to and assumed that Mr Manafort was innocent. We did due diligence, we applied the evidence, our notes, the witnesses and we came out with guilty verdicts on the eight counts,” she said. reporting by Nathan Layne .in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Robert Birsel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-manafort-juror/manafort-juror-says-one-holdout-kept-jury-from-convicting-on-all-counts-idUKKCN1L80A4,2019-02-08,"The jury in the trial of Paul Manafort would have convicted the former Trump campaign chairman on all 18 criminal charges if not for one juror who had questions about the reasonable doubt standard of guilt, a juror told Fox News on Wednesday.",Manafort juror says 'one holdout' kept jury from convicting on all counts
2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he found out only after the fact about payments his then-lawyer Michael Cohen made to silence two women who said they had had affairs with Trump, adding that the money came from him and not his campaign. “Later on I knew,” Trump told Fox News Channel when asked if he knew about the payments. “And they’re weren’t taken out of campaign finance ... They didn’t come out of the campaign; they came from me.” Cohen, in pleading guilty to eight criminal charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations, told a federal court on Tuesday that Trump directed him to arrange the payments to influence the 2016 presidential election - a claim at odds with Trump’s statement.  “My first question, when I heard about it, was, ‘Did they come out of the campaign,’ because that could be a little dicey,” Trump said in the interview with Fox, which is set to air in its entirety on Wednesday. “And they didn’t come out of the campaign, and that’s big.” “It’s not even a campaign violation,” he said, repeating a claim he made earlier in the day on Twitter without evidence, even though both Cohen and prosecutors have agreed it was.

2019-02-08,"ZURICH (Reuters) - One of Switzerland’s largest banks, Credit Suisse, has frozen roughly 5 billion Swiss francs ($5 billion) of money linked to Russia to avoid falling foul of U.S. sanctions, according to its accounts, further increasing pressure on Moscow.  The move by Credit Suisse, which owned aircraft surrendered by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska and had lent money to Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg before the sanctions, underscores a widespread fear among banks of reprisals from Washington for working with targeted Russian individuals and entities. For Russia’s elite, such steps could close off an important avenue for finance as well as a safe haven for billions of rubles of their wealth. “Credit Suisse works with international regulators wherever it does business to ensure compliance with sanctions, including compliance with sanctions involving Russia,” said a spokeswoman for the bank, which did not identify the owners of the money. Long popular with wealthy Russians for its combination of bank secrecy, political stability and glitzy ski resorts such as Zermatt and St. Moritz, Switzerland has become one of the most important destinations for money leaving Russia. Roughly $6.2 billion, or 14 percent of total Russian cross-border outflows, went to Switzerland in 2017 — almost three times as much as went to the United States, according to Russian central bank data. The latest round of sanctions was announced in April by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to penalize Russia for its annexation of Crimea, involvement in the war in Syria and “attempting to subvert Western democracies”. More could follow. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would like better ties with Moscow, but although he met Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, relations between the countries remain strained. Earlier this month, members of Congress, where both chambers are controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, called for more action, including introducing new sanctions legislation “from hell”, to punish the Russian “menace”. While U.S. sanctions do not apply to neutral Switzerland, its banks are obliged to follow suit because they depend on access to the dollar and could be blackballed by the United States for any missteps. The Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) asset freeze took place in the second quarter. It is rare for a Swiss bank to reveal such details. Two of its rivals, UBS (UBSG.S) and Julius Baer (BAER.S), said they also respected international sanctions, but declined to say whether they had taken similar steps. “UBS ... implements worldwide at least the sanctions currently imposed by Switzerland, the U.N., the EU and the U.S.,” said a spokesman for UBS. A spokesman for Julius Baer said it “cooperates with international regulators ... in the field of sanction regulations”. Credit Suisse is being cautious in part because of earlier bad experiences. In 2009, it reached a $500 million settlement with U.S. authorities over dealings with sanctions-hit Iran. There have been other instances where European banks have been punished. In 2014, France’s BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) agreed to pay a record $8.9 billion for violating U.S. sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran. Switzerland’s banking watchdog FINMA does not require Swiss banks to enforce foreign sanctions, but has said they have a responsibility to minimize legal and reputational risks.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON/CHARLESTON, W.Va. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump suffered twin setbacks on Tuesday with two ex-advisers facing prison sentences - and one of them saying Trump told him to commit a crime - possibly hurting his Republican Party’s election prospects and widening a criminal probe that has overshadowed his presidency. Within minutes of each other in separate courts, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on tax and bank fraud charges, while Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to a range of charges. Cohen also testified that Trump directed him to commit a crime by arranging payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence two women who said they had affairs with Trump. The president has denied having affairs with the women. His lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said the payments were made to spare Trump and his family embarrassment and were unrelated to the campaign. The setbacks on Tuesday refocused attention on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow and whether Trump obstructed justice by firing then-FBI Director James Comey, who was formerly in charge of the investigation. Moscow has said it did not interfere in the 2016 election and Trump has denied collusion, calling Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt.” Of the two latest developments, Cohen’s plea deal was the more troublesome, said those around Trump.  “A bad day for the home team,” said one source close to the president, who asked not to be identified.  The source added that the legal woes could depress voter turnout and increase Republicans’ risk of losing their 23-seat majority in the House of Representatives in November’s congressional elections. “This hurts our midterm prospects.” A Democratic victory in November would limit Trump’s ability to push through legislation and increase the risk of calls for his impeachment. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, said late on Tuesday that his client was “more than happy” to tell Mueller’s legal team everything he knows about Trump. Democrats pounced on the Cohen and Manafort cases, saying they bolstered their argument that the Trump White House was weighed down by scandal.  “The American people deserve answers regarding the president’s role in these corrupt and criminal actions,” said Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro. Rodell Mollineau, a senior Democratic strategist, said the news “adds to a constant drumbeat that will ultimately affect some independent voters” and help Democrats at the polls. “Manafort being convicted, on its own, might not sway any votes. But given the totality of criminality uncovered ... it will be hard for some Republicans to ignore and even harder to explain.” Still, there were no immediate calls for Trump’s impeachment and Republican lawmakers did not join the chorus of criticism from Democratic ranks. The long-term impact of the Cohen and Manafort cases will likely depend on how they affect the turnout of Republican and Democratic voters in November. While he undoubtedly had a bad day on Tuesday, some analysts said Trump might be able to turn the setbacks to his advantage by reinforcing core supporters’ views that he is under siege, said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. “In midterm elections, the president’s party tends to be less interested and less motivated to vote. But one thing that will motivate people to get out and vote is if they believe the party is being attacked unfairly,” he said. At a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Tuesday night, a relatively subdued Trump did not mention either the Cohen or Manafort case. Instead, as supporters cheered him on, he made fun of his opponents’ focus on the Mueller investigation, saying they were desperate to find collusion with Russians.  “Where is the collusion? Where is it?” he said, mimicking his critics. Josh McGrew, who travelled from Huntington, West Virginia, for the rally, called the investigation a “smear campaign” and said his support for Trump was unshaken. “This is all about finding out anything they can in somebody’s past,” McGrew said. “They haven’t come up with anything in a year and a half, almost two years.” Polling by Ipsos/Reuters has shown Trump’s job approval rating holding steady at about 40 percent, even with Mueller’s investigation already bringing guilty pleas by several former Trump advisers. The Cohen and Manafort cases were unlikely to erode Trump’s support from his political base or the Republican Party establishment, said Larry Sabato, a political analyst and director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “I don’t think there is any change at all,” said Sabato. “That’s the amazing part of it. The Trump base and virtually the entire Republican Party could care less. The polls will bear me out.” Reporting by Steve Holland and James Oliphant; Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia-analysis/jolted-by-ex-allies-criminal-cases-trump-faces-election-and-legal-risks-idUKKCN1L7077,2019-02-08,,"Jolted by ex-allies' criminal cases, Trump faces election and legal risks"
2019-02-08,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Industrial gases giants Linde LIN1.DE and Praxair PX.N are in talks to try to salvage their $83 billion merger after U.S. competition regulators demanded they sell assets that generate more than $4.3 billion in sales. Linde said on Wednesday the divestments were expected to reach a level that would allow either party to abandon the deal, although the German company added that talks continued with both Praxair and regulators. Analysts said they still expected the deal to go ahead, though they cautioned the asset sales could make the deal less attractive and/or make synergy targets harder to achieve.  Linde and U.S.-based Praxair agreed an all-share merger in principle in December 2016, aiming to create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France’s Air Liquide (AIRP.PA), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas. The companies agreed that if antitrust regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in sales, or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty. Linde said on Wednesday it expected the revenue threshold for divestment commitments to be exceeded, but didn’t say by how much and did not mention the EBITDA hurdle. It had previously warned this was very likely to happen. “Linde and Praxair remain in constructive dialogue with each other and the regulators on how to satisfy their requirements,” Linde said. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asked for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and also said it wanted prospective buyers of these assets to meet certain other requirements. Bids for major U.S. firms have had mixed fortunes recently. U.S. President Donald Trump in March blocked Singapore-based microchip maker Broadcom’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion takeover proposal for Qualcomm (QCOM.O) on national security grounds.    The $63 billion takeover of seeds maker Monsanto by Germany’s Bayer (BAYGn.DE), meanwhile, went through after 7.6 billion euros worth of disposals.   A source familiar with Linde’s thinking said both companies were doing everything they could to see the deal through, but they could not lose track of the targeted $1.2 billion in annual synergies without perhaps putting shareholders’ support at risk. Commerzbank analyst Michael Schaefer said he expected Linde and Praxair to seek to address the FTC’s demands. “The fact that they remain in constructive talks signals to us that there is still readiness on both sides to stay the course”, he said. Linde shares were down 1.3 percent at 0915 GMT, paring initial losses of 2.3 percent. The German group last month lined up a consortium of gases firm Messer and investor CVC as a buyer of North and South American assets to allay antitrust concerns, while Praxair’s European gases business will be sold to Japanese rival Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (4091.T). The source said U.S. regulators had some qualms about the proposed buyer of the former block of assets, which Linde has been trying to address. While the European Commission gave its go-ahead this week, regulators in the United States, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and Chile have yet to decide. Arne Rautenberg, a fund manager at Frankfurt-based Union Investment, this week said he expected the deal to be salvaged, but added Linde might have to shed its high-margin on-site business in the United States, an operator of gas production facilities near petrochemical and steel plants, which would be a “huge blow”. The regulatory challenge is a setback for Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who has been a driving force for the deal and had to reshuffle management following the departure of the company’s chief executive and finance chief. The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules. The time pressure would put Linde and Praxair in a weak position when negotiating a price with prospective buyers of the assets, analysts have said.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Britain and Japan cancelled a plan for a simulated amphibious beach assault near Mount Fuji this week that would have been the first joint drill between their troops in Japan, officials said on Wednesday, as a typhoon approached the Japanese mainland. Typhoon Cimaron, which is heading north from the western Pacific, is expected to bring strong winds and rain to Japan over the next few days. Britain and Japan had planned for a Royal Marine detachment and Japanese amphibious troops to storm the beach from boats launched from the British Navy’s flagship amphibious assault carrier HMS Albion on Friday. The cancellation was announced by Britain’s embassy in Japan and the Ministry of Defence in Tokyo. The Albion has operated in and around Japanese waters for several weeks, including patrols to help enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea, as Britain seeks to bolster defence ties with Japan as it prepares to exit the European Union. London is eager for a presence in a region that is driving global economic growth, while Tokyo wants to nurture defence ties beyond its traditional ally, the United States, as it contends with China’s growing military. A Japanese destroyer and helicopters had also been assigned to the exercise in addition to the participation of Japan’s first marine unit since World War Two, the Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade. Activated in April, the 1,500-strong force backed up by helicopter carriers, amphibious ships, Osprey tilt-rotor troop carriers and amphibious assault vehicles was formed to counter any threats against islands along the edge of the East China Sea that Tokyo worries could be vulnerable to attack by China. However, its existence is controversial because critics warn amphibious units could theoretically be used against Japan’s neighbours in breach of a post-World War Two constitution that renounces the right to wage war.

2019-02-08,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Turkey could end its lira-battering crisis with the United States “instantly” by freeing a detained American pastor, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser said, adding that a Qatari cash infusion would not help Ankara’s economy.  The Turkish currency has been in freefall since Washington ordered tariffs in retaliation for the detention of Pastor Andrew Brunson on charges of complicity in a failed 2016 coup.  Brunson denies wrongdoing, and Ankara has in the past suggested his fate could be linked to that of a U.S.-based Turkish cleric whom President Tayyip Erdogan accuses of orchestrating the attempted putsch. “Look, the Turkish government made a big mistake in not releasing Pastor Brunson,” Bolton told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Israel.  “Every day that goes by that mistake continues, this crisis could be over instantly if they did the right thing as a NATO ally, part of the West, and release pastor Brunson without condition.” Asked if the United States questioned Turkey’s membership in NATO given the stand-off, Bolton said: “That’s not an issue at the moment. We’re focussed on Pastor Brunson and the other Americans that the Turkish government’s holding illegitimately and we expect that to get resolved.” Qatar’s Emir this month approved a package of economic projects, including a $15 billion pledge of support, for Turkey, giving a boost to a lira that has lost some 37 percent of its value this year. Bolton was sceptical about the intervention by the Gulf state, which has been feuding with U.S. allies in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. “Well, I think what they pledged is utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkey’s economy. It’s certainly not helpful but we’ll actually see what develops from their pledge,” he said.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified on Tuesday that Trump had directed him to commit a crime by arranging payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence two women who said they had affairs with Trump. Cohen’s voice cracked several times as he pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges in federal court in Manhattan, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Facing up to five years in prison, the admissions were a dramatic change from Cohen’s earlier boasts that he was Trump’s “fixer” and would “take a bullet” for the president.      Most legal experts say a sitting president cannot be indicted for a crime, but the Constitution allows Congress to impeach and remove a president from office for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”   Cohen’s accusation increases political pressure for Trump ahead of November’s congressional elections where Democrats are trying to regain control of the House of Representatives and Senate.  Cohen told Judge William Pauley III that “in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office” he arranged payments to two women for their silence “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.” Adult-film star Stormy Daniels was given $130,000 and former Playboy model Karen McDougal was paid $150,000. Cohen did not name Trump in court, but his lawyer, Lanny Davis, said afterward that he was referring to the president. “Today he (Cohen) stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” Davis said in a statement. “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?” Davis said. Trump has denied having affairs with the women. His lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said the payments were made to spare Trump and his family embarrassment and were unrelated to the campaign.     Trump did not mention Cohen at a rally in West Virginia hours later. Giuliani lashed out at Cohen on Tuesday, calling him a “devious little rat” and saying he had a history of lying. “I think the president is absolutely in the clear,” Giuliani told Reuters. “The Cohen thing is over.”     Under U.S. election law, campaign contributions, defined as things of value given to a campaign to influence an election, must be disclosed. A payment intended to silence allegations of an affair just before an election could constitute a campaign contribution, which is limited to $2,700 per person per election, some experts said.      Ross Garber, a lawyer who has represented four Republican governors in impeachment proceedings, said Cohen’s statement “dramatically increases the likelihood that, were Democrats to take control of the House in the midterms, they would begin an impeachment investigation.” “The odds of an investigation have definitely gone up,” Garber said. The guilty pleas came in the same hour that a federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of eight charges of tax and bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.  The Manafort conviction resulted from U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. The charges against Manafort mostly predate his work on Trump’s campaign. The probe also led to a referral from Mueller about Cohen to federal prosecutors in New York who began their own probe of the longtime Trump lawyer. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion and has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.” Russia has denied meddling in the election, although U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow interfered. Mueller has also brought indictments against 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.      Cohen is scheduled for sentencing on Dec. 12 and his bail was set at $500,000. Davis told CNN he believed his client had information that would be of interest to the special counsel, but did not give further details.     Mueller’s investigation, which began in May 2017, has resulted in the indictment of more than 30 people and five guilty pleas.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday it would boost its military might and also showcased a new fighter jet amid increased tensions with the United States and with regional rivals over conflicts in the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic Republic’s military prowess was what deterred Washington from attacking it, adding that under President Donald Trump the United States was becoming isolated even from its own allies. “We should make ourselves ready to fight against the military powers who want to take over our territory and our resources,” Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television ahead of Wednesday’s National Defence Industry Day. “Why does the United States not attack us? Because of our power, because it knows the consequences,” Rouhani added. Last week, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also said the United States would avoid any military confrontation with Tehran because of Iranian military might. Khamenei has rejected Trump’s offer of unconditional talks on a new nuclear deal, prompting Trump to tell Reuters in an interview on Monday: “If they want to meet, that’s fine, and if they don’t want to meet, I couldn’t care less.” Relations between Washington and Tehran worsened further after Trump in May took the United States out of an international deal that curbed Tehran’s nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions. Trump branded that 2015 deal as flawed because it did not address Iran’s missile programme or involvement in conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and he has reimposed U.S. economic sanctions. Rouhani compared the sanctions on Iran with the U.S. trade war with China and its new tariffs on some imports from Turkey and European countries.  “It’s not only us who do not trust America. Today even Europe and China do not trust them; even American allies like Canada have lost their trust,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday Rouhani attended a ceremony, broadcast by state TV, that included the fly-past of a new fighter jet called Kowsar, which Iran says is “100-percent indigenously made” and able to carry various weapons and to be used for short aerial support missions.   However, some military experts believe the fighter jet is a carbon copy of an F-5 first produced in the United States in the 1960s.  “The airframe appears to be an externally unaltered, two-seat F-5 tiger. Whilst it may be domestically manufactured, it’s an entirely foreign airframe,” said Justin Bronk, a research fellow specialising in combat airpower and technology in the Military Sciences team at the Royal United Services Institute. “It’s a very small lightweight fighter with very small engines which limits the thrust output, a very low internal fuel capacity which limits range, and a very small nose which limits the size and power of radar that you can fit,” he told Reuters. “All of those constraints are not going to be changed by updating the internal components. While you might put a modern radar, or modern avionics - by Iranian standards - in there, it is still going to be subject to all limitations of the F-5 airframe.” Iran’s air force has been limited to perhaps a few dozen strike aircraft using either Russian or ageing U.S. models acquired before the 1979 Iranian revolution. Iran has sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to help prop up President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, but had to rely on Russia for aerial support due to its own lack of a powerful air force. The Islamic Republic launched in 2013 what it said was a new, domestically built fighter jet, called Qaher 313, but some experts expressed doubts about the viability of the aircraft at the time.

2019-02-08,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc has hired a chief financial officer, the ride-services company said on Tuesday, filling a long-standing vacancy and clearing the way for a much-anticipated initial public offering next year. Uber said it had hired Nelson Chai, a financial services veteran with deep connections to the banks and deal-makers Uber must impress ahead of what is expected to be a large, complicated IPO. Uber lost more than $1 billion per quarter in three of the last six quarters. Still, it hopes its growth potential will attract investors. Uber must meet its self-imposed deadline of an IPO next year or a shareholder provision that would lift transfer restrictions on shares could create a chaotic market of buying and selling Uber stock. The CFO position has been empty since 2015, when Brent Callinicos departed. Previous Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick had shown little interest in hiring a replacement, but the search stepped up last year under new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.  Uber’s most senior finance executive, Prabir Adarkar, left last month to become CFO at meal-delivery service DoorDash, further depleting the department. Uber’s lack of a CFO, and the protracted search for one, had worried investors. Operating without such a senior manager is rare for a company the size of Uber, whose net revenue, after payment for drivers, promotions and refunds, was $2.8 billion in the second quarter this year. A CFO is also vital for conducting an initial public offering. “I know people at the major investment banks,” Chai, 53,  said in an interview. “After the announcement (from Uber) goes out I expect to become a lot more popular with people from my past.” Chai has had stints at Merrill Lynch, where he worked as CFO through the financial crisis, and Bank of America (BAC.N) after it bought Merrill Lynch in 2008. He was also president of commercial lending bank CIT Group (CIT.N). Previously, he worked as CFO at Archipelago Holdings and helped take that electronic stock exchange public in 2004. It was later bought by the New York Stock Exchange, where Chai worked as CFO until 2007. Most recently, he was president and CEO of insurance provider The Warranty Group, placed there by private equity firm TPG to improve the company’s performance. His relationship with TPG, an Uber investor and board member, and especially John Thain, another Uber board member who ran CIT Group, Merrill Lynch and the New York Stock Exchange, led him to Uber. Chai said had breakfast with Khosrowshahi in June, his introduction to the job and the man he would work for. “He will be a great partner for me and the entire management team as we move toward becoming a public company,” Khosrowshahi said. Uber chose Chai after making an offer to VMware (VMW.N) CFO Zane Rowe this past spring. Rowe turned it down under pressure from his board, according to people familiar with the matter. Chai acknowledged Uber must work to convince public market investors it can keep growing and that it has a path to profitability after losing more than $4 billion last year. Revenue for the second quarter was up 8 percent over the first quarter and more than 60 percent from last year. Potential investors will challenge him to explain the sphere of business at Uber, which has oscillated between investing and divesting in products, strategies and geographies. This year Uber sold its Russia and Southeast Asia businesses, while pledging to invest heavily in India. It scrapped its autonomous trucking effort while doubling down on its freight-hauling business. It bought an electric bikes company and is eyeing a scooter service, but retrenched from its self-driving car ambitions. “The bigger part is going to be talking through some of the strategy choices the company has made to invest in and shareholder return,” Chai said. Uber had a number of executive vacancies to fill since Kalanick departed, and not all have gone smoothly. Chief Operating Officer Barney Harford, picked by Khosrowshahi, has been accused of making racially insensitive comments, prompting an internal probe. Chai is based in New York City, and said he is currently looking for an apartment in San Francisco and starts the job next month.

2019-02-08,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi said on Tuesday her relationship with the military - which held her under house arrest for nearly 15 years - was “not that bad” and that the generals in her cabinet were “rather sweet”.  However, Suu Kyi, who has been criticised for failing to speak out against an army crackdown in Rakhine State that the United Nations has called “ethnic cleansing”, said she hoped constitutional change would eventually curb the military’s influence. “Our relationship with the army is not that bad,” the Nobel peace prize laureate and the face of Myanmar’s democratic awakening, said at an event in Singapore in response to a question about whether she feared another military coup.   “Don’t forget that we have three members of the cabinet who are in fact military men, generals, and they’re all rather sweet.” The military ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years after seizing power in a 1962 coup. The generals have initiated reforms, beginning in late 2010 with Suu Kyi’s release from house arrest, and they have largely stepped back from the day-to-day running of the country, handing over to Suu Kyi’s government after her party swept a 2015 election. But the military retains considerable powers under a 2008 constitution and Suu Kyi, barred under that constitution from becoming president, said the transition to democracy was “still incomplete”. Suu Kyi did not mention by name the Rohingya Muslims, more than 700,000 of whom have fled from the north of Rakhine State into Bangladesh since an army crackdown that began a year ago after attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents. The Aug. 25 attacks were launched by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which Myanmar says is a terrorist group, and Suu Kyi said terrorism remained a threat, which could have “grave consequences” for the wider region. “The danger of terrorist activities, which was the initial cause of events leading to the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine remains real and present today,” she said. “Unless this security challenge is addressed the risk of inter-communal violence will remain. It is a threat that could have grave consequences, not just for Myanmar but also for other countries in our region and beyond.” Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and dismissed most accounts from refugees of atrocities, instead blaming Rohingya “terrorists”. Buddhist-majority Myanmar and Bangladesh reached an agreement late last year on the repatriation of Rohingya, most of whom are stateless and subjected to restrictions in Myanmar. Suu Kyi said spaces have been mapped out for the resettlement of people who fled. She also stressed the difficulties that other small ethnic and religious groups living in Rakhine State face. “There are not just the Muslims in Rakhine, like most people think. There’s Hindus there, there are ... small ethnic groups and I would like you to take interest in these small ethnic groups because some of them are disappearing very quickly,” she said. “They live in their own traditional ways, they’re very peaceful ... we must do everything we can to help them to preserve their culture, their traditions and to help them prosper.” On plans for Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar, she said it was difficult to set a time frame, suggesting the onus was on Bangladesh to get the process started. “The returnees have to be sent back by Bangladesh. We can only welcome them at the border,” she said. “I think Bangladesh would also have to decide how quickly it wants the process to be completed.” The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine State, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar’s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said it would formally apologise to 18 members of the “Windrush generation” who were forced to leave or detained because they were not issued with documents when they came to the country from the Caribbean after World War Two. The scandal damaged the authority of Prime Minister Theresa May, who had led efforts to tackle illegal immigration when she led the Home Office, and resulted in the resignation of her Home Secretary Amber Rudd. May said earlier this year that the treatment of thousands of migrants who were invited to fill labour shortages in post-war Britain on ships such as the Empire Windrush had been “appalling”. The government said 18 people had been identified in a review of removals and detentions affecting Caribbean nationals, of whom 11 went on voluntarily to leave Britain and seven were detained but subsequently released without being removed. Fourteen of the 18 had been contacted and would be given the option to return, it said. They would also be guided to a compensation scheme. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the experiences faced by some members of the Windrush generation were completely unacceptable. “I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve,” he said on Tuesday. “We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again – which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush.” The government also said 74 people were either detained or removed because they had lost their entitlement to stay in Britain after leaving for more than two years, and a further 72 people were detained temporarily at port but allowed to enter. A task-force set up after the scandal had helped 2,272 people to get the documentation they needed to prove their existing right to be in the UK, the government said.  A further 1,465 people had been granted citizenship or documentation to prove their status under a formal Windrush Scheme.

2019-02-08,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan forces killed four out of nine insurgents who launched mortar attacks on Tuesday on areas around the presidential palace and diplomatic district of Kabul, two officials said. They attacked just as President Ashraf Ghani was delivering a speech marking the beginning of Eid al-Adha, a three-day religious festival. President Ghani acknowledged the explosions that were heard during his speech and described the perpetrators as enemies of Afghanistan, Islam and peace. An official at the NATO-led Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan said nine insurgents had fired about 30 mortar rounds from two separate locations in Kabul. Afghan police cordoned off the two locations and military helicopters destroyed the two firing positions used by the insurgents. “In total four of the nine insurgents were killed. The other five insurgents surrendered to Afghan forces,” U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Martin O’Donnell said in a statement. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack that came two days after Ghani offered the Taliban a three-month ceasefire. Ghani said security forces would observe the truce beginning this week - but only if the militants reciprocated. The ceasefire offer was welcomed by the United States and NATO but two Taliban commanders said their leader had rejected it and vowed to continue their war against Afghan and international forces.  Tuesday’s attacks dampened the festive spirit and large parts of the city were blocked by police vehicles, forcing people to stay at home. Embassies, offices and residential areas used by diplomats, international aid workers, and other foreigners were put on lockdown. The Taliban have launched a wave of attacks in recent weeks, including on the city of Ghazni, southwest of Kabul. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting. On Monday Taliban fighters kidnapped about 200 bus passengers in northern Afghanistan and released more than 160 civilians but kept at least 20 soldiers and policemen as captives, an official said on Tuesday. Nearly 200 passengers were taken hostage by Taliban insurgents near the northern province of Kunduz on Monday as they travelled to the capital, Kabul. “More than 160 civilians have reached home safely but at least 20 soldiers and policemen have been taken to an undisclosed location by the Taliban,” said Ghulam Rabani Rabani, a provincial council member in Kunduz. Two Taliban commanders confirmed the release. One said the insurgents had no intention of harming the civilians, who were travelling during the Eid al-Adha holiday, but they would hold the police and soldiers. “We wanted to convey a powerful message to the government that we can launch many attacks and defeat them at every level,” said one of the commanders, who declined to be identified.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hopes that the United States and China might find a compromise to resolve their trade dispute lifted European shares on Monday, while Turkey’s currency crisis showed no immediate sign of worsening.     The pan-European STOXX 600  was up 0.6 percent at the close, with all major markets across the continent also finishing in positive territory. “The prospect that any possible escalation may well be some way away has prompted some investors to tentatively step back into the market,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said in a note to clients. Amid the “risk-on” environment, basic materials and miners .SXPP were among the best-performing sectors, up 0.9 percent.  Among stocks that fared best were ArcelorMittal (MT.AS), up 2.5 percent at the top of Paris’ CAC 40 index, and London-listed Evraz (EVRE.L), up 2.8 percent.  Italian infrastructure group Atlantia (ATL.MI) fell 4.7 percent as speculation continued over whether the government would revoke toll highway concessions held by its Autostrade per l’Italia business after last week’s collapse of a Genoa bridge that it operated. British software group Sage (SGE.L) dropped 7 percent after a rating downgrade by Deutsche Bank. “The competitive situation in Sage’s core mid-market franchise appears to be worsening,” the German bank’s analysts wrote, adding that “higher-end competitors also appear to be gradually gaining share from Sage’s core user and reseller base”. Shares in British contractor G4S (GFS.L) fell more than 1 percent after the British government took over the running of a prison after an inspection found it had fallen into a “state of crisis”. Among smaller companies, handbag maker Mulberry (MUL.L) sank nearly 30 percent to its lowest in nearly eight years after a trading update in which it warned of “materially reduced” profit if current UK sales trends continue into the second half. The results could be seen as a bad omen for retail and luxury peers in Britain.  “This is really a sign of how it’s not just the retailers that are affected by the decline on the high street, but also some of the key brands that depend on department store concessions and the visible presence they offer to consumers,” wrote Neil Wilson, an analyst for Markets.com.

2019-02-08," (The Aug. 19 story was refiled to correct the translation of Khan’s quote in paragraph 20 to clarify he was referring to a struggle, not holy war) By Saad  Sayeed and Drazen Jorgic ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan’s new Prime Minister Imran Khan called on Sunday for the rich to start paying taxes and said the country will begin an austerity drive to reduce debt, a campaign he will kick-start by selling his office’s fleet of bullet-proof cars. In his first address to the nation as premier, Khan set out his vision for a “New Pakistan” and spoke at length about the need to reshape the country by introducing an Islamic welfare system, reducing poverty and slashing high debt levels.  “We have formed a bad habit of living on loans and aid from other countries,” said Khan, speaking under a portrait of his hero and Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah “No country can prosper like this. A country must stand on its own feet.”    Khan, 65, a former cricket legend, was sworn in as prime minister on Saturday after his party swept to power in last month’s election. A firebrand populist, Khan’s appeal has soared in recent years on the back of his anti-corruption drive, which has resonated with young voters and the expanding middle class in the mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people. But Khan has inherited a host of problems at home and abroad, including a brewing currency crisis and fraying relations with Pakistan’s historic ally, the United States. Khan did not shed any light on policy plans to deal with the currency woes that analysts expect will force Pakistan to seek another International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. Instead, Khan focussed on debt and said former central bank governor Ishrat Husain would lead a task-force to drive austerity. Criticizing what he called the colonial-era mindset and lavish lifestyles of Pakistan’s ruling elite, Khan announced he would live in a small three-bedroom house instead of the palatial prime minister’s residence. Khan plans to have only two servants instead of 524 reserved for a sitting premier. He also announced plans to sell a fleet of bullet-proof vehicles to help Treasury shortfalls, a bold move in a country where Islamist militants still pose a threat. “I want to tell my people, I will live a simple life, I will save your money,” he said. Khan appealed to overseas Pakistanis to invest in the country and urged the wealthy to start paying taxes, a perennial problem in a nation famous for tax dodging and where less than 1 percent of the population files income tax.  “It is your responsibility to pay taxes,” said Khan. “Think of this as a struggle, that you need to pay tax for the betterment of your country.”    Khan said Pakistan was in grave danger from the effects of climate change and promised to reduce some of the world’s highest maternal death rates and infant mortality rates.  He also spoke passionately about the need to help 22.8 million out-of-school Pakistani children in a nation where the literacy rate hovers above 40 percent.  Khan, who has never held a government position, named his 21-person cabinet over the weekend, opting mostly for experienced politicians.  Opponents criticised the choices, saying about half of the cabinet had served under the former military dictator Pervez Musharraf and were part of the old guard. On Sunday, Khan announced he will oversee the interior ministry. A former playboy of the London social scene who has since adopted a pious persona, Khan said he wants Pakistan to build a welfare state akin to some found in the West, which he said are modelled on the ideas first voiced by Prophet Mohammad in the holy city of Medina. “I will spend money on those who God has not given enough to,” he said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Strong mining stocks helped boost Britain’s FTSE 100 on Monday, leaving last week’s four-month lows behind as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks and Turkey buoyed markets, while luxury handbag maker Mulberry sank after results. The FTSE 100 .FTSE ended the session up 0.4 percent, tracking gains across European bourses, as investors awaited developments on U.S.-China trade talks later this month. Investors were more confident that Europe would remain relatively insulated from an economic crisis in Turkey, even as the lira slid back above 6 to the dollar and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after rating downgrades from Moody’s and S&P Global on Friday.  “Should one extrapolate the recent EM contagion risk? We don’t believe so,” said JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka. “Turkish impact is small - less than 1 percent of euro exports/GDP ratio and banks’ exposure at 6 percent of capital.” BHP Billiton BLT.L, Glencore (GLEN.L), Rio Tinto (RIO.L), Anglo American (AAL.L), and Antofagasta (ANTO.L) climbed 0.2 to 1.3 percent as copper prices rose on hopes of progress in a trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The stand-out faller across UK markets was Mulberry (MUL.L) whose shares plunged nearly 30 percent after the luxury handbag maker said it would take a 3-million-pound ($3.83 million) hit from the administration of House of Fraser earlier this month. Mulberry operates 21 concessions in the department stores group.  The company also said that if current UK sales trends continued into the second half, the group’s profit for the whole year would be “materially reduced”. “House of Fraser is the symptom rather than the cause, but its failure is just making the pressure on these brands tougher,” said Neil Wilson, analyst at markets.com. Sage (SGE.L) shares fell 7 percent, the worst-performing on the index after Deutsche Bank downgraded the software firm to “sell” from “hold”.  “The competitive situation in Sage’s core mid-market franchise appears to be worsening,” DB analysts said in a note, citing conversations with accountants, resellers, and rival companies.  Among mid-caps, shares in security contractor G4S (GFS.L) fell 3 percent at the open after the government took over the running of a major prison in Birmingham following an inspection which found it was in a state of crisis. The stock recovered swiftly, though, and ended 1.2 percent lower. The inspection by the Ministry of Justice found that staff locked themselves in offices to avoid prisoners who were using drugs and violence with near impunity.  “While such headlines are unhelpful, they have limited implications for our positive investment thesis,” Stifel analysts said in a note.  Overall British companies’ results have driven sharp share price moves this quarter, and analysts were downgrading their earnings estimates as the results season drew to a close.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Chartered (STAN.L) will likely have to wait until the autumn at the earliest for approval from German and European banking regulators to turn its Frankfurt branch into its European Union subsidiary, a spokeswoman for the bank said on Monday. Standard Chartered may also have to move “a few” more jobs than originally envisaged to Frankfurt, the spokeswoman said, as the bank seeks to satisfy the European Central Bank and German authorities about its plans for the hub to conduct its business in Europe after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019. The bank began interviewing candidates in March this year for about 20 jobs it is moving to Frankfurt, Reuters reported on March 7, after it submitted its license application to German and European authorities in November 2017. Nine months later StanChart is still waiting for approval, a sign of how European regulators are pushing banks to transfer more staff and submit more detailed plans for their European hubs to avoid them becoming little more than empty shells. Standard Chartered was among the first of about 20 banks to formally apply for licenses to open bases or expand existing ones in the euro zone by March 2019. The delay in the finalization of the move comes amid deepening scrutiny by the main European banking regulator to ensure lenders have a long-term plan to staff and structure their post-Brexit hubs. The ECB, which supervises the main lenders in the euro zone and is a central player in setting conditions for the new bases, said last month it will prevent banks from creating token offices. Banks will be particularly scrutinized as to whether work that is outsourced from European hubs to countries outside Europe still complies with local regulations within the trading bloc. Standard Chartered has to that end created a dedicated “outsourcing oversight officer” role in Frankfurt, the spokeswoman said, whose duties will be to ensure that such overseas business activities are compliant with German and European rules.

Since the debt crisis exploded in early 2010, four successive Greek governments have struggled to stave off bankruptcy, relying on the biggest bailout in economic history, more than 260 billion euros (£233.2 billion) lent by Greece’s euro zone partners and the IMF. “The extensive reforms Greece has carried out have laid the ground for a sustainable recovery: this must be nurtured and maintained to enable the Greek people to reap the benefits of their efforts and sacrifices,” Moscovici said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"KOROR, Palau (Reuters) - Empty hotel rooms, idle tour boats and shuttered travel agencies reveal widening fissures in the tiny Pacific nation of Palau, which is caught in an escalating diplomatic tug-of-war between China and Taiwan. Late last year, China effectively banned tour groups to the idyllic tropical archipelago, branding it an illegal destination due to its lack of diplomatic status. As China extends its influence across the Pacific, Palau is one of Taipei’s 18 remaining allies worldwide and is under pressure to switch allegiances, officials and business people there say. “There is an ongoing discussion about China weaponising tourism,” said Jeffrey Barabe, owner of Palau Central Hotel and Palau Carolines Resort in Koror. “Some believe that the dollars were allowed to flow in and now they are pulling it back to try and get Palau to establish ties diplomatically.” In the commercial centre of Koror, the Chinese pullback is obvious. Hotel blocks and restaurants stand empty, travel agencies are boarded and boats which take tourists to Palau’s green, mushroom shaped Rock Islands are docked at the piers. Prior to the ban, Chinese tourists accounted for about half the visitors to Palau. Of the 122,000 visitors in 2017, 55,000 were from China and 9,000 from Taiwan, official data showed. Chinese investors had also gone on a buying frenzy, building hotels, opening businesses and securing large swathes of prime coastal real estate. The decline since the ban was announced has been so sharp, charter airline Palau Pacific Airways announced in July it would terminate flights to China, four hours away, from the end of this month.  The Chinese government was “putting an effort to slow or stop tourists going to Palau”, said the Taiwanese-controlled airline, which has experienced a 50 percent fall in bookings since the China restrictions began. China has previously used its tourism clout as a diplomatic tool, last year halting tours to South Korea after Seoul installed a controversial U.S. missile defence system. Asked if designating Palau an illegal destination was a way of putting pressure on it to move away from Taiwan, China’s Foreign Ministry said relations with other countries had to happen under the framework of the “one China” principle. “The one China principle is the pre-condition and political foundation for China to maintain and develop friendly cooperative relations with all countries around the world,” it said in a statement to Reuters, without specifically addressing the Palau issue. The “one China” principle is a core government policy that states Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.  Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says China has lured four countries to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in the past two years by offering generous aid packages and investment. “While Taiwan faces serious diplomatic challenges, the government will not bow down to pressure from Beijing,” the ministry said on its website. “Taiwan will work with friendly nations to uphold regional peace and stability and ensure our rightful place in the international community.”  Palau President Tommy Remengesau Jr. said there had been no official communication from Beijing on the tourism restrictions.  “It is not a secret that China would like us and the diplomatic friends of Taiwan to switch to them, but for Palau it is not our choosing to decide the one China policy,” he told Reuters in an interview in Palau’s second biggest city, Meyuns.   Remengesau, whose second and final term as president ends in January 2021, said Palau welcomed investment and tourism from China but the current administration’s principles and democratic ideals aligned more closely with Taiwan.  Palau was adapting to the China pullback by focusing on higher spending visitors rather than mass tourism, which had taken a toll on the environment, said Remengesau, dressed in a lemon coloured shirt and white shell necklace. One of Palau’s key tourist attractions, the saltwater Jellyfish Lake, was shut in 2017 after large numbers of swimmers were blamed for contributing to plummeting jellyfish numbers. “The reality is that numbers did not mean big revenues for Palau. It actually made us more determined to seek the policy of quality versus quantity,” said Remengesau, who in 2015 declared most of Palau’s territorial waters a marine sanctuary the size of California.  Former Palau government officials say Beijing is trying to cement its influence in the region ahead of the expiry of the  Compact Funding agreements between the United States, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau in 2023 and 2024. The United States provides around $200 million a year on average to the Compact states and is responsible for the defence of the three countries, which each hold a seat at the United Nations. Last December, the U.S. belatedly approved $124 million in assistance for Palau through till 2024, but has not announced any plans to extend the Compact agreements. “The United States and China are not zero-sum competitors,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters. “However, we have concerns about the sustainability of debt loads for countries highly indebted to China, as well as the environmental, social, or labour conditions that often come along with Chinese-financed projects.”  A June Security report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Beijing’s increasing economic engagement in the Pacific was driven by its diplomatic and strategic priorities, including reducing Taiwan’s international presence, gaining access to natural resources and developing a blue water navy. Former Micronesian government officials said Beijing also wants to extend its Belt and Road Initiative to Palau, and could provide an important source of investment once the Compact agreement expires.  “China is making overtures,” said former Palau President Johnson Toribiong. “We should be bringing in investors and that is a big factor in our Palau-Chinese relationship.”  Toribiong, who served until 2013, told Reuters Palau should not isolate itself. “I like Taiwan. But even Taiwanese want China now. The businessmen, they also want China. They don’t care about political consequence. Think about the economics,” Toribiong said.  Palau receives $10 million annually from Taiwan, as well as education and medical scholarships. Remengesau said Palau has not had any official talks with China for funding after the Compact expires but the government was discussing the issue internally.  China has quickly become one of the dominant economic players in the Pacific, spending billions of dollars in trade, investment, aid and tourism across Micronesia and the broader region.  China’s total goods trade with the Pacific Island Forum member countries reached $8.2 billion in 2017 versus $1.6 billion for the United States, according to the U.S. security report. Chinese concessional loans to Pacific islands have also risen sharply. In contrast, Washington’s efforts to strengthen its position in Palau have been largely superficial, according to locals who cite examples of bigger U.S. flags on their official vehicles and increased public signage.  Chinese activity has slowed significantly, however. Barabe, the resort owner, said Chinese investors had secured 99-year leases for around 60 hotel projects prior to 2017, but construction has been largely put on hold.  At a lush forest site leased by China’s Hanergy group, a rusting metal gate blocks the entrance with no sign of construction. Hanergy did not respond to requests for comment regarding the development. At a nearby hilltop site overlooking the ocean and leased by another Chinese developer, the shell of a dilapidated mansion stands scrawled with graffiti.  Jackson M. Henry, a real estate appraiser in Koror who helps Chinese companies lease land from local clans, said he was trying to set up channels to aid Chinese investment into Palau ahead of the next election in 2020. Pro business candidate Surangel Whipps Jr. was an early favourite to win the vote.  Henry, whose previous roles included Palau’s ambassador to Taiwan and Chairman of Palau Visitors Authority, said Palau wanted to be friends with both Taiwan and China. “They (Chinese clients) are looking towards the next administration to improve the relationship with mainland China.” For Graphic on Taiwan's political allies, click tmsnrt.rs/2hpQ0xx Reporting by Farah Master; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING, Jessica Macy Yu and Yi-Mou Lee in TAIPEI and David Brunnstrom in WASHINGTON.

2019-02-08,"PACARAIMA, Brazil (Reuters) - Fearful Venezuelan immigrants lined up in smaller numbers to enter Brazil on Sunday at the only border crossing between the two countries one day after violent protests by Brazilian residents drove hundreds back across the frontier. The Brazilian army, which reinforces security at the Pacaraima border post, said 1,200 Venezuelans, including women and children, fled back into Venezuelan on Saturday when residents went on a rampage after the stabbing and beating of a local shop owner. The angry demonstrators destroyed tents used by Venezuelans to camp out in the street near the bus station and set fire to belongings the immigrants left behind. “The Brazilians came running with sticks and bottles. They burnt all our things, even the children’s clothes,” said Joana Perez, a 24-year-old mother holding a 6-month-old baby. “I’m scared. I don’t know where to sleep tonight or if there will be another attack. We lost everything. All I have is my ID card.”  The outburst was triggered by the severe beating of a shop owner by four alleged Venezuelan immigrants on Friday, the state government said. But police declined to comment and had still not found the suspects on Sunday.  Tens of thousands of Venezuelans have poured over the border into Roraima state over the last few years, fleeing economic and political turmoil in their country. The influx has overwhelmed the state’s social services and brought a rise in crime, prostitution and disease, and has sparked incidents of xenophobia, Brazilian government officials say. “About 1,200 Venezuelans went back to their country yesterday. The flow has restarted today but evidently there are less people coming,” Colonel Hilel Zanatta, commander of the army operation at the border post, told Reuters. A Reuters photographer who crossed into Venezuela on Sunday morning to the border town of Santa Helena de Uairen said the streets were crowded with thousands of people seeking to leave the country but fearful of a hostile reception in Brazil. Venezuela’s government said the attacks on its citizens were fuelled by xenophobia and called on Brazil to protect the immigrants and their belongings. The Brazilian border state of Roraima repeated a call to close the border, which the federal government has refused to do for humanitarian reasons. Instead, President Michel Temer announced after meeting with cabinet members on Sunday an increase from 31 to 151 in the contingent of soldiers helping keep order at the border and will speed up moving Venezuelan immigrants to other Brazilian states.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May could face trouble getting her Brexit deal approved by the British parliament before exit day unless she changes her proposals, the head of an influential group of pro-Brexit lawmakers said in an interview published on Sunday. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group, a faction within May’s Conservative Party, is strongly opposed to the government’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and favours a clean break with the bloc on March 29 next year. “If she sticks with Chequers, she will find she has a block of votes against her in the House of Commons,” Rees-Mogg, tipped as a possible successor to May, told The Sunday Times newspaper, describing the Chequers proposals as “surrender” to the EU. “Of course the Eurosceptics in parliament are not in a majority on all issues, but we will inevitably be in a majority on some of them and that will make the legislation extraordinarily difficult if it is based on Chequers.” The Chequers plan would keep Britain in a free trade zone with the EU for manufactured and agricultural goods. But some Brexit supporters have said it would mean parts of the British economy would still be subject to rules set in Brussels. Both London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the Oct. 18 EU Council, but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic. If May cannot get a deal by October, an agreement could be reached at the December 13/14 EU Council. Rees-Mogg said letting it run to December would be “very risky”, the newspaper reported, as that would only leave three months to get the deal approved by the British parliament.   That would mean the government “must come forward with a deal that Brexiteers like, because otherwise they might find it’s much harder to get through parliament than they think”, he was quoted as saying. Parliament will have two votes: one on the Brexit deal and one on the Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill. May is betting that the fear of a so called “no-deal” scenario will push many Conservative and Labour lawmakers to support a deal, but the numbers are tight. In recent votes, May commanded a majority of around six votes on major Brexit issues. Britain’s Brexit minister Dominic Raab will travel to Brussels on Tuesday in a bid to pick up the pace of talks with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, but the government is also stepping up planning for a “no-deal” Brexit. Rees-Mogg said he believed a “Canada-plus” deal, a free trade pact along the lines of the EU’s 2016 agreement with Canada but with deeper ties given Britain’s already closer trading links, could command a majority in parliament. “If the prime minister came to the House of Commons with a Canada-plus style Brexit, people like me would say, ‘Yes, that’s all right,’ and people who are strongly pro-European would say, ‘Yes, that’s better than leaving on World Trade Organisation terms,’” Rees-Mogg said. “So although that wouldn’t be what people might choose, it could command a majority.” Reporting by Kylie MacLellan.

2019-02-08,"MESEBERG, Germany (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as Iran and a gas pipeline project that has drawn U.S. ire during tough talks outside Berlin that ended with no clearcut progress. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters no agreements were reached, but the meeting had simply been intended to “check the watches” after Merkel’s meeting with Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in May. Ties between the two countries have been strained since Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. The two leaders both viewed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project as a purely commercial venture, despite persistent fire by the U.S. and Ukrainian governments, Peskov said. “That’s why it is necessary to take measures against possible non-competitive and illegal attacks from the third countries in order to complete this project eventually,” he told reporters shortly before Putin flew back to Russia. It was not immediately clear what such “measures” could entail. At the start of the talks, Merkel underscored her expectation that Ukraine should continue to have a role in gas transit to Europe, and welcomed the start of discussions among the European Union, Ukraine and Russia on that issue. Putin, speaking at the German government’s Meseburg castle, said such a move had to make sense from a business perspective. “The main thing is that the Ukrainian transit – which is traditional for us - meets economic demands,” he said. “Nord Stream 2 is exclusively an economic project.” The United States is pressing Berlin to halt the pipeline that will carry gas from Russia under the Baltic Sea, arguing it will increase Germany’s dependence on Russia for energy.  Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business, while Germany’s eastern European neighbours worry about Russian encroachment. Peskov said the threat of possible U.S. sanctions against companies involved in the project was not discussed on Saturday. Standing beside Putin before the talks, Merkel said both countries - but especially Russia as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council - had a responsibility to try to solve the ongoing fighting in Ukraine and Syria. She said she also planned to raise potentially thorny human rights issues with Putin, and discuss bilateral relations. “I am of the opinion that controversial issues can only be addressed in dialogue and through dialogue,” she said. Both leaders raised concerns about Syria and the plight of the many refugees created by the seven-year-old war there. Merkel said it was important to avert a humanitarian crisis in Idlib, Syria and the surrounding region, and said she and Putin had already discussed the issue of constitutional reforms and possible elections when they last met in Sochi in May. Putin told reporters that everything must be done to help Syrian refugees to return to their country and that Syria needed assistance to rebuild. The two leaders took no questions. On Ukraine, Merkel said she hoped fresh efforts could be undertaken at the beginning of the new school year to disentangle Ukrainian military forces and separatists on the front lines in the Donbass region.  Putin arrived in Germany on Saturday evening after a stop at an Austrian vineyard where he danced with Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl at her wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger.  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper Germany hoped to “create new momentum” in the Minsk peace process. Sanctions relief for Russia would only be negotiated if the Minsk accord was implemented, he added. Maas said he had spoken with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin this week, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was due to visit Berlin again on Sept. 14 after a meeting with Merkel in the German capital last month.

2019-02-08,"ACCRA/GENEVA (Reuters) - Former U.N. Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kofi Annan died on Saturday at the age of 80, his foundation said, after decades of championing efforts to try to end protracted conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Annan, a Ghanaian national, died in hospital in Bern, Switzerland, in the early hours, his close associates said. In Geneva, the Kofi Annan Foundation announced his peaceful death after a short undisclosed illness with “immense sadness”, saying he was surrounded in his last days by his second wife Nane and children Ama, Kojo and Nina. After rising through the ranks of the United Nations, Annan served two terms as U.N. Secretary-General in New York from 1997-2006 and retired to live in a Swiss village in the Geneva countryside. His 10-year-old foundation promotes good governance and the transformation of African agriculture. “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations. He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whom Annan had chosen to head the U.N. refugee agency, said in a statement. Annan and the United Nations shared the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to reform the world body and give priority to human rights issues. As head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, Annan was criticised for the world body’s failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s.  As U.N. boss he was linked to peace efforts to reunite the divided island of Cyprus, submitting a reunification blueprint which was rejected in a referendum by Greek Cypriots in 2004. He staunchly opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and later served as the first U.N. envoy at the start of Syria’s war, but quit after world powers failed to fulfil their commitments, saying: “I lost my troops on the way to Damascus”. “The U.N. can be improved, it is not perfect but if it didn’t exist you would have to create it,” he told the BBC’s Hard Talk during an interview for his 80th birthday in April, recorded at the Geneva Graduate Institute where he had studied. “I am a stubborn optimist, I was born an optimist and will remain an optimist,” added Annan, who often joked about having learned from locals to wear earmuffs against the freezing cold during his undergraduate years at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the United States.  Raila Odinga, Kenyan opposition leader and former prime minister, said on Citizen TV: “We didn’t expect Kofi to pass that abruptly. Kofi Annan is a man of integrity; a great African, a great leader of the world.” Former U.S. presidents praised Annan. George W. Bush called him “a gentle man and a tireless leader of the United Nations”, while Barack Obama described him as “a diplomat and humanitarian who embodied the mission of the United Nations like few others”.  “Kofi Annan devoted his life to making the world a more peaceful place through his compassion and dedication to service. He worked tirelessly to unite us and never stopped fighting for the dignity of every‎ person,” U.S. envoy to the U.N. Nikki Haley said.  The Elders, a group of former leaders including Gro Harlem Brundtland and Mary Robinson, paid tribute to their inspiring chairman, noting his visits to South Africa and Zimbabwe in July.  U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, paid tribute to Annan as “humanity’s best example, the epitome, of human decency and grace”. Zeid, who has criticised major powers and other countries during his four-year term that ends later this month, said that whenever he felt “isolated and alone politically”, he would go for long walks with Annan in Geneva. “When I told him once how everyone was grumbling about me, he looked at me — like a father would look at a son — and said sternly: “You’re doing the right thing, let them grumble.”Then he grinned!” Reporting by Kwasi Kpodo in Accra, Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, Michele Kambas in Athens and George Obulutsa in Nairobi; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Andrew Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-un-annan/former-u-n-chief-and-nobel-peace-laureate-kofi-annan-dies-aged-80-idUKKBN1L30BB,2019-02-08,,Former U.N. chief and Nobel peace laureate Kofi Annan dies aged 80

2019-02-08,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Qatar has accused Saudi Arabia of barring its citizens from this year’s haj, something Riyadh denies, saying a diplomatic dispute is not stopping Qataris from making the pilgrimage to Mecca. Although 1,200 Qataris are eligible to perform the haj under a quota system, Qatar says it has become impossible to get permits, blaming the campaign by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to cut trade and diplomatic ties with the country. Abdullah Al-Kaabi of the state-run Qatar National Human Rights Committee said Saudi Arabia had shut down an electronic system used by travel agencies to obtain permits for pilgrims from Qatar. “There is no chance this year for Qatari citizens and residents to travel for haj,” he told Reuters. “Registration of pilgrims from the State of Qatar remains closed, and residents of Qatar cannot be granted visas as there are no diplomatic missions.” A Saudi official said Qatar had blocked several registration links set up for its pilgrims. An official at Saudi Arabia’s haj ministry said a group of Qataris had arrived for the pilgrimage which runs from Sunday to Aug. 24, but he did not say how many there were or whether they had travelled directly from Qatar. Last year, 1,624 Qatari pilgrims attended, he said. Saudi Arabia says the Qatari government is using the issue for political ends and it “rejects any effort to politicise the haj or drag political differences” into the pilgrimage, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Saudi Arabia, and the three other Arab countries, closed land, air and sea links with Qatar in July last year, accusing it of funding terrorism, something Doha denies. Saudi Arabia has said Qatari pilgrims can arrive on any airline other than Qatar Airways.  But three travel agencies in Doha told Reuters they had stopped trying to sell haj packages, which can cost up to 120,000 riyals ($33,000).  “Last year we lost a lot of money as the crisis started after we had booked everything in Mecca and Medina and we had to pay people back,” said a manager of one travel agency in Doha, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. “This year, nobody is really trying as people have understood there is no way to go there in these circumstances.”  Riyadh temporarily opened the land border for the haj last year, but not this time. A travel agency catering to migrant labourers in Doha said that had hit business. “We sell haj journeys by bus with accommodation for around 12,000 riyals,” its manager said. “But as nobody can get visas and land borders are closed, it is zero bookings this year.” The diplomatic crisis has defied mediation efforts by the United States, which has strong alliances with both sides and fears the split among its Sunni Muslim allies could benefit Shi’ite Iran. Saudi Arabia and Iran are involved in proxy wars, including in Yemen and Syria, and tensions between the two have spilled over into the haj in the past. In 2016, Iran boycotted the haj over security concerns after hundreds of people were killed in a crush there. Iranian pilgrims returned in 2017.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to visit Pyongyang next month at the invitation of North Korea leader Kim Jong Un to attend the celebrations of the 70th anniversary of North Korea’s founding, Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper reported. It will be the Chinese leader’s first visit to the North Korean capital since he took power in 2012, and 13 years after the last visit by a Chinese President, when Xi’s predecessor Hu Jintao visited in 2005, the newspaper said on Saturday.  The Straits Times did not say where it obtained the information and the Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. North Korea’s celebrations are set to take place on Sept. 9 and the Straits Times said that Xi’s visit could still be subject to last-minute changes.  China is the reclusive country’s most important trading partner and Kim has visited China three times so far this year during which he has held talks with Xi on improving cooperation between the two countries and economic reforms.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump faced an unprecedented outcry from former intelligence officials on Friday after stripping the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, but Trump defended his move and said he planned another one soon. The bipartisan group, which included Robert Gates, George Tenet, David Petraeus, James Clapper and Leon Panetta, lashed out at the president in a scathing letter released late on Thursday. By Friday evening, another 60 former intelligence officers added their voices in their own letter. Brennan, a former official in the Obama administration and sharp critic of Trump, has said he will not be deterred by the removal of his security clearance. Brennan described Trump’s actions at a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last month as treasonous. In an interview on MSNBC on Friday night, Brennan did not back down on his criticism of Trump’s conduct as president, but he did walk back his comment in July that Trump’s behavior in Helsinki was “nothing short of treasonous.” “I didn’t mean that he committed treason, but it was a term that I used, ‘nothing short of treasonous,’” Brennan said in the interview. Trump defended his decision, announced on Wednesday, saying it had elevated the former CIA chief rather than hampering his freedom of speech.   The president also told reporters he was likely to revoke  the clearance of Bruce Ohr, a Department of Justice official who is linked to a dossier on Trump’s campaign and Russia that was compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. Trump lashed out again at Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Moscow. Without citing evidence or offering proof, Trump said that Mueller had conflicts of interest. In the statement released late on Thursday, officials who served under Republican and Democratic officials said they did not necessarily agree with Brennan’s harsh criticism of the president, but that security authorizations should be based on national security, not politics.   “We all agree that the president’s action regarding John Brennan and the threats of similar action against other former officials has nothing to do with who should and should not hold security clearances - and everything to do with an attempt to stifle free speech,” the former CIA directors, deputy directors and directors of national intelligence said.  “We have never before seen the approval or removal of security clearances used as a political tool,” they wrote. Petraeus, one of the signers, was once considered by Trump as a candidate for secretary of state. Like the signatories of the first letter, the 60 former CIA officers said that while they do not necessarily agree with Brennan’s opinions, “It is our firm belief that the country will be weakened if there is a political litmus test applied before seasoned experts are allowed to share their views.” The second group included Henry Crumpton, who also served as the State Department’s top counter-terrorism official and Letitia Long, a former head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which oversees the military satellites used for intelligence collection, navigation and communication. In another pushback against the president, retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, who oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, praised Brennan and asked Trump to revoke his own security clearance as well, writing in a Washington Post opinion piece that he would “consider it an honor.” Trump challenged the suggestion that he was trying to silence critics by taking away security clearances. “There’s no silence. If anything, I’m giving them a bigger voice,” Trump said.  “Many people don’t even know who (Brennan) is, and now he has a bigger voice. And that’s OK with me, because I like taking on voices like that. I’ve never respected him.” The White House said it was studying a list of other individuals for security clearance review, and Trump suggested Ohr was at the top of that list. “I think Bruce Ohr is a disgrace,” he said. “I suspect I’ll be taking it away very quickly.” Ohr, who works in the Justice Department’s criminal division, was in contact with Steele, the former British spy who compiled a dossier of allegations of possible collusion between Trump’s camp and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Russia denies having meddled in the 2016 election, but three U.S. intelligence agencies reported in January 2017 that Moscow had intervened and tried to help Trump beat Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  Putin told reporters in Helsinki, while standing next to Trump, that he had wanted the former New York businessman to win the White House.

2019-02-08,"GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and wounded scores of others taking part in weekly Gaza border protests on Friday, medics said, as Egyptian mediators tried to clinch a truce deal that would calm the impoverished enclave. In Jerusalem’s Old City, another area that Palestinians want for a future state, Israeli police said they shot dead an Arab who attacked them with a knife after leaving a mosque complex.  After a more than four-month surge in confrontations over the Gaza Strip border, Israel this week eased its clampdown on the enclave’s commercial traffic and fishing. Cairo said it was finalising details of a longer-term accommodation between Israel and the dominant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Some 20,000 people participated in Friday’s protests, which took place a few hundred meters from the fence, though dozens came closer, with some rolling burning tyres, witnesses said.  Medics said Israeli gunfire killed two men and wounded at least 270 other Palestinians, 50 of them with live bullets. An Israeli army spokeswoman said troops had responded with “riot-dispersal means” to prevent breaches of the border.  Friday’s deaths brought to 170 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the weekly protests began on March 30. The campaign is pressing for rights to land that Palestinians lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation, and for an end to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza. Anger in Gaza has also been stoked by funding cuts by the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which dominates the West Bank and is the rival of Hamas, which runs Gaza. Their efforts at agreeing on a power-sharing unity deal with Egyptian mediation have not borne fruit. Cairo had no immediate comment on Friday’s incidents. Hamas official Izzat Reshiq said the group, and other Palestinian factions, concluded a round of talks with Egyptian security officials over a possible truce with Israel and that further talks were scheduled for later this month. “Efforts will resume after the holiday of Eid Al-Adha,” Reshiq said on Twitter, referring to a Muslim festival that begins on Aug. 21 and ends on Aug. 24.     Israel sees the Gaza protests as a bid by Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in the last decade, to use civilians as cover for cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this.  Separately, Israeli police said they were attacked on Friday by a knife-wielding man after he emerged from a complex housing Al Aqsa mosque, Islam’s third-holiest shrine, in East Jerusalem. The man was shot dead, police said, describing him as a resident of an Israeli Arab town where pro-Palestinian sympathies are strong. CCTV video from the scene showed a man lunging at a police trooper with a knife, but not what followed. Palestinians said that, after the incident, Israeli authorities barred Muslim worshippers from Al Aqsa mosque. “This is a grave escalation that may lead to unpredictable consequences,” Abbas said in a statement carried by the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on four Myanmar military and police commanders and two army units, accusing them of “ethnic cleansing” against Rohingya Muslims and widespread human rights abuses across the Southeast Asian nation. The sanctions by the Treasury Department marked the toughest U.S. action so far in response to Myanmar’s crackdown on the Rohingya minority, which started last year and has driven more than 700,000 people into neighbouring Bangladesh and left thousands of dead behind. But the Trump administration did not target the highest levels of Myanmar’s military and also stopped short of calling the anti-Rohingya campaign crimes against humanity or genocide, which has been the subject of debate within the U.S. government. The measures were announced as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to U.S. officials, prepares to issue the findings of an intensive U.S. investigation of alleged atrocities by Myanmar authorities against the Rohingya in Rakhine state.  The release of the report, compiled from interviews at refugee camps in Bangladesh, is expected to be around the August 25 one-year anniversary of the bloody crackdown. “Burmese security forces have engaged in violent campaigns against ethnic minority communities across Burma, including ethnic cleansing, massacres, sexual assault, extrajudicial killings, and other serious human rights abuses,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Sigal Mandelker, using an alternative name for Myanmar.    “Treasury is sanctioning units and leaders overseeing this horrific behaviour as part of a broader U.S. government strategy to hold accountable those responsible for such wide-scale human suffering,” Mandelker said. The sanctions were imposed on military commanders Aung Kyaw Zaw, Khin Maung Soe and Khin Hlaing and border police commander Thura San Lwin, in addition to the 33rd and 99th Light Infantry Divisions. The measures call for freezes of any U.S. assets the individuals hold, a prohibition on Americans doing business with them as well as bans on travel to the United States. A Reuters special report in June gave a comprehensive account of the roles played by the two infantry divisions in the offensive against the Rohingya. The military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, also known as Burma, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism. Myanmar’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics have accused President Donald Trump of being slow in his response to the Rohingya crisis. Human rights groups noted that while Friday’s sanctions list included generals, Myanmar’s powerful army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, was spared. Rich Weir, Myanmar researcher at Human Rights Watch, called the sanctions “an important but long overdue step.” “The avoidance of the top military leaders is striking,” he added. “The likelihood that they did not know what was happening is close to infinitesimal.” In the Treasury statement, Mandelker said: “The U.S. government is committed to ensuring that Burmese military units and leaders reckon with and put a stop to these brutal acts.” In November, following the lead of the United Nations and the European Union, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared that the Rohingya crisis constituted “ethnic cleansing,” a designation that increased pressure on its civilian leader, Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Pompeo has yet to decide whether, once he releases the State Department’s Rohingya atrocities report, to ratchet up   characterization of the violence as crimes against humanity or genocide or to avoid any such label, the officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Such terms could commit the United States to stronger punitive measures or help set the stage for charges at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Some within the administration worry that this could complicate Suu Kyi’s relationship with the powerful military and push Myanmar closer to China, Washington’s regional rival. Until Friday’s announcement, the United States had only sanctioned a single Myanmar commander and had scaled back already-limited bilateral military ties. On Friday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, called on social media companies to better protect vulnerable communities by regulating hate speech on their platforms, citing a Reuters report that found more than 1,000 examples of content published on Facebook that attacked the Rohingya and other Muslims in Myanmar. ( here ) “Facebook and other technology companies must find the means to address these problems head on and invest in solutions,” said Cantwell in a statement.   Two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, are on trial in Myanmar on charges of violating a state secrets law after being arrested in December while reporting on the massacre of 10 Rohingya men. Both have pleaded not guilty and have told the court how they were “trapped” by police officials who planted documents on them. This month Pompeo called for the immediate release of the two reporters.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency scams are using images of celebrities and upmarket London addresses to hoodwink consumers into parting with cash, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has said. The warning, first made in June, was reposted on the FCA’s website on Friday. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether are not regulated in Britain, and the FCA said it has received a rising number of reports about investment scams that claim to offer high returns. “UK consumers are being increasingly targeted by cryptocurrency-related investment scams,” the FCA said in a statement. “Cryptocurrency fraudsters tend to advertise on social media, often using the images of celebrities or well-known individuals to promote cryptocurrency investments.” The ads link to websites for investments either using cryptocurrencies or traditional cash. “The firms operating the scams are usually based outside of the UK but will claim to have a UK presence, often a prestigious City of London address,” the FCA said. Given that cryptocurrencies are not regulated, consumers are unlikely to get their money back, and are not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the watchdog said.

2019-02-08,"YUKHOVICHI, Belarus (Reuters) - Tamara and Yuri Baikov knew it was time to move away from their village when one of their ducks wandered into a neighbour’s plot of land, only to return with a wire deliberately threaded through its beak. Since then, the husband and wife have lived for more than a quarter of a century in a primitive hut in a forest in northeastern Belarus, close to the Russian border.  “There are no people - there is no conflict,” said Tamara Baikov, who says she loves weeding her vegetable patch and would rather plough a hectare of land than venture to a city. Life is simple for the two 69-year-olds. There is no electricity, so they read by torchlight. They take the water they need from the river and cook with a wood-burning stove. Their chickens and ducks provide them with meat and eggs. Their goats give them milk and cottage cheese. Manure is their only fertiliser for growing potatoes and vegetables. Daughter Veronika is their main contact with the outside world. She brings any additional supplies they might need from a store, and also sells their produce to generate some income.  “Our Veronika sells all this in neighbouring Russia. Plus a pension, we have enough to live on,” Yuri said. “We cannot leave our animals and birds even for a day - and we don’t want to.” They live on a small farm they built in 1992. The nearest Belarussian village, Yukhovichi, is 15 km (9 miles) away, while Russia is a few hundred metres across the river. They used to live in Yukhovichi as farmers, keeping cows and poultry. But dwelling near other people did not suit them — the injured duck was one example. In late 1991, the local authorities gave them a piece of land in the forest and one night in May 1992, they left together with Veronika, five cows, some groceries, tools and nails.  They spent the first few nights under a linden tree, covering themselves in plastic sheets for warmth.  Veronika grew up and eventually moved beyond the river to a village in Russia called Davostsy. She now has a 16-year-old daughter of her own called Angelina. Tamara and Yuri stayed in the cramped hut that was initially intended as a temporary shelter. They had planned to build a proper house, but a lack of money and bureaucratic hassles prevented them from doing so. They like to listen to Russian radio stations to keep up with world news. But mostly they enjoy the solitude. “Silence is very good - only grandma is not silent, she talks a lot,” Yuri joked, referring to his wife.

2019-02-08,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss Re is one of the main insurance companies for the Italian company Autostrade per l’Italia that managed the stretch of motorway where a bridge collapsed in Genoa, the Swiss group said on Friday. “We are already working with and will continue supporting our client in managing the impact of this tragic event on the victims and their families,” a Swiss Re spokeswoman said. Swiss Re declined to disclose details of individual insurance contracts or comment on the coverage it provided to clients. A 200-metre section of the bridge in northern Italy gave way on Tuesday in busy lunchtime traffic, claiming at least 38 lives. There have been calls for Autostrade per l’Italia’s parent company Atlantia to have its road concessions to be withdrawn.  “We will be working through the discovery process that will include independent third party assessments in order to determine the likely root cause of the event,” Swiss Re said, adding it was saddened by the loss of lives and grief caused by the tragedy.

2019-02-08,"KOCHI, India/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The death toll from the southern Indian state of Kerala’s worst floods in a century has risen to 79, a government official said, with rising water levels likely to impact rubber and other plantations in the region. Torrential rains in Kerala, India’s largest rubber producer and also a major tourism hub, have left over 30,000 people homeless, destroyed crops and disrupted air, rail and road traffic within the state for a week. “Ten people died today,” said M. Sivasankar, an official at the chief minister’s office. “(So far) 79 people have died in the most recent floods ... over (the course of) a week.” Rubber output in India, the world’s sixth biggest producer and second largest consumer, is likely to fall 13.5 percent from a year ago to 600,000 tonnes in the fiscal year to March 2019, according to N. Radhakrishnan, a dealer and former president of Cochin Rubber Merchants Association.  “In July rubber production was hit by rains. Now with the situation worsening in August, farmers again cannot tap rubber trees,” Rajiv Budhraja, director general of India’s Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association, told Reuters. With industry officials saying that a quick rebound in local rubber output is unlikely, tyre makers like MRF (MRF.NS), JK Tyre (JKIN.NS), Apollo Tyres (APLO.NS) and Ceat (CEAT.NS) will have to rely more on imports. That could lift India’s imports to a record 500,000 tonnes due to high demand from tyre makers, Budhraja said. Higher imports by India could support global rubber prices and lift shipments from major exporters like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Production of other key plantation crops such as tea, coffee and black pepper in Kerala have also been severely hit, with the state having received about 30 percent more rain than it typically gets since the start of the monsoon season in late May. Tens of thousands of people, including tourists visiting Kerala for the annual Onam festival, were stranded in parts of the state as the provincial government sought more helicopters and central forces for rescue operations. “Floating devices, lifeboats and life jackets will be air dropped to stranded groups of 50 or more people,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office said in a tweet on Thursday, appealing to people to stand in open areas or on top of houses and other buildings to ensure quick airlifting. Sivasankar, the official at the chief minister’s office, said a total of 265 people had died since the onset of the monsoon in Kerala on May 29. Kochi, the state’s commercial capital and a key gateway for tourists to the state, said it was flooded, forcing a suspension of operations at the airport until Aug. 26. Railway tracks and roads connecting Kochi to other parts of India were also inundated after the state received rainfall eight times heavier than normal on Wednesday. Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) Indian unit, which just held its big annual Indian Independence Day sales event, said that it had been forced to temporarily halt deliveries in parts of Kerala.      Heavy to very heavy rain is forecast in Kerala until Saturday, with a “red alert” for all 14 districts in the state.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China’s military has expanded its bomber operations in recent years while “likely training for strikes” against the United States and its allies, a Pentagon report released on Thursday said. The assessment, which comes at a time of heightened U.S.-China tensions over trade, was contained in an annual report that highlighted China’s efforts to increase its global influence, with defence spending that the Pentagon estimates exceeded $190 billion in 2017. “Over the last three years, the PLA has rapidly expanded its overwater bomber operating areas, gaining experience in critical maritime regions and likely training for strikes against U.S. and allied targets,” the report said, using an acronym for China’s People’s Liberation Army. The report comes as China and the United States plan to hold trade talks, offering hope they might resolve an escalating tariff conflict that threatens to degenerate into an all-out trade war. The report said that while the PLA had continued to extend operations, it was not clear what message Beijing was seeking to  send by carrying out the flights “beyond a demonstration of improved capabilities.” The Chinese embassy in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment. This year China’s air force landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region. In January the Pentagon put countering Beijing, along with Russia, at the centre of a new national defence strategy. While Washington and Beijing maintain a military-to-military relationship aimed at containing tensions, this has been tested in recent months, notably in May when the Pentagon withdrew an invitation to China to join a multinational naval exercise. In June, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis became the first Pentagon chief to visit China since 2014. The Pentagon report said that despite a projected slowdown in economic growth, China’s official defence budget would be more than $240 billion by 2028. The Pentagon report also said China’s space program was progressing rapidly. “The PLA continues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space,” it said.  This month, President Donald Trump’s administration announced an ambitious plan to usher in a new “Space Force” as the sixth branch of the military by 2020. One of the arguments in favour of developing such a force is that American rivals like China appear increasingly ready to strike U.S. space-based capabilities in the event of a conflict.

2019-02-08,"GENOA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy’s government opened an investigation on Thursday into  the country’s biggest toll-road operator, hours after saying it could face a heavy fine or lose its concession over a bridge collapse that killed at least 38 people. A section of the bridge gave way on Tuesday in busy lunchtime traffic, plunging dozens of vehicles 50m (160 feet) below and engulfing Autostrade per l’Italia into a political fire storm. Shares in the operator’s parent, Milan-listed international Atlantia (ATL.MI), fell by as much as 25 percent at one point as investors spooked by threats of government retaliation dumped the stock. They closed down around 22 percent at 18.3 euros. Shares in other toll-road firms such as SIAS (SIS.MI) and ASTM (ATMI.MI) also fell, after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the state would have to take over the country’s motorways if concession-holders could not do the job properly. Launching its investigation late on Thursday, the Transport Ministry said it had given Autostrade 15 days to show it had met all its contractual obligations, adding it wanted the company to rebuild the bridge at its own expense. If the justifications provided by the company were judged inadequate Rome would consider it a breach of the concession terms. Earlier Deputy Transport Minister Edoardo said Autostrade, owned by Italy’s Benetton family, could lose its concession as it had failed to ensure the viaduct’s safety.  “The options we’re looking at are the full revocation, the revocation of just the A10 section or a penalty, but a 150 million euro ($170 million) penalty is too low,” Rixi told Reuters. Under the terms of the concession Autostrade can be fined up to 150 million euros. A government source separately suggested Italy may impose a fine rather than withdraw Autostrade’s concession as the latter could involve a long legal fight and risk the government being ordered to pay compensation to the company. Autostrade says it made regular, thorough safety checks on the 1.2 km-long viaduct, part of a motorway linking the port city of Genoa with southern France, and had used world-leading experts when conducting the tests and inspections. Autostrade will hold an extraordinary board meeting on the crisis next week a source close to the matter said. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the reasons behind the bridge collapse, but have yet to publicly identify the cause. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has declared a state of emergency for Genoa, one of Italy’s busiest ports, whose main land corridor with France has effectively been severed. In the valley below the shattered structure, cranes moved away chunks of debris on Thursday as rescue teams searched for survivors under the rubble of a bridge completed in 1967 and overhauled just two years ago. Genoa’s chief prosecutor, Francesco Cozzi, said 10-20 people were still missing.     A state funeral for the victims will take place in Genoa on Saturday, officials said, as the coffins of some of the dead were laid out in a hospital chapel. One man stood in silence with his hands on the coffin in front of him. Other relatives were comforted by family members as they wiped away their tears. Italy’s ruling coalition has threatened to break EU budget rules if needs be to repair infrastructure and ensure there’s not repeat of the disaster. A spokesman for the executive European Commission rebuffed any suggestion EU spending rules were crimping action by Italy, saying Rome was getting 2.5 billion euros from EU coffers for investments in network infrastructure in 2014-2020. “Even without this tragedy the likelihood of the Italian government testing the EU’s patience with respect to its budget rules was always likely to be there,” CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said. “And we’ve seen that in the way that the investors are reacting around the bond markets. What this has done I think is act as a bit of a lightning rod for investors.” Bonds issued by Atlantia and its Autostrade per l’Italia unit have fallen sharply since Tuesday and now trade at record lows. A document detailing the terms for 3.2 billion euros worth of bonds guaranteed by Autostrade show that an early termination of the motorway concession would give bondholders a right to demand an early repayment. Bankers and analysts said Atlantia was less likely to bid for major projects abroad given the threat of punitive government measures against its Autostrade unit. Autostrade is 88 percent owned by Atlantia and accounts for around 66 pct of its revenues. “Atlantia is 100 percent focused on handling the Genoa crisis,” a source familiar with the matter said. “I can’t see them investing any resources into a new bidding process.”  ($1 = 0.8797 euros) Additional reporting by Valentina Za, Stefano Bernabei, Lisa Di Giuseppe and Stephen Jewkes, Jonathan Saul in London, Writing by Mark Bendeich, Editing by William Maclean and Jon Boyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-motorway-collapse/italy-opens-probe-into-operator-of-collapsed-bridge-investors-dump-shares-idUKKBN1L10U0,2019-02-08,,"Italy opens probe into operator of collapsed bridge, investors dump shares"
2019-02-08,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of U.S. newspapers on Thursday launched a coordinated defence of press freedom and a rebuke of President Donald Trump for denouncing some media organizations as enemies of the American people. “A central pillar of President Trump’s politics is a sustained assault on the free press,” said the editorial by the Boston Globe, which coordinated publication among more than 350 newspapers.   “The greatness of America is dependent on the role of a free press to speak the truth to the powerful,” the Globe said. “To label the press ‘the enemy of the people’ is as un-American as it is dangerous to the civic compact we have shared for more than two centuries.” Each of the newspapers, including some in states that Trump won during the 2016 presidential election, ran an editorial, which is usually an unsigned article that reflects the opinion of an editorial board and is separate from the news and other sections in a paper. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of the press. Trump has frequently criticized journalists and described news reports that contradict his opinion or policy positions as fake news. He lashed out again on Thursday, tweeting “THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING!” He also wrote there was nothing he would want more for the United States than true freedom of the press, but that much of what the media published was fake news, “pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!” The Republican president’s comments reflect a view held by many conservatives that most newspapers and other news outlets distort, make up or omit facts because of a bias against them. A representative for the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the editorials. In its editorial, the New York Times said it was correct to criticise the news media for underplaying or overplaying stories or for getting something wrong.  “News reporters and editors are human, and make mistakes. Correcting them is core to our job,” the Times said. “But insisting that truths you don’t like are ‘fake news’ is dangerous to the lifeblood of democracy. And calling journalists the ‘enemy of the people’ is dangerous, period.” The U.S. Senate unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution on Thursday that affirmed the “vital and indispensable role” played by the news media and declared that “the press is not the enemy of the people.” Thursday’s coordinated editorials were criticized by some in the media, including a CBS News commentary that described them as a “self-defeating act of journalistic groupthink.” “Seriously — Who’s going to be persuaded by this effort, or be impressed that a few hundred newspapers can hum the same tune? Who’s even going to notice?” CBS News’ commentary asked. Politico’s media critic, Jack Shafer, wrote this week that the coordinated editorial response was sure to backfire. “It will provide Trump with circumstantial evidence of the existence of a national press cabal that has been convened solely to oppose him,” Shafer said. “Trump will reap enough fresh material to whale on the media for at least a month.” In January, U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, said Trump had embraced the despotic language of former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Grammy winner Aretha Franklin earned her title “the Queen of Soul” with a voice could be both powerful and plaintive. Her music became part of the American soundtrack beginning in the 1960s through to her death on Thursday. Soon after her death, the following tributes poured out onto the internet: “In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade - our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect. She helped us feel more connected to each other, more hopeful, more human. And sometimes she helped us just forget about everything else and dance.” - Former President Barack Obama and wife, Michelle, in a statement “Let’s all take a moment to give thanks for the beautiful life of Aretha Franklin, the Queen of our souls, who inspired us all for many many years. She will be missed but the memory of her greatness as a musician and a fine human being will live with us forever.

America has lost a legend. RIP.” - U.S. Senator Kamala Harris on Twitter “Whether it was Gospel, Blues, Jazz, R&B, Pop, or Civil Rights, Aretha Franklin was the greatest gift and the voice of a generation. She could turn any song into a hymn. She will be greatly missed here on earth, but that band in heaven just got our Angel.” - Country singer Willie Nelson on Twitter “We were blessed to live in a world with #ArethaFranklin.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is sounding out some of Europe’s top insurance firms to see if they would contribute products to a UK price comparison website in what would be a major foray by the U.S. online retail giant into the region’s financial services. Three industry executives told Reuters they had held talks with Amazon about the possible launch of a site. One said the talks were part of several discussions Amazon is having with insurers. A second said there were no imminent launch plans. While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites. “As Amazon becomes a larger part of the home, whether it’s products delivered to the home, security monitoring, home services like Wi-Fi installation, you can make the case that insurance is the next logical step for this company,” said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. The industry sources declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Amazon declined to comment. An Amazon price comparison website for insurance products would be a potential challenge to existing UK sites given the U.S. company’s cutting-edge technology, reach and loyal customer base. Two of the most high profile are comparethemarket.com which shows products from insurers including AXA, Hastings and eSure; and GoCompare, which lists insurance from firms such as Santander and LV= [LV.UL]. In response to the prospect of Amazon launching a rival service, shares in Moneysupermarket, GoCompare and Admiral, which runs the confused.com site, were down between 1.6 percent and 4.6 percent on Thursday. A UK insurance site would also build on Amazon’s existing products in Europe offering extensions to manufacturers’ warranties, a service known as Amazon Protect. While Amazon’s loyal customer base and reach would probably prove attractive to some insurers happy to cede some of their premiums to Amazon to expand sales, the potential for premiums to be forced lower through competition could deter others. One of the industry sources said the comparison site model fitted Amazon’s strategy of offering a range of products, as opposed to partnering with one firm.  A price comparison website in particular could also be used to help drive traffic to its other marketplaces, Hottovy said. It was not immediately clear what financial arrangements Amazon would strike with insurers if it were to go ahead.  Tech-rival Google launched a financial services comparison site in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2016 but shut it down after only a year due to low traffic.  In the United States, Amazon has a joint venture with insurer Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan aimed at slashing U.S. healthcare costs. It also offers a small business loan programme. In Europe, Amazon has had a partnership with The Warranty Group since 2016 to offer the warranty extensions. It also offers co-branded credit cards in the United Kingdom and Germany although it does not lend money of its own. In a sign of potential expansion plans, Amazon began to place job ads last year for staff for a new insurance business in Europe, without giving details. While Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent have large finance arms, leading Western tech firms have taken a more cautious approach to heavily regulated financial services, which often have hefty capital requirements. A comparison site, however, would let Amazon give its customers access to insurance from a variety of providers while avoiding that level of regulatory burden, industry sources said. The use of comparison websites to buy motor and home insurance is more prevalent in the United Kingdom than Europe or the United States. Some insurers rely heavily on comparison websites for sales. UK insurer Hastings, for example, told Reuters it sells 90 percent of its motor policies through such sites. Rival car insurer Admiral also relies on websites for sales and would be open to joining any Amazon site, its chief financial officer, Geraint Jones, said. “If it establishes a comparison site then I suspect Admiral will be interested in being a member, potentially. Price comparison is the main source of distribution of our products and we’ll await with interest what they do,” Jones told Reuters.

Disney would only be forced to make such an offer if it completes a deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox’s (FOXA.O) TV and film assets, which include a 39 percent stake in Sky, before either Fox or rival suitor Comcast (CMCSA.O) succeed in taking control of the British broadcaster. The price is designed to reflect the level of the offer Disney is making for Fox, and its holding in Sky.  The regulator had set the level of a possible mandatory Disney offer for Sky at 14 pounds a share on July 13.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Financial Times Chief Executive John Ridding is to pay back some of his 2.6 million pound salary after a group of the newspaper’s reporters complained about his pay. Steve Bird, joint head of the National Union of Journalists at the newspaper, wrote to FT editors and journalists this month saying Ridding’s pay was absurdly high and calling for him to give some back to help those on lower salaries. Ridding said in an email to staff, which was seen by Reuters, that his salary had been set by Japanese media group Nikkei, which bought the FT for $1.3 billion in 2015, adding it was independently assessed and “highly performance-related”. “While our performance has been strong, I recognise that the size of the consequent jump in my own total reward in 2017 feels anomalous and has created concerns,” he wrote. Ridding said he had decided his remuneration should be restructured. “For now, I have decided to reinvest into the FT the increase awarded in 2017, which is 510,000 pounds before tax.” Ridding said “the first call” on the money would be a women’s development fund to boost the FT’s efforts to promote women to more senior roles and reduce the gender pay gap. “The balance of funds will be used to help meet the company’s overall financial objectives,” he said. The journalists’ union at the FT unanimously passed a resolution welcoming Redding’s actions, but said they did not go far enough and demanded higher pay for trainees and above-inflation pay increases for other employees. Ridding should also clarify what he would be paid this year, and forego his bonus for 2018, the resolution said. “We believe the company should respond to the widespread anger among staff as a matter of urgency,” the newspaper’s union chapel said in a statement.  “If we do not receive a timely response to all of our demands, we instruct chapel reps to place this matter into dispute and take such steps as may be necessary, up to and including balloting for industrial action.” Nikkei said in a statement it was very satisfied with the growth of the newspaper under Ridding and his team, and the success of the FT-Nikkei partnership. “We respect and support his proposal to adjust his remuneration to refocus attention on the FT’s mission,” it said.

2019-02-08," (This August 14 story was corrected to say “private” instaed of “public” in paragraph 14) By Supantha Mukherjee (Reuters) - Tesla Inc’s board named a special committee of three directors on Tuesday to decide what to do about Chief Executive Elon Musk’s potential offer to take the electric carmaker private, although Musk has yet to make a formal offer and is still negotiating to hire advisers needed to do a deal. The board announced the move in Tesla’s first filing with regulators since Musk tweeted a week ago that he was considering taking the company private and had already secured funding for a $420-per-share offer, valuing Tesla at $72 billion.  Since that unorthodox announcement on Aug. 7, which has triggered investor lawsuits and an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk and Tesla have scrambled to bring order to the process of negotiating a deal.  Musk tweeted on Monday he was working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman Sachs was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Silver Lake was also not signed up officially as a financial adviser, as it is helping Musk explore how to take Tesla private with no compensation, Reuters reported on Monday.  Goldman Sachs and Silver lake declined to comment. Musk’s effort to associate his potential bid with some of Wall Street’s most venerable institutions, even at the risk of misrepresenting their involvement, comes as pressure has been building on him to justify his pronouncement last week that funding for a deal had been “secured.”      Musk said on Monday he had held talks with a Saudi sovereign fund on a buyout that would take Tesla off the Nasdaq exchange - an extraordinary move for what is now the United States’ most valuable automaker. Tesla has a market value of $60 billion, bigger than Detroit rivals General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co, which produce far more cars. Tesla shares closed down 2.5 percent at $347.64 on Tuesday. They are still above $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private, which pushed the shares up 11 percent to an 11-month high.  Tesla said in its statement on Tuesday the special committee had the authority to take any action on behalf of the board to evaluate and negotiate a potential transaction and alternatives to any transaction proposed by Musk.       That means three members of Tesla’s board will now weigh whether it is advisable - or even feasible - to pursue what could be the biggest-ever go-private deal, and they are doing so before receiving a formal proposal from the CEO.  Musk has yet to persuade Wall Street analysts and investors that he can find the billions needed to complete the deal, or even such a deal is a good idea for a loss-making company.  “Despite Elon Musk’s frustration with being a public company, I think there are more advantages to remaining public,” said CFRA analyst Efraim Levy, citing cheaper access to capital and media exposure due to interest in a public company. Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, said it would be better for Tesla to remain a public company so investors can benefit from an “earnings inflection” if Musk fulfills his promise of making the company profitable later this year.   THREE-MEMBER PANEL Tesla said the committee consists only of independent directors: Brad Buss, Robyn Denholm and Linda Johnson Rice. But corporate governance and shareholder voting advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services said they do not consider Buss an independent director, due to his connections to solar panel installer SolarCity, which Tesla bought two years ago. Denholm, the first woman on Tesla’s board, is chief operations officer of telecom firm Telstra and the former chief financial officer of network gear maker Juniper Networks.    Rice, the first African-American and second woman to join the board, is CEO of Johnson Publishing Company and Chairman Emeritus of EBONY Media Holdings, the parent of EBONY and Jet brands, according to Tesla’s website.  Tesla’s other board members include Musk; his brother Kimbal Musk; Twenty-First Century Fox’s CEO James Murdoch; Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners; and Ira Ehrenpreis, founder of venture capital firm DBL Partners. One director, Steve Jurvetson, is currently on leave of absence. Tesla’s board said on Aug. 8 that Musk had held talks with the directors in the previous week on taking the company private. Latham and Watkins LLP has been retained by the committee as its legal counsel. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati will be legal counsel for Tesla itself.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Emperor Akihito, in his last appearance as reigning monarch at an annual ceremony marking Japan’s World War Two surrender, expressed “deep remorse” on Wednesday over the conflict, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed no repeat of the horror of war. Early in the day, Abe sent a ritual offering to Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni Shrine for war dead but did not visit out of apparent consideration for ties with South Korea and China. Past visits by Japanese leaders to the shrine have outraged China and South Korea because it honours 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal, along with war dead. China’s relations with Japan have long been haunted by what Beijing sees as Tokyo’s failure to atone for its occupation of parts of China before and during World War Two, although ties have thawed recently. Japan occupied Korea from 1910-1945 and bitter memories rankle. A silver-haired Akihito, 84, who will abdicate next year, spoke at the memorial for war dead after a moment of silence.  “Thinking of the peaceful times that have extended for many years after the war, reflecting on our past and with a feeling of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated,” said Akihito, who was accompanied by a kimono-clad Empress Michiko. Akihito has carved out a role as a symbol of peace, democracy and reconciliation during his three decades on the throne, visiting wartime battlefields to pray for the dead of all nationalities. His remarks on Wednesday echoed those he first spoke on the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, which were seen by many liberals and moderate conservatives as a subtle rebuke to Abe, who has said future generations should not have to keep apologising for the conflict. “I will humbly face the past and resolutely uphold this promise,” the prime minister said on Wednesday. In Beijing, the foreign ministry said, “The Yasukuni Shrine enshrines Class A war criminals who were directly responsible for the war of aggression. “We firmly oppose the wrong practices of the Japanese side,” the ministry said in a statement. South Korea’s foreign ministry expressed “deep regret” over Abe’s sending of an offering to the shrine. “Our government urges Japan’s political leaders to show a serious introspection and sincere attitude of self-reflection towards past history,” the ministry said in a statement. Separately, a group of about 50 conservative Japanese lawmakers including Shinjiro Koizumi, the popular son of former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, who is often spoken of as a future premier, paid their respects at the Yasukuni Shrine. Ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Masahiko Shibayama, who made the offering on Abe’s behalf, said the prime minister asked him to pray for the souls of the departed and that Abe regretted being unable to pay his respects in person. Abe has only visited the shrine in person once since taking office in 2012.  That December 2013 visit angered China and South Korea and prompted an expression of disappointment from ally the United States. Since then, he has sent offerings on Aug. 15 and Yasukuni’s twice-yearly festivals. Akihito’s father, Emperor Hirohito, in whose name Japanese fought World War Two, stopped visiting Yasukuni after the wartime leaders were first honoured by the shrine in 1978, and Akihito does not pay his respects there.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - One of China’s highest-ranking Buddhist monks quit as the head of the country’s Buddhist association on Wednesday after facing a government investigation over accusations of sexual misconduct.  The abbot of Longquan Temple on the outskirts of Beijing, who is also a member of the Communist Party’s top political advisory body, has denied accusations of harassing and demanding sexual favours from several nuns. The Buddhist Association of China said in a statement on its website that it had accepted Master Xuecheng’s offer to resign from the chairmanship and other posts on Wednesday, without elaborating on the reasons. China’s religious affairs administration launched an investigation following accusations levelled against the abbot in a document prepared by two former monks at the monastery. Xuecheng issued a denial on his Weibo microblog account, saying the allegations stemmed from “fabricated material” and “distorted facts”.  The case is one of the most prominent to have arisen since the #MeToo movement began to gain momentum in China. The Chinese #MeToo-style movement came in December last year and the hashtag #MeToo has so far appeared more than millions of  times on Weibo, and while issues like sexual assault have traditionally been brushed under the carpet, the movement is changing mindset among the younger generation.

2019-02-08,"GYODONG ISLAND, South Korea (Reuters) - Retired South Korean farmer Hwang Rae-ha would love to see his mother again, but nearly 70 years after he last set eyes on her, he says he would settle for a photograph.  “Too much time has passed by, and it is over now,” he told Reuters, standing near his home within sight of the North Korean border. “I don’t think she is alive.” During the Korean War, which raged up and down the peninsula for three years, Hwang’s family fled here to Gyodong Island, in what is now South Korea. But his mother returned to their home in the North to prepare for a hoped for peace and was caught on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divided the two Koreas after the 1953 armistice. Hwang, now 77, stayed on Gyodong Island, even building a home within sight of North Korea, hoping one day his mother would return. So far, there has only been silence. With tensions on the Korean peninsula easing, North and South Korea plan to revive the cross-border family reunions that were halted three years ago as concerns over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes mounted. More than 57,000 South Korean survivors are registered with the South Korean government, hoping for a shot at a brief meeting with loved ones. Just 93 South Koreans and 88 North Koreans have been selected for a new round of reunions that will begin on August 20 at a resort in North Korea’s Mt Kumgang, a popular tourist region. “I still cry whenever I talk about my family, I will probably cry again once I see them,” said 82-year-old Bae Soon-hui, who was picked to meet her sisters for the first time since the war. “I was utterly in shock after hearing that I was selected.”    Hwang, the retired farmer, was not one of the few picked for this new round of meetings. “When can we meet our loved ones?” he asked. “After all of us are dead? 100 people per each event is just meaningless. There are 50,000 people waiting all over the country.” His question is not entirely rhetorical. Since 1988, 132,484 South Koreans have added their names to a government registry, hoping to reunite with their families.  But survivors of the war are aging rapidly, and 75,425 people on that list have already died, the vast majority without ever having seen their relatives again. In a decade, most of the survivors - already in their 80s or 90s - will have died, said Cheong Seong-chang, Vice President of Research Planning at Seoul’s Sejong Institute. “That is why the state-run reunion programme is a matter of urgency, an extremely pressing matter,” he said. Park Kyung-sun, 81, who lives in Goyang city near the North Korean border, didn’t want to wait on the government. During a period of closer relations in the 2000s she unsuccessfully searched for her family during three tightly controlled tours in North Korea, once glimpsing her old home briefly from the window of a tour bus. “All I wanted was to tell my mom how I lived, but she is dead now,” Park said. “I miss my brothers. It’s so hurtful leaving them behind.” For many survivors the reunions offer the first details of their family’s fate following the war that left more than 1.2 million dead. “I will probably ask them how they have been, and when mother died,” Bae said of her sisters. “That’s what I want to know.”  South and North Korea first agreed to hold reunions after a historic inter-Korea summit in 2000. The reunions were held every year until 2015. Over that period, 2,046 people were picked by a computer which prioritises them on factors including their age and family background. Others are selected when their relatives in the North request a meeting. “I could not believe it at first, I thought I was being scammed,” said Kim Hyun-sook, 91, describing her shock when her daughter and granddaughter in North Korea asked to meet her in 2015. Many of those selected, however, say being torn away after seeing their relatives for only a few hours under the watchful eye of North Korean guards is a traumatic experience. “When the time was up, I let go of my daughter’s hand, and went to the bus,” Kim said. “The moment I sat down, I could not speak.” Kim said she wants to see her family again before she dies, but with North Korea still largely cut off from the rest of the world and those who have already had reunions ruled out of the selection process, that seems increasingly unlikely. “She is alive, and I can’t see her anymore for the rest of my life, can you even imagine that?”  Writing by Josh Smith.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Private equity firm Bain Capital has agreed to buy esure ESUR.L for 1.21 billion pounds, in a deal that gives investors in the British insurer a 37 percent premium on the share price at the end of last week. The insurer said its independent directors and two biggest shareholders, Chairman Peter Wood and Toscafund, supported the Bain deal at 280 pence per share. They together own 47.7 percent shares of the company. Wood and Halifax bank launched online insurer esure.com in 2001. After a management buy-out in 2010, it became an independent company and listed in London in March 2013 at 290 pence per share. The deal ends over two years of speculation around esure being a takeover target for U.S. private equity firms and reports of Wood trying to offload his 30.69 percent stake in the insurer.  Wood, however, told Reuters that esure had not received any other bids in the run up to the deal with Bain Capital. “This (Bain offer) was out of the blue. Bain Capital people came to see me in Palm Beach, Florida, at the end of April, I listened to them and then we had a few informal discussions and then it became more serious,” he said. Wood, 72, is set to earn 371 million pounds from the deal, according to Reuters calculations. He has agreed to continue as chairman of esure.  Wood added that Bain’s offer to buy esure without planning material job cuts or major reorganisation was a “very attractive” prospect. “It is very good for all my colleagues, all the employees because Bain Capital are going to grow the business and invest heavily,” he said. The company employs 1,850 at offices in Reigate, southern England and in the cities of Manchester and Glasgow. Bain does not intend to shift esure’s headquarters from Reigate, the insurer said. Bain on its part, cited esure’s “nimble and focussed approach, lean structure and strong use of technology”. esure’s stock had soared more than 30 percent on Monday after the insurer said it was in advanced talks over a possible bid from Bain Capital. Wood ruled out counter-bidders, citing the stock’s price jump. The stock was trading 3.9 percent higher at 277.5 pence at 0920 GMT on Tuesday but is below levels at which it traded at the end of June 2017.  esure, which launched Sheilas’ Wheels – a female-focused insurance brand – in 2005, vies with firms such as Aviva (AV.L), RSA (RSA.L), Direct Line (DLGD.L), Hastings (HSTG.L) and Admiral (ADML.L) in the competitive British car insurance market. “Given the headwinds facing the smaller challenger UK motor companies in a subdued pricing environment, we see this as an attractive valuation multiple,” UBS analysts said. GRAPHIC: Britain's motor insurers hit by falling prices, regulation - tmsnrt.rs/2P7LXHu Wood said esure was still on the lookout for a new chief and he had shortlisted two external candidates to replace Stuart Vann, who stepped down abruptly in January.

2019-02-08,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - The risk of a no-deal Brexit has been increasing and the European Union commission needs to change its attitude if a deal is to be reached, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Tuesday. “Everyone needs to prepare for the possibility of a chaotic no-deal Brexit,” Hunt told reporters in Helsinki. With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement.     “I think the risk of a no Brexit deal has been increasing recently ...  there is absolutely no guarantee that we will get a deal,” Hunt said after a meeting with his Finnish counterpart Timo Soini. “But it’s not what anyone wants and I hope very much that we’ll find a way to avoid that ... the British government has been doing everything it can to avoid that outcome,” he said. “We do need to see a change in approach by the European Commission.” Both London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the Oct. 18 EU Council, but diplomats think that target date is too optimistic. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of Prime Minister Theresa May’s new trade proposals last month. Economists say a failure to agree the terms of the divorce would cause serious harm to the world’s No.5 economy as trade with the EU, Britain’s largest market, would become subject to tariffs. Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU. Meanwhile, some MPs are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Royal Mail has been fined 50 million pounds for discriminating against Whistl, its only major competitor delivering letters, regulator Ofcom said on Tuesday. Royal Mail changed wholesale customers’ contracts in early 2014 when Whistl was set to become the first company to challenge its monopoly in the large-scale delivery of bulk mail. As a result, Whistl suspended plans to extend delivery services to new parts of the UK, Ofcom said. “Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery,” said Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom’s Competition Group Director.  “All companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail’s behaviour was unacceptable, and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition.” Royal Mail said it would appeal the fine, which is the biggest ever imposed by the regulator. “Royal Mail strongly refutes any suggestion that it has acted in breach of the Competition Act, and considers that the decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed,” it said. Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, said the wholesale price changes were designed to support the sustainability of the Universal Service - its obligation to deliver to all UK destinations for the same charge - as competitors cherry picked profitable urban areas for end-to-end delivery. Whistl had been trying to compete with Royal Mail in delivering bulk mail, such as utility bills and bank statements, direct to addresses in some urban areas while still using Royal Mail for final deliveries elsewhere.  Royal Mail also said it would challenge the ruling on the basis that for an allegation of abusive price discrimination to be established, the relevant prices must actually be paid. And it said the party paying such prices must be placed at a competitive disadvantage as a result, an essential element that didn’t exist in this case. Analyst Gerald Khoo at Liberum said that although the fine itself was not material and Whistl has long since ended its attempts at competing with Royal Mail through direct delivery, there were broader potential implications.  “We believe this is a reminder that Royal Mail must act with restraint given its dominant market shares in both letters and parcels, and this limits the group’s ability to grow parcels revenue over the long term,” he said. Shares in Royal Mail were trading down 0.5 percent at 460 pence at 0925 GMT.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - When Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko stood, heads bowed, at a seaside cliff on Saipan 60 years after a bloody World War Two battle, their silent prayers conveyed a message many felt resonated louder than words.  On that June 2005 visit - one of many war-related trips during Akihito’s three-decade reign - the royal couple paid their respects at memorials not only for Japanese but also American and Korean war dead. “I think the emperor felt heartfelt pain and mourning for those who died, and that we must not forget the tragedy of the war and should convey that to the generations who have not experienced it,” Shingo Haketa, former grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, which manages the monarch’s affairs, told Reuters in an exclusive interview. Haketa and a half-dozen other associates of the emperor recounted to Reuters how after the death of his father on Jan. 7, 1989, Akihito carved out an active role as symbol of peace, democracy and reconciliation. Although he cannot directly influence government policy, Akihito has created a broader consciousness of Japan’s wartime past, experts say.  That is a sharp departure from the legacy of his father, Hirohito - once revered as a “living god” in whose name Japan fought World War Two. Hirohito’s comments about the conflict were vague after Japan’s defeat, and he remained a divisive figure because of his role.  Akihito, 84, will abdicate next year. On Aug. 15, he will  for the last time as reigning emperor take part in an annual memorial ceremony honouring war dead held on the anniversary of Japan’s surrender. His retirement comes amid tensions with China and the Koreas, and his legacy appears threatened by a Japanese drift to the right mirrored in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s conservative agenda. Japanese political leaders have expressed regret, remorse and apology for their country’s wartime actions. But remarks by the emperor have a different weight, experts say. “Emperors are like popes - their gestures carry a symbolic message,” said Andrew Horvat, a visiting professor at Japan’s Josai International University. Politicians have sometimes undercut official apologies, but Akihito’s message has remained consistent. “People see (Akihito and Michiko) as sincerely and respectfully trying to reach out to wartime victims in a deeply symbolic and very reconciliatory way,” said Jennifer Lind, a Dartmouth College professor who has written about apologies. Friends and scholars credit Akihito’s post-war education with laying the foundations for how he forged his role. Influences included Quaker tutor Elizabeth Vining and former Keio University head Shinzo Koizumi, who saw many of his students die in the conflict. “Currently, most Japanese people think that the emperor is gentle and kind,” Mototsugu Akashi, a former classmate, told Reuters. “But that is clearly a post-war phenomenon.” The makeover of the monarchy began after Japan’s surrender in 1945, when Akihito was 11. In theory, the emperor can say what he likes as long as his remarks don’t violate the post-war constitution, which defines the emperor as “the symbol of the State and the unity of the People”, devoid of governmental power and unable to interfere in politics. In practice, Akihito’s public remarks are carefully vetted to ensure they don’t violate those rules, with delicate discussions determining how forthright he can be.     Akihito strained against those limits, say those who know him.     “I know that for one or two speeches, he was angry with the Imperial Household Agency and foreign ministry about the words to be used,” said Michael Barrett, who knew Akihito while head of the British Council in Japan during the 1990s.     “It was said that they (the imperial couple) were birds in a gilded cage, but he opened the door of that cage,” he added.      In one early example, Seoul in May 1990 wanted the new emperor to apologise for Japan’s often brutal 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula.  Ruling party lawmakers objected, and prime minister Toshiki Kaifu offered to apologise instead to South Korean president Roh Tae Woo.  Akihito, however, had his own ideas. “The current emperor wanted to make clear that it was Japan that caused the suffering of the Korean people,” Makoto Watanabe, a former imperial grand chamberlain, an aide to the emperor, told Reuters in an interview. Ultimately, Akihito had his way after private negotiations with government officials. “I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret,” he said at a banquet for Roh.  The early years of Akihito’s reign saw a flourishing of debate over Japan’s responsibility for World War Two and a series of government apologies. The statements, and efforts to teach children about Japan’s wartime actions, sparked a conservative backlash against a view of history seen as undermining national pride and identity. In 1992, Akihito became the first modern Japanese monarch to visit China. Domestic right-wing groups opposed the trip, while Chinese activists demanded an apology. While in China, the emperor said he felt “deep sorrow” for the suffering Japan inflicted on the Chinese people.  The next year, he began visits to wartime sites, beginning in Okinawa, where resentment lingered against mainland Japan over the islanders’ wartime sacrifices.    Six decades after the war’s end, he visited Saipan, a U.S. territory, on his first trip to a foreign battleground. “He had felt strongly that he wanted to pray for all the souls who died in the war, not just domestically but overseas, not just Japanese but all the people of the world,” Haketa said.  “Usually, the emperor’s overseas trips are in response to requests by the government, but this trip was based on his strong personal desire,” he added.  Despite Akihito’s age and health problems - he has had heart surgery and been treated for prostate cancer - he has continued his travels. In 2015 he and Michiko went to Palau’s tiny Peleliu island, site of a fierce battle in 1944. In 2016 they visited the Philippines and this year returned to Okinawa. On the 70th anniversary of Japan’s defeat, Akihito expressed “deep remorse” over the war, a nuanced departure from his annual script.     Many liberals and moderate conservatives saw it as a subtle rebuke to Abe, who a day earlier had expressed “utmost grief” for the suffering Japan inflicted but said future generations should not have to keep apologising.     Months later, Akihito told a news conference to mark his 82nd birthday: “I believe having thorough knowledge about the last war and deepening our thoughts about the war is most important for the future of Japan.”    Akihito’s heir, Oxford-educated Crown Prince Naruhito, 58, holds similar views on teaching about the tragedy of the war. “It is important to look back in a humble way on the past and pass on correctly the tragic experiences of war ... from the generation that experienced the war to those who have grown up without first-hand knowledge of it,” Naruhito told a news conference ahead of his 55th birthday. But it is unclear how much impact Naruhito will have, partly because like most Japanese, he did not experience the war. “If he speaks of remorse, many people will ask, ‘Remorse for what?’” said Keio University imperial law professor Hidehiko Kasahara.

2019-02-08,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Rising violence in Canada has prompted calls for the federal government to tighten gun laws but tougher regulations could cause a political backlash in a country where 2 million people are licensed to own a firearm. In 2016, 223 people were murdered with a gun, a 23 percent increase from 2015 and the highest rate since 2005, according to Statistics Canada. One of the deadliest shooting sprees so far this year took place on Friday when four people were shot to death in the Eastern Canadian city of Fredericton. Weeks earlier, a gunman opened fire on a bustling Danforth Avenue in Toronto, killing two and injuring 13 before turning the gun on himself. In Fredericton, a commonly available “long gun” such as a rifle or shotgun was used, police said Monday, adding that the suspect had a permit to use it. In Toronto the gunman used a handgun. It is not clear how the suspects obtained the guns. Canada’s firearm homicide rate of 0.61 per 100,000 people is about 10 times greater than the rate in the United Kingdom. In the United States, by contrast, four in every 100,000 residents are killed with a gun, or almost 13,000 annually. Canada’s federal government introduced gun laws earlier this year that would require retailer record-keeping and beef up background checks. The government is open to considering tougher ones after Toronto called for a ban on handguns in the wake of the Danforth shooting, said Bill Blair, the minister charged with tackling gun violence. “We’re prepared to look at any measure that will reduce gun violence,” he said in an interview, adding that “it’s a vast country and the way in which guns are viewed in Toronto is different than they might be viewed in different municipalities or communities.” The bill has passed second reading and is likely to pass in the House of Commons, where Liberals hold a majority, but may face headwinds in the Senate. But any move by the Liberal government to more heavily regulate ownership could prompt a backlash by the opposition Conservatives, who tend to do well in rural areas where hunting is popular and many farmers have guns.  Canada requires residents to obtain a license and pass a safety course to buy a gun. According to the Firearms Commissioner, more than 2 million people have such licenses in a country of 36 million. There is a national registry of handguns and other restricted and prohibited guns. The government ended a similar registry for long guns such as rifles in 2012 due to its unpopularity with gun owners and conservative voters. Under proposed legislation, retailers would keep records of everyone who buys a long gun. The National Firearms Association, a lobby group similar to the U.S. National Rifle Association but with less clout, said it would campaign against the Liberals’ proposed legislation, which the Conservatives said “treat law-abiding firearms owners as criminals” because of the background checks and requirements for record-keeping. National Firearms Association Executive Vice President Blair Hagen said his group, which has 150,000 members, has been in touch with the opposition Conservative party and hopes to make gun control an election issue.  “It’s one of those flashpoint issues,” he said Monday. “As soon as you touch that third rail, you’re setting yourself up for a very, very serious political fallout.” The Liberals criticized the former Conservative government’s 2012 move to scrap a registry of shotguns and rifles but the issue became so politically toxic that the party has promised not to bring it back. “That is not part of our plan and has never been,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island Monday.     The registry’s elimination left a crucial gap when it comes to tracking guns, says Wayne Rideout, a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer now working with the British Columbia government to tackle gun crime.  Now, someone with a license buying a rifle “can buy 10 guns, 20 guns, 100 guns and they don’t know who you are, they don’t keep a record,” he said in an interview. “There’s a number of broken pieces in the chain that need to be fixed.”     Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Additional reporting by Danya Hajjaji and Allison Martell in Toronto and David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-canada-shooting-guns/as-canada-faces-rising-gun-violence-tighter-laws-are-a-tough-sell-idUKKBN1KY2CO,2019-02-08,,"As Canada faces rising gun violence, tighter laws are a tough sell"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Having sunk to 13-month lows, sterling could fall by up to another 10 percent in the coming months should Britain crash out of the European Union without a deal on future trade ties, luring more speculators to bet against the currency. Sterling lost almost two percent last week just as British holidaymakers were heading off for some overseas sun GBP=D3. The latest move lower was kickstarted by trade minister Liam Fox's warning that, with Britain less than eight months from its scheduled EU departure date in March, there was a 60 percent chance of leaving without a deal. The moves were certainly exacerbated by a big and broad dollar rally, and the pound has since clawed back the worst of its losses against the euro, rebounding from 10-month lows  EURGBP=D3. But the worry, say analysts, is that in the absence of any conclusive developments towards a deal over the coming months, the pound’s spiral will accelerate while the clock ticks down on the deadline and hedge funds are tempted into betting against the currency.  And muddying the horizon are major political events - Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party conference in early October, and meetings of EU leaders in late September and then mid-October.   “There’s no guaranteed date for when Brexit progress or hard Brexit will be known by apart from exit day on 29 March 2019,” Nomura analysts told clients, describing a “hard Brexit” as a “cliff edge” moment in which Britain crashes out of the EU in March 2019 without any future trading arrangements in place. “We find that we are very much in the early stages of pricing for a hard Brexit.” Pound vs U.S. dollar: reut.rs/2vEBpYn How will sterling trade in the later stages, then? Most economists still believe Britain will reach a deal with the EU. But the latest Reuters polls indicate risk of no deal have risen to 25 percent, versus 20 percent in July.    Some bookmakers price even higher odds, above 40 percent. If that comes to pass, Britain’s currency would crash to $1.20 - from today’s $1.2750 levels, the Reuters poll showed, a fall of around 6 percent. But sterling is forecast to rise to $1.34 by end-January if an agreement is reached.  Others predict more precipitous falls - Commerzbank sees a 10 percent drop against the dollar and euro. That would leave the pound close to parity with the single currency, below post-Brexit referendum lows of 94 pence and current levels of 89.2 pence.   The uncertain outlook and the prospect of a sudden sterling surge had kept many hedge funds on the sidelines. Now though, sensing profits to be made, some funds have begun to wager against the pound. Prominent Brexit campaigner and hedge fund boss Crispin Odey told Reuters he was betting against sterling. He predicts it will hit $1.21 before March. Concern may be mounting at the corporate level too. A senior currencies trader at a large European bank said British exporters had rushed to hedge themselves, while speculators were using options to short the pound in increasing numbers. “Below the $1.30 mark is where corporates start to get nervous,” the trader said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “Hedge funds have been buyers of sterling on the dips but that’s starting to change. If it weakens further, we will see some accelerated selling.” Perhaps reflecting that shift, the price investors are prepared to pay for the future right to sell sterling has rocketed. Demand for options to sell sterling climbs to highest since Jan 2017: reut.rs/2MfsQg0 Three-month sterling/dollar risk reversals GBP3MRR=, a gauge of put-to-call options, have plunged to their weakest level since January 2017, indicating heightened demand for ‘puts’ — derivatives that give holders the right to sell an asset. ‘Call’ options give the right to buy. As Brexit approaches, more wild price swings are likely. Sterling/dollar three-month and six-month implied volatility gauges GBP3MO=FN, which measure price swing expectations, have shot to their highest since February. Nine-month GBP9MO=FN implied volatility, which covers the official March 29, 2019 Brexit date, has spiked even further, to 17-month highs.  Even relatively stable euro/sterling three-month EURGBP3MO=FN implied volatility is at its highest since March.         Pound volatility gauges spike to highest since February: reut.rs/2MfrQbK Yet shorting sterling remains a risky play.  Should Britain retain close trading ties with the EU, the pound could jump towards its post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4377 reached in April. A Brexit on these terms would also clear the path for the Bank of England to tighten monetary policy further. Sterling also looks cheap, according to some historical measures.  Using the real effective exchange rate or REER gauge — a currency’s value against trade partners’ currencies, adjusted for inflation — sterling is six percent below its five-year average, and 16 percent below its 20-year average. Under the purchasing-power parity, or PPP, theory, which compares the prices of a basket of goods, sterling/dollar should trade at $1.61, and euro/sterling at 80 pence. “Sure, there is gloom now but the currency remains undervalued as it has been historically,” said Geoffrey Yu, Head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. “Some [buyers] will see this as an opportunity.”          Sterling looks cheap on a historical basis: reut.rs/2vANtcX Editing by Sujata Rao and Toby Chopra",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-sterling-analysis/that-sinking-feeling-sterling-traders-prepare-for-brexit-meltdown-idUKKBN1KY1MB,2019-02-08,"Having sunk to 13-month lows, sterling could fall by up to another 10 percent in the coming months should Britain crash out of the European Union without a deal on future trade ties, luring more speculators to bet against the currency.",That sinking feeling?

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Independent music labels group Impala has called on EU antitrust regulators to block Sony Corp’s bid to become the world’s largest music publisher with its $2.3 billion offer for control of EMI, saying the combination would have too much market power.  Sony announced the deal in May, the boldest strategy move by its new CEO Kenichiro Yoshida, which would give it rights to 2.1 million songs from artists such as Drake, Sam Smith, Pharrell Williams and Sia. The Japanese conglomerate, which currently owns a 30 percent stake in EMI, wants to buy Mubalada Investment Co’s 60 percent stake. Last month, it acquired the estate of Michael Jackson’s  minority share of EMI. The growing popularity of fixed-price music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, SoundCloud and YouTube has boosted the industry. Sony’s control of EMI would give it the power to do what it wants, said Helen Smith, Impala’s executive chair. “The market needs big operators, but not when they are allowed to acquire so much power that they start to strangle it and squeeze out the independents who are the ones taking the risks,” she said, adding that 80 percent of new releases come from independent labels. She said the deal would give Sony the clout to negotiate online rights for both its recording and publishing catalogs, promote its global repertoire both on radio and in playlists, and be better able to attract songwriters with better terms. There was also a risk that Sony might focus more on bigger-selling Anglo-American hits rather than local songs, Smith said. “Blocking seems to be the only outcome as it is difficult to see how remedies could help in this case,” she said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays (BARC.L) has begun shifting direct ownership of its French, German and Spanish branches from a British-based entity to its Irish bank, according to sources with direct knowledge of the plans, ahead of Britain’s exit from the European Union. The move shows Barclays putting its Brexit contingency plans into action, in common with other banks which are not waiting for the outcome of negotiations over how financial services will operate after Britain leaves the EU in March.  The British bank outlined plans to expand its EU-based Irish entity in a slide presentation to investors earlier this month, saying the unit would primarily consist of Barclays corporate, investment and private banking activities and its Barclaycard credit card business in Germany. In addition to the French, German, and Spanish branches, Barclays will ultimately move all of its European branches under control of Barclays Bank Ireland, one of the sources said. Its other main corporate and investment banking businesses in Europe include Luxembourg, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands, according to a Reuters review of company filings. Barclays Bank Ireland will have total assets of around 224 billion pounds after absorbing all the European business, Barclays said in its presentation to investors, out of 1.1 trillion pounds for the entire bank as of the end of 2017. Barclays no longer operates a consumer banking business in Europe, having sold the last of its retail operation in 2016 as the bank shifted its global strategy to focus on the United States and Britain. While Barclays’ European branches will still ultimately be owned by its London-listed holding company, the change in organisational structure shows how lenders are shifting business to try to avoid any disruption that Brexit might cause.  Banks are trying to ensure that even under a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where Britain would crash out of the EU without any agreements in place, they would still be able to serve EU customers as before. British banks have largely chosen to base their main European hubs wherever they already have a suitably licensed existing subsidiary, as they seek to minimise costs and inconvenience in the event a last-minute deal renders the reorganisations unnecessary. Barclays rival HSBC (HSBA.L) has begun shifting direct ownership of its European branches from its British entity to its French subsidiary, while Lloyds (LLOY.L) is planning three EU subsidiaries, Reuters reported in July.

2019-02-08,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A fire at a hospital in Taiwan in the early hours of Monday killed nine people and injured 15 and an investigation has been launched into the cause of the blaze, authorities said.  Premier William Lai said the health ministry was overseeing rescue efforts at the hospital in New Taipei City, where the fire was extinguished shortly after dawn. The fire broke out on the 7th floor of the building, which was used for hospice care.  Media footage showed patients being wheeled out of the building in their hospital beds, while medical workers took others out on stretchers and into ambulances.  Scores of ambulances lined up outside the hospital waiting to take victims to medical centres. Lai said lessons had to be learned by every hospital in Taiwan. “In the event of a repeat incident, it’ll help to limit the impact to a minimum,” Lai told media. President Tsai Ing-wen, on a stop-off in the United States on Monday on her way to visit two of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, Belize and Paraguay, expressed grief for the dead and hopes for the injured, the government said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Passengers arriving at London’s Heathrow Airport had to queue at passport control for up to two-and-a-half hours in July, official figures showed, sparking further criticism from aviation chiefs about delays caused by Britain’s border regime.  The Border Force missed its 45-minute or less target for passport check wait times for 95 percent of visitors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) on all but one day last month, according to the data obtained by UK-based airline Virgin Atlantic.  Queues were longest on July 6 when non-EEA visitors had to wait for up to two hours and 36 minutes at Heathrow, Europe’s busiest airport.  The boss of Virgin Atlantic called the queue times “unacceptable”, adding to criticism from the chief executive of British Airways (ICAG.L), who said last week that Heathrow’s queues were worse than at other major world airport. “We all agree that security and safety at our airports is vital and remains our top priority, but other countries are managing their borders more effectively,” Virgin Atlantic’s chief executive Craig Kreeger said in a statement on Monday.  Britain’s interior ministry, responsible for Border Force operations, said it was deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow this summer, who would all be in place during peak travel periods in August and September. It said in a statement that it would not compromise on border checks and was working to reduce waiting times.  Heathrow Airport’s chief executive John Holland-Kaye last week called on the Home Office to let visitors from low risk countries such as the U.S. use the electronic passport gates which currently are only open to EEA visitors.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has sharply criticised U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and sanctions policies, saying such measures were destroying jobs and growth and that Europe would not bow to U.S. pressure regarding Iran. The United States has triggered a bitter tit-for-tat trade dispute with import tariffs meant to protect American jobs against what Trump calls unfair trade practices from China, Europe and other countries. Trump’s determination to push ahead with sanctions on Tehran which also target European companies doing business with Iran has opened another battle front. “This trade war is slowing down and destroying economic growth - and it creates new uncertainties,” Altmaier told Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that consumers suffered the most because higher tariffs were driving up prices. Altmaier lauded the agreement reached by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during negotiations with Trump last month, saying the interim deal had saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe. The U.S. and the European Union are embroiled in a spat after Trump imposed tariffs on aluminium and steel imports and Brussels responded with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods. Trump had also threatened to impose tariffs on EU auto imports but reached an agreement to hold off on taking action after meeting with Juncker at the White House last month. “The agreement between the EU and U.S. can only be a first step. Our goal is a global trade order with lower tariffs, less protectionism and open markets,” Altmaier said. Turning to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the minister said Germany and its EU allies would continue to support companies doing business with Iran despite U.S. pressure. “We won’t let Washington dictate us with whom we can do business and we therefore stick to the Vienna Nuclear Agreement so that Iran cannot build atomic weapons,” Altmaier said. German companies should be allowed to continue to invest in Iran as much as they want and the German government is looking for ways together with its European allies to ensure that financial transactions could still take place, he added. Several European companies have suspended plans to invest in Iran in light of the U.S. sanctions, including oil major Total (TOTF.PA) as well as carmakers PSA (PEUP.PA), Renault (RENA.PA) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE).        German business associations have warned that companies are increasingly suffering from Trump’s sanctions policies - including those against Iran - as well as the tariffs he is imposing in the escalating trade conflict with China. The trade and sanctions disputes are clouding the growth outlook for Germany, Europe’s largest economy, but Altmaier said he nonetheless expected strong growth this year due to vibrant domestic demand, record-high employment and rising wages. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product figures for the second quarter on Tuesday, with analysts expecting the quarterly growth rate to pick up to 0.4 percent after 0.3 percent in the first quarter.

2019-02-08,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For the past two weeks, a wildfire has forced much of Yosemite National Park in California to close, with smoke blanketing its famous rock formations and clouding the summer travel season for one of the largest tourism economies tied to a U.S. park. Steven Anker, 53, has seen business decrease by 80 percent at his Priest Station Café in nearby Groveland.”People come to Yosemite to see the outdoors. If the air quality is bad, they just won’t go,” Anker said.  Wildfires burning in the U.S. West have scorched 5.6 million acres (2.3 million hectares) this year, including parts of other national forests, the National Interagency Fire Center said on its website. But the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite has stood out as particularly damaging to local tourism. “The gateway communities around Yosemite are our top concern,” Caroline Beteta, president and chief executive officer of the tourism group Visit California, said in an email. “They are losing significant business during peak season.” The area around Yosemite has the seventh largest tourism economy connected with a U.S. national park, with 4.3 million visitors spending an estimated $452 million in 2017, according to the National Park Service. While Beteta had no official estimates for how much wildfires have hurt tourism, the concern is that potential travelers alarmed by the blazes are canceling trips. Nearly 20 percent of visitors to California go to a national park, making them important drivers of tourism, she said.  Yosemite is due to reopen on Tuesday, though with limited hours and services, the park said on Friday. Spokesman Scott Gediman said the fires have been contained away from the park, though smoke is still a problem at times. “I’m watching a helicopter dip water out of river with one of those long hoses,” he told Reuters by telephone from his office at the park. “They’re still fighting fires.”  Local businesses around the park this summer have lost millions of dollars in revenue on everything from hotel rooms to trinkets, with occupancy rates at many hotels approaching zero, said Rhonda Salisbury, chief executive of the Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau. The fire has triggered road closures for large sections of the park, including the Yosemite Valley, which has been cut off to visitors since July 25.  “Roads are money, and without the roads open, we die,” said Doug Shaw, who operates the Yosemite Bug Rustic Mountain Resort near the park. Shaw had to lay off some staff and lost about $200,000 in potential profits, he said. The Ferguson Fire has caused two deaths and scorched about 100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) at Yosemite, which is about 150 miles (240 km) east of San Francisco. It broke out on July 13,  when local businesses usually count on a large influx of families with children on summer vacation. The fire has also hurt businesses such as Skydive Yosemite, which on its website touts “amazing views of Yosemite National Park.” Those views have been obscured by billowing clouds of smoke.  In the past, customers could see Half Dome and El Capitan while plummeting to Earth during a tandem jump, said Skydive Yosemite co-owner Paul Wignall, but smoke blocked those views.  The company had 10 cancellations in August, he said. California has seen the worst start to its fire season in a decade, and officials from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said satellite images show two-thirds of the state covered in smoke.  Smoke from fires in Northern California have even reached Oregon to the north. As a result, the annual Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland has canceled 12 outdoor shows due to poor air quality, causing a loss of about half a million dollars, said Linea Gagliano, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Tourism Commission.  Tourism officials in some other parts of the U.S. West, such as Montana, Idaho and Utah, reported minimal damage to their local travel and leisure industries from wildfires. But the local tourism economy of Durango, southwest Colorado, is still feeling the effects from a wildfire. When the 416 Fire burned parts of the nearby San Juan National Forest in June, hotels in Durango saw occupancy rates fall below 30 percent, said Theresa Blake Graven, spokeswoman for the Durango Area Tourism Office. Back in Yosemite, park spokesman Gediman said the rare interlude of quiet at the peak of summer has given wildlife free rein in the valley. “The bears are walking around eating apples off the trees and the berries. We saw a mama bear and her cub by a hotel, the gray foxes are out ... So for me it’s been fun to see.”  Additional reporting by Diana Kruzman in New York and Bill Tarrant in Los Angeles; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Frances Kerry",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-wildfires-tourism/smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-wildfires-sting-california-park-tourism-idUKKBN1KX0CP,2019-02-08,,Smoke gets in your eyes: wildfires sting California park tourism
2019-02-08," (This August 10 story corrects name of expert in paragraph 12, fixes typographical error in paragraph 3) By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations human rights panel said on Friday that it had received many credible reports that 1 million ethnic Uighurs in China are held in what resembles a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy.”  Gay McDougall, a member of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, cited estimates that 2 million Uighurs and Muslim minorities were forced into “political camps for indoctrination” in the western Xinjiang autonomous region. “We are deeply concerned at the many numerous and credible reports that we have received that in the name of combating religious extremism and maintaining social stability (China) has changed the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy, a sort of ‘no rights zone’,” she told the start of a two-day regular review of China’s record, including Hong Kong and Macao. China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority. A Chinese delegation of some 50 officials made no comment on her remarks at the Geneva session that is scheduled to continue  on Monday. The U.S. mission to the United Nations said on Twitter that it was “deeply troubled by reports of an ongoing crackdown on Uighurs and other Muslims in China.” “We call on China to end their counterproductive policies and free all of those who have been arbitrarily detained,” the U.S. mission said. The allegations came from multiple sources, including activist group Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which said in a report last month that 21 percent of all arrests recorded in China in 2017 were in Xinjiang.  Earlier, Yu Jianhua, China’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, said it was working towards equality and solidarity among all ethnic groups. But McDougall said that members of the Uighur community and other Muslims were being treated as “enemies of the state” solely on the basis of their ethno-religious identity. More than 100 Uighur students who returned to China from countries including Egypt and Turkey had been detained, with some dying in custody, she said.  Yemhelhe Mint Mohamed, a panel member, referred to “arbitrary and mass detention of almost 1 million Uighurs” and asked the Chinese delegation, “What is the level of religious freedom available now to Uighurs in China, what legal protection exists for them to practice their religion?” Panelists also raised reports of mistreatment of Tibetans in the autonomous region, including inadequate use of the Tibetan language in the classroom and at court proceedings. “The U.N. body maintained its integrity, the government got a very clear message,” Golok Jigme, a Tibetan monk and former prisoner living in exile, told Reuters at the meeting.

2019-02-08,"ALEXANDRIA, Virginia (Reuters) - The head of a small Chicago bank was directly involved in approving $16 million in loans to former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort while seeking Manafort’s help securing a post in the new administration, a witness testified on Friday in Manafort’s fraud trial.  Dennis Raico, a former Federal Savings Bank executive testifying under immunity, said the bank’s chief executive, Steve Calk, expressed interest in such posts as Treasury secretary or Housing and Urban Development secretary. Calk took a “personal interest” in Manafort’s loan applications and expedited them, Raico said. One loan was approved a day after a July 27, 2016, call in which Calk let it be known to Manafort he wanted a role in the administration.   “I knew Steve was interested politics,” Raico said.  Manafort later asked the incoming administration to consider tapping Calk for secretary of the Army, according to testimony earlier in the week. Calk, a retired Army officer and helicopter pilot, did not get any post in the administration, although he was named to a Trump campaign advisory panel in August 2016.  A spokeswoman for Federal Savings did not respond to requests for comment. Calk declined to comment. Raico was one of just three witnesses called to the stand on Friday as the trial resumed after an unexpected recess that lasted into the midafternoon. The delay derailed the prosecution’s plans to wrap up its case by the end of the week.  Greg Andres, a prosecutor on U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team, said he would call James Brennan, a vice president at Federal Savings Bank who was also granted immunity, and two other witnesses on Monday before resting their case. It was not clear if Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to  18 felony counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose about 30 foreign bank accounts, will call any witnesses. So far Manafort’s lawyers have focused their defence on attacking Rick Gates, Manafort’s former right-hand man who cut a plea deal and is cooperating with Mueller’s probe. Raico testified that Gates had nothing to do with the two Federal Savings loans in question - a $9.5 million mortgage on Manafort’s estate in the Hamptons and a $6.5 million loan on a brownstone in Brooklyn. Prosecutors say Manafort lied about his income and provided other false information to get the loans. Raico said Calk asked him to call Manafort shortly after the Nov. 8, 2016, election, to see if he could be a candidate for the Treasury or HUD posts. Raico said the involvement of Calk in the Manafort loans was unusual and made him uncomfortable. He said had never seen loans approved so quickly at the bank. On cross-examination, defence attorney Richard Westling sought to show that the loans to Manafort were justified. Westling pointed out that the Hamptons property had been appraised at $13 million, well above the $9.5 million borrowed, and that Federal’s credit committee had approved the loans. Raico said that a letter from Gates indicating that he, not Manafort, would be paying for Yankees season tickets in 2016 lowered his debts, helping him qualify for the Federal loans. In the letter Gates said he had borrowed Manafort’s American Express card to pay for the tickets, which cost more than $200,000 a year. Gates testified this week the letter was false and a “favor” to Manafort to help him get the loans. Irfan Kirimca, senior director of ticket operations at the Yankees, testified on Friday that Manafort had purchased four season tickets since at least 2010 and that Gates never had an account with the Yankees. Kirimca said Manafort paid for the Legends Suite package, which includes food service and cushioned seats. Kirimca testified about one email exchange in which Manafort instructed a Yankees employee to send the tickets to his Trump Tower address. Andres also on Friday briefly questioned Andrew Chojnowski, chief operating officer of home lending at Federal, asking him  whether Manafort had signed various documents warning that he could be prosecuted for giving false information to the bank. Chojnowski read one disclaimer which noted that mortgage fraud was punishable by up to 30 years in prison. Andres said he plans to call James Brennan, a Federal Savings executive who like Raico was granted immunity, on Monday. He then wants to recall Paula Liss, a special agent for the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, who testified earlier this week. Manafort’s lawyers have opposed Liss taking the stand again, a matter on which T.S. Ellis, the judge overseeing the case, has yet to rule. Ellis said the recess on Friday could not be avoided as he had matters to attend to. Without further details, courtroom observers were left to speculate about the reason for the break and a long bench discussion with attorneys from both sides. Ellis, who reminded jurors in the morning in unusual detail about the need to “keep an open mind” about the trial and not to talk to anyone about the case, gave them the same instructions before dismissing them for the weekend. “Put it completely out of your mind until Monday. I certainly plan to do that,” Ellis said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump intensified his spat with Turkey on Friday by imposing higher tariffs on metal imports, putting unprecedented economic pressure on a NATO ally and deepening turmoil in Turkish financial markets. Criticizing the state of the U.S. relationship with Ankara, Trump announced on Twitter that he had authorized a doubling of duties on aluminium and steel imported from Turkey, making them 20 percent and 50 percent respectively. The White House said Trump would use a section of U.S. law that allows for tariffs on national security grounds to impose the increased duties. Washington and Ankara have been at odds for months over an American pastor detained in Turkey, the Syrian civil war and other diplomatic issues.  Trump’s move sent Turkey’s lira currency deeper into tailspin. The lira, which has long been falling on worries about the government’s influence over monetary policy and the U.S. tensions, plunged more than 18 percent at one point on Friday to a record low against the dollar. Even before Trump’s announcement, President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks to exchange gold and dollars for lira in order to fight “an economic war.” Waves from the crisis spread abroad, with investors selling off shares in European banks with large exposure to the Turkish economy.   “I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!” Trump said in an early morning post on Twitter. “Aluminum will now be 20 percent and Steel 50 percent. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!” The United States, the world’s biggest steel importer, imposed tariffs of 10 percent on aluminium and 25 percent on steel in March for imports from a variety of countries.      Turkey is the sixth-largest steel exporter to the United States. Ankara sent a delegation this week to Washington to meet with both the State and Treasury Departments to resolve some of the disputes but those talks showed no signs of breakthrough. Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Turkey’s justice minister and interior minister for not releasing U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson.     Brunson, an evangelical Presbyterian pastor from North Carolina, was jailed for allegedly supporting a group that Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Brunson denies the charge. His cause resonates with Christian conservative supporters of Trump, who could also be influential as Republicans seek to retain control of Congress in midterm elections in November. Trump and Turkey’s Erdogan have had an up-down relationship. At the U.N. General Assembly last year, Trump called Erdogan a “friend” who got “very high marks” for how he runs the country.  Just weeks ago, Trump was reported to have fist-bumped Erdogan during a NATO meeting in Brussels. Aaron Stein, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said Trump has “personalized the Brunson issue and feels like Erdogan cheated him.” “We are in uncharted waters here. No idea how this ends, or where Ankara wants to take this but it’s going to be a wild ride,” Stein said. In addition to the Brunson case, Washington is seeking the release of three locally employed U.S. embassy staff. Trade issues and differences over Syria have also strained bilateral ties.    Turkey also wants the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric who Turkish authorities say masterminded the coup attempt against Erdogan in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies the allegation.  Turkey, home to the Incirlik air base which is used by U.S. forces in the Middle East, has been a NATO member since the 1950s and a close ally of the United States.

2019-02-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Investors dumped euro zone bank shares on Friday on concerns about their exposure to Turkey, as the lira fell to yet another record low with a defiant government showing few signs it is ready to take decisive steps to stabilise the currency. A widening rift with the United States, its main NATO ally, and President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy under a new powerful executive presidency have helped to drive the lira down by more than 40 percent this year, a particular vulnerability for Turkish banks as over a third of their lending is in foreign currencies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he had authorised higher tariffs on imports from Turkey, imposing a 20 percent duty on aluminium and 50 percent one on steel, as tensions rose between the two NATO allies over Ankara’s detention of an American pastor and other diplomatic issues. The euro zone bank sell-off was exacerbated by a report in the Financial Times that the European Central Bank is increasingly concerned about some lenders, particularly BBVA (BBVA.MC) of Spain, UniCredit (CRDI.MI) of Italy and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) of France, as they have some of the largest operations in Turkey among euro zone banks. The ECB declined to comment. Sources familiar with its work added that a review has been going on for several weeks and this was considered a prudent supervisory practice given the situation. This echoed the FT report, which said that the situation was not yet considered critical.  Shares in BBVA were down 5.7 percent late on Friday, UniCredit was off 6.4 percent and BNP dropped 4.4 percent, all exceeding a 4.3 percent drop in the euro zone bank index .SX7E.  Turkey accounted for 373 million euros of BBVA’s its first half net attributable profit, 14 percent of the group total, suggesting that it may be the most vulnerable to the country’s market turmoil. The bank declined to comment. UniCredit, whose Turkish unit Yapi Kredi is viewed by Goldman Sachs analysts as the most vulnerable in terms of capital levels, played down its exposure in its recent earnings presentation.  It argued that the country accounted for less than 2 percent of group revenues and a 10 percent fall in the lira would affect its CET1 ratio - capital that must be set aside as a buffer against financial shocks - by only around 2 basis points. It declined to comment on Friday. However, a report by Credit Suisse said Turkey remained a risk for UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank by assets, as the depreciation of the lira could further hit its core capital - which came in lower than expected at the end of June.  The Yapi Kredi stake is valued on the bank’s books at $2.5 billion and is currently worth $1.1 billion, Credit Suisse said in a report on Friday. “The Turkish risks may also come from potential asset quality deterioration as Turkish corporate could be under pressure due to its large amount of debt USD denominated,” it said. “We cannot rule out that the regulator may require an add-on on capital for the exposure.” UniCredit is also exposed to the rouble’s fall and widening Italian government bond spreads.      BBVA, which reported a lowly CET 1 ratio of 10.8 percent at the end of the first half, also said a 10 percent slump in the lira would shave 2 basis points off its core capital.     Data from the Bank of International Settlements indicate that banks’ exposure to Turkey is about $82 billion in the case of Spain and $17 billion for Italy, relatively low figures given that top euro zone banks have combined total assets of more than 20 trillion euros.  Much of these exposures are also lira in the balance sheets of local subsidiaries, suggesting that the actual risk to their parent firms is even smaller. While the lira’s plunge could drag down the Turkish economy, the impact on euro zone banks in general is seen as modest, economists said.  “The surge in Turkish inflation, bond yields and the even more dramatic plunge in Turkey’s exchange rate in 2018 suggest that the country could now be in danger of heading for a bust,” Berenberg economist Carsten Hesse said.  “The impact on euro zone GDP growth would be small,” Hesse added. “The total damage from a Turkish recession would be smaller than 0.1 percentage point to the euro zone economy.” Still, the sell-off may not be over after the government struck a defiant tone on Friday even after Trump’s move. Erdogan, who says a shadowy “interest rate lobby” and Western credit ratings agencies are attempting to undermine Turkey’s economy, said Turks should exchange their gold and dollars into lira to help the currency.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Brexit is depressing economic growth in Britain, Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Friday after official data showed lacklustre year-on-year expansion. “Clearly that uncertainty is having a depressing effect on economic growth,” Hammond told broadcasters during a trip to central England to announce 780 million pounds of public investment in high-tech industry. Brexit proposals set out last month by Prime Minister Theresa May should lead to economic growth broadly the same as if Britain were to stay in the EU, he added. Hammond said that in the long run he wanted to see growth rates faster than the year-on-year expansion of 1.3 percent recorded in the second quarter of 2018.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - An increase in wholesale energy prices pushed Britain’s Centrica (CNA.L) to announce its second price rise of the year this week even as regulators prepare to cap prices to help millions of households struggling with rising costs.  All of Britain’s top energy suppliers have increased prices since Prime Minister Theresa May lashed out at what she called “rip-off energy prices” last October and pledged to cap prices in the biggest market intervention since privatisation almost 30 years ago.  Wholesale gas prices spiked to their highest level in at least 10 years as the country was hit by a cold weather snap dubbed the beast from the east in February, while the heatwave felt across the country this summer has also led to higher than usual demand for electricity.  Academics said British demand for electricity rises 350 megawatts (MW) for every degree the temperature rises above 20 degrees Celsius, a frequent occurrence in recent weeks, while lower wind speeds curb power output from the country’s wind farms. Regulator Ofgem will cap prices on the most widely used standard tariffs (SVTs) by the end of the year, but experts warn prices could continue to rise ahead of the cap if wholesale prices, which make up almost 40 percent of a bill, continue to remain high. “We cannot of course rule out further SVT price rises, given the trajectory of commodity price changes,” analysts at Bernstein said in a research note.  Reuters data shows average day-ahead wholesale gas prices TRGBNBPD1 in the first half of 2018 were almost 30 percent higher than over the same period last year, while the average day-ahead electricity price TRGBBD1 was around 20 percent higher.  “This is mostly due to the global rise in oil prices feeding through to wholesale gas prices which impacts both domestic heating and electricity generation,” Ofgem said this week as it announced it would allow suppliers to raise prices for the most vulnerable customers. Average benchmark Brent crude oil prices LCOc1 in the first half of 2018 were up almost 35 percent on a year earlier. Although British energy users pay less per unit for electricity and gas than those in most western European countries, including Germany, Italy and Spain, according to Eurostat data for the second half of 2017, Ofgem says the cost of supplying Britain’s near 28 million homes has soared. Intervention in a free market is an unusual step for Britain’s ruling Conservative Party, and indeed the idea of capping prices was first floated by the opposition Labour party before the 2015 parliamentary election. But May made a promise upon taking office in 2016 to help poorer Britons who are “just about managing”, many of whom vented their frustration with years of low earnings growth by voting for Brexit two years ago. Utilities have denied overcharging, but the Competition and Markets Authority found they had overcharged some British households a total of 1.4 billion pounds a year on average from 2012 to 2015. The government launched a campaign to persuade consumers to seek out the cheapest deals by switching tariff or supplier but the majority of households remain on SVTs which can be as much as 200 pounds a year higher than other deals offered by the same supplier. All of Britain’s “big six” energy companies have announced price increases this year. The others are SSE (SSE.L), E.ON (EONGn.DE), EDF Energy (EDF.PA), Innogy’s (IGY.DE) Npower and Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power.   The closure last year of Rough, Britain’s largest gas storage site, also means there is less gas in reserve when demand spikes happen, like during last winter’s cold snap, forcing the country to rely more on imports.  A weaker pound makes imports of products such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) priced in dollars more expensive. Around 80 percent of British homes are heated by gas, while about 40 percent of Britain’s electricity comes from gas-fired power plants so high gas prices have a knock-on effect.  Higher environmental levies such as carbon costs have also lifted electricity prices this year. Britain’s fossil fuel power generators are subject to two carbon emission levies, the European Emission Trading System (ETS) and the domestic carbon floor tax. With cuts in the supply of carbon permits expected from next year, prices in the ETS have more than doubled in 2018 to around 17.50 euros ($20.29) a tonne CFI2Zc1, which must be paid on top of the domestic tax which is currently around 18 pounds per tonne.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin discussed possible new U.S. sanctions against Russia with his Security Council on Friday, the TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. The U.S. State Department on Wednesday announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia that pushed the rouble to two-year lows and sparked a wider sell-off over fears Russia was locked in a spiral of never-ending sanctions. Separate legislation introduced last week in draft form by Republican and Democratic senators, dubbed “the sanctions bill from hell” by one of its backers, proposes curbs on the operations of several state-owned Russian banks in the United States and restrictions on their use of the dollar. Putin and members of the Security Council said the latest round of sanctions was “absolutely illegal” under international law, Peskov was quoted as saying.

2019-02-08,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) unveiled the Galaxy Note 9 “phablet” in New York on Thursday in a key product launch that it hopes will attract younger customers with stepped-up features and services for gamers and music-lovers. Launching the Note 9 at 11 a.m. in New York, or Friday midnight in Seoul, Samsung also announced partnerships with global hit game Fortnite and music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N) in a stepped-up challenge to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in the premium-phone race. Samsung’s new focus marks a shift away from its previous positioning of the Note as a multi-tasking device popular with graphic designers and artists. But the hefty price tag - at $999.99 for the base 128 gigabyte model, according to U.S. carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) - has raised questions as to whether features such as a longer battery life and quick cooling would be enough to attract customers. “I couldn’t find anything that was eye-catching enough to prompt customers to ignore the high price tag,” said Greg Roh, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities. Shares of Samsung were down 3.5 percent in Seoul, mirroring weakness in other chip-related stocks. Samsung is under pressure to jump-start faltering smartphone sales after posting its slowest quarterly profit growth in more than a year, as rivals such as China’s Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] nipped at its heels with cheaper, feature-packed models. The Note 9 will support up to 1 terabyte of memory - a 512GB version that can take another 512GB through a memory card - making Samsung the first major smartphone maker to sell a 1TB phone. The phablet - a cross between a smartphone and a tablet - will hit stores on Aug. 24, Samsung said. Verizon said the Note 9 will be available for pre-order from Aug. 10, with the 512GB model priced at $1,249.99. Sprint Corp (S.N) will introduce the device on Aug. 24 at a 50 percent discount as part of a promotional scheme.  The Note 9 is the first Android phone to support Fortnite, a hugely popular video-and-smartphone survival game that was only playable on computers, consoles and Apple products until now.  It also comes with a Bluetooth-enabled stylus designed to act as a remote for snapping photos and controlling YouTube video playback. The New York event also featured a Samsung Galaxy watch and Galaxy Home speaker, a device that will use its Bixby voice assistant and compete with similar products from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.  Spotify will be supported on the speakers, along with all other Samsung devices - news that sent shares in the music-streaming service provider up nearly 5 percent. Samsung is counting on the Note 9 to outsell the Note 8 to stem a sales slump. It said last month its flagship Galaxy S9 phone missed sales targets, sending profits in the mobile division down by a third in the April-June quarter. Samsung does not break out shipments of its smartphone models, but analysts reckon it has shipped around 10 million Note 8 models so far. “The jury is still out if the device can boost sales of Samsung’s premium category,” mobile phone market tracker Counterpoint Research said in a blog, pointing to stiff competition from the iPhone X, Huawei’s P20 Pro and the Find X from China’s Oppo Electronics. “The price is a big factor.” Huawei predicted last week it would become the world’s top smartphone seller by volume - displacing Samsung - in the final quarter of next year, while Apple sold more of its $1,000 iPhone Xs in the June quarter.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Japanese trade officials said they better understood each other’s positions after talks on Thursday, while Tokyo appeared to stick to its position of avoiding a bilateral free-trade agreement. “We had a frank exchange of views and deepened mutual understanding,” Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters after several hours of meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which he said would continue on Friday. However, Motegi reiterated Japan’s view that multilateral talks, which Washington has abandoned, were the best way to address trade issues. Tokyo wants to avoid a bilateral free-trade agreement - which Lighthizer called for in the past - where it could come under pressure over access to its auto and agricultural markets. “Ambassador Lighthizer and Minister Motegi had a thorough and constructive exchange of views on all bilateral trade issues,” Lighthizer’s office said. “They understand each other’s conditions for further discussions and plan to move forward with additional talks.”     President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the  Trans-Pacific Partnership, calling it a bad deal and saying he preferred bilateral talks. Thursday’s talks launched a round of what the two sides call “free, fair and reciprocal” negotiations. They fall within broader bilateral economic discussions led by Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.  Motegi said Japan and the United States agreed they want to achieve results quickly. He declined to give details of the first day’s discussions, telling reporters he would “say what I can after the first round of talks end”. Trump’s threats to impose higher tariffs on auto imports, including those from Japan, raised concerns such a step would harm both economies.

2019-02-08,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia and China on Thursday objected to a U.S. proposal to add a Russian bank, Moscow-based North Korean banker and two other entities to a U.N. Security Council blacklist, diplomats said. The list of proposed designations mirrors new sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury last week. [nL1N1UU0VN] The United States made the proposal to the 15-member U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which operates by consensus. Russia objected to the designations because it said the U.S. proposal was not “adequately substantiated by sufficient information,” diplomats said. China gave no reason for its objections. Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met for the first time in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization. The United States and other council members have said there must be strict enforcement of sanctions until Pyongyang acts. Last week, Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank, North Korean banker Ri Jong Won, China-based Dandong Zhongsheng Industry & Trade Co Ltd and North Korea-based Korea Ungum Corporation.  The U.S. Treasury Department said Agrosoyuz Commercial Bank had conducted “a significant transaction” for North Korean banker Han Jang Su, who had been blacklisted by Washington. Han is the Moscow-based chief representative of Foreign Trade Bank (FTB), North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank. The Security Council blacklisted FTB in August last year. Ri is FTB’s deputy representative in Moscow. The U.S. Treasury said Dandong Zhongsheng Industry & Trade and Korea Ungum Corporation were FTB front companies. The U.N. blacklist would impose a global travel ban and asset freeze on those designated. Russia and China last month delayed a U.S. push for the Security Council sanctions committee to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said. [nL1N1UF15D] Sanctions by the United States and the U.N. Security Council, which include a ban on exports of coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood from North Korea, and caps on imports of oil and refined petroleum products, are aimed at choking off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Mercedes-Benz GLE and GLS models, built in the United States between May 4 and June 12, 2018, have a brake issue which poses a “safety risk,” according to a Chinese customs document circulating on Chinese social media.  The document said authorities in Shanghai had found the rear brakes on these vehicles to be “insufficient.” The authenticity of the documents could not be verified with Chinese authorities.  Daimler said the company had been made aware of a potential brake issue related to vehicles in China imported from the United States.  “We are working with the relevant authorities to resolve the issue,” a spokeswoman said on Thursday. Daimler could not immediately comment on the number of vehicles affected, and is seeking to resolve what it described as an “entirely technical issue.”  On Wednesday, Chinese authorities said they would impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from steel products to autos, in an escalation of the trade dispute between China and the United States. In June, Daimler cut its 2018 profit forecast because of the trade war between China and the United States, sparking fears of a wave of earnings downgrades in the auto industry.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Treasury said on Thursday it would soon start putting contingency arrangements in place for financial services regulation if the country crashes out of the European Union without a deal.  The Treasury said that firms should still continue to plan for a transition phase of just under two years, which will come into force when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019 as long as the two sides agree a deal. However, it said it was also preparing in case that did not happen.  “The government will ensure a workable legal regime is in operation whatever the outcome of negotiations,” the Treasury said in a document outlining its approach to financial services legislation throughout Brexit.   The plan for a no-deal scenario would see Britain convert EU laws and regulations into British law in a process dubbed “onshoring”.  The government hopes this would smooth the exit for financial services - a major industry accounting for 12 percent of Britain’s economic output. The Treasury said it would also delegate powers to financial regulators to address any gaps in their rule books arising as a result, and would consult with all stakeholders to discuss its plans.   A number of statutory instruments will be created to establish the basis for the contingency arrangements, it continued. It plans to deliver soon the first, granting temporary permission for EU-licensed financial firms to operate in Britain if they can no longer ‘passport’ their licenses into the country, it said.    A further six instruments will be delivered throughout the autumn and into early 2019, the Treasury said, covering areas such as prudential regulation and capital markets.

The 335-store Poundworld went into administration in June after its majority owner, the private equity group TPG Capital, failed to find a buyer for the struggling business which had a total workforce of about 5,100.

David Henderson said in a statement his family’s offer to purchase “the best and remaining stores” had been accepted by Deloitte. He did not disclose how much the family would pay. “There’s an agreement in principle but it’s not confirmed,” said a source close to Deloitte.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thirsty city slickers are pitching in to help farmers in Australia’s parched interior by eating a pub delicacy called a “parma,” with some of the proceeds marked for drought relief. The dish of fried crumbed chicken topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese, called parmagiana, or parma for short, is staple pub food across a country in the depths of a big dry. Winter’s wheat crop is failing in the east and graziers are struggling to keep livestock alive on bone-dry pastures.    All over a continent where “the bush” looms large in the public psyche, that’s prompted bars to promise a dollar in donation from each meal sold, as well as collecting cash from barflies, as part of the “parma for a farmer” drive. “We thought let’s double that, we’ll do two dollars,” James Martin told Reuters at the Old Fitzroy Hotel in the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo where he is chef. “It resonates for me to jump on board, to help do what I can,” he said. “We use a lot of produce, a lot of meat and the drought issue is obviously massive for the farmers, but there is this huge ripple-on effect that’s occurring throughout Australia.” A thousand other pubs have signed on as well in just a week, illustrating the depth of feeling for drought-stricken farmers, which has deepened further still as images of starving sheep, dry waterholes and fields turned to moonscapes have hit the city press and evening bulletins in recent weeks. “We’ve all seen the horrendous pictures on the news, it’s shocking,” said Amanda Kinross, a cake decorator from rural Victorian town Bendigo, who began the campaign with a Facebook post. “Within minutes pubs were saying: ‘Yep, we’re on.’” Australia’s government has already pledged almost A$600 million (£345.4 million) in aid but proceeds from the “parma” drive will be directed especially to assist with buying and sending emergency livestock feed to affected farms. “Sometimes in the city we don’t realise how tough it is out there, and it’s a bit of a tough time at the moment, so supporting in any way that we can,” said Andy Casey, who tucked in to a huge A$24 parma, with chips and salad, for lunch. “It was fresh, it was delicious,” he said, washing it down with a beer.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s embassy in the United States on Thursday called new U.S. sanctions draconian and said the reason for the new restrictions — allegations it poisoned a former spy and his daughter in Britain — were far-fetched. The United States on Wednesday announced it would impose fresh sanctions on Russia after Washington determined Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, in Britain. Russia has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack, and Russia’s embassy in Washington said in a statement that Washington’s findings against it in the case were not backed by evidence. “On August 8, 2018 our Deputy Chief of Mission was informed in the State Department of new ‘draconian’ sanctions against Russia for far-fetched accusations of using the ‘Novichok’ nerve agent against a UK citizen,” the embassy said in a statement. “We grew accustomed to not hearing any facts or evidence.”  The U.S. announcement fuelled already worsening investor sentiment about the possible effect of more U.S. sanctions on Russian assets and the rouble slid by over 1 percent on Thursday against the dollar, a day after falling towards its lowest level in nearly two years.       The Russian embassy said Moscow continued to advocate for an open and transparent investigation into the poisoning. Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia’s GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury in March after a liquid form of the Novichok type of nerve agent was applied to his home’s front door. European countries and the United States expelled 100 Russian diplomats after the attack, in the strongest action by President Donald Trump against Russia since he came to office. The new U.S. sanctions would cover sensitive national-security controlled goods, a senior State Department official told reporters.  There would, however, be exemptions for space flight activities, government space cooperation, and areas covering commercial passenger aviation safety, which would be reviewed on a case by case basis, the official added. The official said a second batch of “more draconian” sanctions would be imposed after 90 days unless Russia gave “reliable assurances” it would no longer use chemical weapons and allow on-site inspections by the United Nations or other international observer groups. Given that Russia flatly denies involvement in the incident, it appears unlikely to accede to the U.S. demands.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion (£12.4 billion) worth of U.S. imports from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment, the Chinese commerce ministry said, as the world’s largest economies escalated their trade dispute. The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23, the ministry said, the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods. The United States published its final list of goods subject to the new tariffs on Tuesday. China’s final list announced on Wednesday differs from an earlier draft it published in June, which included crude oil. The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft, although the total value is unchanged. The U.S. action that prompted the Chinese retaliation was the latest by President Donald Trump to put pressure on China to negotiate trade concessions, after Washington imposed tariffs on $34 billion in goods last month. China has vowed to retaliate with equivalent tariffs against any U.S. action. “This is a very unreasonable practise,” the Chinese commerce ministry said of the U.S. action on Wednesday as it rolled out China’s counter-tariffs. To compensate for the gap on its tariff list caused by the exclusion of crude oil, China added fish meal, wood waste, paper and paper waste, metal scraps, and various types of bicycles and cars, among other products. Last week, China proposed additional tariffs on another $60 billion of U.S. goods after Trump raised planned tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office could not immediately be reached for comment on China’s retaliation announcement or whether this would trigger Trump’s next round of threatened tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  USTR is conducting a public comment period for those tariffs, which could reach 25 percent, due to end Sept. 5. It would take a few more weeks to revise the list and make programming changes at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the duties. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said he expected that there would be little to stop further escalation of the U.S.-China tariff war as both sides dig into entrenched positions. “My expectation is that U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China will be in effect about a month prior to the November U.S. elections. That’s soon enough to be used by Trump as a rallying argument, but late enough so that adverse effects will not occur before January 2019. Of course, China will retaliate, probably dollar for dollar,” Hufbauer said. China, however, would run out of U.S. imports to levy, as it bought only $130 billion worth of American goods last year. It would likely have to impose penalties on U.S. companies doing business in China to make up the difference.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - U.S. companies are putting in place measures to cushion the impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. The world’s two largest economies have already imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s imports. In the latest development, Washington slapped additional tariffs on $16 billion worth of China’s goods and Beijing followed suit. The following is a list of recent comments made by U.S. companies: ** Tesla Inc said higher import duties on Chinese components and unfavourable currency movements likely to cause negative pressures. Price hikes made to offset the tariffs will likely have some near-term negative impact on volumes in China.  ** Fitbit Inc, which utilizes China-based contract manufacturers, said if the latest U.S. tariffs come into force, it would weigh on the company’s material costs. ** Caterpillar Inc said U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are expected to increase its material costs by about $100 million to $200 million in the second half of the year. The heavy machinery maker plans to offset most of the higher costs with mid-year price hikes. ** General Electric Co estimated that new tariffs on its imports from China could raise its costs by $300 million to $400 million overall, before steps to lessen the impact. ** Detroit automakers General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV lowered their full-year profit forecasts due to escalating tariffs.     ** Boeing Co is concerned about the impact of possible trade tariffs on the cost of running its supply chain, but has not yet seen any impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions on its business, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said. ** U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc said it would increase the use of supply chain sources from non-China countries to counter growing costs related to a tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. ** Home furnishings chain At Home Group Inc said it would make adjustments to its supply chain to mitigate the impact of the proposed tariffs on goods imported from China. ** Home furnishing retailer Pier 1 Imports says the company does not expect financial results in fiscal 2019 to be materially affected by proposed tariffs. About 59 percent of the company’s fiscal 2019 net sales are expected to be derived from merchandise produced in China.  Of the 59 percent of 2019 sales from Chinese merchandise, about half is expected to have products subject to proposed tariff. ** Consumer products maker Newell Brands Inc said annualized impact of tariffs could be as much as $100 million, which the company’s 2018 forecast has accounted for. It also said product delivery in the second half of the year would be impacted by the new U.S. tariffs on China-sourced goods and the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the EU and Canada.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk said if the China tariffs are raised to 25 percent, the company will hike prices. ** U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc said it expected incremental costs of about $15 million to $20 million for the remainder of the year from the steel and aluminium tariffs imposed by Trump. It also says it will take further hits from retaliatory moves from the European Union. ** Polaris Industries Inc, which makes Indian motorcycles, raised its 2018 cost estimates related to tariffs to $40 million from $7 million, and said it expected to ramp up motorcycle production in Poland for European market in 2019 to offset higher costs. ** Diversified industrial manufacturer 3M Co said it expects an impact of about $10 million, or 1 cent per share, on an annualized basis from the tariffs passed so far. The company also said it was prepared to make changes to supply, sourcing and pricing in response to any further tariffs. ** Paper and packaging company International Paper Chief Executive Officer Mark Sutton says the company has so far not had any direct impact from tariff disputes. ** Otis elevator maker United Technologies Corp said based on tariffs which have been enacted so far it expects to see 5 cent per share impact in 2018. The company expects to see a much bigger impact in 2019.     ** Medical device maker Boston Scientific said it buys a “very small portion” of components from China and that it has the ability to substitute with other suppliers outside of China since it does not manufacture in the country.     ** Upscale home furnishing chain RH expects to reduce significantly the amount of goods sourced from China in its 2019 fiscal year to mitigate the impact of proposed new tariffs by the United States. ** Gentex Corp, a maker of aircraft windows and rear-view mirrors, said it expected cost increases of between $5 million and $8 million for the second half of 2018 related to its planned purchases of raw materials from China. ** Meat Processor Tyson Foods Inc cut its full-year profit forecast, citing the uncertainty in trade policies and increased tariffs that have hurt domestic and export prices of meat. ** Toymaker Hasbro Inc said it was moving more production out of China as a result of the tariffs, adding 30 percent of its manufacturing was now done elsewhere.  ** Danaher Corp, which develops technology for the dental, life sciences, diagnostics and environmental industries,  said it expected an earnings impact of 1 cent per quarter, and that it would look to modify manufacturing locations. ** The oil and gas producer Energen Corp said higher costs associated with ancillary services and steel tariffs could push its capital expenditure towards the high end of its previously announced range.  The company had estimated capital expenditure between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion for 2018.    ** U.S. pipeline operator Plains All American Pipeline said the tariffs were tolerable for the company, but it applied for exemptions. However, the company added that if it could not get the exemption or the required quota of steel, “it would just basically extend and delay growth.” Compiled by Manas Mishra and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china-factbox/factbox-impact-of-u-s-china-trade-tariffs-on-u-s-companies-idUKKBN1KT28L,2019-02-08,,Factbox - Impact of U.S.-China trade tariffs on U.S. companies

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Glencore (GLEN.L) said it would favour share buybacks over deal-making after it reported a 23 percent rise in first-half core earnings on Wednesday, just below analyst forecasts. The miner and commodities trader said its earnings for January-June were a record - building on 2017 full-year results it said were the best yet - but also that higher costs and lower prices for cobalt and other byproducts ate into profits. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said market conditions were likely to remain volatile. Many mining stocks have pared gains this year as metals markets weakened in response to trade tensions and uncertainty about Chinese demand .FTNMX1770. While other producers have warned of cost inflation, Glencore’s share price has come under additional pressure from its exposure to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) investigation. Days after it announced the investigation in July, Glencore said it would buy back shares worth $1 billion. On Wednesday it said further buybacks could be in the pipeline as the best way to reward shareholders. “Right now, buybacks may be the best returns we can get,” Glasenberg said on a conference call. “We just don’t see anything out in the market. We look opportunistically at M&A.” A strong rebound in Glencore’s share price last year from the commodity crash of 2015-16 was based on the company’s exposure to battery minerals and analyst expectations it would expand through deals. Its share price has retreated 17 percent this year. Glasenberg said the stock was undervalued, making buybacks a better option than increasing dividends. By 1500 GMT, Glencore shares were flat in London at 326.30 pence.  The company’s first-half adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $8.3 billion (6.4 billion pounds) missed a consensus forecast of $8.5 billion (6.6 billion pounds). Adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from its marketing division of $1.5 billion (1.2 billion pounds), up 12 percent, were in line.  Even allowing for geopolitical risk, many analysts also say Glencore is undervalued. But Sven Reinke, lead analyst for Glencore at Moody’s credit ratings agency, said legal uncertainties were “an obstacle for a potentially higher rating”. Glencore’s strong first-half results and low net debt of $9 billion - down 16 percent year-on-year - meanwhile, were in line with Moody’s expectations, he said. Apart from the risks associated with the DoJ investigation, Glencore faces higher costs in Congo because of a mining code, signed into law in June. Glasenberg said Glencore was reluctantly paying a higher rate royalty of 3.5 percent on gross revenue for copper and cobalt compared with 2 percent on net revenue previously. He said the industry was negotiating with the government and was also looking into legal options to overturn the new rules. Already, as Glencore this year ramped up copper operations in Congo, it said copper costs were higher than expected as by-products, such as cobalt CBD0 lost value. Cobalt’s use as a battery metal drove it to a peak of $98,000 per tonne in April, but it has since dropped to around $55,000 as Chinese production has created a surplus, analysts say.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A worsening row between Saudi Arabia and Canada about human rights threatens to undermine Riyadh’s foreign investment drive, a campaign already unsettled by a series of assertive political and diplomatic initiatives by the top oil exporter. The kingdom froze new trade and investment with Canada and expelled its ambassador this week, angered by a call from Ottawa for the freeing of arrested rights activists. Riyadh’s action may do some damage to the miniscule trade between the two countries - Saudi Arabia’s main state wheat buying agency, for example, has told grains exporters it will no longer buy Canadian wheat and barley. But the row raises question marks more broadly for the foreign investors Riyadh is counting on to become partners — to the tune of tens of billions of dollars — in the modernisation of the Arab world’s biggest economy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MbS, has made a strong pitch for foreign capital since rising to power in 2015, spearheading an ambitious economic and privatisation plan that included the future listing of oil company, Saudi Aramco. At the same time, he has sought to project Saudi power in an increasingly unstable Gulf, fighting a costly war in neighbouring Yemen, working to isolate sometime ally Qatar, and deepening a contest for regional influence with arch rival Iran. At home, an anti-graft campaign watched closely by foreign investors saw mass arrests of princes and top officials, including some businessmen with a high international profile. Critics said the spat risks slowing a faltering foreign investment drive. Inflows have slowed mainly due to years of low oil prices, but regional turbulence doesn’t help, they say. “Saudi Arabia simply cannot afford to alienate any other sections of the global community in the midst of its unpopular military engagement in Yemen, its indirect confrontation with Iran, “ prominent Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi wrote in the Washington Post. “Most importantly, Saudi Arabia’s economic transformation requires more friends than enemies.  MbS, he wrote, “needs to use ways and means that investors are accustomed to. If business executives fear a backlash over any possible criticism regarding their investment, the new vision of Saudi Arabia would be in serious jeopardy.” The kingdom insists it is justified in punishing Ottawa for its public appeal over the activists. A statement decried “a blatant interference in the Kingdom’s domestic affairs, against basic international norms and all international protocols.” Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Wednesday ruled out mediation and said Riyadh might take more measures. But for some, the Canada row strengthens an impression of impulsive policy-making. Germany, for example, found itself in hot water last year after appearing to criticise Riyadh’s ties with Lebanon — The kingdom reacted by moving to exclude German companies from government contracts. “It risks suggesting that policymakers may be backsliding on some of the recent measures to open up the economy, and that policymaking can be quite arbitrary. This might hurt investment into the country,” said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. New foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia plunged to a 14-year low in 2017, U.N. figures show, posing a blow to MbS’s plans to raise inflows of foreign capital sharply. In an effort to reverse that trend, Saudi Arabia last year hosted a Davos-style gathering of global investors in Riyadh, which MbS wants to make a regional financial powerhouse.  Within days, the euphoria of the event was dampened by the severity and secrecy of an anti-graft crackdown that saw the detention of high profile businessman including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the face of Saudi business to the outside world.  Prince Mohammed has defended last November’s crackdown, in which dozens of top business leaders and princes were detained, as necessary to combat “the cancer of corruption”.  Most detainees have been freed, and the authorities say they have said they plan to seize more than $100 billion (£77.7 billion) in assets. As a result, fund managers face a dilemma over Saudi Arabia, weighing attractive developments like privatisation and its classification as an emerging market by index provider MSCI from mid-2019, against the kingdom’s riskier impulses. “Against the growing and encouraging will to invest, the incident with Canada brings to light some of the issues that many investors see as inseparable,” said Christopher McKee, the CEO of PRS Group, a New York-based political risk consultancy. “The real issue isn’t so much about Canada as the way in which Saudi Arabia — in a world of mobile global capital — responds to international criticism.” In 2017, Saudi Arabia exported $2 billion worth of goods and services to Canada, less than one percent of Saudi Arabia’s total world exports of $220.07 billion, over the same period, while Canada’s exports were even lower. It is unclear how far the row will affect that activity, although the suspension of educational exchange programmes with Canada may affect thousands of Saudi students and cost Canadian universities millions of dollars in tuition fees. But for now, the mood is uncertain.  “For all businesses, we are entering dangerous territory that nobody really wants,” said Omar Allam, former Canadian diplomat and head of global consultancy Allam Advisory Group.

Saudi Arabia froze new trade and investment with Canada and expelled the Canadian ambassador this week in a retaliatory move after Canada publicly called for the release of arrested human rights activists. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that human rights should be promoted with respect for specific national customs and traditions.  “We have always said that the politicization of human rights matters is unacceptable,” Zakharova said.  “What one probably needs in this situation is constructive advice and assistance rather than criticism from a ‘moral superior’,” she said.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Ireland’s allure as a post-Brexit base for global financial firms has driven wages for some roles considerably higher with some positions offering 15 percent more than a year ago. Risk and compliance staff are particularly sought after, five of Dublin’s leading recruitment consultants told Reuters. Expertise in data science and newer technologies such as payment platforms is also in demand. And upwards pressure on wages could continue, with the central bank expected to approve more firms’ expansion plans in the coming months. While the higher pay is good news for workers, it can bring concerns for others. International financial firms only account for 2 percent of Irish jobs but have contributed to a sharp fall in the overall jobless rate. The central bank said last week the economy could overheat if capacity constraints emerge in the labor market. “Financial services is one of the areas seeing a definite spike in recruitment,” said Gerard Murnaghan, vice president at job search site Indeed. Its first-quarter postings were up 15 percent year-on-year. Although Ireland is widely considered the most vulnerable among EU members to any change in trade after Brexit, the financial services firms want to keep close access to clients after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019. Barclays, Legal & General Investment Management and Standard Life Aberdeen are among companies to pick Ireland as a post-Brexit base against stiff competition from rival centers including Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris. Robert MacGiolla Phadraig, Sigmar Recruitment’s chief commercial officer, said headhunted personnel were securing increases of between 10 percent and 15 percent, with front-office staff able to command the highest salary jumps.  Two thirds of employers surveyed by Sigmar and accounting firm EY earlier this year said they expected to give staff a pay rise in order to stop poaching by rivals, a practice already accounting for one in four hires. “We have reached a tipping point.. this is a talent crisis.” Local banks Allied Irish Banks (AIBG.I) and Permanent TSB ILOA.I both said they had lost staff to international rivals in recent weeks, hobbled by a salary cap and ban on share-based remuneration. Around a fifth of vacancies are being filled from abroad and more employers were also offering flexible working to help seal the deal.  Andrew Crawford, head of Experis Ireland, said applicants were coming from as far afield as Australia and the United States, after many had left following the 2008 financial crisis.    Ireland’s economy has grown faster than any other in the European Union for the last four years and is forecast to expand by 5.6 percent in 2018 against 2.1 percent for the region. The central bank last week said that fast growth could lead to “full capacity” in the economy with a risk it overheats and creates a boom-and-bust cycle. But Brexit also brings with it some uncertainty for Ireland. The central bank estimates that if neighboring Britain leaves the EU without a formal divorce agreement in March, it would shave 3.2 percent off economic growth over 10 years, and result in the creation of around 40,000 fewer jobs. An economy is considered at its limit when unemployment is so low that rising wages push up prices. Ireland’s jobless rate has dropped sharply in recent months to 5.1 percent, in part due to hiring at fund managers, insurers and foreign-owned banks. Irish business lobby IBEC said it has also seen steep pay rises for specialist positions in other areas such as Ireland’s large pharmaceutical and medical device sectors and for IT roles in retail. That was due to faster growth, rather than Brexit, however.   For those hiring, the wage rises can also bring problems. MacGiolla Phadraig said he was worried about the knock-on effect of defensive pay hikes on the competitiveness of the economy, which relies on foreign firms for almost one in ten jobs.  “The indicators are honestly quite worrying,” he said.      Estelle Davis, managing partner at Brightwater Executive, said she had seen a near-20 percent rise in financial services job vacancies, with almost a quarter of senior roles placed in the second half of 2017 directly attributed to Brexit. The buoyant economy and attractive market outlook was also encouraging ex-pat Irish workers to move back home, she said, particularly for more experienced hires, “someone who has 8 years plus senior management experience under their belt”. Returnees commanding higher wages nevertheless have to dig a little deeper to find a place to live as property prices, both commercial and residential heat up. While average house prices are still 20 percent below their property bubble peak, they rose 11 percent in Dublin in the year to end-May. Residential rents have already passed the previous peak. That, said Mark O’Donnell, a partner working in financial services in the Dublin office of Odgers, was the “biggest impediment” for some financial services firms. “Rents have sky-rocketed and this has already put off potential new entrants.” Additional reporting by Carolyn Cohn; editing by Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-ireland/brexit-jobs-feast-pushes-up-wages-in-irelands-financial-sector-idUKKBN1KT17H,2019-02-08,,Brexit jobs feast pushes up wages in Ireland's financial sector
2019-02-08,"GUMANTAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Moments after fleeing their home, dodging falling tiles and shattering glass, Indonesian farmer Haji Ruslan and his family stood in a field opposite and watched the house collapse. They survived, unlike 40 others in the area who residents say perished in Sunday’s 6.9-magnitude earthquake, but it is hard to feel fortunate as they wait for government help. “What is most important is that we’re alive. But we are out of hope and we are out of energy,” Ruslan said as his wife rummaged through the ruins to recover anything usable, such as ground mats, pillows, and kitchenware. The earthquake, which killed more than 130 people and drove thousands of tourists to leave, was the worst on record to hit the holiday island of Lombok. Just a week earlier another quake, of magnitude 6.4, rocked the same area, killing 17 people. The people of Gumantar, a rural hamlet surrounded by fields of corn and rice, rely on the generosity of family and friends from the rest of the island, as well as volunteer groups, to deliver essentials such as medicines, rice, instant noodles, and water.     Like thousands living in the farmland and hills of northern Lombok, they camp out under flimsy tarpaulin tents, too rattled by the huge quake and continuing aftershocks to sleep indoors. Most have nothing to return to, anyway. The one-lane road that winds through Gumantar, about 30 minutes’ drive east of the quake’s epicentre, is lined with the rubble of houses, village halls and schools. Toppled electricity poles have left villagers without power or mobile phone reception to communicate with emergency response teams or relatives. Water pipes poke out of the ground, cracked and leaking from the force of the quake. Women sit in tents by the roads, trying to ration out instant noodles and water. Playgrounds are a mess of twisted metal so children who would otherwise be in school chase each other around the fields and play with chickens. At night, portable generators power a few light bulbs shared among hundreds of evacuees. Residents speak of neighbours and family members who died in the disaster, but there is little emotion in their voices. Many remain in shock. “It’s like being in a dream. I can’t believe this has happened and everything is gone,” said Suniati, who goes by one name. “The community is still feeling the trauma of the earthquake and now the aftershocks.” Some residents, like Ruslan, are already to clear up the debris with their bare hands. Other men in the village use sledgehammers and ropes to bring down partially toppled walls so construction can eventually start anew. Many say they need more assistance to rebuild their homes and lives. “We don’t know how to start over in the future and we hope someone will help us,” Ruslan said.

2019-02-08,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - The star witness in the trial of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort faced tough questioning on cross-examination on Tuesday about a “secret life” that included an extramarital affair and stealing funds from his former boss.  Rick Gates, who served as a right-hand man to Manafort in his political consulting business for a decade, acknowledged maintaining a flat in London for the affair, inflating expense reports and a long list of other misdeeds. “In essence, I was living beyond my means,” the married father of four said from the witness stand in Alexandria, Virginia. “I’m taking responsibility for it. I made a mistake.”  Gates, who is cooperating with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, testified on Monday that he helped Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and evade hundreds of thousands of dollars in U.S. income taxes. Under questioning by defence attorney Kevin Downing on Tuesday, Gates also admitted he wrote a fraudulent letter to prospective investors in a movie project and that “it’s possible” he submitted to Trump’s inaugural committee personal expenses, which may have been improper. Downing sought to portray Gates as an inveterate liar, raising questions about whether he has been truthful with Mueller’s office even after cutting a plea deal in February. Under the deal, he admitted to helping Manafort evade taxes, violate U.S. lobbying laws, and conceal foreign bank accounts. In addition, he pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators.  “After all the lies you told you expect this jury to believe you?” Downing asked Gates, who responded that he did. “I’m here to tell the truth,” Gates shot back. “Mr. Manafort had the same path. I’m here.” Undercutting Gates’ credibility is the foundation of Manafort’s defence. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts containing tens of millions of dollars earned from work for Russian-backed politicians in Ukraine.  The charges largely predate the five months Manafort spent on Trump’s campaign. If convicted on all counts, Manafort could face eight to 10 years in prison based on federal sentencing guidelines, according to sentencing expert Justin Paperny. Gates made numerous damaging admissions during cross-examination. Gates admitted to stealing from Manafort, but he said he did not know how much money he took. Looking at a ledger listing nearly $3 million in transactions, he was unable to say which ones were legitimate and which ones he initiated with false expense reports. Downing also pressed Gates about creating “fake and phony” invoices to trigger payments to himself from Manafort’s accounts in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.   “Are they payments for your secret life?” Downing asked.     “No, they’re not,” Gates said. Prosecutors hope to wrap up their case this week. Manafort’s trial is the first on charges brought by Mueller’s office, who is also investigating whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Russian officials. Gates also worked on the campaign. During questioning by prosecutors on Tuesday morning, Gates said that Manafort had emailed him in late 2016 asking for the incoming Trump administration to consider tapping Federal Savings Bank Chief Executive Steve Calk for Secretary of the Army. Employees from Federal Savings Bank are expected to testify later this week. Prosecutors allege that the bank lent Manafort money based on fraudulent documents, and that Calk was named an adviser to the campaign and sought the Army post as part of a quid pro quo. Calk and Federal did not reply to requests for comment. Gate’s testimony was part of the prosecution’s effort to prove that Manafort was responsible for financial maneuverings that he and other witnesses have testified include filing false tax returns, defrauding banks in borrowing against real estate, and failing to report foreign bank accounts. One part of his testimony led to laughter in the courtroom.   “Not happy. I just saw this. WTF,” Manafort wrote to Gates in an email using a common shorthand to show exasperation after learning his projected tax payment for 2014. Gates said that he helped fabricate documents to convert some income to a loan to lower Manafort’s tax bill. Gates also acknowledged creating a fraudulent letter for movie producer and political operative Steven Brown, who pleaded guilty in April to participating in a scheme that defrauded investors of over $9.5 million involving false documents. Walter Mack, Brown’s lawyer, declined comment. Gates also testified on Tuesday how he and Manafort hid income earned for political work in Ukraine, explaining their efforts to set up companies in Cyprus so they could easily be paid by Ukranian businessman who held bank accounts there.  Prosecutors showed contracts laying out that Manafort would be paid $4 million a year in quarterly installments of $1 million, all channelled through Cyprus. The funds were logged as loans in order to meet later audits in Cyprus that required documentation of transfers between bank accounts. Gates testified they were not loans but compensation to Manafort. Reporting by Sarah N.

2019-02-08,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone over California’s raging wildfires on Tuesday, saying he was in constant contact with officials there, a day after blaming the state’s environmental policies for exacerbating the fires. One of the 17 major fires in California, dubbed the Mendocino Complex, became the biggest in state history on Tuesday, eclipsing a previous record set only eight months ago, as hot, windy conditions fanned the blazes in what Governor Jerry Brown has called a “new normal.”    The Mendocino Complex, made up of two fires, grew to nearly 300,000 acres (117,700 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles - and was expected to burn for the rest of the month, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said.  The blaze has surpassed the Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres (114,078 hectares) in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in southern California last December, destroying over 1,000 structures.  In the last two days, Trump has said California was letting water run into the ocean instead of using it to fight blazes and blamed California’s environmental policies for worsening the fires. The comments baffled California firefighters, who said they had more than enough water to douse the flames.  “We’re going to have to have some meetings about it because there are ... things you can do to mitigate what’s happening,” Trump said at a dinner in New Jersey. The fires have killed seven people, destroyed over 1,500 structures and displaced tens of thousands of people over the past month. Climate change is widely blamed for higher temperatures that have fueled wildfires in California, and as far afield as Portugal, Sweden and Siberia.  Temperatures in Northern California could reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) over the next few days, the National Weather Service said, making it easier for fire to spread. The Mendocino Complex has burnt 75 homes and forced the evacuation of 23,322 people. Firefighters are trying to keep fire out of communities like Nice, Lucerne and Clearlake Oaks. “It’s going into residences, backyards, farmland,” said Mitch Bosma, a spokesman with Cal Fire.   The fires are on track to be the most destructive in a decade, prompting Brown and Republican leaders such as state Senator Ted Gaines to call for thinning and controlled burns of forests to reduce fire danger - moves opposed by environmentalists who say they kill wildlife.  “We have to re-examine the way we manage our forests, the way we build our houses - how we build them, where we build them - and how much we invest in our fire protection services,” Brown said at a weekend news conference after touring an area destroyed by the deadly Carr Fire in Shasta County.

2019-02-08,"BEDMINSTER, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his administration was in contact with officials in California over wildfires burning in the state and would look into what could be done to mitigate fire danger in the state. “My administration is in constant contact ... with the local authorities and the state authorities,” Trump said at a dinner with business leaders at one of his golf resorts in New Jersey. “We’re going to have to have some meetings about it because there are ... things you can do to mitigate what’s happening.” Trump on Sunday approved a federal disaster declaration requested by Governor Jerry Brown for the fires, which now include the biggest in state history. Trump had said in tweets about the California fires that unspecified water diversions to the Pacific were making matters worse, but fire authorities insisted on Monday that they have ample water supplies to fight the devastating fires. On Tuesday, Trump praised the firefighters. “We’re deeply grateful to our incredible firefighters and first responders. They’re really brave people,” he said.

2019-02-08,"RIYADH/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Monday refused to back down in its defense of human rights after Saudi Arabia froze new trade and investment and expelled the Canadian ambassador in retaliation for Ottawa’s call to free arrested Saudi civil society activists. In her first public response to Saudi Arabia’s actions, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said, “Canada will always stand up for human rights in Canada and around the world, and women’s rights are human rights.” Riyadh on Sunday recalled its ambassador from Canada and gave the Canadian ambassador 24 hours to leave. The Saudi government also banned new trade with Canada, although it was unclear if it would affect existing annual Saudi-Canadian trade of nearly $4 billion and a $13 billion defense contract. The moves were a stern rebuke to Canada after the country on Friday expressed concern over the arrests of activists in Saudi Arabia, including prominent women’s rights campaigner Samar Badawi, and called for their release. Riyadh said that amounted to “a blatant interference in the Kingdom’s domestic affairs, against basic international norms and all international protocols.” Saudi Arabia’s sudden sharp response to criticism shows the limits of reforms by Saudi Arabia’s 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs its day-to-day government. He has launched a campaign of social and economic change, but has not eased the absolute monarchy’s total ban on political activism. In recent months Saudi Arabia has lifted a ban on women driving, but it has also arrested activists, including more than a dozen high-profile campaigners for women’s rights. In the fist comments by Washington since the dispute erupted, a U.S. State Department official said the United States had asked Riyadh for details on the detention of activists. “We continue to encourage the government of Saudi Arabia to respect due process and to publicize information on the status of legal cases,” the official added.     On Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir criticized Canada’s calls to free arrested civil society activists as a position built on “misleading” information.  The moves, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency, caught diplomats in Riyadh off guard. Both the Saudi and Canadian ambassadors were away on leave at the time. The kingdom will suspend educational exchange programs with Canada and move Saudi scholarship recipients to other countries, Saudi-owned Al Arabiya reported on Monday.  “It would be a shame for those students if they are deprived of the opportunity to study here,” Freeland told reporters. Neighbors and allies Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates said they stood with Riyadh, although they did not announce similar measures. Saudi state airline Saudia said it was suspending flights to and from Toronto, Canada’s largest city.  The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a loose association of the six Gulf Arab countries, the Arab League and Palestine also supported Saudi policy. But Qatar, which has been locked in a diplomatic rift with Saudi Arabia and other neighbors for over a year, said on its foreign ministry’s official Twitter account that the GCC secretary general’s statement did not represent its view of the situation. Crown Prince Mohammed, as heir to the throne, is in line to become the first Saudi king from a new generation after a succession of six brothers dating to 1953. He has ambitions to diversify the economy from oil exports and ease some social restrictions. But his reforms include no changes that would liberalize a political system that allows no public dissent. Amnesty International said the response to Canada showed that it was important Western countries not be intimidated into silence over Riyadh’s treatment of dissenters. “Instead of pursuing human rights reform, the government of Saudi Arabia has chosen to lash out with punitive measures in the face of criticism,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Campaigns. Riyadh has a record of responding robustly to Western criticism under Mohammed bin Salman. “Saudi Arabia is shooting itself in the foot. If you want to open up your country to the world, you don’t start expelling ambassadors and freezing trade with countries such as Canada,” said Joost Hiltermann, regional program director for the International Crisis Group. Saudi-Canadian trade consists largely of Saudi exports of petrochemicals, plastics and other products. In 2014, the Canadian unit of U.S. weapons maker General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) won a contract worth up to $13 billion to build light-armored vehicles for Saudi Arabia, in what Ottawa said was the largest advanced manufacturing export win in Canadian history. “We are waiting for Saudi Arabia to offer some more specifics on what they intend to do,” Freeland said when asked about the arms deal.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - England’s run to the semi-finals of the soccer World Cup and a scorching summer encouraged shoppers in Britain to spend more on food, drink and electric fans in July, but overall spending rose only slowly, according to a survey of retailers. Total retail sales values rose by 1.6 percent compared with July 2017, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, the weakest increase since February, excluding a fall in April which was distorted by the timing of Easter. “Last month’s sweltering temperatures kept shoppers focused on eating, drinking and keeping cool. Food sales had their best July in five years, while fans and cooling equipment flew off the shelves,” Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said. “However, total sales growth slowed as the heat laid bare the underlying weakness in consumer spending.” Non-food retail sales fell after rising in the previous two months, the BRC said. British shoppers, whose spending accounts for about 80 percent of the economy, have seen inflation rise faster than their pay for much of the past decade, although in recent months growth in earnings has turned positive in real terms. Separately on Tuesday, Barclaycard the credit and debit card division of Barclays, said its measure of consumer spending — which includes bars and restaurants — rose by an annual 5.0 percent in July , driven by shopping in supermarkets and an increase in fuel prices. Pub spending rose by nearly 17 percent, the most since April last year, helped by the World Cup. “It will be interesting to see if this strong level of growth continues,” Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said. “It’s clear that some consumers remain cautious about what’s to come with interest rates rising and overall confidence in household finances down slightly from June.” The Bank of England last week raised its benchmark interest rate for only the second time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago but stressed it would continue to raise borrowing costs only gradually.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) is prepared to win against Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google in China, its chief executive officer said on social media, amid rumblings the U.S. search engine giant was planning to re-enter a market it left eight years ago. Google’s search engine has been largely blocked in China since 2010, when the company exited the market over ethical concerns related to China’s strict censorship laws. Baidu dominates the domestic search engine space currently. Last week, Reuters reported Google was developing a censored version of its search engine to enter China, citing information from the firm’s employees and Chinese officials. The plans were earlier reported by the news website Intercept. In a posting on a private social media account on Tuesday, Baidu CEO Robin Li said if the two companies come head to head, “Baidu will win again”. “Chinese companies today have plenty of ability and confidence” to compete globally, he added. A Baidu spokeswoman confirmed the posting, which was shared by local media, was authentic.  Li was reacting to an article posted by state media outlet People’s Daily which said Google was welcome in China but must abide by local laws. The report has since been removed from People Daily’s Twitter and Facebook accounts. The article was originally circulated in another state media newspaper on Monday. Google declined to comment on the report and Li’s comments.  News of Google’s plan to return with a censored search app, criticized by human rights advocates as a blow to global free speech, comes at a time when China has stepped up scrutiny of business dealings involving U.S. tech firms including Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) amid intensifying trade tensions between the countries. Apple has removed hundreds of apps from its Chinese app store in the past year under increasingly strict censorship laws championed by Chinese president Xi Jinping.  Facebook, whose social media products are banned in China, is also making efforts to enter the restrictive market.  Last month, it said it was opening an innovation hub in the eastern city of Zhejiang, but only hours later the announcement of the project’s registration was pulled by regulators from a national database.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The pound sank to an 11-month low on Monday as comments by officials about Brexit stoked fears among investors that Britain could soon crash out of the European Union without securing a trade agreement. With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels. The saga over Brexit has come to dictate the pound’s fortunes as fears mount about the impact it would have on Britain’s trade. Investors are growing edgy about the currency’s outlook despite signs the economy is improving and the Bank of England raising of interest rates last week for only the second time in over a decade.  British trade secretary Liam Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter in Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet, said over the weekend the odds of Britain leaving the EU without agreeing on a deal stood at 60-40. “The voices forecasting a hard Brexit are becoming increasingly shrill. The FX market is slowly beginning to work out that these people might successfully torpedo a constructive solution,” said Commerzbank currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann in Frankfurt. Sterling on Monday fell to $1.2920, its lowest since July 19, before settling down half a percent on the day GBP=D3. It slumped 0.4 percent against the euro to 89.33 pence and was the biggest loser among major currencies against a broadly strong greenback. Speculators’ net short pound positioning slid to its highest level in 10 months, according to calculations by Reuters. Prime Minister May still believes that Britain will negotiate a good Brexit deal with the European Union, her spokesman said on Monday. But British voters’ approval of her handling of Brexit negotiations has fallen to 22 percent, according to pollster ORB International, the lowest figure it has recorded. If Britain fails to agree the terms of its divorce with the EU and leaves without a transition agreement, it would revert to trading under World Trade Organization rules. Most economists think that would cause serious harm to the world’s fifth largest economy as trade with the EU, Britain’s biggest market, would become subject to tariffs. Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU. On Friday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the chances of a no-deal Brexit had become “uncomfortably high”.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will aggressively enforce economic sanctions that is it re-imposing on Iran this week and expects the measures to have a significant impact on the Iranian economy, senior U.S. administration officials said on Monday. The so-called snapback sanctions would target Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading and other dealings, coal, industrial-related software and its auto sector.      The officials added that Trump was ready to meet with Iran’s leaders at any time in an effort to forge a new agreement with Tehran after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal in May. “There is no question that these financial sanctions are going to continue to bring significant financial pressure,” one official told reporters on a conference call.  Washington is due to bring back some of the measures against Iran that it suspended under the 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Some of the sanctions will come back on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT). The United States also plans to re-introduce potentially more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November. The renewed sanctions are part of the broader strategy under Trump aimed at cutting off the Iranian leadership’s access to resources. They are aimed at modifying Iran’s behaviour not bring about a “regime change” targeting President Hassan Rouhani, the officials added. The officials said the Iranian government’s handling of current social and labour protests in were concerning. “We are deeply concerned about reports of Iranian regime’s violence against unarmed citizens,” one official said. “The United States supports the Iranian people’s right to peacefully protest against corruption and oppression without fear of reprisal,” the official added. Trump “will meet with the Iranian leadership at any time to discuss a real comprehensive deal that will contain their regional ambitions, will end their malign behaviour and deny them any path  to a nuclear weapon,” one official said.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s exports are expected to have maintained solid growth in July despite new tariffs on billions of dollars of shipments to the United States, though the outlook has darkened as both sides raised the stakes in a trade conflict that has rattled financial markets. China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, following a proposal by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump for a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  The increasingly heated rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has rattled global markets worried about the impact on world trade and growth, with few signs either side is willing to make significant concessions.  Economists say that tariffs on $34 billion (26.16 billion pounds) of China’s exports to the United States, which went into effect on July 6, so far are not having a significant impact on overall Chinese exports.  July exports are predicted to have risen 10 percent year-on-year, according to median estimates from 37 economists, compared to 11.2 percent growth in June. While July’s forecast does not point to any sharp slowdown, economists do see headwinds mounting for China’s massive export sector.  “In addition to the tariffs impact, there might be some impact from front-loading of orders in previous months,” said Betty Wang, Senior China Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  “There will be some gradual impacts that could be seen over the following months, as this is the first month the tariffs were implemented.”  ANZ forecasts China’s exports rose 6.4 percent in July.  Markets will be closely watching the data on two-way trade between the world’s two biggest economies, as well as China’s trade surplus with the United States, a sore point in the trade relationship. The $34 billion of Chinese exports impacted by current tariffs amount to less than 7 percent of its total exports to the United States last year. Trump, however, has effectively threatened to slap tariffs on all of China’s shipments to the United States, the Asian giant’s largest export market.  China’s surplus with the U.S. swelled to a record in June as exports continued to rise, though signs of front-loading orders suggest the spike may have been a one-off. China’s imports are expected to have risen 16.2 percent in July, picking up from 14.1 percent growth in June.  The poll showed China’s overall trade surplus likely fell to $39.33 billion in July, from $41.61 billion in June, though that amount would be China’s second-highest surplus of the year.  There was no separate forecast on China’s trade surplus with the United States which has continued to grow even as its total surplus has narrowed over the last two years. China ran a $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which Trump has said is unacceptable.   Chinese officials have vowed to retaliate against any further U.S. measures, though they have also taken steps in recent weeks to shore up economic growth and have warned of the risks of job losses as a result of the trade war.   These measures could help mitigate a broader impact to economic growth, economists say.  “China has made it very clear it is going to boost infrastructure investment for the second half of the year,” said ANZ’s Wang. “That would support overall GDP growth momentum even though we see more downside risk and uncertainties around the export sector.”  Reporting by Elias Glenn; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-economy-trade/chinas-july-exports-growth-still-seen-holding-up-despite-u-s-tariffs-reuters-poll-idUKKBN1KR0H5,2019-02-08,"China's exports are expected to have maintained solid growth in July despite new tariffs on billions of dollars of shipments to the United States, though the outlook has darkened as both sides raised the stakes in a trade conflict that has rattled financial markets.",China's July exports growth still seen holding up despite U.S. tariffs - Reuters poll
2019-02-08,"ON BOARD THE AQUARIUS (Reuters) - Rescue ship Aquarius, which has picked up almost 3,000 migrants from the Mediterranean this year, will carry out rescue missions without waiting for orders from coastguards and will not return people to Libya, its search and rescue head said. “When we see there is a vessel in distress, with a high likelihood of people dying, we will go and rescue them immediately as per international maritime law,” Nick Romaniuk told Reuters on board the Aquarius. Over the last year coordination centres asking rescue vessels to go on standby or wait for clarification on certain things had added to the danger of people needing to be rescued, which is why they would no longer wait, he added. The 77-metre vessel, operated by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee, set sail from Marseille this week on its tenth mission of the year.  The ship will be patrolling between 25-30 miles from the Libyan coast, west of Tripoli, an area that is outside Libya’s territorial waters but inside the Libyan search and rescue region. International law states the country responsible for operations in an area has primary responsibility for disembarking rescue ships. Romaniuk said that while Aquarius would continue to abide by international maritime law, it would not be taking people back to Libya because it was not a safe place, putting it at odds with the wishes of the new Italian government. “Libya is still not recognised as a port of safety, so (we)will not be taking people back there, because... a rescue cannot terminate in a place which is not deemed a port of safety,” he said. “It has to continue for the time being to be European ports. But again, it’s not our decision to make, maritime authorities, they make that decision, but our red line will be not taking people back to Libya,” he said. In the past the Aquarius has waited for orders from the responsible authorities before moving ahead to rescue migrants aiming to reach Italy from Libya.  But Italy has toughened its stance since the new government, a coalition including the anti-immigrant League party, took office earlier this year. Interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, has spearheaded a policy to shut ports to charity ships that pick up migrants from overcrowded smugglers’ boats. He now wants as many as possible to be picked up by Libyan coastguards and returned. In June, the Aquarius picked up 629 migrants off the coast of Libya, planning to take them to the nearest European port - the usual practice with such rescue missions. But the Italian government asked the ship to go to Malta rather than Italy, triggering a standoff that drew in the European Union and France. Salvini has accused SOS Mediterranee and other charities of acting like a Mediterranean “taxi service” for the migrants. The Aquarius is one of a number of NGO-supported ships that have carried out rescue operations in the southern Mediterranean, alongside the Italian navy and EU-led missions. A rescue boat operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms this week rescued 87 migrants in the southern Mediterranean in international waters. More than 10,000 migrants have drowned in the region since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration.

2019-02-08,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s state media on Monday lashed out at the policies of U.S. President Donald Trump in an unusually direct attack, accusing him of “starring in his own carefully orchestrated street fighter-style deceitful drama”. Trump’s wish for others to play along with his drama is “wishful thinking,” the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper said in an editorial. The editorial said the United States had escalated trade friction with China, and turned international trade into “zero-sum game”. “Governing a country is not like doing business,” the editorial said, arguing that Trump’s actions imperiled the national credibility of the United States.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies is facing increased scrutiny in Britain because it is using an aging software component sold by a firm based in the United States, one of the countries where lawmakers allege its equipment could facilitate Chinese spying, sources told Reuters. The fact that the British misgivings stem in part from Huawei’s relationship with a U.S. company shows how trade wars and heightened national security concerns are making it harder for technology firms and governments to safeguard products and communication networks.  A report last month by a British government oversight board charged with analyzing Huawei equipment said it had found technical and supply chain “shortcomings” which exposed the country’s telecoms networks to new security risks. One of those is due to Huawei’s use of the VxWorks operating system, which is made by California-based Wind River Systems, said three people with knowledge of the matter, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing details which were not made public in the report.  The sources said the version of VxWorks being used by Huawei will stop receiving security patches and updates from Wind River in 2020, even though some of the products it is embedded in will still be in service, potentially leaving British telecoms networks vulnerable to attack. “Third party software, including security critical components, on various component boards will come out of existing long-term support in 2020, even though the Huawei end of life date for the products containing this component is often longer,” the July report, which did not name VxWorks, said. U.S. and Australian lawmakers have said Huawei’s products can be used to facilitate Chinese espionage operations, an allegation the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment has repeatedly denied. All three sources said there was no indication that the VxWorks mismatch was deliberate. There is also no suggestion that the software itself represents a security risk.  Reuters was not able to establish which Huawei products were involved or what steps the Chinese company was taking to address the issue. A spokeswoman for Wind River Systems said she was unable to comment on Huawei, but said the company often helped customers upgrade to newer software versions. “Wind River offers migration routes and paths for its customers, which should be pretty well known and understood in the industry,” she said. A Huawei spokesman declined to comment on specific issues in the report but said the company would address any areas for improvement which were raised by British authorities.     “Cyber security remains Huawei’s top priority, and we will continue to actively improve our engineering processes and risk management systems,” he said. While the United States and Australia have moved to restrict the use of its gear due to security concerns, Huawei has been deepening ties with Britain, supplying broadband equipment to its largest telecoms provider, BT Group (BT.L), and mobile networks for wireless giant Vodafone Group (VOD.L).     Consultant Edward Amoroso, a former chief security officer at AT&T, said Huawei’s experience in Britain showed the challenges of securing international supply chains.  Although no one should dismiss Huawei as a supplier solely because of its geographical location, reliance on software that is going out of support is a legitimate concern, Amoroso said. “I don’t care if it’s from China, Indiana or the moon, it speaks badly for them,” he added.     The globalized nature of the technology industry has come under increasing scrutiny as countries seek to limit the use of equipment from nations they regard as adversaries. In the United States, the Pentagon is working on a “do not buy” list to block vendors who use software code originating from Russia and China, and Moscow has had problems implementing a data storage law without relying on foreign technology. By contrast, London says it effectively addresses any security issues presented by the use of Huawei products as part of Britain’s critical national infrastructure by having the equipment reviewed by staff at a special company laboratory. This is overseen by British government and intelligence officials who report annually on its work. In addition to the issue with VxWorks, this year’s report also cited technical issues which limited security researchers’ ability to check internal product code.   Many in the cybersecurity industry say efforts to bar equipment or software on grounds of nationality are futile because of the deeply inter-dependent nature of the global technology business.  “There’s a real dilemma for policy makers, for politicians,” said Robert Hannigan, former director of Britain’s GCHQ spy agency and now executive chairman for Europe at cybersecurity services firm BlueVoyant. “How do we find a way of taking advantage of foreign technology in a way that we don’t think compromises our security? That’s a really difficult balance to get.” Editing by Jonathan Weber and Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-huawei-security-britain-usa/huawei-in-british-spotlight-over-use-of-u-s-firms-software-idUKKBN1KQ003,2019-02-08,,Huawei in British spotlight over use of U.S. firm's software
2019-02-08,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - North Korea and the United States on Saturday sparred over an agreement reached at a landmark summit in June for the Asian country to end its nuclear program, as Washington called for maintaining sanctions pressure against Pyongyang, which in turn said it was alarmed by U.S. intentions. The discord at a regional forum in Singapore was the latest reminder of the difficulties that have long impaired efforts to negotiate an end to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, despite commitments made at an unprecedented summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the city state less than two months ago. “The DPRK stands firm in its determination and commitment for implementing the DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement in a responsible and good-faith manner,” North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the ASEAN Regional Forum, using his country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “What is alarming however is the insistent moves manifested within the U.S. to go back to the old, far from its leader’s intention,” he said. Ri made the statement after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had left the Singapore conference centre for Indonesia having pressed Southeast Asian nations to maintain sanctions on North Korea until it gives up a nuclear weapons programme that now threatens the United States. At the June 12 summit, Kim, who is seeking relief from tough sanctions, committed to work towards denuclearisation, but North Korea has offered no details on how it might go about this. Pompeo suggested on Friday that continued work on weapons programmes by North Korea was inconsistent with Kim’s commitment to denuclearise. On Saturday, he nevertheless said he was optimistic a North Korean denuclearisation could be achieved although it “would take some time.” Ri said North Korea had made goodwill gestures, including a moratorium on nuclear tests and rocket launches and the dismantling of a nuclear test ground. “However, the United States, instead of responding to these measures, is raising its voice louder for maintaining the sanctions against the DPRK and showing the attitude to retreat even from declaring the end of the war, a very basic and primary step for providing peace on the Korean peninsula,” he said. On Saturday, Pompeo said Washington took very seriously any relaxation of U.N. sanctions, calling out Russia for possibly violating a U.N. resolution by issuing work visas to North Korean workers. “I want to remind every nation that has supported these resolutions that this is a serious issue and something that we will discuss with Moscow,” he said. “We expect the Russians and all countries to abide by the U.N. Security Council resolutions and enforce sanctions on North Korea.” Russia has denied a report by the Wall Street Journal that said Moscow was allowing thousands of fresh North Korean labourers into the country and granting them work permits in a potential breach of U.N sanctions. Russia’s ambassador to North Korea also denied Moscow was flouting U.N. restrictions on oil supplies to North Korea. According to a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Friday, North Korea has not stopped nuclear and missile programs in violation of United Nations sanctions. Although Pompeo has been leading U.S. negotiating efforts with North Korea, he had no formal meeting with Ri in Singapore. However, at a group photo session on Saturday, he walked up to the North Korean and shook hands and exchanged words and smiles.  He told Ri: “We should talk again soon,” the State Department said.  “I agree, there are many productive conversations to be had,” Ri replied, according to the State Department. Pompeo later tweeted that it had been “a quick, polite exchange” and there had been the opportunity to deliver a letter for Kim Jong Un from Trump.  U.S. Ambassador Sung Kim handed Ri the letter, which the State Department said was in return for one from Kim to Trump that the White House said was received on Wednesday. The State Department has not said what is in Trump’s letter to Kim.  Trump posted a note on Twitter on Thursday thanking Kim for returning the remains of U.S. soldiers from the Korean War and saying he looked forward to seeing Kim again “soon”, although the White House said no second meeting was currently planned. It is not the first time since the summit that North Korea has appeared to offer a more negative impression of the progress of talks with the United States that Washington. Following a trip to Pyongyang in July, Pompeo spoke of progress, but as soon as he had left the country North Korea accused him of “gangster-like” diplomacy, casting doubts about the future of the discussions. Even so, Trump has continued to hail progress, emphasizing the halt in bomb and missile tests and North Korea’s return of purported American war remains. A senior State Department official sought to play down Ri’s statement, saying it was to be expected. “Much of the intervention was positive and that’s an improvement from the past,” the official said. “We’re building a relationship with North Korea after years of difficult relations.” Since U.S. talks with North Korea resumed this year, Pompeo has primarily engaged with Kim Yong Chol, a top North Korean party official and former spy agency chief, not Ri. Pompeo told a Senate committee hearing on July 25 that North Korea was continuing to produce fuel for nuclear bombs in spite of its denuclearisation pledge. On Monday, a senior U.S. official said U.S. spy satellites had detected renewed activity at the North Korean factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair proposed that a third-party mediator join talks with a trade union representing its Irish pilots who went on strike for a fourth time on Friday before wider stoppages planned around Europe next week. The Forsa trade union, which had called for such mediation, welcomed Ryanair’s response and said it would recommend it to pilots. Europe’s biggest airline by passenger numbers agreed to recognise unions for the first time late last year but negotiations since have faltered.  It has seen strikes in some of its biggest markets including Ireland, Spain and Italy as it struggles to reach collective labour agreements with trade unions. Around a quarter of Ryanair’s 350 pilots based in Ireland have taken part in a series of one-day strikes and a number picketed in the rain outside Dublin airport on Friday morning. Ryanair has limited the damage from the Irish strikes so far and said passengers on the 20 flights it cancelled from the 300 that flew in and out of Ireland on Friday were either put on another flight or refunded. However it faces greater disruption next Friday with Irish pilots joining colleagues in Sweden and Belgium on strike, and Ryanair braced for action in Germany and the Netherlands on the same day. So far that has forced Ryanair to cancel 6 percent of the more than 2,400 flights it has scheduled across Europe next Friday - a further 20 to and from Ireland, 22 in and out of Sweden and 104 in Belgium. Ryanair shares were down 0.2 percent at 12.98 euros by 1455 GMT, near two-year lows and well below the level hit in December when it shocked the markets by ending 32 years of refusing to recognise unions. While the Irish airline has signed recognition deals in some markets, it has failed to do so in others and not yet reached any collective labour agreements. “This is part and parcel of life in aviation when you recognise unions,” Ryanair Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs told Ireland’s Newstalk radio station, pointing to years of wrangling over pay and conditions at rival Lufthansa. “There is going to be disruption, it will be small, we will manage it... We are making progress around the rest of Europe, strikes can be part of that process, they are not helpful, but we will get collective labour agreements in place over the autumn in our key markets.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Jason Neely/Keith Weir",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ryanair-unions-ireland/ryanair-proposes-mediator-for-irish-pilots-union-talks-idUKKBN1KO1KW,2019-02-08,Ryanair proposed that a third-party mediator join talks with a trade union representing its Irish pilots who went on strike for a fourth time on Friday before wider stoppages planned around Europe next week.,Ryanair proposes mediator for Irish pilots union talks
2019-02-08,"GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian and wounded at least 220 others at protests along the Gaza border on Friday, Gaza health officials said, as diplomats sought to secure a durable ceasefire deal. Over four months of weekly Friday border protests that began on March 30 have reduced in intensity lately but organisers have vowed they would continue until Israel lifts economic sanctions on the coastal enclave. The Israeli military said troops had responded with “riot dispersal means” and had operated “according to standard operating procedures,” a term that refers to the use of accurate live fire, after some Gazans broke through the border fence and attacked troops with firebombs and an explosive device. It said some 8,000 Gazans had participated in the protests at five locations along the border. A Gaza hospital official said of the 220 hurt, 90 suffered wounds as a result of the live fire. The dead was a 25-year-old man. At least 156 Palestinians have been killed in the protests and one Israeli soldier was shot dead by a sniper in Gaza. Israel has lost tracts of farmland and forests to fires set by kites and helium balloons laden with incendiary material and flown over from Gaza.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a trip to Colombia next week, his office said, and is due to consult with top ministers on Sunday on proposals to end the tensions, Israeli media has reported. Some top ranking Hamas officials arrived in Gaza from Egypt late on Thursday to discuss the possible deal but no details have been given. The delegation included the group’s deputy chief, Saleh al-Arouri, exiled by Israel in 2010. “The delegation will (consult) ... over issues of concern for the Palestinian people, foremost in achieving the national reconciliation and ending the Gaza blockade,” Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said before the delegation arrived. More than two million Palestinians are packed into the narrow strip which suffers deep economic hardship. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders, citing security concerns over Hamas and other militant groups. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border. Israel, the United States and other Western countries regard Hamas as a terrorist organization. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008, the last of them in 2014. On Sunday, Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said on Twitter that he held “productive meetings” with Egyptian officials in efforts to de-escalate Gaza tensions and resolve humanitarian issues. “The devil is always in the details but we are #movingforward in the interest of #peace,” Mladenov said. Israeli media said Israel was seeking a long-term commitment from Hamas to end the protests and halt the launch of the incendiary balloons and kites that have destroyed thousands of acres of farmland and forests, in exchange for lifting restrictions on the passage of goods and travel for Gaza. Speaking about the Hamas delegation’s visit, Hamas political official Hussam Badran said: “We will achieve a national unity of the highest level in order to break (Israel’s) blockade... We want the blockade to end once and for all.”    Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi; Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-israel-palestinians/israeli-troops-kill-palestinian-at-gaza-border-protest-ceasefire-efforts-continue-idUKKBN1KO2G0,2019-02-08,,"Israeli troops kill Palestinian at Gaza border protest, ceasefire efforts continue"
2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - President Emmerson Mnangagwa urged Zimbabweans to unite on Friday after he was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe’s removal from power, but the opposition leader insisted he had won and pledged to challenge the result. Sounding a conciliatory note after six people were killed in a post-election crackdown by the military, Mnangagwa vowed to be president for all Zimbabweans and declared his rival Nelson Chamisa would have a vital role to perform in Zimbabwe’s future.  He also said the army’s use of violence in Harare after the vote would be investigated independently, although he also suggested he understood the resort to military force, remarking that police had been overwhelmed by opposition demonstrators. The army’s clampdown and opposition claims that the vote was rigged revealed the deep fissures in Zimbabwean society that developed during the four-decade rule of Mugabe, when the security forces became a byword for heavy-handedness. In an apparent effort at soothing those rifts, Mnangagwa, 75, said: “To Nelson Chamisa, I want to say: you have a crucial role to play in Zimbabwe’s present and its unfolding future. Let us both call for peace and unity in our land.” But Chamisa, 40, told reporters Mnangagwa’s ruling Zanu-PF had authorised the army crackdown on opposition supporters because it knew it had lost the election, the first since the army removed 94-year-old Mugabe from office in November. “We are going to explore all necessary means, legal and constitutional, to ensure that the will of the people is protected,” Chamisa said. Voting passed off relatively smoothly on the day, raising hopes of a break from a history of disputed and violent polls, but the violence in Harare darkened the political atmosphere. After three days of claims and counterclaims, 75-year-old Mnangagwa - a former spy chief under Mugabe - secured victory. He polled 2.46 million votes against 2.15 million for Chamisa, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) announced in the early hours of Friday morning. “This is a new beginning. Let us join hands,” Mnangagwa said on Twitter. “We won the election freely and fairly, and have nothing to hide or fear.” His bid to repair the image of a nation known for repression and economic collapse was further hurt by a police raid on the headquarters of Chamisa’s Movement for Democratic Change and the dispersal of journalists before a Chamisa news conference. Mnangagwa won 50.8 percent of the vote, official figures showed, just over the 50 percent mark needed to avoid a runoff. The delays in announcing the presidential results and the narrow margin of victory fuelled the opposition accusations of rigging.  He now faces the challenge of persuading the international community that the army crackdown and lapses in the election process will not derail his promise of political and economic reforms needed to fix a moribund economy. European Union observers on Wednesday cited several problems, including media bias and mistrust in the electoral commission. Its final assessment will be crucial in determining whether Zimbabwe can return to the international fold. The United States, which is weighing whether to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe, said it was reviewing data by its own and other election observers and urged all sides to act peacefully. “We encourage all stakeholders and citizens to pursue any grievances peacefully and through established legal channels, and we encourage all political leaders to show magnanimity in victory and graciousness in defeat,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.  Chamisa, who accused the commission of trying to rig the vote, said it should release “proper and verified” results. He told a news conference he would pursue all legal means necessary to challenge the result, which had serious legitimacy problems. He declined to divulge the specific action that his party would take to challenge the election outcome. Christopher Dielmann, economist at Exotix Capital, said the immediate priorities for Mnangagwa would be to continue on the path of restoring the economy and boosting exports, helped by international engagement. “By many accounts, this imperfect election delivered sufficient transparency, especially in relation to past results in the country, that should allow re-engagement to occur relatively smoothly.” Charles Laurie, head of country risk for Verisk Maplecroft, said for international investors, Zimbabwe’s election was less about an MDC or a ZANU-PF win, and far more about electing a legitimate, stable and trustworthy leader.  “There is a bleak pall over Mnangagwa’s win,” he said. South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa urged all Zimbabweans to accept the poll results. Harare’s traffic was thinner than usual. Water cannon and anti-riot police remained outside MDC offices, a reminder of the clashes between opposition and the security forces this week. “We are not happy with this election but what can we do?” said Patience Sithole, a cleaner in Harare. “We don’t trust these observers, we don’t trust these courts. I’m not sure things will ever change in Zimbabwe.” The Herald newspaper, which acts as a government mouthpiece, hailed the election as reflecting the will of the majority and admonished the opposition, decrying “a culture of rabble-rousing and sham protests of alleged rigging whenever a party loses.” Additonal reporting by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and James Macharia in Johannesburg; editing by Ed Cropley, Angus MacSwan, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-zimbabwe-election/zimbabwes-mnangagwa-promises-probe-of-post-election-killings-urges-unity-idUKKBN1KO0JF,2019-02-08,,"Zimbabwe's Mnangagwa promises probe of post-election killings, urges unity"
2019-02-08,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Europe’s heatwave gripped Spain and Portugal on Friday, as governments checked for forest fires, a Budapest game reserve fed its animals iced snacks and a Finnish supermarket invited customers to sleep over to stay cool. Summer has brought drought and forest fires as far apart as Britain and Greece, where scores of people died, and Sweden warned of forest fires on Friday. Hot air from North Africa has caused the most severe heatwave since 2003 in Iberia. (Europe's drought) tmsnrt.rs/2M4kIvA Portugal’s Civil Protection agency reported 426 firefighters were putting out or checking fire alerts in the north and centre. Fires typically flare late in the day when the weather is hottest. Spanish and Portuguese temperatures will remain above 40 Celsius at least until Sunday, and could rise 2 or 3 degrees. That could push them above Europe’s record high of 48C, set in Athens in 1977. The record in both Spain and Portugal is just over 47C. In Portugal, local media said temperatures could beat Death Valley in California, one of the world’s hottest places. “Lisbon will be one of the hottest cities in the world this weekend because it’s 10 in the morning right now and the weather is already way too hot,” said Ana Pascoal, 56, a cleaner at a high-end restaurant. Parts of Portugal’s parched southern Alentejo region were forecast to hit 47C. The country is on alert to prevent a repeat of its worst fires in history last year when 114 people died. Francois Jobard, a forecaster for Meteo France, said the hot air mass from North Africa could cause temperatures in Portugal and Spain of 45C until Saturday and perhaps hotter. Last month, wildfires killed at least 91 people in Greece. “I don’t want to say anything bad but yesterday, while I was watching TV, I thought the same could happen here but I’m praying it doesn’t,” said Eva Stigliano, a Greek tourist visiting Portugal for the third time. “I’ve been here in the summer but it has never been this hot.” Lisbon’s temperature reached 43C. Spanish authorities issued a heatwave warning for most of central Spain, expected to last until Sunday with temperatures of over 42C in some parts of Andalusia and Extremadura. Two men died of heat-stroke in the southeastern region of Murcia, Cadena Ser radio station reported on Wednesday. A branch of the K-Supermarket chain in Helsinki’s Pohjois-Haaga district has invited 100 customers to sleep in its air-conditioned store on Saturday. Finland’s August average is 19C but temperatures approached 30C this week and few have air-conditioning at home. A store manager told the state broadcaster that beer sales would end at 9 p.m. (2000 GMT) as usual though snacks would be available. In Germany, state rail operator Deutsche Bahn said it was offering free water to passengers in case of delays and would keep air conditioning running on its trains even when they are empty.

Martina Ihrig, an office worker from Germany, said she was delaying visiting the Eiffel Tower with her three daughters until evening. “It’s too hot to visit it now,” she said. In Switzerland, mountain railways reported booming business as city dwellers fled to the Alps. Fishery authorities in the canton of Zurich were combing creeks to rescue fish from suffocation as streams dry up or oxygen levels plunge.  The Swiss army let soldiers wear shorts and T-shirts instead of standard uniforms. The small Budakeszi game reserve outside the Hungarian capital Budapest said it was helping its animals cope with the heat with iced fruit and a diet with less meat and more nutrients.  In another sign of drought, water levels in the Danube River in Budapest are about to fall to a level that will expose a small outcrop called Dearth Rock that is almost always underwater, the National Water Management Authority said. In Scandinavia, temperatures hit records until a few days ago. In Sweden July was a record month and wildfires burnt in parts of the country.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA/GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - An Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is likely spread over tens of kilometres and poses a high regional risk given its proximity to borders, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday. Four people have tested positive for Ebola in and around Mangina, a town of about 60,000 people in North Kivu province, 100 km (62 miles) from the Ugandan border, the health ministry said. Another 20 people died from unidentified haemorrhagic fevers in the area, mostly in the second half of July.   Just last week, a previous outbreak on the other side of the Central African country was declared over after killing 33 people. “It would appear that the risk, as we can surmise for DRC, is high. For the region it’s high given the proximity to borders, particularly Uganda,” said WHO’s emergency response chief Peter Salama. “We are talking about tens of kilometres but I stress that this is very preliminary information at this stage.” Ebola is believed to be transported long distances by bats and can find its way into bush meat sold at local markets and eaten. Once present in humans, it causes haemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. Over 11,300 people died of an epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.  This is the vast, forested central African country’s 10th outbreak since 1976, when the virus was discovered near Congo’s Ebola river in the north. That is more than twice as many epidemics as any other country. The response to Congo’s previous outbreak was considered a success despite the 33 deaths, as the use of a vaccine made by Merck (MRK.N) helped contain the virus.  The kind of Ebola in the latest outbreak has been confirmed as the Zaire strain that the Merck vaccine protects against, Congo’s health ministry said late on Thursday. This should allow health officials to again use what has become the greatest weapon against Ebola epidemics to date.  Still, this outbreak poses new challenges. Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of conflicts over land and ethnicity stoked by decades of on-off war and this could hamper efforts to contain the virus. About 1,000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people. Officials in Mangina rushed on Thursday to educate people about the risks of spreading the virus in a town that one local nurse told Reuters had no ambulance service.  Agents were deployed to warn people about the need for strict hygiene and the local radio station passed on messages about how to act, a local journalist said by phone. “There is a great panic among the local population following the appearance of the Ebola epidemic,” said a nurse by phone, who asked not to be named.  The hospital where she works has already seen three people die recently of haemorrhagic fever. The hospital was awaiting help from the Red Cross to bury the bodies properly, she said.  Meanwhile, Uganda has set up screening at the land border it shares with Congo and at its Entebbe international airport.   “Ebola is highly infectious so we have put in place measures,” Uganda’s Junior Health Minister Sarah Achieng Opendi told Reuters. An international delegation including officials from the United Nations, the World Bank and the WHO is in Beni, 30 km from Mangina.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK’s top share index climbed on Friday as cyclical stocks recovered thanks to a respite from trade and Brexit worries, while results from Mondi and RBS were well-received. The FTSE 100 .FTSE index rose 1.1 percent to 7,659.10 points, though it suffered its first weekly loss in a month. This week, fresh concerns over global trade marred sentiment after U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up the pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. “(Trade) is certainly a concern among other concerns around the world. It’s not one a global investor can particularly do much about - we’re already seeing the impact in a number of companies’ earnings,” said James Clarke, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. Certain industries are hurt more than others, he said, but a lot of those stocks have already been hit. “Is that an opportunity or not? We’re listening very carefully to this quarter’s conference calls to see what is actually happening in these businesses,” said Clarke. While the Bank of England raised interest rates as expected on Thursday, it signalled it was in no rush to raise them further before Britain’s exit from the European Union next year, for which there is no clear plan. However, these broader worries eased briefly as traders instead focused on earnings updates from paper and packaging firm Mondi (MNDI.L) and lender RBS (RBS.L). Overall, analysts say the earnings season in the UK has been good. “The distraction of the reporting season has been especially welcome in the UK,” said Ian Williams, strategist at Peel Hunt. “After a very difficult start to the year, it now looks like consensus forecasts have been pitched at a sufficiently conservative level to allow a few ‘proper’ upgrades to come through, in addition to those that simply reflect foreign exchange movements,” he wrote in a note. Shares in RBS (RBS.L) jumped 3.1 percent and touched their highest level since the end of June after the bank reported half-year results. Not only was attributable profit much better than the loss expected by analysts, but the bank announced its first dividend in a decade. “RBS continues to take small steps, rather than large strides, but even so is demonstrating something of a return to health,” Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said in a note.   RBS’ rise helped financials add the most points to the FTSE, while materials stocks also bounced back. Mondi (MNDI.L) gained 7.9 percent after its results beat expectations. However, shares in IAG (ICAG.L) were at the bottom of the index, down 2.2 percent after the British Airways owner’s results came in below expectations. Strikes by French air traffic control weighed on IAG’s second quarter operating profit. Results were also in focus among mid-cap stocks as shares in William Hill (WMH.L) tumbled 8.1 percent. The betting company posted a half-year loss and warned of more charges as it revamps its retail business due to tougher regulation at home.

2019-02-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The British Navy’s flagship amphibious assault ship HMS Albion arrived in Tokyo on Friday extending Britain’s naval presence in East Asia to four months as London deepens military ties in a region it considers vital to global security and economic prosperity as it exits the European Union. The 22,000-tonne warship, the largest Royal Navy ship to visit Japan in 26 years, docked in Tokyo where it will conduct ship tours for the general public, Japanese officials, and defence industry executives. An onboard contingent of around 120 Royal Marines will train with Japanese Self-Defence Force troops including joint landings with new Japanese marine units on a beach near Mount Fuji. “Our visit here is a testament to the global reach of the navy, a very global Britain and of course is aimed at building at our bonds with Japan,” Captain Tim Neild, the Albion’s commander, said at a briefing after his ship docked at a wharf surrounded by construction cranes building the athletes’ village for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.   As Asia drives global economic growth and Brexit approaches, Britain has sought closer economic ties with the region’s biggest economy, China, but also deeper security ties with Japan. With its ally the United States, Japan represents the strongest check on China’s influence in the region, including its growing control over the contested South China Sea through the construction of island bases on submerged reefs.  Japan for its part wants to cooperate more with other potential allies beyond the United States as part of a bigger regional security role as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government steps back from a post World War Two pacifist constitution that has barred the use of military force overseas. London and Tokyo have been holding regular meetings between their foreign and defence ministers since 2015, and are also discussing cooperation to jointly develop new military kit. At a press briefing before the Albion’s visit to Tokyo, Paul Madden, the British ambassador to Japan, said the backdrop to growing cooperation was “the tensions on the Korean peninsula as well as wider challenges to the rules-based international system”.       The Albion was earlier docked at nearby Yokosuka, which is home to the USS Ronald Reagan, the U.S. Seventh Fleet’s carrier, and has patrolled waters around North Korea as part of operations to enforce U.N. sanctions meant to persuade Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes. The Albion, which replaced the British frigate HMS Sutherland, will hand over to HMS Argyll, another frigate, when it leaves East Asia around the start of next month for naval exercises in the Middle East. Its journey west will take it through the South China Sea, a major waterway for sea-borne global trade that is claimed by China and in part by several Southeast Asian nations. The United States has challenged Beijing’s control there by sending war ships close to Beijing’s island bases through seas it says must remain open to international traffic. “The United Kingdom subscribes to the rules based system, as does Japan and many other countries, and we are committed to upholding that system wherever we operate on the high seas,” said Neild when asked about China’s maritime activities in the South China Sea and East China Sea.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Less than a third of 800 UK business leaders surveyed have carried out contingency planning on Brexit, the Institute of Directors (IoD) said on Friday. Forty-nine percent were not intending to do any planning and, of those, 49 percent thought Brexit would not affect them while 42 percent were waiting until the relationship between Britain and the EU becomes clearer.  Internationally-minded firms that trade with both EU and non-EU countries were more active in contingency planning, the survey showed. “Many companies are still unprepared for Brexit, and it’s hard to blame them,” said Stephen Martin, IoD director general. “When it comes to knowing what to plan for and when, firms have been left in the dark,” he added in a statement. “As long as no-deal remains a possibility, it is essential that the government steps up to the plate and provides advice on preparing for such an outcome. We therefore urge them to speed up publication of the technical notices.” Prime Minister Theresa May’s government has said it will set out the notices on no-deal preparations in August and September.

2019-02-08,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A threat to impose sanctions on Russian sovereign debt transactions is one of the biggest financial weapons that the U.S. can deploy against the Kremlin, but Moscow’s slide down the investment league table in recent years means the move will not pack the punch it once would have.  A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at penalising Russia for interference in recent elections, something the Kremlin strongly denies, as well as for its annexation of Crimea and actions in Syria. The sanctions would need to be passed by the full House and receive President Donald Trump’s signature, but if they do become a reality it would mark a new low in relations between the former Cold War foes. They would also hit the energy sector, Russian uranium imports and a host of oligarchs, but it is a move to ban purchases of any new Russian sovereign debt going forward that has raised the most eyebrows. It is considered one of Washington’s most potent tools because it would effectively freeze the Russian government out of international borrowing markets, creating a similar scenario to that faced by Argentina for a decade until 2015, following a default and a U.S. court ruling against it.  The measure may create fewer problems for Russia though than were faced by Argentina, given Russia has one of the lowest debt levels in the world and nearly half a trillion U.S. dollars in reserves thanks to huge oil and gas export revenues. Russia is also used to belt-tightening during difficult times and has sharply cut back on issuing dollar debt after the Ukraine crisis. In addition, Russia features less in emerging market investors’ portfolios than it did even five years ago.  “Russia is still an overweight for most people at the moment, but this isn’t going to kill the fund industry by any means,” said Peter Kisler, an emerging market debt manager at North Asset Management. As overseas borrowing by the Russian government and companies has shrunk, so has the country’s weighting on bond indexes that are used by investors.  For instance, Russia comprises just 3.6 percent of JPMorgan’s EMBI Global “hard currency” sovereign bond index, compared to 9.0 percent in 2007. GRAPHIC: Russia's weighting in global bond indexes png - tmsnrt.rs/2K7y48s On the CEMBI corporate debt index, it amounts to 5.0 percent, down from 14 percent 10 years ago.  So in theory at least, it would be relatively easy for investors to bypass Russia in portfolios, even if its debt is a current favourite due to scarcity value and the country’s rock-solid payment credentials. Mike Cirami, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance in Boston said the weighting of Russian debt was now small enough and the premium it offers was low enough for investors to easily be able to jettison it if needed. “If all you were was an EMBI investor, you could forget that Russia exists in my opinion, and you could manage just fine and not have any problems outperforming (the benchmark EMBI Global Diversified),” he said. Russia has a higher 7.6 percent weight in the index for emerging local currency bonds, the GBI-EM. That’s up from 1.5 percent in 2007, but off the 10 percent index-maximum it hit during the 2012-14 oil boom. But while rouble government debt, known as OFZ, has been popular with investors, Deutsche Bank analysts last week highlighted a decline in foreigners’ share of the market. Central bank data showed foreign holdings at 28 percent in June, the lowest since February 2017. GRAPHIC: Foreign investors have sold Russia's rouble denominated debt - reut.rs/2KaAeUM It is by no means certain that U.S. sanctions will be deployed as many reckon the Treasury will hold off from such aggressive measures. “I would say that our base case is that Russian sovereign would be a last-resort sanction, whereas they are likely to use the corporate sector to target individuals and companies from a sanctions perspective,” said Shamaila Khan, head of emerging markets fixed income at AllianceBernstein in New York. “The fact is, once you embark on a sanctions path you just don’t know where it ends,” added Khan, who said unpredictability could weigh on Russian asset prices generally. The developments nonetheless focus attention on how Russian markets have stagnated relative to those in other developing economies. Its importance over the last decade has declined for bond as well as equity investors. Russia’s weighting on MSCI’s emerging equity index, a benchmark for almost $2 trillion in cash, has dwindled to 3.3 percent from over 10 percent in 2007. China’s weight, meanwhile, has almost doubled in that period to nearly 30 percent. That reflects Russia’s own stagnation, says Renaissance Capital’s global economist, Charles Robertson. He notes the three biggest companies in Russia’s equity index are the same ones as back in 2007 - Gazprom, Sberbank and Rosneft. All are state-controlled. “At one point, we were asking whether Russia’s GDP was going to catch up with California’s,” said Robertson  “That is certainly not going to happen now.” And unless there is a shake-up in the Russian political order and economy, these commodity-reliant companies can expect to hang on to their top positions, he predicted. Contrast this with the United States, where the top rankings  change every decade or two. China is replicating that dynamic with technology giants such as Tencent and Baidu taking over from previous companies that topped the rankings, including state-run oil firms and banks. Within MSCI’s emerging equity index too, technology firms have displaced commodity producers as the biggest firms. Russia’s Gazprom was the biggest company in the index back in 2007. Today it does not make the top 10.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s verbal attacks on the media run the risk of triggering real violence against journalists, the U.N. rapporteur for freedom of expression said on Thursday. In a joint statement with Edison Lanza, who holds the same post at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, David Kaye said Trump’s tirades against the media violated the basic norms of press freedom. “These attacks run counter to the country’s obligations to respect press freedom and international human rights law,” they said. “We are especially concerned that these attacks increase the risk of journalists being targeted with violence.”     Trump frequently brands stories and outlets he dislikes as “fake news”. Last week CNN said one of its White House correspondents was excluded from a Trump event, prompting a complaint from the White House Correspondents Association. The freedom of expression experts said Trump’s attacks on the press were designed to raise doubts about verifiable facts, and that he and his administration had sought to undermine reporting on potential illegal conduct. “But he has failed to show even once that specific reporting has been driven by any untoward motivations,” Kaye and Lanza said.  They also urged the administration to stop suing journalists to discover their sources and to stop using the Espionage Act to pursue whistle-blowers. There have been at least two prosecutions of people leaking to journalists under that law.

2019-02-08,"JERUSALEM/AMMAN (Reuters) - Israel and Jordan said on Thursday that their forces had killed Islamic State insurgents who approached their borders after being squeezed out of southwestern Syria by the army of President Bashar al-Assad. In a nod to his battlefield gains, Israel described victory by Assad, who is on a last push to restore his rule after more than seven years of civil war, as a fait accompli that could calm the Golan Heights. The strategic plateau divides Israel and Syria, old foes, and saw decades of stable stand-off before the Syrian rebellion. Meanwhile, in a major change to the pre-conflict 2011 status quo, Russian military police began deploying on the Syrian-held Golan and planned to set up eight observation posts in the area, the Defence Ministry in Moscow said. After weeks of intensive Russian-backed bombing, Syrian forces have seized the lush farmland where the Yarmouk River flows that was once controlled by a group affiliated to Islamic State known as the Khaled Bin Walid Army.   The Israeli military said it carried out an air strike on the Golan on Wednesday night, killing seven insurgents it believed were from the Khaled Bin Walid Army and en route to attack an Israeli target. Separately, the Jordan military said it had clashed with encroaching Khaled Bin Walid Army fighters for 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday, killing an unspecified number of them.  “We applied rules of engagement and members of the Daesh (Islamic State) gang were forced to retreat inside Syria,” an army source told Jordanian state news agency Petra.  Assad’s sweep of southwest Syria drove hundreds of thousands of refugees toward Israel and Jordan, alarming both. As tensions peaked last week, Israel shot down a Syrian warplane that it said had strayed into the Israeli-occupied Golan and warned Assad’s Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements against trying to deploy on the Syrian-held side.  But Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman sounded more upbeat on Thursday as he described an Assad win as a given.  “From our perspective, the situation is returning to how it was before the civil war, meaning there is a real address, someone responsible, and central rule,” Lieberman told reporters during a tour of air defence units in northern Israel. Asked whether Israel should be less wary of possible flare-ups on the Golan - much of which it seized from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognised abroad - Lieberman said: “I believe so. I think this is also in Assad’s interest.” There was no immediate Syrian government response to the border clashes reported by Jordan and Syria on Thursday.  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group, confirmed fighting between Assad’s forces and Islamic State on the Syrian-held Golan, which also abuts Jordan.  In Moscow, the Russian Defence Ministry said its deployment of military police on the Syrian-held Golan was aimed at supporting a decades-old U.N. peacekeeper presence. It said the new Russian posts would be handed over to the Syrian government once the situation had stabilised. Lieberman said that, for there to be long-term quiet between Israel and Syria, Assad must abide by a 1974 U.N.-monitored armistice that set up demilitarized zones on the Golan.  Lieberman reiterated Israel’s demand that Iran not set up military bases against it in Syria, nor that Syria be used to smuggle arms to Hezbollah guerrillas in neighbouring Lebanon.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays’ (BARC.L) second-quarter pretax profits almost trebled in the absence of hefty payouts for legal problems but the British lender faced further questions about the role of investment banking in its strategy.  Barclays reported pretax profit of 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) for the April-June quarter, up from 659 million pounds a year ago and higher than the 1.46 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by the bank. The improved profitability showed years of restructuring starting to pay off for Barclays, one of the big five that dominate the banking industry in Britain. But little improvement to income at its investment bank brought the performance of that part of the business back into focus after questions raised by activist investor Edward Bramson.  “It is the first quarter for some time with no significant litigation or conduct charges, restructuring costs, or other exceptional expenses which hit profitability,” American CEO Jes Staley said in a statement.  Income in the investment bank rose just 1 percent in the first half of 2018, largely due to outperformance in the equities division, where revenues rose by 30 percent bolstered by strong sales of derivatives products. Barclays shares initially rose on Thursday but were down 0.9 percent by 0930 GMT against a 1.7 percent fall in the broader STOXX Europe banks index .SX7P. “If you could invest in Barclays excluding the investment bank it would be a great investment. Sadly you cannot – and it now looks like 2018 is shaping up to be another strong start followed by weak second half,” analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW said. The Barclays investment banking performance compared favorably with European peers which have struggled in recent months, but paled in comparison with U.S. peers which have reported their best revenues since 2011. Staley faces a call to cut back the trading arm of the investment bank from Bramson, the New York financier who disclosed a surprise 5 percent stake in Barclays in February. Bramson has argued in presentations to his investors that the lender should pare parts of the investment bank that do not directly serve corporate clients.  “We are in conversations with Bramson, I have met him, and we look forward to meeting him post these results, but he has not outlined what his strategy is to us,” Staley told reporters on a conference call. Barclays’ core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 13 percent, just above analysts’ average forecast of 12.9 percent.  That number had been depleted by fines and misconduct costs and was a source of concern for investors in recent months, fuelling speculation the bank might need to raise fresh capital. The bank said it would pay an interim dividend of 2.5 pence per share, above analysts’ expectations and above the 1 pence paid at the same time a year ago. Barclays still faces a raft of problems that threaten to dent its numbers in future.  The UK’s Serious Fraud Office is seeking to resurrect its prosecution of Barclays over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors, and the bank faces a host of investigations into interest rate manipulation and its conduct in foreign exchange trading. Barclays separately announced on Thursday it is taking a minority stake in MarketInvoice, a financial technology firm which allows small businesses to borrow money secured against invoices to their customers.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange said on Thursday that more customers were clearing euro-denominated contracts, as it sought to quell concerns that rival Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) was beginning to steal significant market share. Euro clearing has become a Brexit battleground as some EU policymakers want it moved from London, where LSE dominates, to the single currency area after Britain leaves the bloc next March, threatening the City’s role as a global financial centre. Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) said this week it was shifting a large part of its new euro derivatives clearing from London to Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt. “We have seen no discernible change in customer behaviour,” David Warren, LSE Group chief financial officer, told reporters on Thursday when the bourse announced first-half results that sent its share price sharply higher. LSE’s clearing unit LCH, which clears about 90 percent of euro denominated contracts globally, saw a 34 percent increase in customers clearing euro swaps in the first half, Warren said. Deutsche Boerse was simply getting a “small slice of a growing pie”, he added. The LSE reported a 21 percent rise in first-half adjusted operating profit to 480 million pounds as its clearing, capital markets and information services businesses grew strongly.     That topped the 459 million pounds in a company supplied consensus forecast from 13 analysts. The LSE’s total income rose 12 percent to 1.06 billion pounds versus an estimate of 1.05 billion.         LSE shares were up 1.9 percent at 4,441 pence at 0801 GMT, making them the second biggest percentage gainers on London's blue-chip index .FTSE.  The LSE said it was activating contingency plans in case Britain crashes out of the European Union next March without a transition deal. These include applying for an EU licence in Amsterdam for its Turquoise pan-European share trading platform. “The complexity and the lack of clarity of the application of a hard Brexit may decrease the effectiveness, or applicability of some of these contingency plans,” the bourse operator said in a statement.  A hard Brexit could “adversely affect” its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it said. The exchange also has a clearing subsidiary in Paris, but Warren said it was not applying for an extension of its licence there to clear interest rate swaps, the contracts that Deutsche Boerse is attracting from Deutsche Bank. Warren said LCH in London will apply instead to the EU for “recognition” to continue serving customers in the EU from London after Brexit. Customers don’t want clearing to be split between different clearing houses, which would bump up costs, Warren said. “It’s never going to be about one currency, one product,” he added. Goldman Sachs veteran David Schwimmer started his new job as LSEG chief executive this week facing the task of helping the 300-year-old institution to navigate Brexit.  He replaces Xavier Rolet who left last November after a boardroom battle involving activist hedge fund TCI, headed by Christopher Hohn. Asked if he would be meeting with Hohn, Schwimmer told reporters: “I look forward to meeting with all of our shareholders.” Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru, editing by Huw Jones and Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-lse-results/london-stock-exchange-dismisses-frankfurt-euro-clearing-threat-idUKKBN1KN0PM,2019-02-08,"The London Stock Exchange said on Thursday that more customers were clearing euro-denominated contracts, as it sought to quell concerns that rival Deutsche Boerse  was beginning to steal significant market share.",London Stock Exchange dismisses Frankfurt euro clearing threat
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British insurer Aviva (AV.L) on Thursday posted a 2 percent dip in first-half operating profit, hit by disposal costs, weaker profits in Canada and a significant increase in weather related claims. Cold winter weather in Europe, higher claims in Canadian auto insurance and the costs of exiting Spain and Taiwan all weighed, although a beat on underlying profits helped the company to maintain its plan to return more capital to shareholders.  Operating profit in the six months to the end of June was 1.44 billion pounds ($1.89 billion), it said in a statement, compared with 1.47 billion pounds a year earlier. Excluding disposals, operating profit rose 4 percent, Aviva said. Operating earnings per share rose by 4 percent to 26.8 pence, beating some analyst estimates, and the company said it remained confident of reaching its goal of greater than 5 percent growth in operating earnings per share in 2018. KBW analyst Greig Paterson told clients in a note that he forecast growth of 8 percent in operating EPS, helped by the use of disposal proceeds to finance bolt-on acquisitions, share buybacks and paying down debt. “Stripping these out, it is not clear that there is underlying economic growth,” he added, flagging a ‘market perform’ rating and target price of 495 pence a share. While operating EPS and underlying operating profits beat consensus, life insurance sales of 603 million pounds and the company’s Solvency II ratio of 187 percent both lagged, he said. At 0840 GMT, shares in Aviva were down 0.4 percent at 493.4 pence. Aviva also said it would pay an interim dividend of 9.25 pence a share, up 10 percent from the prior year and beating a company supplied consensus estimate for 9.18 pence a share. “During these choppy market conditions, it is reassuring that Aviva’s results are consistent, dependable and growing,” Chief Executive Mark Wilson said. “Aviva remains financially strong with a capital surplus of 11 billion pounds,” he added, although this was down from 12.2 billion pounds a year earlier.

2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it believed this week’s election in Zimbabwe had generally proceeded in an orderly fashion, and that it hoped all sides can ensure the country’s stability following post-vote clashes. China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe, which it has been keen to maintain following the ouster of former president Robert Mugabe last November in a de facto coup that brought his former ally Emmerson Mnangagwa to power. Zimbabwe police said three people were killed in Harare on Wednesday as soldiers dispersed stone-throwing opposition supporters who accused the ruling party of trying to rig Monday’s presidential election. Even before the violence, European Union observers questioned the conduct of the presidential and parliamentary vote, the first since Mugabe’s forced resignation after nearly 40 years in charge of the southern African nation. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had sent observers to the election at Zimbabwe’s invitation. “According to their observations on the ground, the level of participation of Zimbabwe’s people was high, the election was generally peaceful and orderly,” Geng said. He added they had noted reports on events that had happened after the election took place, alluding to the protests. China hopes that all sides can put the country’s interests first and work hard to ensure the country’s peace, stability and development, Geng said.

2019-02-08,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Dozens of people were injured when a packed Aeromexico-operated Embraer jet crashed right after takeoff in Mexico’s state of Durango on Tuesday, but authorities said most were not seriously hurt and there were no fatalities.  The mid-sized jet was almost full, with 103 people including two infants and four crew members on board, when it crashed at about 4 p.m. local time (2100 GMT), authorities said. Passengers and crew jumped to safety before the plane was engulfed in flames.  Passenger Jackeline Flores told reporters the plane crashed shortly after taking off in heavy rain. She and her daughter escaped from a hole in the fuselage as the aircraft filled up with smoke and flames, she said.  “A little girl who left the plane was crying because her legs were burned,” said Flores, who said she was Mexican but lived in Bogota, Colombia. Flores said her passport and documents burned in the fire. “I feel blessed and grateful to God,” she said.  TV images showed the severely damaged body of the plane after it came to rest in scrubland and a column of smoke rose into the sky. The plane had barely taken off when it felt like it was hit by a strong air current, another passenger told network Televisa. Durango Governor José Rosas Aispuro also said a gust of wind rocked the plane before it plunged suddenly, citing air traffic control at the airport. The plane’s left wing hit the ground, knocking off two engines, before it came to a halt 300 meters (328 yards) from the runway, he told a news conference. Passengers were able to escape on the plane’s emergency slides before it was engulfed in flames, he said. The pilot was the most severely hurt but was in a stable condition.  Grupo Aeroportuario Centro Norte, the airport operator, also attributed the crash to bad weather, citing preliminary reports.  Aeromexico said in a statement: “We deeply regret this accident. The families of all those affected are in our thoughts and in our hearts.” Alejandro Cardoza, a spokesman for the state’s civil protection agency, said in an interview that around 85 people had suffered mostly light injuries and that the fire had been put out. The civil protection agency said 37 people were hospitalized, while the state health department said two passengers were in a critical condition. “Many managed to leave the plane on foot,” Cardoza said. The head of Mexico’s civil aviation agency, Luis Gerardo Fonseca, said it could take months to know the cause of the crash. He told Televisa the plane’s voice and data recorders would be recovered once rescue efforts were completed.  The United States will send two people to assist the Mexican investigative team, a U.S aviation official said. Flight number 2431 was an Embraer 190 bound for Mexico City when it crashed, Aeromexico said on Twitter. A spokesman for the Mexican airline declined to disclose the passenger list or the nationalities of those on board. Among the passengers was Chicago-born priest Esequiel Sanchez of the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, according to a statement by the Archdiocese of Chicago. A U.S. embassy spokesman said he did not currently have confirmation of whether any American citizens were involved in the incident.  Aeromexico has not had any fatal crashes in the past 10 years. A Mexican pilots association said last year there were 66 accidents and 173 incidents in Mexican aviation, saying the number was “worrying” and calling for more supervision of flying schools, more funds for maintenance and oversight of fleets, and shorter flying hours for pilots. The Embraer 190 was involved in one fatal crash when a Henan Airlines flight overshot a Chinese runway in 2010 and another in Africa in 2013 when a LAM Airlines pilot deliberately crashed the plane during a hostage-taking incident, according to a summary by the Aviation Safety Network.  Embraer has delivered more than 1,400 E-Jets.  Aeromexico leased the 10-year-old aircraft involved in Tuesday’s incident from Republic Airlines in the United States in 2014, according to data on Planespotters.net. Embraer said late on Tuesday it had sent a team of technicians to the scene of the accident and stood ready to support the investigation. The aircraft, the serial number of which was 190-173, was delivered in May 2008, the company said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump appealed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end an investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016  election, drawing a rebuke from his fellow Republicans in Congress who said the probe must go on. It was Trump’s most direct call for his top U.S. law enforcement officer to shut down Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s criminal investigation and Democrats promptly accused the president of trying to obstruct justice. Trump’s remark coincided with the start of the trial this week of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort on charges arising from Mueller’s inquiry. In a series of tweets, Trump called a “TOTAL HOAX” the idea his campaign worked with Moscow, which Mueller is examining. “This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further,” he said. Since his surprise election in November 2016, Republican Trump has chafed at any suggestion that the Russian interference might have helped him win the White House. And while he has long maligned Mueller and the investigation, his tweet on Wednesday was an extraordinary bid to try to influence the course of an inquiry hanging over his presidency. In any case, Sessions recused himself from the investigation in March 2017 and does not have the power to stop it.  The White House said the tweet was not an order to Sessions and that Trump was expressing his frustration with the length of the probe. “It’s not an order. It’s the president’s opinion,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing. She denied that Trump was trying to obstruct the probe. “He’s fighting back,” she said.  Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump was expressing an opinion long espoused by his team. Some U.S. lawmakers said shutting down the investigation early would be a mistake. Trump also said that Mueller is “totally conflicted.” He provided no evidence that the team led by Mueller, a Republican who was appointed by a Republican, is biased against him. Peter Carr, spokesman for the special counsel’s office, declined to comment on Trump’s Twitter post. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department had no comment. Trump has steadily attacked Sessions for recusing himself. Sessions cited his role as a senior adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign and appointed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to oversee the investigation. Rosenstein in turn appointed Mueller and is the person with the authority to fire him. Mueller, a Republican and former FBI director who served a Republican and Democratic president, has broad support in Congress, where Republicans control both chambers. Six Republican senators going into a vote on Wednesday disapproved of Trump’s tweet calling for an end to the probe. “They ought to let them conclude their work. What they’re doing is something that is important and we support and I don’t think any effort to truncate that or somehow shut it down early is in the public’s best interest,” said Senator John Thune. Senator Orrin Hatch said he did not think Sessions had the power to end the probe and it would be unwise to do so. An element of Mueller’s investigation includes whether Trump or anyone in the campaign tried to obstruct justice. The New York Times reported last week that Mueller’s office was examining negative tweets and statements by Trump about Sessions and former FBI Director James Comey. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Moscow meddled in the 2016 campaign to try to tip the vote in Trump’s favour. Moscow has denied such interference, and Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign or any obstruction of justice.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said after Trump’s tweet, “It’s clear to me he’s very worried about it and he wants to prevent it any way he can.” In April, the committee approved legislation to protect Mueller but Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said there was no need to advance the bill because he did not believe Trump would fire Mueller. Some legal analysts said Wednesday’s tweet alone was not enough to bring an obstruction of justice charge but it could be used to establish a pattern of conduct revealing Trump’s intentions. “It is a piece of evidence. It is part and parcel with the other 94 things the man has done that show obstruction of justice,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former prosecutor who was part of a team that investigated President Bill Clinton.  Jens David Ohlin, a law professor at Cornell University, said the tweets would likely not be seen as an order to Sessions, but as “Trump venting his continued frustration with the fact that he can’t control the Russia investigation.” Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Susan Cornwell; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld, Jan Wolfe and Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry, Mary Milliken and Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-russia/trump-urges-attorney-general-to-end-russia-probe-right-now-idUKKBN1KM542,2019-02-08,,Trump urges attorney general to end Russia probe 'right now'
2019-02-08,"BIRMINGHAM (Reuters) - England collapsed in the final session on day one of the first test against India, losing six wickets for 67 runs as they limped to the close on 285 for nine on Wednesday.  England captain Joe Root top scored for the hosts with a fluent 80 runs but his run out from a brilliant throw by Virat Kohli sparked their demise.  England, who were 216 for four when Root was dismissed, lost their next four wickets for 27 runs, with spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who ended the day with four wickets, inflicting the bulk of the damage for the visitors.  Electing to bat after winning the toss, England had made a solid start to their innings, reaching 83 at lunch in a morning session that offered some early help to the fast bowlers.  The confident start almost threatened to unravel in the afternoon before Root and Jonny Bairstow steadied the ship with a 104-run partnership for the fourth wicket.     In England’s 1,000th test match, opener Keaton Jennings was dropped on nine, but moved to 42 before being bowled by Mohammed Shami, while Bairstow looked confident on his way to 70 runs off 88 deliveries. India’s seam attack struggled to extract much help from the pitch and the visitors’ one success before lunch was a ripper from off-spinner Ashwin that removed Alastair Cook for 13. The 33-year-old had struck two handsome boundaries off Umesh Radav but in Ashwin’s second over he played forward to a ball that drifted in towards middle stump before straightening past Cook’s outside edge and clattering off stump. After Cook’s dismissal, Shami continued to look dangerous for India — beating Jennings with a beauty in the 21st over.  Shami took the wicket of Jennings midway through the afternoon while Dawid Malan could only score eight before becoming the Indian medium pacer’s second victim of the day.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British factories lost momentum in July and manufacturers were their most downbeat in nearly two years, a survey showed on Wednesday, but the data was unlikely to deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates on Thursday. The weak domestic demand highlighted in the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) added to other signs of a largely sluggish British economy facing an uncertain exit from the European Union in less than eight months’ time. The PMI slipped to its second-lowest level since late 2016 at 54.0, down from 54.3 in June and weaker than a median forecast of 54.2 in a Reuters poll of economists. Rob Dobson, an IHS Markit director, said the sector — which accounts for 10 percent of the British economy — had provided no meaningful boost to economic growth so far this year. “The financial markets still seem to have an interest rate increase nailed on for August,” he said, referring to Thursday’s policy announcement by the BoE.  “However, if the combination of weaker growth and a softening of pipeline cost pressures at manufacturers is mirrored in the larger service sector, the Bank of England’s decision will be far from unanimous and they may even yet find some cause for pause,” he said. The PMI for Britain’s services industry is due to be published on Friday but is likely to be shown to the BoE’s policymakers ahead of their rate decision. A rise in the BoE’s benchmark rate above its post-financial crisis levels is widely expected on Thursday, even though Britain’s economy is growing only slowly. Sterling and government bond prices were little changed by Wednesday’s PMI survey. Governor Mark Carney says the economy, with unemployment at a four-decade low, will generate too much inflation unless they raise borrowing costs gradually over the coming years. But several private economists have challenged the need for a rate hike now, pointing to inflation that is below the BoE’s forecasts and no clear acceleration in wages, as well as the risk of a disruptive, no-deal Brexit. Elizabeth Martins, an HSBC economist, said Wednesday’s PMI was unlikely to deter the BoE from raising rates on Thursday, but there were clouds on the horizon other than Brexit.  “While UK manufacturing export orders appear to have held up better in July, the poorer numbers from across the Channel may pose some risks going forward,” she said, also pointing to uncertainty about global trade. A leading economic think tank said the BoE should raise rates but also said it would make a U-turn if Brexit talks sour or trade tensions with the United States escalate. IHS Markit’s gauge of manufacturing output fell to its lowest level since March of last year and growth in new orders was the weakest since June 2017, even as export demand rose. Manufacturers were their least confident in 21 months, reflecting concerns about Brexit and the value of the pound, and there was another warning sign in the first fall in two years in the production of intermediate goods, which are used in the process of manufacturing other products. But the survey also showed the steepest rise in prices charged by factories since February as input costs continued to grow strongly, albeit a bit more slowly than in June.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - A rescue deal for British retailer House of Fraser was thrown into doubt on Wednesday after C.banner cancelled planned fundraising for its deal to become a majority shareholder in the department store. House of Fraser said talks about other possible sources of investment were ongoing, and that an update would be given when appropriate. C.banner, an international retailer, had agreed in May to buy a 51 percent stake in House of Fraser but earlier on Wednesday it cancelled a planned share placing that would have funded the deal and announced a profit warning. “In light of C.banner’s announcement... House of Fraser is in discussions with alternative investors and is exploring options to obtain the required investment on the same timetable,” the 169-year-old retailer said in a statement. C.banner, a major retailer of mid-range to premium footwear brands in China, bought famous London toy shop Hamleys in 2015. House of Fraser had agreed to close stores as part of the rescue deal, and in June creditors approved a restructuring plan which would see 31 of its 59 stores close early next year and pave the way for the loss of 6,000 jobs. A string of UK retailers have either gone out of business or announced plans to close shops in recent months as they struggle with subdued consumer spending, rising labour costs and higher business property taxes as well as growing online competition.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Next got a boost from Britain’s hot summer with a 2.8 percent rise in second-quarter sales but the fashion retailer  does not see the warm glow lasting, sticking to forecasts that indicate little growth for the rest of the year. “We over-performed in the second quarter as a result of the weather; we think some of that will be sales pulled forward form August,” Chief Executive Simon Wolfson said on Wednesday.  “Some of the stock we were planning to sell in August has already sold.”  He said the warm weather had been good for summer fashion, but that was not a reason in itself to change its outlook. Shares in Next, which has been a standout performer among struggling British retailers largely due to the success of its online range, fell 6 percent in early trading. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon said hopes had been high that the sunny weather would have led to higher profit expectations, but Next said it would rather wait and see how the remainder of the summer goes. “This seems fair enough, but it will have left a few wondering if the best summer in years isn’t enough to upgrade profits, then want is?” he said. Next’s positive performance followed a strong first quarter for the fashion and homewares retailer against an easy comparative, which led it to upgrade forecasts in May.  It expects full-price sales to grow by 2.2 percent for the year to January 2019, and group profit before tax to dip slightly to 717 million pounds at the centre of its guidance. Wolfson said the 4.5 percent rise in first-half sales implied there would be little growth in rest of the year.   “The second half is slightly bigger, so (sales) will be slightly up, but not dramatically,” he said in an interview. Growth continued to be driven by Next’s online operation, with sales up 12.5 percent in the 12 weeks to July 28. Sales in its retail stores fell 5.9 percent in the quarter,  an acceleration of the 4.8 percent decline seen in the first quarter. Wolfson said the online operation had suffered growing pains. “In our online warehouses, we are beginning to get close to capacity and as warehouses get close to capacity they become crowded and a little bit less efficient,” he said. “We are investing in new capacity so we don’t expect there will be a crunch, but it does mean in the first half there has been some operating inefficiencies.” The higher warehouse costs would largely offset a 4 million pound boost to profit from a successful clearance, Next said.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, apologised on Wednesday for causing “concern and anxiety” by hosting a 2010 event at which another speaker was reported by a newspaper to have compared Israeli policy to Nazi policies. Corbyn is wrestling with accusations that his party has been tolerant of anti-Semitism among some of its members. Last month Jewish newspapers said Labour would represent an “existential threat to Jewish life in this country” if they won power. The Times newspaper reported that Corbyn hosted a Holocaust Memorial Day meeting at which a Jewish survivor of Auschwitz, Hajo Meyer, who died in 2014, repeatedly made comparisons between Israeli policy and Nazism. Before his death, Meyer criticised Israel’s policies towards Palestinians. Reuters has not been able to verify what was said at the event. The Times carried a photograph of Corbyn at the event with Meyer, and his office did not dispute his involvement.    “Views were expressed at the meeting which I do not accept or condone,” Corbyn said in a statement. “In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject. I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused.” The Campaign Against Antisemitism, a charity which seeks to combat and educate people about anti-Semitism, said it did not believe Corbyn’s apology. Corbyn has previously apologised for what he called “pockets” of anti-Semitism in the party and promised to stamp them out. He has responded to protests by meeting with Jewish community leaders reassuring Jewish people they are welcome in the party.

2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s presidential and parliamentary vote was peaceful and orderly and opened the door to strengthen the country’s democracy, election observers from the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) bloc said on Wednesday. The southern African nation held its first election since Robert Mugabe was forced to resign after a November de facto coup in which President Emmerson Mnangagwa and opposition leader Nelson Chamisa were the main contenders for power.

2019-02-08,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s opposition accused the election commission on Tuesday of deliberately delaying results of this week’s vote to favour the ruling party, reporting irregularities in the first poll since the removal of Robert Mugabe in a November coup. Even though the election passed off peacefully, several water cannon trucks patrolled outside the central Harare headquarters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) as its red-shirted supporters danced in the streets. Some local results from parallel parliamentary elections have been declared but the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) has yet to produce any figures from Monday’s presidential vote. ZEC chief Priscilla Chigumba said the presidential result may not be ready until Saturday. Former MDC finance minister Tendai Biti and ZESN, the main domestic election monitor, said one in five polling stations - more than 2,000 in all - had not physically posted tallies on their doors, as required by law. That omission gave room for the ZEC, which ZESN and the opposition have accused of bias, to manipulate the results in favour of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party, Biti said. “There is a deliberate delay in formally announcing results,” Biti told a news conference, characterising it as “interference with the people’s will”. ZESN and other civil society groups were preparing a legal challenge to force the results into the open, Biti said.  ZEC said there was no rigging or cheating in the vote, whose credibility is vital in Zimbabwe’s attempts to emerge from the pariah status and economic decay into which it sank in the latter half of Mugabe’s nearly four decades in charge. However, ZEC did not explain the failure by the polling stations to post results. The poll is a two-horse race between 75-year-old Mnangagwa, a long-serving security chief who took over after Mugabe’s removal, and 40-year-old MDC leader Nelson Chamisa. Both men have expressed confidence in victory although Western diplomats and local observer groups said the race, which saw a turnout of 75 percent, was too close to call. “The information from our representatives on the ground is extremely positive!” Mnangagwa said on his official Twitter feed. Chamisa had earlier said he was poised for victory, writing on Twitter: “Awaiting ZEC to perform their constitutional duty to officially announce the people’s election results and we are ready to form the next government.” As well as electing a president, Zimbabweans were voting for 210 members of parliament and more than 9,000 councillors. The final outcome may not be known until Aug. 4. In the absence of a clear winner, a run-off will be held on Sept. 8. The winner must put Zimbabwe back on track after 37 years under Mugabe tainted by corruption, mismanagement and diplomatic isolation that brought one of Africa’s most promising economies to its knees. Election monitor sources said Monday’s vote appeared to have passed without major foul play although they noted some coercion and intimidation of voters in rural areas by ZANU-PF and said state media was biased towards the ruling party. Chamisa questioned the independence of the ZEC and said voters were being suppressed in urban areas where he is popular. ZANU-PF has denied any misconduct.     Whatever the outcome, unrest remains possible. If the MDC loses and contests the result there could be street protests. Protracted court battles could also spark violence and delay much-needed economic reforms. Should Mnangagwa lose, many Zimbabweans fear some in the ruling party may not accept the result, particularly given the huge risks some senior cadres and army officers took in removing Mugabe. Some of the organisers of the coup are now in government, including Vice President Constantino Chiwenga. Mnangagwa and ZANU-PF have said they will accept the result, but after a string of questionable elections under Mugabe, many Zimbabweans remained sceptical. “If this guy loses there is no way they will hand over power,” said Gift Machekera, pointing at a huge banner of Mnangagwa hanging on a building in Harare. “Those who have the guns have the power. This is Africa.” Several civil society groups are collating results from 10,985 polling posts in parallel with ZEC but are not allowed to release results early. A source at one group said it was too early to call a winner but it was looking “very close”. In the capital Harare, an MDC stronghold, results posted outside some polling stations showed Chamisa winning by wide margins, but Mnangagwa was expected to claw back ground in ZANU-PF’s rural heartland. Urban results tend to emerge quicker than those from rural outposts. The run-up to Monday’s vote was peaceful compared with past elections under Mugabe, where the ruling party and veterans of the 1970s independence struggle were accused of violence against opponents. Dozens of people were killed ahead of a runoff in 2008 between Mugabe and MDC-founder Morgan Tsvangirai, who died of cancer in February. Mugabe emerged on the eve of the election to announce he would vote for the opposition, surprising Mnangagwa who accused him of striking a deal with Chamisa.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government on Tuesday firmly defeated two no-confidence motions put forward by opposition lawmakers over its handling of a scandal involving President Emmanuel Macron’s bodyguard, confirming his solid majority. Although the two motions had virtually no chance of succeeding, the votes capped a tumultuous two weeks in French politics after a video showing the bodyguard beating protesters triggered the most serious crisis of Macron’s tenure. The motion backed by the conservative opposition party won 143 votes, falling short of the 289 necessary to topple the government, while the one put forward by an alliance of left-wing parties only gathered 74 votes. Macron’s Republic On The Move party controls an outright majority in the lower house National Assembly and not a single of the president’s MPs broke ranks on Tuesday. Despite the parliamentary victories, what has become known as the “Benalla affair”, after bodyguard Alexandre Benalla, has left an impact on Macron’s presidency, denting his popularity and throwing parts of his agenda off schedule. The 40-year-old president was criticised for firing the aide only after the video showing him assaulting a May Day protester while wearing police gear was revealed by the press, undermining his claim of building an “exemplary Republic”. As well as forcing his government to postpone a constitutional reform, the affair has pushed Macron down in the polls, with his popularity now at barely 36 percent, according to one recent survey. It has also emboldened a fragmented opposition, which had been floundering since Macron’s landslide victory last year. The scandal has also raised questions about Macron’s highly centralised governing style and the wide powers conferred on the president under France’s Fifth Republic. “This scandal reveals above all the abuses of a hyper-presidential regime,” veteran Communist lawmaker Andre Chassaigne told MPs before the no-confidence vote. “This is not just a summer affair, it shows the ultra concentration of powers by an elected monarch which undermines the very principle of separation of powers,” he said. The former investment banker has dismissed the case as a “storm in a teacup”. Although Macron will soon head off to the south of France for a summer break where he will host British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, the scandal will continue to make waves when lawmakers return in September. The senate, France’s upper house of parliament, has set up an enquiry which may question the 26-year old bodyguard after Benalla said in an interview he was open to it, despite the separate judicial investigation opened by prosecutors. On Tuesday, the head of Macron’s party, Christophe Castaner, told the enquiry he had fired Vincent Crase, the second man who was seen roughing up protesters with Benalla on the video revealed by Le Monde newspaper. Crase, who held a security position in the president’s party, was also placed under formal investigation by prosecutors.

2019-02-08,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has asked Britain to extradite former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, overthrown in a coup in 2014 and sentenced in absentia to jail for negligence, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday. Yingluck fled the country last August to avoid being jailed over a rice subsidy scheme that ran up losses in the billions of dollars. She has denied wrongdoing and said the trial was politically motivated. The Supreme Court sentenced her in absentia to five years’ jail last September. Prayuth said the request was a necessary procedure between the two countries which share an extradition treaty. “We cannot go and arrest people abroad so it is up to that country to arrest and send (her) to us,” Prayuth said. Yingluck and her brother, ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have been at the centre of a power struggle that has dominated Thai politics for more than a decade, pitting traditional royalist and the military elite against the Shinawatra family and their supporters in the rural north and northeast. It was not immediately clear why the government had waited until now to seek Yingluck’s extradition or how Britain would respond. With a long-awaited general election due for some time next year, both Thaksin and Yingluck still wield significant political influence. The junta has long maintained that it is unconcerned by the Shinawatra siblings but critics say the military is looking to end the family’s political influence by introducing a new military-backed constitution and restrictions on political parties.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Four members of Russia’s Pussy Riot protest group who were jailed for 15 days for staging a pitch invasion during the football World Cup final were detained again after their release on Monday and were held overnight, their lawyer said on Tuesday.   The members of the group face new charges of staging a public event without having prior permission, an offence that carries a jail sentence of up to 10 days or a fine of up to 30,000 rubles (£365.8), Russian news agencies reported.  Nikolai Vasilyev, the group’s lawyer, said police had not yet allowed him to see the case materials, and he was unable to confirm what charges his clients faced, or when a court hearing would be held.    The activists briefly interrupted the football World Cup final on July 15 when they ran onto the pitch in police uniforms.  Their intrusion onto the pitch in Moscow’s main stadium in front of President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials marked a rare security breach in the weeks-long football tournament hosted by Russia. The group said the stunt, which held up the game only briefly, was meant to promote freedom of speech and condemn policies of FIFA, football’s global governing body. The four pitch invaders were jailed for 15 days for the stunt and were banned from sporting events for three years.  The four members were Veronika Nikulshina, Olga Pakhtusova, Olga Kurachyova and Pyotr Verzilov. Tournament organisers said the stewards who failed to stop the intrusion would face disciplinary action.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump was mistaken to expect Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to compensate for supply losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran, after OPEC production rose only modestly in July.  The comments, from Iran’s OPEC governor, came a day after a Reuters survey showed OPEC production rose by 70,000 barrels per day in July. Saudi production increased but was offset by a decline in Iranian supply due to the restart of U.S. sanctions, the survey found. [OPEC/O] “It seems President Trump has been taken hostage by Saudi Arabia and a few producers when they claimed they can replace 2.5 million barrels per day of Iranian exports, encouraging him to take action against Iran,” Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters.  “Now they and Russia sell more oil and more expensively. Not even from their incremental production but their stocks.” He said oil prices, which Trump has been pressuring the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down by raising output, will rise unless the United States grants waivers to buyers of Iranian crude. “They are also calling for the use of the U.S. SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). This will also mean higher prices. U.S. waivers to our clients if they come is due to the failure of bluffers (Saudi and the other producers) and, if not given, will again push the prices higher,” he said. “So they hanged him (Trump) on the wall. Now they want to have a mega OPEC, congratulations to President Trump, Russia and Saudi Arabia.” OPEC governors represent their respective country on the organisation’s board of governors and are typically the second most senior person in a country’s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. “The longer-term solution, Mr President, is to support and facilitate capacity building in all countries, proportionate to their reserves of oil and gas. And we will remain the biggest opportunity,” Kazempour said.

2019-02-08," (The July 29 story corrects paragraph 18 to show meeting was with Qatar officials) By Jibran Ahmad and Abdul Qadir Sediqi PESHAWAR, Pakistan/KABUL (Reuters) - A meeting between a senior U.S. diplomat and Taliban representatives in Doha last week to discuss a possible ceasefire ended with “very positive signals” and a decision to hold more meetings, people with knowledge of the talks said on Sunday. The meeting between a delegation led by Alice Wells, deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, and Taliban representatives was first reported in The Wall Street Journal but has not been officially confirmed. According to one Taliban official, who said he was part of a four-member delegation, there were “very positive signals” from the meeting, which he said was conducted in a “friendly atmosphere” in a Doha hotel. “You can’t call it peace talks,” he said. “These are a series of meetings for initiating formal and purposeful talks. We agreed to meet again soon and resolve the Afghan conflict through dialogue.” He said the talks had been held without the presence of Afghan government officials at the insistence of the Taliban. The move comes as the Afghan government and the United States have stepped up efforts to end the 17 year-war in Afghanistan following the unprecedented three-day truce during last month’s Eid al-Fitr holiday. The truce, which saw unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with soldiers on the streets of Kabul and other cities, offered the first concrete vision of a peace settlement since an earlier attempt at peace talks broke down in 2015. Although the Taliban refused an offer by President Ashraf Ghani to extend the Eid ceasefire, behind-the-scenes contacts have continued and the government has said it is considering another ceasefire during next month’s Eid-al Qurban holiday. As hopes of possible formal negotiations have risen, the United States has agreed to participate directly in the talks, although it insists the process will remain under Afghan leadership. The Taliban official said the talks took place with the approval of the leadership council. The two sides had discussed proposals to allow the Taliban free movement in two provinces where they would not be attacked, an idea that President Ashraf Ghani has already rejected. They also discussed Taliban participation in the Afghan government. “The only demand they made was to allow their military bases in Afghanistan,” said the Taliban official. The meeting in Doha, where the Taliban maintains a political office, followed two earlier meetings between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives in recent months, the sources said. “We have held three meetings with the U.S. and we reached a conclusion to continue talks for meaningful negotiations,” said a second Taliban official. He said they would first exchange prisoners and then discuss other issues that could restore peace to Afghanistan. “However, our delegation made it clear to them that peace can only be restored to Afghanistan when all foreign forces are withdrawn,” he said. Another person with knowledge of the talks said the United States had pressed the Taliban side to accept the ceasefire offer for Eid-ul Adha, often known in Afghanistan as Eid-al Qurban, which this year starts on Aug. 22. “So a long-term ceasefire is expected on Eid-ul Adha,” the person said. “Both sides agreed upon the continuation of the meetings and talks and another meeting is expected before Eid, but the exact time and place is not clear yet.” The State Department confirmed that Wells had visited Doha but has said only that she met Qatar government officials, including the deputy prime minister, to talk about their contributions to the situation in Afghanistan. Asked about talks with the Taliban, a State Department spokesman referred to a July 9 comment from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the United States would “support, facilitate, and participate in these peace discussions, but peace must be decided by the Afghans and settled among them.” Ghani’s main spokesman Haroon Chakansuri said last week that peace talks would be Afghan-led and would build on international consensus in support of peace.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets fell on Monday, pulled down by a sell-off in U.S. technology heavyweights, while the dollar slipped against the euro ahead of several central bank monetary policy meetings later this week. Most major currencies stuck to narrow trading ranges ahead of central bank decisions. The Bank of Japan ends a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday, and the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates on Thursday. Shares in Europe fell, led by a 2.9 percent decline in software maker SAP SE (SAPG.DE) and a 2.5 percent drop in French industrial gases company Air Liquide (AIRP.PA). The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading European shares closed down 0.3 percent.  MSCI’s all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.37 percent on weakness in the so-called U.S. FAANG group: Facebook (FB.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O).  Wall Street stocks also closed down on the tech sell-off, which included Microsoft (MSFT.O) as another big decliner.

The S&P 500 .SPX lost 16.22 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,802.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 107.42 points, or 1.39 percent, to 7,630.00. The technology index .SPLRCT tumbled 1.78 percent as disappointing results spurred concerns about future growth for a sector that has led U.S. equities to record highs. (Graphic: FAANG market cap - reut.rs/2mRA3oi)    “There’s a lot of money and speculation piled into the FAANG stocks, and now that money is coming out,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. “It’s money coming out of a crowded trade,” he said.   Industrials, energy and materials led gainers on Wall Street, with Caterpillar (CAT.N) raising its full-year outlook after second-quarter earnings nearly doubled and beat expectations, helped by robust global demand for its equipment. A revival in global growth may lift stocks even as tech shares stop leading the market higher, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “You’re seeing a change in leadership in the market, and that’s the underlying story here. Energy, financials, materials and industrials are the early leaders,” Arone said. The S&P telecommunications services index .SPLRCL rose 1.95 percent and the S&P energy sector .SPNY jumped 0.84 percent as oil prices gained.

The dollar slipped the most against the euro, with the common currency 0.41 percent higher as it recovered from its weakest weekly performance against the greenback in six weeks. The euro tumbled last week after the European Central Bank reaffirmed that rates would stay low through next year’s summer. Analysts said the euro rebounded largely because traders felt it had been oversold last week.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.33 percent, while the Japanese yen JPY= retreated slightly, slipping 0.04 percent versus the greenback to 111.07 per dollar. The euro EUR= rose to $1.1703. Euro zone government bond yields rose after a strong Italian auction boosted demand for Italian debt at the expense of higher-rated markets in the bloc. Expectations for the upcoming Bank of Japan meeting also pressured yields, analysts said, along with German and Spanish inflation data that remained slightly above the ECB’s price stability target in July. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield DE10YT=RR, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose more than 4 basis points to a six-week high of 0.46 percent. Yields on U.S. Treasury bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year at a six-week high, as investors sold U.S. government bonds on growing speculation that the BOJ may adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy at its meeting.  U.S. benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were down 3/32 in price to yield 2.9747 percent.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will set out ‘sensible precautions’ in a series of notes looking at how to prepare for a possible exit from the European Union without a formal divorce deal, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said on Monday. “It is about setting out sensible precautions in the event of a no deal scenario,” the spokesman told reporters when asked about the government’s plans to send out “technical notices” on no deal preparations in August and September. “We have been absolutely clear that it is in the interests not just of ourselves but of the EU to get a deal. In the event of no deal there will of course be consequences for the European Union,” the spokesman said. The spokesman added that, contrary to some media reports, there were no plans to involve the army in its ‘no deal’ provisions, especially regarding food supplies.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two-thirds of Britons now think the government will end up with a bad deal when Britain leaves the European Union early next year, and half want the chance to vote on what happens next, Sky News reported on Monday, citing its own poll. With less than eight months until Britain is due to leave the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to find a proposal to maintain economic ties with the bloc that pleases both sides of her divided party and is acceptable to negotiators in Brussels. The Sky poll said 65 percent of British voters thought the government would end up with a bad deal - an increase of 15 points from March - and half support a referendum to choose between leaving with a deal, leaving without a deal or staying in the EU. The poll indicated 40 percent opposed such a vote, while 10 percent did not know. When asked to choose between three options - May’s deal, a no deal or staying in the EU - 48 percent said they would prefer to stay in the EU, 27 percent wanted to leave with no deal and 13 percent would opt for the government’s deal. Sky Data interviewed a nationally representative sample of 1,466 Sky customers online between July 20 and 23. Data are weighted to the profile of the population. The shift in public opinion comes as May has stepped up planning for a so called “no-deal” Brexit that would see the world’s fifth largest economy crash out of the EU on March 29, 2019 without a trade agreement. A separate poll on Friday suggested that the proportion of voters who favour a referendum on the final terms of any Brexit deal had overtaken those who do not for the first time. May has repeatedly ruled out holding another public vote on Brexit, saying the public spoke at a June 23, 2016, referendum, in which 51.9 percent of the votes cast backed leaving the EU while 48.1 percent backed staying.  Her main opponents in parliament, the Labour Party, are also not advocating a second referendum, meaning that, despite growing support and a vocal campaign for another vote, there is no obvious path for one to take place. However, the potential for major political upheaval remains, with May’s minority government facing a series of make-or-break moments in the Brexit process over coming months.  She must find a way to strike a deal with the EU, which has already rejected her preferred plan on trade, then sell that deal to her deeply divided Conservative Party, before putting it to a vote in parliament. Failure at any of those three hurdles could cost her her job. The Sky poll found 78 percent of voters thought May’s government was doing a bad job of negotiating Brexit, up 23 percentage points from March. Just 10 percent thought the government was doing a good job. Earlier this month, the government set out in detail for the first time what kind of trading arrangement it wants with the EU after leaving the bloc, triggering a political crisis in which two senior ministers resigned in protest, saying May was watering down Brexit. Since March, the proportion of those satisfied with May’s performance has fallen to 24 percent, down 17 percentage points, the Sky poll showed.  Voters were split on whether Brexit would be good or bad for the country: 40 percent said it would be good and 51 percent said it would be bad.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Delays to the planned sale of Toshiba’s (6502.T) NuGen nuclear project in Britain have prompted a review of the roles of 60 direct employees, who are mainly based in Manchester, raising further doubts over its future. The plant in Moorside, north-west England, was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain’s electricity when built, but has faced several setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. Following the Westinghouse bankruptcy, NuGen joint venture partner Engie (ENGIE.PA) pulled out of the project, leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investors. Toshiba put NuGen up for sale and South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (015760.KS) was chosen as preferred bidder last year, but the process has stalled.  Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices. “Toshiba has pursued a sale of NuGen to KEPCO and the prolonged time it has taken reach a conclusion has required NuGen to undertake a review,” a spokesman for NuGen said. “As such additional options are being pursued for NuGen’s future direction to deliver the next generation of nuclear new build in the UK,” he said. NuGen has around 60 direct employees, mostly based in Manchester, while the roles of around 40 contractors would also be placed under a 30 day consultation period later this week, the spokesman added. Britain’s government has yet to announce any kind of deal for the NuGen project. “We continue to engage with new build developers, though the detail of these discussions is commercially confidential,” a spokeswoman for the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy department said. Another plant, to be built by a unit of Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), has also struggled to find funding, leading the British government to consider direct investment.  However, EDF’s (EDF.PA) Hinkley Point C will be the first new nuclear plant built in the country in more than twenty years after securing additional backing from the French government, investment from China General Nuclear Power Corp, and a long-term power price guarantee from Britain. The government has been criticised for being too generous in the terms it has set for this deal.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - GVC Holdings Plc (GVC.L) shares leapt to a record high on Monday after it agreed to set up an online betting platform in the United States with U.S. hotel and casino operator MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) . The announcement comes ahead of the American football season and as British betting companies look to capitalise on the U.S. market after a U.S. Supreme court ruling in May lifted a ban on sports betting. Bookmakers have also been assessing the impact of recently implemented UK gambling curbs after the government said in May it would cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to two pounds from 100 pounds.   “GVC appears to have struck gold by signing a 50/50 JV with arguably the biggest gambling brand in the U.S.,” London-based broker Shorecap’s Greg Johnson said in a note.     GVC shares rose as much as 7.5 percent to a record high of 1,178 pence before retreating slightly to trade 5 percent by 0748 GMT. The companies will initially invest $100 million each in the joint venture, which will have a U.S. headquarters, said GVC which owns the Coral, Ladbrokes and Sportingbet brands. GVC said the joint venture would get access to 15 U.S. states with a population of 90 million, adding that the venture will get access to all U.S. land-based and online sports betting while integrating both companies’ customer loyalty programmes. “We are proud to join forces with GVC, the largest and most dynamic global online betting operator, with existing reputable and trusted operations in the U.S.,” MGM Resorts Chief Executive Jim Murren said. GVC had said on Friday that it was in advanced talks regarding a joint venture with MGM. Sky News had also reported that the deal could pave the way for a merger between the two firms. GVC, which has grown rapidly through acquisitions including the purchase of Ladbrokes late last year, has been looking to expand in the United States, after the U.S. Supreme Court paved the way to legalise sports betting. The company said in July that it expected to post full-year results in line with expectations.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will meet his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday to discuss cooperation between the two countries on his first major overseas trip since he replaced Boris Johnson earlier this month. Hunt and Wang Yi, China’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, are expected to discuss free trade, enforcing sanctions on North Korea and how Britain and China can work together on global challenges such as climate change, Britain’s Foreign Office said. Speaking ahead of the visit, Hunt said that as Britain leaves the European Union it was committed to deepening its partnership with China. “The UK-China Strategic Dialogue is an important opportunity to intensify our cooperation on shared challenges in international affairs, ranging from global free trade to non-proliferation and environmental challenges, under the UK-China Global Partnership and ‘Golden Era’ for UK-China relations,” he said. Britain is trying to reinvent itself as a global trading nation after it voted in 2016 to leave the EU, and China, the world’s second largest economy, is high on the list of countries with which it wants to sign a free trade agreement. Hunt said he would seek to build on Prime Minister Theresa May’s visit to China in February, when she secured commercial deals worth 9 billion pounds. His predecessor quit earlier this month in protest at the government’s plan to maintain a close trading relationship with the European Union after Brexit, a strategy that Johnson said would make it much more difficult to do free trade deals.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Support for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc, trying to move beyond a bitter dispute over migrant policy that threatened the coalition, has fallen to its lowest level since 2006, a poll showed on Sunday. The Emnid poll published in Bild am Sonntag showed Merkel’s Christian Democrats and their sister party, Bavaria’s Christian Social Union (CSU), down one percentage point at 29 percent. That compares with 33 percent in the September election. The CSU faces a tough regional election in October with polls showing it could lose its absolute majority in Bavaria. The Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with the conservatives in Merkel’s coalition, failed to capitalise on those losses, also falling one point to 18 percent. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) was unchanged at 15 percent while the Greens rose 2 points to 14 percent, their best showing this year, according to Bild am Sonntag. Emnid gave no explanation for the changes.  About a month ago, Merkel’s coalition came close to collapse due to fundamental differences on migrant policy with her Bavarian partners who wanted tighter national border controls, which she rejected. A face-saving compromise was reached in early July but underlying tensions linger.

2019-02-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended his electricity minister on Sunday amid continuing protests over poor public services especially power cuts and rampant corruption, the premier’s office said. It said in a statement that Abadi had also ordered an internal government investigation into Electricity Minister Qassim al-Fahdawi’s role in the deterioration of utility services. There was no immediate comment from Fahdawi. Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim heartland, over widespread electricity outages during the blistering hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and pervasive graft. On Saturday, Abadi sacked five local election officials after they were charged with acts of corruption during the May 12 parliamentary election. Abadi’s moves come after Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, urged government action to fight corruption to defuse unrest. Public anger is mounting at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after a May 12 election that was marred by allegations of fraud, prompting a recount. Abadi, who is seeking a second term in office, is heading a fragile caretaker government for the time being.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s conservative government failed to win any of five by-elections held over the weekend, defeats widely seen as an indication Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull faces an uphill battle to be re-elected in a national poll due by May 2019. “We will look very seriously and thoughtfully and humbly at the way in which the voters have responded,” Turnbull told reporters in Sydney on Sunday. In what was coined “Super Saturday”, voters in five seats went to the polls after a handful of mainly Labor opposition lawmakers were forced from office after falling foul of the country’s constitution that bans politicians from elected office if they are dual citizens. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on Sunday said four seats were retained by Labor and a fifth by the small Centre Alliance party, dealing a blow to Turnbull, who is under pressure to demonstrate a viable pathway for re-election with his coalition badly trailing Labor in opinion polls. Political analysts say Turnbull must win marginal seats in the state of Queensland, traditionally a conservative heartland, if he is to be re-elected. But his government failed to win a key by-election seat in Queensland, despite support from Australia’s right-wing One Nation party. Labor retained the Queensland seat of Longman with a bigger majority than it had secured in 2016. Failure to win at least one seat at the by-elections means Turnbull will continue to struggle to pass legislation with only a one-seat majority. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, who was targeted by the government over his poor personal approval ratings, said the results reflected the party’s focus on core issues such as health and education. “It renews my conviction to double down in fighting for fairness and challenging growing inequality,” he told reporters in Queensland.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday denied knowing about the 2016 meeting his son Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign staff held at Trump Tower with a group of Russians who offered damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.  “I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr,” Trump wrote in on Twitter after a CNN report cited his longtime lawyer Michael Cohen as saying Trump had known about the meeting in advance. CNN, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the matter, said Cohen was willing to make that assertion to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump’s presidential campaign had worked with Russia to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, and for possible campaign law violations linked to a $130,000 (£99,170) payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, a person familiar with the investigation has told Reuters. The payment to Daniels, who says she had an intimate relationship with Trump, was meant to buy her silence over the affair. Cohen has not been charged with any crime. Trump, who has said in the past he did not know about the meeting in advance, suggested Cohen was implicating Trump in exchange for possible immunity on unrelated charges related to his business dealings. “Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam,” Trump speculated on Twitter, without supporting his claim. The criticism of a man who was once Trump’s fierce defender reflects the tensions wrought by the federal investigations in New York and Washington.  The role Cohen, a longtime personal confidant of Trump, might play in the Mueller probe is unknown. On Wednesday, Trump expressed disbelief that Cohen would have taped conversations with him, a day after an audio recording of a conversation between the two men was aired on U.S. television. Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani called Cohen a liar on Thursday night after the CNN report on the Trump Tower meeting. “He’s been lying all week, or for two weeks - he’s been lying for years,” Giuliani told CNN. The Republican president has been infuriated by the suggestion he might owe his White House victory to Russia, and has focussed on denying the collusion allegations rather than on concerns about the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Moscow intervened on his behalf. In a series of angry Twitter posts on Friday morning, he again denied any collusion with Moscow and denounced the Mueller probe as a witch hunt. Russia has denied meddling in the election. Cohen did not return a request for comment on Trump’s tweet or the CNN report. His attorney Lanny Davis declined to comment on the report, as did spokeswomen for Mueller and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., along with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and senior campaign aide Paul Manafort took part in the June 9, 2016, meeting with Nataliya Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer and acknowledged Kremlin informant. Trump Jr. told congressional investigators he did not tell his father about the meeting beforehand, according to documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras took political responsibility on Friday for a wildfire that killed at least 87 people and led to opposition accusations that the government failed to protect lives. Tsipras’ opponents went on the offensive on Friday as three days of mourning ended, accusing the government of failing to apologise for the disaster. Seeking to deflect public anger, Tsipras told ministers he was conflicted over whether the authorities had done everything right in response to the disaster.  “I have called you here today first of all to take full political responsibility for this tragedy in front of my cabinet and the Greek people,” he said. “I won’t hide that I am overwhelmed by mixed feelings right now ... Pain, devastation for the human lives unexpectedly and unfairly lost. But also anguish at whether we acted correctly in everything we did.” Tsipras’ contrition comes after the main opposition New Democracy party criticised a government news conference on Thursday night where not one word of apology was heard.  “This government has just added unbridled cheek to its abject failure in protecting lives and people’s property,” said New Democracy spokeswoman Maria Spyraki. Civil Protection Minister Nikos Toskas told the news conference that the government suspected arson was behind Monday night’s blaze, which trapped dozens of people in their cars trying to escape a wall of flames. Survivors of one of the worst Greek disasters in living memory, which hit the town of Mati, some 30 km (17 miles) east of Athens on Monday, heckled Tsipras’ coalition partner, saying they had been left to fend for themselves. Pressure is growing on the government, which is trailing New Democracy in opinion polls, at a time when it had hoped to finally extricate Greece from years of bailouts prompted by its debit crisis and reap the political benefits.  Tsipras now faces questions over how so many got trapped in the fire as the death toll could rise still further.  Tsipras had not been seen in public since Tuesday, when he declared the three days of national mourning for the dead. Politicians’ criticism reflected anger among the survivors. “They left us alone to burn like mice,” Chryssa, one of the survivors in Mati, told Skai television. “No one came here to apologise, to submit his resignation, no one.” Toskas said he had offered his resignation but Tsipras rejected it. Fofi Gennimata, who leads the socialist PASOK party, said the government carried a huge political responsibility. “Why didn’t they protect the people by implementing on time the available plan for an organised and coordinated evacuation in the areas that were threatened?” she said. Graphic on Greek fire - tmsnrt.rs/2K6N3Qc The government has announced a long list of relief measures including a one-off 10,000 euro (8,891.94 pounds) payment for families of the victims. Their spouses and near relatives were also offered public sector jobs.  But many felt that was not enough to ease the pain and had wanted authorities to assume responsibility for the scale of the devastation.  About 300 fire fighters and volunteers were still combing the area on Friday for those still missing. More than 500 homes were destroyed by the blaze.  Haphazard and unlicensed building, a feature of many areas across Greece, was also blamed. Many routes to the beach were walled off.  Tsipras promised a national plan to tackle decades of unauthorised construction and to reform and upgrade the Civil Protection Service “to guarantee ... that there will be no more tragedies”. Mortuary staff in Athens, shocked at the sight of burnt bodies including children, were expected to conclude post-mortems on Friday after relatives of victims provided information and blood samples which could assist identifications. The fire broke out on Monday at 4:57 p.m. and spread rapidly through Mati tmsnrt.rs/2K6N3Qc, which is popular with local tourists.       Firefighters described a rapid change in the direction of the wind, which also picked up speed, and some suggested the thick covering of pine trees and a mood of panic were a deadly combination that would have been hard to combat.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China to beat retaliatory trade tariffs before they took effect in early July. President Donald Trump, who ahead of Friday’s release of the gross domestic product report had promoted the notion that second-quarter growth would be robust, declared victory. “We have accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,” Trump told reporters. “These numbers are very, very sustainable.”  Gross domestic product increased at a 4.1 percent annualised rate also as government spending picked up, the Commerce Department said in its snapshot of second-quarter GDP. While that was the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, it was not the best since the recession ended in mid-2009. January-March quarter GDP growth was revised up to a 2.2 percent pace from the previously reported 2.0 percent rate to account for updated information and methodology improvements. Compared to the second quarter of 2017, the economy grew 2.8 percent. Output expanded 3.1 percent in the first half of 2018, putting the economy on track to hit the Trump administration’s target of 3 percent annual growth. A measure of domestic demand surged at a 4.3 percent rate in the second quarter.  Contrary to Trump’s assertions, the economy enjoyed periods of robust growth during the Obama administration. GDP growth recorded a 5.1 percent pace in the second quarter of 2014 and the economy experienced four quarters of output above a 4.0 percent rate. Economists also cautioned against putting much weight on the surge in second-quarter growth as one-off factors, including a $1.5 trillion tax cut package, were behind the growth spurt. The soybean boost is likely to reverse in the coming quarters and the fiscal stimulus is seen fading in 2019.  “Pop the champagne today, but don’t get used to it, growth going forward has a lot of headwinds,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “Unless you cut taxes again, there won’t be additional tax cut monies to line company and consumer pocket books.” The United States slapped 25 percent duties on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods effective July 6, provoking a similar response from Beijing, which targeted soybeans and other agricultural products as well as U.S.-made cars.  Trump has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, leading to retaliation by the United States’ main trade partners, including Canada, the European Union, Mexico and China.  Strong growth in the April-June quarter likely keeps the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates two more times this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs in June for the second time this year and forecast two more rate hikes for 2018. The GDP report showed the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, increased at a 2.0 percent rate in the second quarter. The core PCE price index rose at a 2.2 percent pace in the January-March period. The dollar was little changed versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and stocks on Wall Street were down. While trade war fears helped to boost output last quarter, import duties are seen undercutting economic growth, with higher prices for goods discouraging consumer spending and businesses shelving investment plans. Economists in a Reuters poll earlier this week predicted that growth will slow notably from here. “The spring quarter could be the high water mark for growth,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. “That said, there is every reason to expect that growth in the second half of the year will still be in the 3 percent range.”  Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.0 percent rate in the second quarter. That was the fastest in 3-1/2 years and followed the January-March period’s stall-speed pace of 0.5 percent.  Households bought motor vehicles and spent more on health care, utilities, food and accommodation in the last quarter.  Consumer spending is also being driven by a robust labour market, which created an average of 215,000 jobs per month in the first half of this year. The front-loading of deliveries of soybeans and other goods boosted exports in the second quarter, which grew at their quickest pace in 4-1/2 years, sharply narrowing the trade deficit. Trade added 1.06 percentage points GDP growth in the second quarter after being neutral in the January-March period. The rush to offload soybeans, however, depleted farm inventories. Inventories declined at a $27.9 billion rate after rising at a $30.3 billion pace in the first quarter. They  subtracted 1.0 percentage point from GDP growth. Business spending on equipment slowed and a further moderation is likely, with trade wars casting a pall on the business spending outlook. General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Wednesday cut their full-year profit forecasts, citing higher steel and aluminium costs.  Harley-Davidson Inc has warned that more expensive steel and aluminium and a 25 percent retaliatory duty imposed by the European Union on shipments from the United States could cost the motorcycle maker $45 million to $55 million this year. Investment in homebuilding fell for a second straight quarter. Government spending grew solidly, boosted by defense outlays.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Some European companies are rethinking their strategies to cushion the impact of trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China. U.S. President Donald Trump said on July 20 he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $500 billion (381.28 billion pounds) of imports from China, threatening to escalate the current trade clash with the Asian nation. Earlier this month, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. In return, China levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products. The Trump administration on July 19 came under criticism from automakers, foreign governments and others as officials consider imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts. Below are recent comments from European companies on trade tensions: ** Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) cuts 2018 outlook on Wednesday, hurt by weaker performance in China. Its operating profit for the second-quarter was negatively impacted by China import duty changes. ** French mining group Eramet (ERMT.PA) warned that current favourable markets could be hurt by trade rows.  ** Swiss speciality chemicals maker Clariant (CLN.S) plans to move production out of U.S. amid trade tensions, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. ** Finnish steel maker Outokumpu (OUT1V.HE) sees two-fold impact from the U.S. tariffs, with surging imports to Europe resulting in heavy price pressure, whilst in the Americas, base prices have risen throughout spring benefiting local manufacturers, including the company. ** Other Finnish company, Valmet (VALMT.HE), says that tariff increases could derail the recovery and depress its medium-term growth prospects. ** Chinese-owned Volvo Cars (IPO-VOLVO.ST) said it was shifting production of its top-selling SUV production for the U.S. market to Europe from China to avoid Washington’s new duties on Chinese imports. ** German automaker BMW (BMWG.DE) said this month that it would be unable to “completely absorb” a new 25 percent Chinese tariff on imported U.S.-made models and would have to raise prices on the vehicles made in South Carolina. ** Daimler (DAIGn.DE) issued a profit warning in June, saying that profits would fall in 2018 because new import tariffs on cars exported from the United States to China would hurt sales of high-margin Mercedes-Benz sports utility vehicles. [nL8N1TM691] ** The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, whose members include General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), also warned on the impact of the tariffs. A study released by a U.S. auto dealer group warned that the tariffs could cut U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles. ** Sweden’s Electrolux (ELUXb.ST) said on July 18 that the U.S. tariffs announced at the beginning of July would have an impact of $10 million plus this year. In the third quarter, it expects raw material costs to rise by 0.5 billion Swedish crowns. ** Belgian steel wire maker Bekaert (BEKB.BR) reported on the same day that it sees underlying operating profit 20 percent below analysts’ estimates in the first half, blaming wire rod costs partly driven up by tariffs. ** Swedish lock maker Assa Abloy’s (ASSAb.ST) CEO said on July 18 that he sees an important further increase in steel prices in the second part of the year in U.S., partly due to new import tariffs. He expects price hikes to compensate better for the higher cost in the last six month of the year than in the second quarter. ** Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine (VOES.VI) said on June 6 that about a third of its U.S. sales would be impacted by Washington’s steel import tariffs, adding that it was talking to its customers about who would bear the cost. ** Norway’s REC Silicon (REC.OL) booked an impairment charge of $340 million “due to the market disruption from the curtailment of solar incentives in China, as well as continued trade barriers that prevent access to primary markets inside China.”  “We need the U.S. and Chinese governments to cooperate in ending the solar trade dispute ... to prevent additional job losses and to enhance the value of the solar industry in the U.S. and China.”       Reporting by Pawel Goraj and Tommy Lund; Editing by Keith Weir and Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china-europe/impact-of-trade-tariffs-on-european-companies-idUKKBN1KH1OM,2019-02-08,"Some European companies are rethinking their strategies to cushion the impact of trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies, the United States and China.",Impact of trade tariffs on European companies
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Soaring temperatures in Britain have led to an increase in electricity demand equivalent to an extra 2.5 million homes, a report by academics at Imperial College London said on Friday. Britain’s prolonged heatwave has prompted a warning from the government for people to keep out of the sun, while the Meteorological Office said all-time temperature records could be broken. Graphic - British wholesale day-ahead electricity price June/July: reut.rs/2JWWJMY Efforts to keep cool such as ramping up air-conditioning units and supermarkets turning up freezers have boosted demand for electricity, the Imperial College report for British power firm Drax’s (DRX.L) Electric Insights series said.  Demand for electricity rises 350 megawatts (MW) for every degree the temperature rises above 20 degrees Celsius the report said. Unseasonably high temperatures led almost 900 MW of extra power demand a day during the last week of June, the equivalent to demand from 2.5 million households or an area the size of Scotland, it said. “Global demand for cooling technology is only going to increase as temperatures, and global income, rise,” Iain Staffell of Imperial College London said. Fortunately for the National Grid, the weeks of blazing sunshine that have driven up temperatures have also boosted production from the country’s solar panels.  Solar power was providing almost 17 percent of the country’s electricity at 1200 GMT on Friday, National Grid and Sheffield University data showed. Last year, solar power provided around 1 percent of total available UK power, based on government figures.  That means the additional power demand is unlikely to cause problems. The warmer weather and increased demand have contributed to higher power prices this summer. Average British wholesale power prices TRGBBD1 averaged around 56 pounds per megawatt hour over June and July so far this year, around 40 percent higher than the average for the same period in 2017, Reuters data showed.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier rejected key elements of Britain’s new trade proposals on Thursday even as he and his new British counterpart Dominic Raab voiced a shared determination to reach a deal by October. At a joint news conference with the Brexit secretary after three days of talks among officials in Brussels, Barnier made clear British offers to collect customs duties for the EU as part of efforts to avoid friction on Northern Ireland’s new EU border had failed to convince already skeptical Europeans. “The EU cannot and ... will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and excise duty collection to a non-member, who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures,” Barnier said. “Any customs arrangements or customs union ... must respect this principle.” “The UK wants to take back control of its money, law, and borders. We will respect that,” he said.  “But the EU also wants to keep control of its money, law, and borders. The UK should respect that.” Barnier added that Prime Minister Theresa May might instead offer to join a customs union with the EU, although that would prevent London cutting its own trade deals with other countries. May has ruled out a customs union and Raab said Britain still believed it could reach a deal to avoid a “hard border”. Negotiations to provide an outline of how trade will work between Britain and the EU after Brexit next March and, more particularly, after the end of a status quo transition in 2021, have become tangled up with resolving the Irish question, which Brussels says must be done in a pre-Brexit withdrawal treaty. Raab said his officials had answered EU counterparts’ concerns on the customs plan, part of a White Paper which May pushed through her cabinet at the expense of the resignation of Raab’s predecessor and fellow Brexit campaigner David Davis. At the heart of the conundrum lies an EU insistence that the way to avoid a “hard border” is for Northern Ireland to follow EU rules as in Ireland and, if need be, different from those on the British mainland, while May rejects new barriers to goods moving from the mainland to the troubled province. Raab said he believed a so-called “backstop” clause in the treaty on Ireland could be agreed, though he said Britain would insist it was not valid forever - something Barnier says it must be in case Britain’s promised better proposals do not work. “With pragmatism on both sides I am confident we can find a way to resolve it into a workable solution and that will be easier to achieve if the backstop, if it were to be exercised at all, could only be for a time-limited period before the future arrangements become operational,” Raab told reporters. Barnier, however, said the talks this week had failed to convince him: “We have no objections in principle to this,” he said of what he calls an “all-UK backstop”.  “But,” he added, “We have doubts that it can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.  “We have had an open and frank and therefore useful discussion with Dominic on these issues. I think the UK has understood our concerns and respects our principles and the UK had promised to come back to us with concrete proposals on how to address our concerns.” Both men said negotiations would resume in mid-August - normally a time when the EU institutions are closed for summer holidays - and would continue weekly thereafter.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britons sweltered in a prolonged heatwave on Thursday, with temperatures hitting a year high and set to test national records on Friday, the Meteorological Office said. The temperature reached 34.9 degrees Celsius at Heathrow Airport, officially making it the hottest day of the year so far, the Met Office said. It forecast a 20-30 percent chance of Britain seeing an all-time highest temperature this week and a 70 percent chance of a record high for July. The all-time British record is 38.5C set in August 2003 near Faversham in Kent, southeast England, while the highest July temperature was 36.7C in 2015 at Heathrow airport. “There is greater potential for both the July and the other (all-time) record to go tomorrow,” said a Met Office spokesman noting that the highest temperatures are expected in the southeast - in Kent, Essex, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. “It’s going to depend on the development of thunderstorms ... If the thunderstorms develop early that’s going to prevent some of the heat from the sun getting to the ground which will curb the rise of temperatures,” he said.     Britain’s heatwave has turned green grass brown, triggered an impending hose pipe ban in the northwest of England, and prompted a warning from the government for people to keep out of the sun. Farmers have also warned of possible food shortages later this year. On Thursday the EuroTunnel Le Shuttle operation warned passengers heading for the Continent at its Folkestone terminal to expect four-hour delays to booked times, blaming restricted shuttle capacity.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Some personal chemistry with a fellow veteran dealmaker and a quick sense that Donald Trump was ready to bargain helped Jean-Claude Juncker strike a surprise accord to avert a transatlantic trade war, for now. That is the view of European Commission officials familiar with the EU chief executive’s meeting at the White House on Wednesday, after which the U.S. president declared there was “love” between the two sides and withdrew a threat to slap new tariffs on EU cars that would have drawn retaliation in Europe. “Clearly there is a good chemistry between President Juncker and President Trump. It helps,” one EU official who was present said. “The human dimension is of crucial importance.” Juncker criticised Trump, notably at a G7 summit last month, but he went into the White House showdown oozing charm. Trump tweeted a photograph of Juncker giving him a trademark kiss. He also gave him a picture of the grave in his native Luxembourg of one of Trump’s heroes, barnstorming World War Two general George Patton, with a note reminding “Dear Donald” of a shared history. “Juncker has been tough on Trump in the past and Trump respects that,” said another EU official on returning to Brussels on Thursday. “You could tell from the atmosphere from the start that Trump was interested in doing a deal.” That deal was twofold: to face down Trump by waving a threat of Europe’s own, to curb access to the world’s biggest market; and to present mostly old and effectively cost-free EU offers as something Trump could sell to voters ahead of November elections — new talks on lowering EU tariffs for U.S. industrial goods, outlets for U.S. gas and soybeans and potential EU backing in trade rows with China. The EU delegation, which had been playing down expectations, confessed to some surprise at how well it worked, surmising that Trump, assailed at home on a range of issues, saw advantage in how an EU deal could be sold compared to a bigger trade war. Juncker himself told the Politico news website “we get along well, surprisingly” and adding that Trump took past criticism well: “He doesn’t like those who beat about the bush.” The two have very different backgrounds. Juncker, 63, has worked in politics all his life, most of it at the top table of EU backroom bargaining as finance minister and prime minister of Luxembourg; Trump, the real estate baron and reality TV star, held no office before his extraordinary election in 2016.  Yet both like to be seen as dealmakers in their different ways and Juncker will relish the praise heaped on him, notably by relieved German exporters, for what his team concede may only be a truce while Trump engages in talks before any action. “Juncker knows how to tame Trump” wrote Vienna’s left-leaning Der Standard, describing the deal as a “masterpiece”.  “The old fox showed that, even from the most difficult of political situations, he can find a diplomatic way out.” It is a far cry from two weeks ago, when some Germans were questioning his fitness for the job after he was seen staggering — due to sciatica, he insisted, not alcohol — during a NATO summit where Trump was busy trashing his European allies. “A lot of love went into their preparations,” a Brussels diplomat from one EU member states said of how the Commission, in one of the biggest tasks the EU executive has undertaken on behalf of its member governments, worked out its Trump plan. In saying the EU would import more U.S. gas, Juncker was able to surprise the president, two EU officials said, by telling him it was U.S. bureaucracy over export licences that was partly holding back sales. In any case, it is part of a long-term EU plan to diversify away from Russia gas and cannot happen quickly as special terminals still have to be built. In saying soybean imports would also rise, Juncker was effectively just reflecting market conditions, as Chinese curbs have driven down the price of U.S. soy, making it attractive to European farmers who use it in animal feed.  As well as carrots, though, Juncker also had a big stick: “I think they weighed what it would mean to open up a 50 billion euro trade nightmare,” a third EU official said in trying to explain how Juncker succeeded where others, notably in Asia, had failed. “They wouldn’t know how this would end.” Additional reporting by Peter Maushagen and Philip Blenkinsop; editing by David Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-eu-kiss/it-started-with-a-kiss-how-juncker-wooed-trump-idUKKBN1KG1J2,2019-02-08,,It started with a kiss - how Juncker wooed Trump
2019-02-08,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department will continue its probe into whether auto imports pose a national security risk despite ongoing trade talks with the European Union, but President Donald Trump asked that no action be taken at this time, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday. “We’ve been directed by the president to continue the investigation, get our material together, but not actually implement anything pending the outcome of the negotiation,” Ross told reporters aboard Air Force One. The Trump administration in May launched a probe into whether car and auto part imports pose a national security risk. Last week, major automakers warned imposing tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts would raise the price of U.S. vehicles by $83 billion (63.32 billion pounds)annually, cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and sharply reduce auto sales. “The work is continuing.  Probably sometime in the month of August we’ll be willing to render a report,” Ross said. He added that tariffs on foreign autos “may not be necessary or it may be necessary - we will see.”  Foreign governments and automakers reject the suggestion that imported vehicles pose a national security risk and no automaker has backed the idea. They have insisted the probe was only opened to press for concessions in trade talks. “We had to take a route of trying to make it more painful for the other parties to continue bad practices than to drop them. And that’s why he put up tariffs to put pressure on. And it seems to be starting to work,” Ross said. “If we hadn’t had the threat of automotive tariffs, we never would have gotten to the point where we are now.” Trump’s threat to impose the 25 percent tariffs on auto imports, which would harm European carmakers such as BMW and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), was put on hold after he met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House on Wednesday to discuss ongoing trade disputes. Juncker called Trump’s decision to delay any tariffs as long as trade talks continue “a major concession.”      Other U.S. officials on Thursday also touted an agreement with the EU to negotiate a solution. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major U.S. and foreign automakers, said “bilateral negotiations are a more effective approach to resolving trade barriers, not increasing tariffs.” Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Dan Grebler and Tom Brown",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-autos/u-s-puts-auto-tariffs-on-hold-pending-outcome-of-eu-talks-ross-idUKKBN1KG2JU,2019-02-08,,U.S. puts auto tariffs on hold pending outcome of EU talks - Ross
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks set to pass a post-financial crisis milestone next week by finally raising interest rates above their emergency levels set more than nine years ago. But with a potentially messy Brexit nearing, Governor Mark Carney may sound cautious about the pace of further moves away from the BoE’s still-powerful stimulus programme. In March 2009, when the financial crisis was raging, the BoE  slashed its benchmark rate to 0.5 percent to stave off the risk of a depression.  Bank Rate has sat there since, apart from a 15-month period after the shock referendum vote in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union, when it was cut again to 0.25 percent - the lowest in the three-century history of the central bank. Now, Carney and his colleagues are expected to nudge rates up to 0.75 percent on Aug. 2, going beyond last November’s increase back up to 0.5 percent.  However, taking rates above their crisis levels will not be a vote of confidence in the world’s fifth-biggest economy.  Britain has gone from having the strongest growth of the Group of Seven rich nations to being one of the slowest after the Brexit decision.  The terms of Britain’s future relationship with the EU are still unclear, eight months before Brexit, and Prime Minister Theresa May could yet be unseated by her own Conservative Party which is split on how close the country should remain to the bloc. At the same time, consumers are still feeling a squeeze on their spending power. And inflation, while above the BoE’s 2 percent target at 2.4 percent, has been weaker than expected. Nonetheless, the BoE says the economy cannot grow even at its current sluggish rate without causing too much inflation, given Britain’s chronically weak productivity growth. A BoE decision to raise borrowing costs could also be backed up by a new estimate of what it considers the neutral interest rate for Britain’s economy, which neither stimulates nor suppresses demand and which is likely to be rising in the coming years as the effects of the financial crisis fade. U-TURN AHEAD? BoE officials have tried to soothe concerns about raising rates, something they promise will be gradual and limited. “Voting for a 25 basis-point rate rise, a full decade after monetary policy was first placed on an emergency setting, is hardly either surprising or radical,” Chief Economist Andy Haldane said in late June. But some analysts believe raising borrowing costs is an unnecessary risk that the central bank is taking because it failed to deliver on previous signals that a hike was coming. John Wraith, a strategist at UBS, said domestic inflation pressure — chiefly from wage growth — was very benign while tighter monetary conditions risked triggering a squeeze on indebted consumers and cooling domestic demand. “If and when that happens, the interest rate market may start to anticipate a reversion by the (BoE) to a neutral policy stance, especially if there are ongoing headwinds and downside risks to the outlook emanating from the UK’s protracted exit from the EU,” he said in a note to clients, adding that investors might even start to bet on a rate cut ahead. Yet the chance of an increase on Thursday is rated at 80 percent by financial markets, and eight of the BoE’s nine monetary policymakers are likely to back a rise, analysts say. Investors will be listening closely for whatever signals Carney gives about the outlook for further increases. Markets are not pricing in an increase in borrowing costs to 1 percent for at least another year. In the past, Carney has warned investors they are being too relaxed about the prospect of further hikes. Victoria Clarke, an economist with Investec, said the BoE might want to send another reminder to the market to remain on guard, as long as Britain manages to secure a deal with the EU and avoid a damaging “cliff-edge” Brexit. “We don’t know what politics will bring but I think Carney would want to push those expectations up a bit,” Clarke said. editing by David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-boe/bank-of-england-poised-to-push-rates-above-crisis-lows-idUKKBN1KG1ZH,2019-02-08,The Bank of England looks set to pass a post-financial crisis milestone next week by finally raising interest rates above their emergency levels set more than nine years ago.,Bank of England poised to push rates above crisis lows
2019-02-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A bomb exploded outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing on Thursday, wounding the lone assailant, the embassy said in a statement, although police described the weapon merely as a “firework device”. The explosion happened on the street outside southeast corner of the embassy compound. Beijing police said the suspect, a 26-year-old man from China’s Inner Mongolia region whom they identified only by the surname Jiang, had injured his hand and had been taken to hospital. Police did not provide a motive but said in a statement via their official account on the Chinese social networking service Weibo that the suspect had a history of mental illness and was once hospitalised for treatment. The suspect was hearing voices, the statement said. China and the United States have been involved in a trade dispute initiated by Washington, with the two sides imposing tariffs on $34 billion (£25.8 billion) worth of each other’s goods. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened ultimately to impose punitive tariffs on all Chinese imports. While Chinese officials and state media have been outspoken in their criticism of Washington’s trade moves, there has not been a groundswell of outrage on China’s heavily censored social media, and no reported boycotts of U.S. goods.   Witnesses told Reuters that they heard an explosion near the embassy and felt tremors. “I’d just arrived and started to queue and then heard a loud explosion about 100 metres away,” a 19-year-old high school student who gave his name as Li told reporters. Li said the blast happened shortly after 1 p.m. as he queued to apply for a U.S. visa to take an exam in Los Angeles. A police SUV appeared to have been damaged, with its back windshield missing, and was cordoned off by police before being removed, a Reuters witness said. The embassy resumed normal operations at about 1.45 p.m., it said. Crowds were still queueing outside the embassy after the explosion, and traffic was moving as normal in an area of northeastern Beijing that is home to numerous embassies including those of France, India and Israel. Postings on social media showed pictures of smoke close to where people line up outside the compound for visa appointments. Some video clips and images were later removed. Li Shaohui, a 58-year-old sanitation worker, said he felt the ground shake and that some people screamed. “I thought first there was a big car crash,” Li told Reuters, adding that the smoke had cleared quickly. There was no damage to U.S. embassy property, the embassy said. Staff members at the Indian and South Korean embassies said they were unaware of any unusual incident and were working as normal. The state-run Global Times reported separately, citing witnesses, that police took away a woman who sprayed herself with gasoline in a suspected self-immolation attempt outside the embassy at around 11 a.m. It was not clear whether this woman’s actions were related to the later explosion, the paper said. A witness who did not want to be identified told Reuters that he saw a middle-aged woman with two buckets of gasoline. On her back were the Chinese characters for “sue them”. Beijing police and the U.S. embassy did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the woman. Security in the Chinese capital is tight and protests are often quickly disbanded. Violent crime rates are low in China, according to official statistics.

2019-02-08,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - For Pakistani cricket legend-turned-politician Imran Khan, his party’s first place in a national election, putting him on the brink of becoming the country’s next prime minister, is the culmination of a battle that started more than two decades ago. For years, he was dismissed as a political dilettante who could not convert his personal popularity into significant seats in parliament for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), or Pakistan Movement for Justice, he founded. But Wednesday’s election has dramatically changed that, putting the former sports star on the brink of power. With nearly half the votes counted, PTI held a commanding lead and Khan declared victory in a speech on Thursday. Khan could join George Weah, one of Africa’s greatest footballers who took over as president of Liberia earlier this year, as the only other international sports personality to head his country’s government.  As prime minister, Khan, 65, would be tested on several fronts, from dealing with an urgent foreign currency shortage to managing a tense relationship with the United States. “I don’t discount the role that experience in sports leadership can translate into other domains,” said Sameer Lalwani, co-director of the South Asia program at the Stimson Center think tank. “(But) he has never had to govern... I worry that what we’ve seen about his public profile and the way he portrays himself, that he is much more likely to surround himself with sycophants.” Khan will also have to battle allegations that he has been helped by Pakistan’s powerful military both during the campaign and in the vote count - rival parties have said soldiers at voting centres threw out their observers when counting began. Khan promised to investigate voting complaints, but has said those who accuse him of military help are trying to preserve a corrupt system. The army, which has ruled the country for almost half its history, denies interfering in politics. An Oxford graduate, Khan campaigned hard on populist promises of a prosperous Pakistan that breaks away from its persistent legacy of corruption. Before the advent of PTI, Pakistani politics had been dominated by two parties - former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People’s Party of assassinated former leader Benazir Bhutto - when the military has not been in power.      Khan began his cricket career in 1971 as a fast bowler known for his pace and aggressive tactics. By the time he retired more than 20 years later, he was regarded as one of the world’s best ever all-rounders. A glamorous fixture of London’s high society in his younger days, he was captain of Pakistan’s team of talented but wayward stars and - with a reputation as a stern taskmaster - led them to win cricket’s World Cup for the first time in 1992. He is still known as “Kaptaan” (captain) in Pakistan.  After his retirement, Khan raised funds to open a cancer hospital in the memory of his mother in his native Lahore in 1994. He has mostly shed the playboy image and made public shows of devotion to Islam, building a large political following in northern Pakistan, especially with the conservative Pashtun population. Earlier this year, he married his spiritual adviser. Khan’s previous two marriages, particularly when he wed his first wife, British heiress Jemima Khan, had captivated international tabloids. Khan started the PTI in 1996, but until 2013 it briefly held only one seat in parliament. “It’s been a 22-year struggle for justice for the people of Pakistan,” Khan told Reuters in an interview earlier this month.  His party became the country’s third-largest in the National Assembly in the previous election, benefiting in part from a groundswell of support, especially from young, urban voters fed up with the country’s corruption. Khan has been critical of the United States’ policy in the region and vocally opposed drone strikes on Pakistani territory. He would have to manage a tense relationship with Washington, which has accused Islamabad of not doing enough to root out Taliban militants. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States had “foolishly” given Pakistan more than $33 billion (£25.2 billion) in aid. Khan opposes the United States’ open-ended presence in Afghanistan. In his victory speech on Thursday, he said he wanted “mutually beneficial” relations with Washington, and peace in Afghanistan. “I do think he will be publicly more adversarial.. (But) he is certainly capable of being more pragmatic, that just hasn’t served his purposes in campaigning and branding himself,” said a former senior U.S. official, who has met Khan several times. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Khan’s stance on the United States would likely be moderated by Pakistan’s powerful military, which seeks a more stable relationship with America. Khan will also have to urgently resolve a currency crisis that threatens Pakistan’s fast-growing economy, which expanded by 5.8 percent in the past year but will most likely need its second bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2013. He has said his future government will launch an anti-corruption campaign and poverty reduction program modelled on China, Pakistan’s traditional ally that has financed billions of dollars of infrastructure projects. At the same time, he has promised to build an “Islamic welfare state”, create 10 million jobs and build 5 million homes for the poor. Asked how he would fund such social spending, Khan has vowed to double Pakistan’s woefully low tax collection rates - the country has one of the world’s lowest tax-to-GDP ratios - by reforming the “corrupt” Federal Bureau of Revenue. “Instead of making policies for a small elite, we will make all policies for this poor class, the oppressed class,” he said on Thursday.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday vigorously defended President Donald Trump’s foreign policy actions as senators from both parties denounced Trump’s behaviour, particularly at his recent summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Pompeo faced tough questioning from Democrats and Republicans during testimony before the Senator Foreign Relations Committee about Trump’s failure to hold the Russian president accountable for Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election at their meeting in Helsinki last week.  “I have tremendous faith in you, I think you’re a patriot ... but it’s the president’s actions that create tremendous distrust in our nation,” the committee’s Republican chairman, Bob Corker, told Pompeo. “Is there some strategy behind creating doubt in U.S. senators’ minds, on both sides of the aisle, doubt in the American people as to what his motivations are?” added Corker, a frequent critic of Trump. Corker also criticized comments by Trump that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was “very talented” and that “he loves his people,” given the country’s serious human rights abuses. “Really?” Corker said. Pompeo said he had been comprehensively briefed on Trump’s one-on-one meeting with Putin, who U.S. intelligence agencies said knew about Russia’s meddling in the election. Putin has said no such interference occurred and Trump has denied there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow. The matter is under investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In often testy exchanges with senators, Pompeo listed actions by the Trump administration against Russia, including what he said were over 200 sanctions against Moscow. Just before his testimony, Pompeo issued a statement restating U.S. policy rejecting Russia’s annexation of Crimea. The “Crimea Declaration” appeared to try to quell suggestions that Washington could accept Moscow’s 2014 occupation of the Ukrainian peninsula following the Trump-Putin meeting and questions about what Trump agreed to in the one-on-one talks.  Trump has repeatedly declined to hold Putin accountable for annexing Crimea, pointing to former President Barack Obama instead for allowing it to happen under his watch. “The United States rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea and pledges to maintain this policy until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored,” Pompeo said in the statement. “The United States calls on Russia to respect the principles to which it has long claimed to adhere and to end its occupation of Crimea,” he said. Pompeo later reassured senators that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until Moscow returned control of Crimea to Ukraine. Russia’s Foreign Ministry quickly dismissed Pompeo’s comments. “We know the worth of such momentous declarations,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on her Facebook account. Speaking after the summit, Putin said Trump believed that Russia’s annexation of Crimea was legal based on a referendum. White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday that Trump would postpone a second meeting with Putin until next year after the federal probe into the alleged meddling is over. Trump said last week he would invite Putin to Washington for an autumn meeting, a move that sparked a new outcry, including from lawmakers in Trump’s Republican Party, who argued that Putin was an adversary not worthy of a White House visit. Pompeo declined to offer details of what he knew about the Helsinki meeting. He said conversations between the president and his Cabinet should remain private. “You come before a group of senators today who are filled with serious doubts about this White House and its conduct of American foreign policy,” Corker said. Democrats like Senator Chris Coons voiced concern about how Trump’s courting of Putin unsettled long-standing allies. “While your statements have been clear, our president’s statements have confused our allies, encouraged our adversaries and have failed to be comparably clear and I’m concerned that an invitation to President Putin to the White House without clarity about his threats to our election, his threats to our allies, puts at risk clarity,” Coons said.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will postpone a second meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin until next year after the federal probe into Russian election meddling is over, national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday. Trump said last week he would invite Putin to Washington for an autumn meeting, a daring rebuttal to fierce criticism over their summit in Helsinki, in which he appeared to give credence to the Russian leader’s assertion that Moscow did not interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The invitation sparked a new outcry, including from lawmakers in Trump’s Republican party, who argued that Putin is an adversary not worthy of a White House visit and that they still did not know what the leaders had discussed during their two-hour, one-on-one meeting. “The president believes that the next bilateral meeting with President Putin should take place after the Russia witch hunt is over, so we’ve agreed that it will be after the first of the year,” Bolton said in a statement. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered to sway the vote towards Trump, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump’s campaign worked with the Russians. Trump rejected the criticism sparked by his Helsinki news conference with Putin and said he misspoke in a series of flip-flops over the summit. He then abruptly issued the invitation to Putin. Reflecting the unease among U.S. lawmakers, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that Putin would not be invited to address Congress or visit the Capitol if he accepted Trump’s invitation. The Kremlin said this week that although Washington and Moscow agreed there was a need for another Putin-Trump meeting, Russia had not yet begun any practical preparations for a new meeting. “There are other options (to meet) which our leaders can look at,” aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters, citing a meeting of G20 leaders in Argentina which starts at the end of November. Trump has repeatedly called Mueller’s probe into meddling in the 2016 election a “witch hunt,” a claim that he repeated in a tweet the same day he met with Putin in Helsinki.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three British Jewish newspapers said on Wednesday that there would be an “existential threat to Jewish life in this country” if the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, won power from the ruling Conservative Party. The Jewish Chronicle, Jewish News and Jewish Telegraph said in a joint editorial titled “United We Stand” that the Labour Party had shown a tolerance of anti-Semitism since Corbyn was elected leader of the party in 2015. It said their response was needed “because of the existential threat to Jewish life in this country that would be posed by a Jeremy Corbyn-led government”. “The party that was, until recently, the natural home for our community has seen its values and integrity eroded by Corbynite contempt for Jews and Israel,” the editorial said. A Labour spokesman said the party recognised the concerns raised by the Jewish community and acknowledged there was a “huge amount of work to do” to build trust and confidence. “The next Labour government poses no threat of any kind whatsoever to Jewish people,” the spokesman said. “The security and wellbeing of Jewish people is a priority for our party and in government we will always ensure schools, synagogues and institutions are properly protected.” Labour is benefiting from turmoil in Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives over Brexit, and has taken the lead in some opinion polls.  While an election need not be held for another four years, the wrangling over Britain’s divorce from the European Union has raised the possibility of a vote much sooner as May struggles to keep her government together. But, Labour has been wrestling with accusations that it has been tolerant of anti-Semitism among some of its members, and in April leaders of Britain’s 270,000 Jews organised a protest accusing Corbyn of failing to address their concerns. “With the government in Brexit disarray, there is a clear and present danger that a man with a default blindness to the Jewish community’s fears, a man who has a problem seeing that hateful rhetoric aimed at Israel can easily step into anti-Semitism, could be our next prime minister,” the newspapers wrote.  Corbyn has previously apologised for what he called “pockets” of anti-Semitism in the party and promised to stamp them out. He has responded to protests by meeting with Jewish community leaders reassuring Jews they are welcome in the party.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - The number of dead from a fire which ripped through a Greek coastal town reached at least 81 on Wednesday as frantic relatives tried to track down people missing from the inferno and officials began the grim task of identifying bodies. Hundreds of people were trapped in the eastern resort of Mati on Monday night as flames whipped around them. Many jumped into the sea to survive but others died from suffocation, either in their cars or trapped on the edge of steep cliffs. One of the victims was Irishman Brian O’Callaghan-Westrop, Ireland’s ambassador to Athens Orla O’Hanrahan told Ireland’s RTE. The broadcaster said he was on his honeymoon. He and his wife Zoe, who survived, had got married last week.  The Greek anti-terrorist service was investigating suggestions that the blaze - one of several throughout the Attica region - was started deliberately, a security source said. Arson is often thought to be behind some fires in a crude attempt to clear forest land for building. The fire brigade said the death in hospital of one person who had initially survived brought the toll up to 81. The service had also received dozens of calls reporting missing people, but it was unclear if some of them were among those already found dead, a spokesperson said. Some people appeared on television to plead for help. “I’m looking for my mum,” a young woman told Greece’s SKAI TV between sobs.  The fire broke out on Monday at 4:57 p.m. (1357 GMT), an hour which is  observed as a siesta time in rural Greek communities. Mati was popular with local tourists, including pensioners. Rescue teams combed through the area and the sea on Wednesday trying to locate anything which could offer clarity on the missing, who are thought to number about 40. “We took our cars and went down to the sea and got into the sea to escape, but there were people who did not make it,” said Mati resident Agni Gantona. “We got into the water and stayed there for about five hours until the boats came to pick us up. We were at the beach with about 250, 300 people.  “Some were burned, some were near fainting from the smoke and the flames. Groups of us, we were holding each other by the hand and shouting each other’s names, because we could not see from the smoke.” With most of the corpses badly charred, identification of the dead will be challenging, experts said.  “Work has started on identifying the victims of the wildfires but the majority of the bodies are totally charred,” Grigoris Leon, head of the Hellenic Society of Forensic Medicine, told Reuters. It was unclear what caused the fire, which spread rapidly through the community. But some suggested that the sheer force of winds, thick pine, fire and panic was a deadly combination making even the most well-executed evacuation plan futile. “Armaggeddon,” wrote the daily newspaper Ethnos on its front page.   It carried a photo of a burned Greek flag hanging among the branches of a charred tree.

2019-02-08,"ATHENS (Reuters) - When the wind whipping wildfire through the pine forests around the Greek coastal village of Mati suddenly changed direction on Monday afternoon, it left residents with perhaps 20 minutes to save their lives. For the 81 or more who died, it was already too late. “Not even 1,000 airplanes would have helped prevent this catastrophe,” said Dimitris Stathopoulos, head of the union of fire brigade employees. “In that cursed hour, the fire became a blowtorch aimed at the settlement.” Fires are not uncommon in Greece’s forests, which cover almost half its territory, and the Mount Penteli area has suffered regularly in the past decades. But until Monday, the wind blew almost every fire inland towards the mountains, shielding Mati from all but minor damage. On Monday it suddenly swung around to come from the southwest, and picked up speed. Stathopoulos said the time window for any response was roughly 20 minutes. The Mayor of Marathon, Elias Psinakis, who is responsible for Mati, said that was simply not enough. “There is a civil protection plan, every municipality has one, but there is no time to do anything when the wind is so strong,” he told Skai TV. And that was when Mati’s basic vulnerabilities were suddenly exposed. “Unfortunately, this area is chaotically built ... people couldn’t find a way out to save themselves,” Stathopoulos said. “Most of the roads are dead ends ... and the rest are very narrow.”  Many Greek villages develop in a haphazard way - houses are often built without planning permission, which is then obtained retrospectively, without full compliance. Homes are embedded among pine trees. Viable evacuation routes are not a priority.  A string of torched cars on a road leading to the beach provide a chilling tableau of the scramble to find an escape route. They only drove into traffic jams or thick, treacherous smoke. Television footage showed that some cars had crashed in the race to leave, while some ended up nose-to-nose with other vehicles. “It’s tragic, it’s really tragic. It looks like the area was hit by a rocket,” said Leonidas Leonidou, head of a team of firefighters from Cyprus. “The fire went so fast, I’ve never seen anything like it, and I’ve got 38 years’ experience. It was like nature was conspiring.” Dozens of people are still missing, and rescue teams are still scouring the scorched land and the sea for survivors. Stathopoulos complained that some fire hydrants had failed to function. But he added that this time, the consequences of a decade of national debt crisis that had forced spending cuts in the fire brigade were not the main reason for the catastrophe. “I’ve often protested about shortages of funds or staff, about old equipment,” he said. “But this time, none of that could have stopped it.” Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-greece-wildfire-blowtorch/greeces-deadly-fire-a-blowtorch-no-one-could-stop-idUKKBN1KF2RT,2019-02-08,,Greece’s deadly fire: a 'blowtorch' no one could stop

2019-02-08,"SEKONG, Laos (Reuters) - Rescue teams from China and Thailand headed on Wednesday into a remote part of landlocked Laos, where more than 3,000 people were stranded after a dam collapse sent a deluge of water across a swathe of villages, domestic media said. The Vientiane Times, citing district Governor Bounhom Phommasane, said about 19 people had been “found dead”. While nearly 3,000 had been plucked to safety, more than that number were awaiting rescue, many on the rooftops of submerged homes. A senior Lao government official told Reuters by telephone from the capital, Vientiane, that dozens were feared dead after the failure of the dam - a subsidiary structure under construction as part of a hydroelectric project - on Monday. (Map locating the collapsed dam in Laos: tmsnrt.rs/2JLQY4F) “We will continue with rescue efforts today, but it’s very difficult, the conditions are very difficult. Dozens of people are dead. It could be higher,” said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.  A United Nations report on the disaster put the death toll at five, with 34 missing, 1,494 evacuated and 11,777 people in 357 villages affected. It said 20 houses were destroyed and more than 223 houses and 14 bridges damaged by the flooding. However, a government official said hundreds were reported missing after at least seven villages were submerged in the Attapeu province, the southernmost part of the country. State media showed pictures of villagers, some with young children, stranded on roofs of submerged houses, and others  trying to board wooden boats. Experts said the remoteness of the affected area could hamper relief operations. “The roads are very poor,” Ian Baird, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Laos expert, told Reuters by telephone.  “People don’t usually go in that area during the rainy season. There are mountains nearby that villagers might be able to get up on ... I don’t think anybody really knows for sure.” State media said a joint team of Lao and Chinese rescuers would reach Attapeu on Wednesday afternoon, and it showed a long line of cars with boats on trailers heading into the country from northeast Thailand. South Korea and Singapore have also offered to help in the rescue effort.  Laos, one of the world’s few remaining communist states and one of Asia’s poorest countries, has ambitions to become the “battery of Asia” through the construction of multiple dams. Its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build the dams under commercial concessions that involve the export of electricity to more developed neighbors, including power-hungry Thailand. Rights groups have repeatedly warned against the human and environmental cost of the dam drive, including damage to the already fragile ecosystem of the region’s rivers. Attapeu is a largely agricultural province that borders Vietnam to the east and Cambodia to the south. The dam that collapsed was part of the $1.2 billion Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. Known as “Saddle Dam D”, it was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. The project’s main partner, South Korea’s SK Engineering & Construction, said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers. The firm blamed the collapse on heavy rain.  Laos and its neighbors are in the middle of the monsoon season that brings tropical storms and heavy rain. Lao state media also posted images of flash flooding, with buildings and roads under water, further north in Khammouane province. An official at SK Engineering & Construction said fractures were discovered on the dam on Sunday and the company ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon the danger became clear. Shares in major stakeholders of SK E&C fell on Wednesday. SK E&C’s biggest shareholder, SK Holdings Co Ltd (034730.KS), was down 6.2 percent in its biggest daily percentage loss since Feb. 11, 2016. The second-biggest shareholder, SK Discovery Co Ltd (006120.KS), slid as much as 10 percent.  Laos expert Baird said the collapse of the subsidiary dam was unlikely to affect others in the project. “The water’s all out of the reservoir now and the water levels are already going down but I don’t think they’ll be able to fix it until the dry season,” he said.  Hydropower dams on the Mekong River’s lower mainstream pose a serious threat to the region, International Rivers, which works to stop destructive hydropower projects in Laos, said in April.  Predicted impacts include a decrease of 30 to 40 percent in fisheries by 2040 as well as a drastic cut in food security and farm productivity, as well as greater poverty in much of the Lower Mekong Basin.  Laos has finished building 11 dams, says Thai non-government group TERRA, with 11 more under construction and dozens planned.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s banking industry will emerge largely unscathed from Brexit and retain its position as one of the world’s top two financial centres for the foreseeable future, Barclays’ Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters. Home to the world’s highest number of banks and largest commercial insurance market, the City of London and its sister district in east London’s Canary Wharf are scrambling to prepare for Britain’s departure from the European Union, the biggest challenge the UK financial sector has faced since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. McFarlane shrugged off fears expressed by some bankers and politicians that a blueprint for Britain’s future trading relationship with the European Union, proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May, would cripple job creation and trigger London’s rapid decline as a global financial services centre. “I don’t think in the long run that there will be terminal damage [to London],” McFarlane said in an interview in his capacity as chair of lobby group The CityUK. Brexit will cost Britain up to 12,000 financial services jobs in the short term, the City of London financial district’s leader, Catherine McGuinness said on Tuesday, and many more jobs might disappear in the longer term. But McFarlane said London would remain Europe’s primary hub for financial services because the city has the continent’s deepest markets and broadest pool of talent, scotching doomsayers who claim the sector could end up the biggest loser from the end of unfettered access to EU markets. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but that long term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. A sharp spike in Italy’s cost of borrowing in late May also handed EU stakeholders a sobering reminder that the EU needs London’s markets as much as London needs the EU, McFarlane said. Short-term Italian bond yields suffered the biggest one-day jump since 1992 on May 29 after a fresh phase of political turmoil forced the government to pay the highest yield in more than five years at an auction of six-month debt.  And when prices tumbled, London-based traders and market makers with age-old relationships with the world’s biggest investors executed the largest volume of Italian government bond trading, McFarlane pointed out. “The only reason that was dealt with is because London existed. Given that we have a competitive advantage in those areas that is not easily replicated, that is a fair argument for why people need to use this system going forward. Because it is better than the alternative,” he said. The financial sector accounts for 12 percent of Britain’s economic output, but McFarlane said the government’s dismissal of the sector’s preferred plans for access to the EU single market post-Brexit will not be as destructive as some commentators have predicted. Many had pinned hopes on a bid for “mutual recognition” - whereby Britain and the EU would accept each other’s rules in exchange for broad two-way market access - as the best way to protect financial contracts and activity worth trillions of euros once Britain exits the EU on March 29. Prime Minister May has instead chosen to build trading ties on a legal mechanism known as “equivalence”, whereby the EU deems a country’s rules to be as robust as its own. McFarlane said the government now needed to act fast to negotiate “expanded equivalence” for Britain after critics said the regime exposed firms to sudden loss of EU market access. “You need to get on with it. Aggressively. Because radical change in this space is difficult,” he said. The EU has so far opposed any attempts to modify equivalence and said it has no plans to reform the regime. McFarlane, who has chaired the British lender and TheCityUK since 2015, said he was confident May would avert a potentially chaotic ‘no deal’ scenario, despite recent ructions in Westminster that have put further strain on Britain’s relationship with EU negotiators.  “I am always optimistic until I am pessimistic, and that line has not been crossed. While it is all to play for, we should play for it and secure it ... Economic logic must win through somewhere and therefore we have a very good chance of securing something,” he said. Concerns about the future prosperity of Britain’s financial services sector have surged since some of its biggest employers scrapped ‘wait and see’ policies on relocation, and began executing plans to shift people and resources from the UK to multiple EU outposts. Barclays has announced plans to shift up to 200 roles to the continent as part of its Brexit planning. McFarlane, however, said he felt reassured that May and her cabinet were striving to protect the interests of the private sector, despite statements to the contrary made by ex-ministers. Recalling a recent dinner attended by May, UK Finance Minister Philip Hammond and around 20 senior banking executives from all over Europe, McFarlane said both politicians impressed with their grasp of the biggest problems the industry faced. “She came, she had no notes but she was fully prepared and she was impressive. It was highly symbolic to that group that she cared,” he said.  “I don’t think the official part of government is dismissive of business ... if anything, they are fighting our corner.” Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-city/barclays-boss-says-uk-finance-sector-will-dodge-brexit-bullet-idUKKBN1KF0OB,2019-02-08,,Barclays boss says UK finance sector will dodge Brexit bullet
2019-02-08,"MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Warnings from carmakers Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) and General Motors (GM.N) weighed on European shares on Wednesday as investors braced for a high-level trade meeting in Washington. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Trump were expected to focus on trade and the U.S.’s President  threatened tariffs on U.S. car imports from Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600  fell 0.3 percent as auto stocks, which rely heavily on exports for growth, declined 1.9 percent to lead sectoral losers in the region. Greg Valliere, Chief Global Strategist at Horizon Investments, said expectations over the meeting were low. “There are only two likely outcomes from today’s talks at the White House: either a pledge to continue negotiations, or a complete breakdown in talks,” he said.  “A third option – signs of a deal with Europe on tariffs – does not appear to be imminent, which means steep new U.S. auto tariffs are still on the table,” he added. In European afternoon hours, the Washington Post reported that several of Trump’s senior economic advisers believe he plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on close to $200 billion of foreign-made automobiles later this year. That further weighed on auto stocks, which had already been hammered earlier in the day by disappointing earning updates from Fiat Chrysler and General Motors, both partly due to trade tariffs. Fiat Chrysler reported second-quarter operating profit below expectations and it cut its full-year outlook in response to a weaker performance in China.  Its shares fell 15.5 percent, it second biggest daily fall ever. Fiat’s warning came a few days after the group named its Jeep brand head Mike Manley as CEO to succeed Sergio Marchionne, who died on Wednesday after surgery complications. German carmakers Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), which are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, both fell more than 2 percent. Elsewhere, luxury stocks gained after conglomerate LVMH (LVMH.PA) reported strong profits and said Chinese shoppers were still snapping up goods at its major brands including Louis Vuitton. Its shares rose 1.8 percent, hovering near record highs, while Gucci owner Kering (PRTP.PA) added 2.6 percent and Hermes (HRMS.PA) gained 1.2 percent. Tech stocks were dragged down by chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM.MI), which fell 8.8 percent after reporting results in line with expectations, and slightly weaker margins. Traders said in-line results were not good enough to drive further gains as investors expect strong growth from tech companies such as STMicro.   Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) fell 1.4 percent after Germany’s largest bank detailed progress on its restructuring and announced a 14 percent drop in net profit in the second quarter, which was marked by weakness in its key trading business.       In encouraging results, Swiss drug ingredients maker Lonza (LONN.S) rose 6.6 percent after upgrading its 2018 sales growth target, while French appliances company SEB (SEBF.PA) jumped 9 percent after it also raised its sales growth guidance. Telefonica Deutschland (O2Dn.DE) reported a narrower than expected loss, sending its shares up 8.1 percent as investors cheered the strong results. Indivior (INDV.L) sank 7.7 percent after the British drug company said the blow from the launch of a copycat of its opioid addiction treatment would be bigger than expected this year. Overall second-quarter European earnings growth is expected to come in at 8.1 percent year-on-year, better than the first quarter. “Equities continue to be supported by strong earnings which have helped to reduce multiples to normal levels,” said Abi Oladimeji, chief investment officer at Thomas Miller Investment. So far, healthcare and technology sectors have delivered the lion’s share of positive earnings surprises, while banks have also performed better than expected after analysts revised estimates down ahead of results. In dealmaking moves, Belgian insurer Ageas (AGES.BR) rose 3.2 percent after a report Chinese conglomerate Fosun (0656.HK) was planning to bid for parts or the whole of the company.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union’s budget commissioner suggested on Wednesday the bloc would be ready to discuss mutual tariff cuts with the United States across a range of products, provided Washington lifts recent punitive tariffs first. Speaking before an EU delegation travels to Washington for talks on Wednesday on a long-term trade deal, Guenther Oettinger said the EU wanted the United States to first drop its new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. “Firstly, our common line is that we expect the existing punitive tariffs to be lifted,” Oettinger, a German, said of the EU’s position. “Then we are ready to discuss a reduction and restructuring of all tariffs in all sectors.” “In this way, we want to avoid a further escalation of the trade conflict, and to avoid a trade war,” he told broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. “One could try to untangle the existing tariffs and then ... reduce tariffs for various goods and services.” “That would be a negotiation that would be possible in half a year, and which we could start with the U.S. in the autumn.” Oettinger suggested the EU and the United States could try to negotiate a lighter version of a stalled comprehensive U.S.-European trade deal known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). “One could try for a TTIP light,” he said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker travels to Washington on Wednesday for talks focused on trade tensions after the U.S. imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminum and U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to extend those measures to European cars. On Monday, the Commission said Juncker would not arrive in the United States for the talks with Trump with a specific trade offer. “Anything would be better than a trade war,” said Oettinger. Trump has repeatedly complained about the European Union, pointing to the higher duties it applies for car imports and describing the bloc as a “foe” in trade. EU officials have said that, while EU import duties for cars are heavier than those of the United States, for other products, such as trucks, U.S. rates are higher. European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom, who will accompany Juncker, said last week that the EU was preparing a list of U.S. products to hit if the United States imposed tariffs on EU cars.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has put forward a “real offer” to a win a deal on leaving the European Union by October, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday, suggesting the government would not shift much from its agreed negotiating stance. With just under three months before Britain and the EU want to agree a deal to end over 40 years of union, Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to sell what she calls her business-friendly Brexit to her own party and across a divided country. The EU has tentatively welcomed what has become known as the Chequers plan, but also says the proposals for a free trade areas with the bloc on goods raises “more questions than answers” and has stepped up its warnings of a “no deal” outcome. But May’s two negotiators, Raab and Europe adviser Oliver Robbins, suggested that the Chequers plan was Britain’s last attempt to get a deal that will usher in the country’s biggest policy shift for decades. “This is, as we have engaged in that dialogue towards the end date of October, a real offer to get us across the line,” Raab told a parliamentary committee. “We are at a mature stage in these negotiations, this isn’t our opening pitch ... What I would say is this is a far advanced, well thought-out, principled and pragmatic document and we expect to negotiate on the basis of it.” But asked if negotiators had received any informal assurances from the EU that the Chequers plan would be accepted, Robbins said: “No ... not in those terms.” He added: “Over months now, ministers, the prime minister and of course the official team supporting them have been sounding European parliaments out on all of the issues.” “CHERRY-PICKING” EU officials have voiced concern that Britain is still trying to “cherry-pick” the best bits of their union, suggesting a customs arrangement on goods but ending free movement of people - one of the bloc’s four basic freedoms.  May had to fight hard to secure the agreement of her cabinet of ministers at her Chequers country residence earlier this month for her vision for Britain’s future relationship with the EU. But as soon as she hailed that agreement, two key ministers - both hardline Brexiteers - resigned and were followed out of the door by junior officials in protest at what they said was a flawed plan that, in keeping close economic ties with the EU, would not honour the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Some MPs in her Conservative Party fear that she will be forced to offer up more in the negotiations - something that could further enrage eurosceptics who fear that May will preside over a “Brexit in name only”. And the bitterness among Brexit supporters at the parliamentary committee was clearly targeted at Robbins, with some suggesting he had hijacked the talks and softened May’s position. A statement confirming that May’s office, and not the Brexit ministry, was spearheading the negotiations did little to soothe those concerns. But Raab was upbeat, saying he believed Britain would get a good deal with the EU, though that it would be a challenge to get an agreement on the future trading relationship by Brexit day in March next year. He told the parliamentary committee: “I think that would be a challenge, but one that I am up for.” Additional reporting by Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Mark Heinrich",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu/a-real-offer-raab-suggests-brexit-proposal-to-eu-may-be-final-idUKKBN1KE2B7,2019-02-08,,'A real offer' - Raab suggests Brexit proposal to EU may be final
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is planning the biggest change to takeover rules in almost two decades, giving the government new powers to block deals in all sectors of the economy to prevent UK companies in sensitive industries from falling into foreign hands. The business minister, Greg Clark, wants to tighten the existing rules, which are limited to large transactions, to cover all British companies including small firms. The changes mark a new era of government oversight of business activity in the world’s fifth-largest economy which has traditionally been one of the most open markets to global mergers and acquisitions.  It comes amid a boom in global merger and acquisition activity in which Britain has remained the second most popular target nation for deals behind the United States. About $277 billion (£210.7 billion) of offers for UK firms were announced in the first six months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The changes mirror efforts in the United States, Germany, France and Australia, where there are concerns that China and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies. Chinese foreign direct investment into Britain reached a record level last year with firms acquiring a slew of energy, technology and property assets. Its foreign ministry said on Tuesday China hoped Britain would provide a fair investment environment for foreign firms. Britain, which wants to reinvent itself as a global trading nation after deciding to leave the European Union, is seeking to balance the demands of safeguarding its strategic industries while continuing to court foreign investors. Prime Minister Theresa May, who is struggling with a rebellion in her party over her Brexit plans, has struck a more cautious tone on deals since becoming prime minister in 2016. “These proposals will ensure we have the appropriate safeguards to protect our national security whilst ensuring our economy remains unashamedly pro-business and open to high levels of foreign investment in the future,” Clark said. Under the new rules, the government will have the power to intervene when a company wants to acquire an asset such as a particular piece of technology, land or intellectual property rather just when they are seeking to buy or take control of a firm. At present the government can only intervene if a deal creates a group with 25 percent of the market or with turnover of over 70 million pounds. That has already been reduced to 1 million pounds for companies that make technology with military or dual-use applications. Scrapping the revenue and market threshold targets illustrates the perceived threat to national security if smaller companies with advanced technology are acquired by foreign governments.  For the first time, breaches of the government’s recommendations over such deals will also be classified as a criminal rather than a civil offence. Deals that take place beyond the UK’s borders might also trigger a probe. “The types of transactions that could be reviewed are broad,” said Samantha Mobley of law firm Baker McKenzie. “Somewhat controversially, the government wants the ability to review acquisitions of influence or control over assets outside of the UK if these could threaten UK national security.”  The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy expects to review around 50 deals a year on national security grounds, compared to one so far this year and one last year. Last year, the government approved the sale of Sepura, which makes walkie-talkies for London’s police, to China’s Hytera Communications 002583.SZ after a probe. Earlier this month, the government also examined the impact on national security of the sale of Northern Aerospace to Chinese-owned Gardner Aerospace Holdings Ltd.  Government officials say the changes will be the most significant to takeover rules since the 2002 Enterprise Act, which allowed a merger to be blocked if it hurt media plurality, national security or public contracts. On becoming prime minister in July 2016 May delayed the multibillion-pound Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project, which is being built by French state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA) and part-financed by China.  She ultimately approved the deal but said her government would take a more cautious approach over similar foreign investments in the future. A government report last week found that technical and supply-chain issues with equipment made by Chinese firm Huawei have exposed Britain’s telecom networks to new security risks. The rule change comes as Britain seeks to demonstrate a more positive approach to foreign direct investment as it prepares to negotiate trade deals after leaving the European Union. Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which assesses potential foreign investment to ensure it does not harm national security, has made it harder for Chinese firms to buy U.S. assets.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government on Tuesday for failing business with its “botched” Brexit plan, saying only his Labour Party could make Britain’s departure from the European Union work for manufacturers. Unveiling a Labour campaign to boost manufacturing and keep public contracts in Britain, Corbyn took aim at Prime Minister Theresa May for driving a Brexit plan that would leave Britain “in hock to Donald Trump”. In a bid to sell the benefits of his Brexit vision of negotiating a new customs union, Corbyn piled pressure on May, who is struggling to sell her plans to not only the competing factions in her governing Conservative Party but across Britain just over eight months before the country is due to leave. But Corbyn also faces dissent in his party, with many Labour MPs and members calling for him to back a second referendum on any deal and support keeping the closest possible ties with the EU by staying in its single market and customs union.  “Theresa May and her warring cabinet should think again, even at this late stage, and reconsider the option of negotiating a brand new customs union,” Corbyn told the EEF manufacturers’ organisation in the city of Birmingham. “A botched ... Brexit will sell our manufacturers short with the fantasy of a free trading buccaneering future, which in reality would be a nightmare of chlorinated chicken, public services sold to multinational companies and our country in hock to Donald Trump,” he said in a speech. May has often said she wants to forge a free trade agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump after Brexit, but some MPs fear the government could open the door to imports of U.S. beef that contains growth hormones, chicken washed in chlorinated water and genetically modified organisms. The government has frequently said it will not lower its standards and will pursue a “business-friendly” Brexit, but with its plans opposed by many in Britain, Corbyn senses his vision may find more support. No election is due in Britain until 2022 but Labour is preparing for a vote, aware that the Conservatives are increasingly at war with each other over Brexit. Conservative Robert Jenrick, a minister at the finance department, said Corbyn’s words were “laughable coming from the Labour Party who oversaw millions of jobs lost and a record decline in manufacturing”. Corbyn’s speech, “Build it in Britain”, was a direct appeal for the backing of British companies, promising more support from the state.  He said again that a Labour government would pursue “exemptions or clarifications” on state aid rules, which prevent countries handing organisations an advantage by using state resources, from the EU, something the bloc may not agree to. “But whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, we will use the powers we have to the full. Where there is a will there is a way and if we need to support our manufacturing sector we will find a way to do it,” he said.  Highlighting that some business and union groups support  trying to negotiate a new customs union, Corbyn went further to say he would also try to bring public contracts back in-house. “Labour will reprogramme our economy so that it works for the people of Britain and not against them,” he said. “And we will build this economy, this future fair for all, right here in Britain.” Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Ros Russell and Alison Williams",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-labour/end-botched-brexit-and-protect-jobs-corbyn-says-idUKKBN1KD2MJ,2019-02-08,"Jeremy Corbyn criticised the government on Tuesday for failing business with its ""botched"" Brexit plan, saying only his Labour Party could make Britain's departure from the European Union work for manufacturers.","End 'botched' Brexit and protect jobs, Corbyn says"
2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Tuesday it was seeking to resurrect a high-profile prosecution of Barclays (BARC.L) over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during the credit crisis two months after a London court dismissed its case. The agency had been praised as “fearless” for taking on one of the world’s largest banks when it first charged Barclays and four former senior executives - including a one-time chief executive - with criminal offences in June 2017. But the prosecution fell at the first hurdle after a London court in May threw out its charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance against Barclays Plc - and a charge of unlawful financial assistance against its subsidiary, Barclays Bank Plc. Barclays had been charged over payments to Qatari investors in connection with a two-part, 12 billion pound ($16 billion) emergency fundraising, that included a $3 billion loan to Qatar at the height of the credit crisis in 2008. The deal allowed the bank to avoid a state bailout. The SFO said it had applied to the High Court for permission to serve a draft indictment, a rare legal procedure once called a “voluntary bill of indictment”, that allows prosecutors to challenge a decision made in the lower Crown Court.  The SFO last applied for a voluntary bill of indictment unsuccessfully in a Welsh mining rights case in 2014 — and lawyers said it was a risky strategy. “The SFO is attempting a second bite of the cherry, which could be a high-risk strategy and viewed as a misstep,” said Charles Kuhn, a partner at law firm Clyde & Co. Barclays, which said in May it expected the SFO to try to reinstate the case, plans to oppose the application. It declined to comment on the substance of the SFO’s case. The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested more than 6 billion pounds in Barclays. Authorities examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as “advisory services agreements” and the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, a process known as financial assistance. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing.  Any failure to revive the case would mark a major setback for the SFO, which narrowly avoided being rolled into a broader crime-fighting agency last year. It is awaiting the arrival in September of new director Lisa Osofsky, a former FBI lawyer. The SFO dropped an investigation into Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) and individuals in July over alleged rate-rigging, blaming insufficient evidence. Barclays shares were trading 1.35 percent firmer at 1244 GMT, outperforming a 0.8 percent rise on the FTSE 100.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit will cost Britain up to 12,000 financial services jobs in the short-term, the City of London financial district’s leader said on Tuesday, and many more jobs might disappear in the longer term. At the lower end of the scale, 3,500 jobs could be lost to EU states, Catherine McGuinness told parliament’s Exiting the European Union Committee. More than 2 million people work in financial services across Britain, with 396,000 in London. “We are not expecting a big Brexodus in the first instance. But depending on how things pan out ... in the longer term, we may see many more go,” McGuinness told lawmakers. Banks, insurers and asset managers in Britain are opening hubs in the EU before Britain’s departure from the EU in March to ensure continuity in services to customers there. So far, there have been 1,600 confirmed job moves, a City of London spokeswoman said separately. The City was disappointed that Britain’s government ditched its preferred option of future EU trade based on mutual recognition, whereby Britain and the EU accept each other’s rules under two-way regulatory cooperation. “We had expected continued support for mutual recognition,” McGuinness said. Instead, Britain has asked for financial-services access based on a more accommodative version of the EU’s equivalence system, used by Japan and the United States, whereby Brussels alone decides who gets access. The EU had already dismissed mutual recognition and has said it won’t adapt its equivalence system in the way Britain wants. “We can all see it’s going to be an uphill task to persuade the EU27,” McGuinness said. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said that opting for some form of equivalence posed a risk that Britain would end up becoming a “rule taker” - having to continue copying EU rules in return for access after Brexit. “You are asking the EU to partner with you in a way to make equivalence work in future. Equivalence... is something the EU considers proprietary,” Evans said. “It’s quite a big psychological ask.” There was plenty of opportunity for “mischief making” by EU states topping up equivalence with national rules, Evans said. The lawmakers also quizzed the broadcasting and tech sectors about Britain’s “White Paper” proposals for future EU trade, which calls for full access for goods, but less access for services in return for flexibility to diverge from EU rules. Sammy Wilson, a committee member, accused the industry officials of giving “alarmist evidence”, adding that foreign direct investment in financial services was around a 10-year high. “You are now trying to do an Airbus on us with the kind of evidence you have been giving,” Wilson said, referring to  Brexit warnings from the European aircraft manufacturer that angered some government ministers. “There is no getting away that Brexit is deeply suboptimal,” Evans replied. “This isn’t a scare story,” added McGuinness. The government also ditched mutual recognition for broadcasters from its White Paper but, unlike with banks, proposed no alternative, Adam Minns, executive director of Commercial Broadcasters Association, told lawmakers. “The White Paper for us was a backward step. We are not certain if we are being thrown under a bus or just hitting a temporary roadblock. This could not have come at a worst time,” Minns said. Britain is home to 1,200 international TV channels that beam programmes to viewers in the European Union, but without an EU licence they would have to relocate, Minns said. Giles Derrington, head of Brexit policy at techUK, said the sector wanted the same trade-off as proposed for goods, meaning EU rules in return for EU access, but without flexibility to diverge. The tech sector struggles to see where the benefits of diverging from EU rules would come from, Derrington said. Lawmakers asked whether the industry officials if they would like Britain to join Norway in the European Economic Area, whose members must follow EU rules but without any say over them. “I look at the EEA longingly. We don’t desire more flexibility at the moment,” Minns said.

2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German football star Mesut Ozil’s decision to quit the national team due to “racism and disrespect” he faced over his Turkish roots triggered a bad-tempered public debate on Monday about the country’s relations with its largest immigrant community. The most prominent German politician of Turkish origin said it would be difficult for the head of the national football association to stay in the role, adding that Ozil’s departure would only be welcomed by those who opposed diversity.  Ozil’s announcement on social media late on Sunday led national newspapers to clear their front pages for the midfielder, 29, a key member of Germany’s World Cup-winning side in 2014 - and also of the side eliminated at the group stage of the 2018 tournament in Russia. The player, who came under fire for having his photograph taken with Turkey’s authoritarian President Tayyip Erdogan in May, was especially piqued by criticism from German Football Association (DFB) head Reinhard Grindel, who he said blamed him for Germany crashing out of this year’s tournament. A spokesman for the DFB did not respond immediately when asked for a comment from Grindel. Cem Ozdemir, the former head of the Greens party and the most prominent politician of Turkish background, said it would be difficult for Grindel to do his job in future given the diverse reality of Germany and its football team. “It will be very hard for Grindel after this,” he told Deutschlandfunk radio. “He doesn’t reflect the breadth of football in Germany and so it will be hard for German Turks, or indeed German Croats, to feel that the DFB is theirs.” Gokay Sofuoglu, leader of the Turkish community in Germany, called for Grindel to resign, adding: “Diversity in the national team was a great showcase project that is now at risk of failing due to incompetent leaders.” Former DFB President Theo Zwanziger was quoted in German media as saying the DFB had not done enough to solve conflicts ahead of the World Cup. “Communication mistakes mean something happened that should never happen to migrants: They should never feel like second-class Germans,” he said, adding: “Ozil’s resignation is a major setback for integration efforts beyond football in our country.” The DFB said it regretted Ozil’s departure but rejected his accusations of racism, saying it had for years helped to integrate people with migrant backgrounds and would continue to do so, adding: “The DFB stands for diversity”. A spokeswoman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday that most of the roughly three million people with Turkish roots living in Germany were well-integrated. She said Germany was a “cosmopolitan country” where people with migrant backgrounds were welcome and sport played a big role in integration. Merkel valued Ozil as a “great” footballer. The row coincides with a testy political debate in Germany about an influx of 1.6 million migrants since mid-2014 that has seen a rise of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party at the expense of traditional parties. It also exposed differences of opinion over the country’s large and well-established Turkish community. Hundreds of thousands of Turks came to Germany in the 1960s to help it tackle a shortage of labour as “guest workers” but little attempt was made to help them learn German and integrate. A survey by the WZB Berlin Social Science Center in June showed people of Turkish descent, like other groups with migrant backgrounds, suffered discrimination when they applied for jobs. Just as 2014’s victorious German side was celebrated for its diversity, so too was France’s World Cup-winning team in 2018 for having numerous key players with African ethnic roots. German football star Jerome Boateng, born in Berlin with a Ghanaian father, tweeted a photo of himself with Ozil and wrote: “It was a pleasure Abi”. “Abi” means brother in Turkish. But German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas questioned the debate around Ozil, who plays for English club Arsenal, saying: “I don’t believe the case of a multimillionaire living and working in England gives much insight into the success or failure of integration in Germany.” British anti-discriminatory body Kick It Out said the “racist treatment” Ozil had received at the hands of media, supporters and society was disappointing but reflected what a number of footballers with mixed heritage in Europe faced. Ozdemir said that even if Ozil had been naive, however, his departure would be “good news for Erdogan, for the AfD, all those who are against diversity.” AfD leader Alice Weidel wrote that: “The integration dream doesn’t work even with football millionaires,” describing Ozil’s “tirade” as a “typical example of failed integration”. In Turkey, however, politicians heaped praise on the player and lashed out at those who had abused him. “What Mesut Ozil went through and how he was treated is unforgivable. There is NO excuse for racism and discrimination,” Gulnur Aybet, a senior adviser to Erdogan wrote on Twitter. Ozil’s main sponsor, Adidas, said it would stand by him.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-germany-turkey/ozil-departure-puts-focus-on-german-relations-with-turkish-community-idUKKBN1KD17G,2019-02-08,,Ozil departure puts focus on German relations with Turkish community

2019-02-08,"DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh police have charged eight militants over a 2016 attack on a cafe in Dhaka that killed 22 people, and freed a British suspect detained without charge for the past two years. Briton Hasnat Karim was detained after the July 2016 attack in Dhaka on suspicion of being involved. Rights group Amnesty International had campaigned for his release. Karim was with his family celebrating his daughter’s 13th birthday at the café, when militants barged in, taking 22 hostages, mostly foreigners, who were killed over 12 hours.  Karim became a suspect after he agreed to a demand to act as a human shield during the ordeal, witnesses said at the time.  An investigation found Karim was not involved, Monirul Islam, the head of the police’s counter terrorism and transnational crime unit, said on Monday.  “During our two-year long investigation, we did not find any involvement (of Karim) in this attack directly or indirectly, so he was acquitted from this case,” Islam said. Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the cafe attack, though Bangladesh has denied the group’s involvement and Islam said the investigation showed no involvement of foreign militants. “All of them belong to (Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh), a home grown militant group,” he said, saying eight militants had been charged.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Quitting the EU could leave British households up to 960 pounds worse off each year, according to a report. Households will face higher prices as they absorb costs from labour changes, tariffs, and red tape, it said, whilst consumer businesses could see profits slump by 1-4 percent. The report by consulting firm Oliver Wyman focused on five different Brexit scenarios, where the size of the annual economic impact would vary between 245 and 960 pounds depending on whether the UK avoids EU tariffs.  The most costly scenario was predicted to be a deal where the UK reverted to World Trade Organisation (WTO) most-favoured nation (MFN) import tariffs, leaving the EU Customs Union and its Single Market. Consumer prices could be affected further by a devaluation of the pound and the likelihood that free trade deals with non-EU countries would fail adequately to mitigate the impact on households, the report said. Two months ago, a report by the House of Lords European Union Committee said food prices are likely to rise after Brexit if no trade agreement with the EU is reached, and that there could be shortages of some products.

2019-02-08,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Russian and Syrian jets stepped up their bombing of an Islamic State bastion along the Jordan-Israel border in southwestern Syria, as the militants pushed into areas abandoned by other rebel groups, diplomatic and opposition sources said. Islamic State-affiliated forces entrenched in the Yarmouk Basin, which borders the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Jordan, also repelled a ground attack by the Syrian army and its allies, the sources added. The rural area has become the main battleground in the sensitive border region after a major Syrian army offensive backed by its Russian allies routed other rebel groups who were once supported by Washington, Jordan and Gulf states. The Syrian army said its aerial strikes and shelling of militants in the Yarmouk Basin had killed “tens of terrorists” in a campaign whose goal it said was to crush militants.         A senior Syrian army officer told Reuters heavy fighting with the militants was focusing on Tel Jamou Heights, a strategic area near the Yarmouk Basin where the hardline group was putting up tough resistance.  An intelligence source told Reuters 1,000-1,500 Islamic State fighters had been holding their ground despite the 10-day-old bombing campaign that he said had hit villages and caused an “untold number” of civilian casualties.  A former resident in touch with relatives said thousands of civilians had fled bombed villages to areas held by the army or the rebels. Another source familiar with the situation said Islamic State had been able to expand its territory over the last 20 hours by seizing at least 18 villages abandoned by other rebels under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA).    The Syrian army wants full control over Quneitra province, where Israel has deep concerns over the presence of Iranian-backed militias in the so-called Triangle of Death area. The area is a bastion of Iranian-backed militias including Hezbollah, according to Western intelligence sources. The Israeli government signalled it would not impede the Syrian army presence in Quneitra as long as Syrian forces steered away from a demilitarised zone along the border. Israel also said it would continue to escalate attacks along its frontier and elsewhere in Syria where it suspects Iranian-backed forces are stationed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday: “We are continuing to act in Syria to prevent Iranian entrenchment there.” Syrian state television said on Sunday an Israeli air strike had hit a military post in the city of Misyaf in Syria’s Hama province but caused only material damage. It was the second suspected attack in a week by Israel on army installations that the Syrian opposition and Western intelligence sources say have an Iranian military presence. Syria’s army and its allies have been pushing to expand their foothold near the Golan frontier by negotiating surrender deals with rebel groups and allowing them to move to opposition-held areas in northern Syria. On Sunday, the evacuation of hundreds of rebels and their families resumed for the third day from villages along the Golan frontier as part of a Russian-brokered surrender deal, sources said. The deal brings the area back under government control and lets Syrian army brigades return to where they were stationed before Syria’s seven-year-old conflict - posts near a 1974 demilitarized zone with Israel on the Golan frontier. The opposition said the Syrian army were expected to be deployed in areas abandoned by rebels once the evacuations are completed and heavy weapons given up by rebels. Russian military police have also entered rebel-held towns  as part of guarantees given by the Russians that the army and its allied militias do not take revenge against civilians and former fighters, rebel officials said. Separately, a source told Reuters on Sunday the unrest in the border area had disrupted efforts to evacuate hundreds of members of Syria’s “White Helmet” civil defence group over the Golan frontier into Jordan. The plan, backed by Israel and Western powers, had meant to evacuate 800 people overnight, but only 422 made it because of the increased presence of Islamic State and government roadblocks, the source said. Russia’s military said it had also shot down two unidentified drones that attacked its air base at Hmeimim in northern Syria on Saturday and Sunday, Russian agencies reported.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure Iran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups, U.S. officials familiar with the matter said. More than half a dozen current and former officials said the campaign, supported by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, is meant to work in concert with U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to economically throttle Iran by re-imposing tough sanctions. The drive has intensified since Trump withdrew on May 8 from a 2015 seven-nation deal to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The current and former officials said the campaign paints Iranian leaders in a harsh light, at times using information that is exaggerated or contradicts other official pronouncements, including comments by previous administrations.  The White House declined comment on the campaign. The State Department also declined to comment on the campaign specifically, including on Pompeo’s role. A senior Iranian official dismissed the campaign, saying the United States had sought in vain to undermine the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He spoke on condition of anonymity. “Their efforts will fail again,” the official said. A review of the State Department’s Farsi-language Twitter account and its ShareAmerica website - which describes itself as a platform to spark debate on democracy and other issues - shows a number of posts critical of Tehran over the last month. Iran is the subject of four of the top five items on the website’s “Countering Violent Extremism” section. They include headlines such as “This Iranian airline helps spread violence and terror.” In social media posts and speeches, Pompeo himself also appeals directly to Iranians, the Iranian diaspora and a global audience. On June 21, Pompeo tweeted out graphics headlined: “Protests in Iran are growing,” “Iranian people deserve respect for their human rights,” and “Iran’s revolutionary guard gets rich while Iranian families struggle.” The tweets were translated into Farsi and posted on the ShareAmerica website. On Sunday, Pompeo will give a speech titled “Supporting Iranian Voices” in California and meet Iranian Americans, many of whom fled the Islamic Revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. “Let me be clear, we are not seeking regime change. We are seeking changes in the Iranian government’s behaviour,” a State Department official said in response to questions from Reuters. “We know we are driving Iran to make some hard choices. Either they can change their ways or find it increasingly difficult to engage in their malign activities,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “And we believe we are offering a very positive vision for what we could achieve and what the Iranian people could have.” Some of the information the administration has disseminated is incomplete or distorted, the current and former officials said. In a May 21 speech in Washington, Pompeo said Iranian leaders refused to spend on their people funds freed by the nuclear weapons deal, using it instead for proxy wars and corruption. By contrast, in March testimony before a U.S. Senate committee, the U.S. Defence Intelligence Agency director, Robert Ashley, said social and economic expenditures remained Tehran’s near-term priority despite some spending on security forces. Pompeo also accused “Iran-sponsored Shia militia groups and terrorists” of infiltrating Iraqi security forces and jeopardizing Iraq’s sovereignty throughout the period of the nuclear agreement. While opponents accuse the Iran-backed Iraqi militias of human rights abuses against civilians, which the groups deny, the militias fought Islamic State extremists and helped keep them from overrunning Iraq in 2014 after Iraq’s army collapsed. They then aided the U.S.-backed offensives that liberated ISIS-held territory and some units are being incorporated into Iraqi security forces. The State Department official acknowledged that the militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, are by law part of Iraq’s security forces and played a role in countering Islamic State in 2014. “We understand, however, that some of the undisciplined PMF are especially close to Iran, responsive to Iran’s directives, and have a history of criminal activity and terrorism,” the official said. “Those groups are as problematic for the Iraqi state as they are for us.” Experts said the administration also is exaggerating the closeness of the relationship between Iran and Afghanistan’s Taliban militants and al Qaeda by calling them co-conspirators. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment about the accuracy of the information it was disseminating.  It is too early to determine the impact of the administration’s communications campaign, U.S. officials said.   Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said the strategy to economically strangle Iran and stoke public discontent with the leadership aimed to produce one of two outcomes. “Outcome one is capitulation, forcing Iran to further curtail not only its nuclear programme but also its regional ambitions,” Sadjadpour said. “Outcome two is the implosion of the Islamic Republic.” But some U.S. officials and other experts cautioned that by fuelling turmoil in Iran, the U.S. administration could foster greater authoritarian rule and a more aggressive foreign policy, raising the threat of a U.S.-Iran confrontation. Washington has long called Iran the world’s leading “state sponsor of terrorism” because Tehran arms and funds proxy militant groups like Lebanese Hezbollah. Iranian leaders urge the destruction of the United States and Israel, and Iranian proxies have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers and diplomats since the Islamic Revolution. That record provided previous administrations with ample material for waging their own public relations campaigns against Tehran, including trying to communicate directly with the Iranian people. President George W. Bush’s administration established Radio Farda, a U.S.-funded broadcaster that beams into Iran what it says is “objective and accurate news and information to counter state censorship and ideology-based media coverage.” The Obama administration launched a Farsi Twitter account - @USAdarFarsi – in 2011.

2019-02-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday cautioned U.S. President Donald Trump about pursuing hostile policies against Tehran, saying “war with Iran is the mother of all wars”, but did not rule out peace between the two countries. Iran faces increased U.S. pressure and looming sanctions  after Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a 2015 international deal over Iran’s nuclear programme. Addressing a gathering of Iranian diplomats, Rouhani said: “Mr Trump, don’t play with the lion’s tail, this would only lead to regret,” the state new agency IRNA reported.  “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,” Rouhani said, leaving open the possibility of peace between the two countries, at odds since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “You are not in a position to incite the Iranian nation against Iran’s security and interests,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to reported efforts by Washington to destabilise Iran’s Islamic government. In Washington, U.S. officials familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Trump administration had launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure Iran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups. Current and former U.S. officials said the campaign painted Iranian leaders in a harsh light, at times using information that is exaggerated or contradicts other official pronouncements, including comments by previous administrations.  Rouhani scoffed at Trump’s threat to halt Iranian oil exports and said Iran has a dominant position in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping waterway. “Anyone who understands the rudiments of politics doesn’t say ‘we will stop Iran’s oil exports’...we have been the guarantor of the regional waterway’s security throughout history,” Rouhani said, cited by the semi-official ISNA news agency.  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday backed Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran may block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted.  Rouhani’s apparent threat earlier this month to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries came in reaction to efforts by Washington to force all countries to stop buying Iranian oil.  Iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action.  On Sunday, Iran’s ground forces commander became the latest military figure to back Rouhani’s apparent threat, the semi-official news agency Tasnim reported. “The Strait of Hormuz region must either be safe for all or be insecure for everyone,” said General Kioumars Heydari, quoted by Tasnim.  Separately, a top Iranian military commander warned that the Trump government might be preparing to invade Iran. “The enemy’s behaviour is unpredictable,” Tasnim quoted military chief of staff General Mohammad Baqeri as saying.   “Although the current American government does not seem to speak of a military threat, according to precise information it has been trying to persuade the U.S. military to launch a military invasion (of Iran),” Baqeri said. Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by the end of the year because of new U.S. sanctions, putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere. Washington initially planned to shut Iran out of global oil markets completely after Trump abandoned the deal that limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions, demanding all other countries stop buying Iranian crude by November. But the United States has somewhat eased its stance, saying it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies.

2019-02-08,"DAKAR (Reuters) - China’s President Xi Jinping pledged during a visit to Senegal on Saturday to strengthen economic ties with Africa, a continent already awash with cheap Chinese loans in exchange for minerals and huge construction projects. Xi arrived in Senegal on Saturday for a two-day visit to sign bilateral deals, the first leg of an Africa tour that will also take him to Rwanda and South Africa, the latter for a summit of BRICS countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. China now does more trade with Africa than any other nation does, and its consistent overtures to the continent contrast sharply with the United States, whose President Donald Trump has shown little interest in it. The visit was Xi’s first trip to West Africa as president, but his fourth to Africa, he told a joint press conference with Senegalese President Macky Sall after their third ever meeting. “Every time I come to Africa, I have seen the dynamism of the continent and the aspirations of its people for development,” Xi said. “I am very confident in the future of Sino-African relations.” Earlier, Xi was greeted by a brass band and hundreds of people waving Chinese and Senegalese flags and wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the two leaders’ faces.  Africa is in the midst of a boom in infrastructure projects, managed and cheaply financed by China, part of Xi’s “Belt and Road” initiative to build a transport network connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China has pledged $126 billion for the plan, which has been praised by its supporters as a source of vital financing for the developing world. In Senegal, Chinese loans have financed a highway linking the capital Dakar to Touba, its second main city, and part of an industrial park on the Dakar peninsula. China’s ambassador to Senegal Zhang Xun was quoted by the local press in March as saying China had invested $100 million in Senegal in 2017. “Senegal takes a positive view of China’s role in Africa,” Sall said at the news conference. “For its contribution to peace and stability and equally ... for the financing of budgets.” But critics say Africa is loading itself up on Chinese debt that it may struggle to repay, with estimates ranging in the tens of billions of dollars. That could leave African nations with no choice but to hand over controlling stakes in strategic assets to the Chinese state. U.S. officials have warned that a port in the tiny Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, a host to major U.S. and French military bases, could suffer this fate, although Djibouti rejects the fear.  In Guinea, meanwhile, one of the world’s poorest nations, China is lending $20 billion to the government in exchange for aluminium ore concessions. As well as trade and minerals, China has also seen Africa as a source of political support. Chinese diplomacy has, as of May this year, succeeded in getting every African country except Swaziland to break off diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China sees as a renegade province.

2019-02-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - French tightrope artist Tatiana-Mosio Bongonga impressed hundreds of Parisians on Saturday with a performance that featured a walk on a rope suspended 35 meters (115 feet) above the ground in the city’s hilly northern district of Montmartre. Bongonga, 34, walked on a rope suspended by a crane at the base of the hill’s steps toward the Sacre Coeur basilica accompanied by a chamber orchestra, without any security equipment, a gesture many in the audience found nerve-wracking. “It’s very surprising and very dangerous. It really impressed me, actually. I noticed that she was not secured. There was a lot of acrobatics. I had a really good time,” spectator Jennifer Mandelbaum told Reuters. Acrobats practising tightrope walking, also called funambulism, maintain their balance by positioning their center of mass directly over their base of support, a rope or a wire. Bongonga, who prepared for the show for a year, has been practising tightrope walking since she was 8.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion (£381.2 billion) of imported goods from China, threatening to escalate a clash over trade policy that has unnerved financial markets.  “We’re down a tremendous amount,” Trump said in an interview  about trade imbalances with China on CNBC television broadcast on Friday. “I’m ready to go to 500.” His comments worried investors already grappling with the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on corporate results, and key stock indexes on Wall Street dropped at the open on Friday. The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies on Friday on Trumps threat to impose more import tariffs and his repetition of complaints about rising interest rates and the strength of the U.S. dollar.  The dollar index .DXY, a measure of its value against a basket of six major currencies, was on track to post its largest one-day loss in three weeks. Against the yen, the dollar was on pace for its worst daily fall in two months. A top Federal Reserve official, meanwhile, warned the trade war could hurt the U.S. economy. Around $505 billion of Chinese goods were imported to the U.S. in 2017, leading to a trade deficit of nearly $376 billion, U.S. government data shows. Chinese imports from the U.S. totaled $205 billion in the first five months of 2018, with the deficit reaching $152 billion. Trump is taking a more aggressive, protectionist posture on trade than his recent predecessors, sparking retaliatory measures from other countries. Earlier this month, the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports. China promptly levied taxes on the same value of U.S. products. When asked about the stock market possibly falling if the United States imposes duties on such a large amount of goods, Trump told CNBC: “If it does, it does. Look, I’m not doing this for politics.” Still, new tariffs could help Trump’s Republican party going into November’s congressional elections. More than 70 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning U.S. adults believe increased tariffs between the United States and its trading partners will be good for the country, according to a Pew Research Center survey released late Thursday. However, most economists warn that the imposition of import tariffs could disrupt global manufacturing supply chains, raise input costs and raise prices for consumers, leading to slower economic growth.  After the interview, Trump reiterated criticism of the Federal Reserve’s planned interest-rate hikes, posting on Twitter that the tightening policy would diminish any U.S. trade advantage and exacerbate losses from “BAD trade deals.” St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank James Bullard said on Friday the Fed would remain unaffected by Trump’s comments on monetary policy and expressed concerns about rising tariffs. “The escalating trade war, if it goes badly, could be a risk for the U.S. economy,” Bullard said, adding he understands the policy’s objective. “But it could be that all we end up with is a lot of tariffs globally and a lot of other types of protectionism globally.” Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Susan Heavey; Editing by Clive McKeef",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trade-china/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-all-500-billion-of-chinese-imports-idUKKBN1KA18M,2019-02-08,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he was ready to impose tariffs on all $500 billion (£381.2 billion) of imported goods from China, threatening to escalate a clash over trade policy that has unnerved financial markets.",Trump threatens tariffs on all $500 billion of Chinese imports
2019-02-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A man armed with a knife attacked people on a bus in the northern city of Luebeck on Friday, injuring 10 including one seriously before he was arrested, police said, adding there was no indication he was radicalized or had a terrorist motive. “The identity of the perpetrator has been clarified: a 34-year-old German citizen resident in Luebeck,” police added on Twitter. “There are currently no indications the man was political radicalized and no signs of a terrorist background.” The police added that a backpack was found in the bus from which smoke was appearing. It was examined by a bomb squad, which found a “fire accelerant” but no explosives. The local Luebecker Nachrichten, without citing its source, said the attacker was originally from Iran who now had German nationality and had lived in Luebeck for years. Police tweeted that 10 people were hurt. “There were no dead,” the police and state prosecutor’s office said in a statement. “The background to the crime is still unclear and the subject of the ongoing investigation.” The local Luebecker Nachrichten reported at least 14 people were wounded, two seriously. On Twitter, the police said the attacker was overpowered and taken into police custody. The attack took place at 1.47 p.m. local time (1147 GMT). “The bus was full,” the police said, appealing to passengers who fled the scene to contact them. Luebecker Nachrichten quoted a witness as saying: “One of the victims had just given up his place to an older woman, when the attacker stabbed him in the chest.”  An area around a bus stop in the Luebeck neighbourhood of Kuecknitz was sealed off by police, spokesman Dierk Duerbook told Bild. In April, a man drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant in the German city of Muenster, killing two people before shooting himself dead. There was no evidence of any link to Islamist militancy and he was not a refugee. In Berlin in December 2016, a Tunisian whose request for asylum was turned down and who had links to Islamist militants hijacked a truck and ploughed into a crowded marketplace. Twelve people, including the man driving the truck when it was hijacked, were killed.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British businessman Arron Banks has denied an allegation made by a former business partner that he approached Russians about investing in his diamond mines, and that the money raised went instead to his campaign to leave the European Union. Banks, who ahead of the Brexit referendum financed Leave.EU, a campaign led by Nigel Farage, then the leader of the UK Independence Party, has faced questions in parliament about his Russia links but denied having business there.  He said the source of the new allegation, made on Channel 4 TV on Friday, was a “a bit of a fantasist” who was attempting to distract attention from a lawsuit that Banks had brought against him. Channel 4 cited an affidavit to a South African court which said that Banks had travelled to Russia to discuss opportunities in mining.      The court papers alleged that it had “recently become apparent that the funds were in fact raised but were used by Arron Banks in other interests that he has including, but not limited to, his participation in the funding of Brexit.” Banks said he had looked at issuing a bond for his diamond mines in South Africa but decided not to proceed with it. He said that as the events had occurred before the 2015 national election, they could not have been related to the Brexit referendum which had not yet been called. “Unless I’m a genius, real genius, how could it be to fund Brexit with Russian money, before I knew there’d even be a referendum campaign?” Banks told Reuters by phone.  He also denied taking business trips to Russia, saying: “I went to Russia in 2014 and 2015 twice, and both were family holidays.” Banks has threatened to sue the European Parliament’s chief Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt for defamation after Verhofstadt said Banks had colluded with Russians over Brexit. Britain has said it has seen no evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union. But as part of a broader inquiry into so-called fake news, lawmakers on the media committee are investigating whether Moscow tried to influence public opinion before the referendum. Banks told the committee he had had two lunches with the Russian ambassador, but had no business interests and had done no deals in Russia.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday as earnings updates disappointed, with auto stocks bearing the brunt of trade tensions that caused a selloff in the Chinese yuan overnight. As U.S. officials work towards slapping tariffs on car imports, autos shares .SXAP were the biggest fallers, down 2.1 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a CNBC interview he was ready to put tariffs on $500 billion of imported goods from China. The broader pan-European STOXX 600  fell 0.15 percent, with losses capped by gains in healthcare and consumer staples, considered less risky sectors.  Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB, down 0.4 percent, underperformed on reports of rising tensions within the country's coalition government. Paper maker Stora Enso (STERV.HE) fell 13.5 percent after reporting second-quarter profits that missed expectations, blaming production problems, maintenance and tight wood supply. It dragged down peer UPM-Kymmene (UPM.HE), which lost 5.3 percent, while paper packaging maker Huhtamaki (HUH1V.HE) fell 5.5 percent after its results.  Swedish builder Skanska (SKAb.ST) was another prominent faller, down 4.6 percent after reporting an unexpected drop in second-quarter profit due to new project writedowns at its struggling U.S. construction business. Atlas Copco (ATCOa.ST) fell 5.5 percent after reporting lower-than-expected order growth in its Vacuum Technique unit and saying demand from the semiconductor industry would fall. Overall, listed European firms are expected to report stronger earnings growth in the second quarter, while investors are honing in on companies’ future guidance for any change due tariff developments, with autos particularly in focus. “Numbers for Q2 are probably not so much impacted from trade conflict, but I think everyone is curious to see if companies see any indications of delayed capex decisions, for example, on the back of more noise coming from the political front,” said Britta Weidenbach, head of European equities at DWS.  French car parts maker Faurecia (EPED.PA) initially made gains after it reported higher first-half profit and raised its outlook, but fell back 7.4 percent as analysts saw margin growth as disappointing.  “The discussions around trade are simply not helpful when it comes to the risk premia for auto companies - and that’s not helpful for valuations,” said Weidenbach. Among gainers were Italian drugmaker Recordati (RECI.MI) and Finnish pharma company Orion (ORNBV.HE), both benefiting from broker recommendation upgrades. Goldman analysts raised Recordati to a “buy”, saying they saw the possibility for an accelerated M&A strategy, while a Jefferies analyst upgraded Orion to “hold”, saying data on a prostate cancer drug in September would be a catalyst for the stock. Big profit warnings savaged some shares outside the large-caps. Shares in food processing firm Wessanen (BSWSc.AS) fell 26.6 percent to a one-year low after it cut its organic growth outlook for the year to “moderate”. Belgian steel wire maker Bekaert (BEKB.BR) plunged 19 percent, hitting a five-year low after saying it expected underlying operating profit 20 percent below analysts’ estimates in the first half, blaming wire rod costs partly driven up by tariffs.

In line with WTO rules, the decision was taken after Canada made its second request at a closed-door meeting of the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body.  The U.S. delegation said that British Columbia’s regulations exclude all imported wine from grocery store shelves and violated WTO rules on non-discrimination, trade officials said.  The restrictions limited sales opportunities for American wine in Canada and gave a substantial competitive advantage to local wines, it said. Canada questioned the commercial rationale for the U.S. move, noting that imported wines account for around 90 percent of all wine sales and there were nearly 1,000 points of sale for imported wine in the province.

2019-02-08,"MILAN (Reuters) - EasyJet EZJ.L and Lufthansa LHAG.DE are still interested in Alitalia after an Italian minister said this week the government wants the majority of the loss-making carrier under state control, the British and German carriers said. EasyJet, Lufthansa LHAG.DE, and budget carrier Wizz Air WIZZ.L submitted expressions of interest earlier this year in at least parts of Alitalia, but the lengthy formation of a new anti-establishment government in Italy, which finally came to power in June, delayed the process. New Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli said this week there was a need for 51 percent of Alitalia to be kept in Italian hands “but with a strong investor next to it ... (Alitalia) needs to return to being a true flag carrier”. Lufthansa has repeatedly said that the Italian market is important for it but that Alitalia must be restructured before it would invest. A spokesman said the German company had already submitted a document to this effect to the new government. “We can imagine further talks on this basis,” he said on Friday. EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said at the Farnborough Airshow this week that the company remained interested in parts of Alitalia but needed to study the details of what the new government is proposing. Alitalia, once a symbol of Italy’s post-war economic boom but struggling to compete against low-cost carriers and high speed trains in recent years, was put under special administration last year after workers rejected its latest rescue plan. (Full Story) Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs Matteo Salvini has said Alitalia was well-placed to return to profitability and “if there are serious private partners, so much the better”. “The only think we won’t allow is a break-up (of the company),” he said. However, sector analysts remain dubious that the government will find an investor willing to put money into an Alitalia in which the state has a say, especially given past political meddling that has failed to return the company to profitability. “Even if the state takes only a minority stake in Alitalia, no investor will dare getting close given what happened in the past,” said Andrea Giuricin, CEO of TRA Consulting and author of “The endless privatisation of Alitalia”. Repeated state bailouts have cost Italian taxpayers around 10 billion euros over a decade, Giuricin estimates, yet the airline’s situation remains precarious: the carrier is losing at least one million euros per day, he added. In the first quarter, Alitalia posted an EBITDA loss of 117 million euros ($136 million) compared with a loss of 228 million a year earlier. Alitalia’s commissioners are due to meet government officials on July 27. The government appointed three commissioners last year to assess whether Alitalia can be restructured, either as a standalone company or through a partial or total sale, or else liquidated.

2019-02-08,"BELLEEK, Northern Ireland, (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will tell the people of Northern Ireland on Friday that her Brexit plan is the best way to avoid a hard border with Ireland, standing firm against critics in her own party. Still reeling from the resignation last week of senior cabinet members and with her own political future uncertain, May will also call on the European Union to give some ground in talks on Britain’s departure from the bloc. May flew to Northern Ireland on Thursday for a two-day visit to see up close the troubled British region’s frontier with EU-member Ireland, which has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks in the negotiations. After quitting the cabinet, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson singled out her treatment of the border as the biggest mistake of her negotiations with the EU for a smooth exit from the bloc next year. May’s Brexit ‘white paper’, the policy document which prompted Johnson’s resignation, proposes negotiating the closest possible commercial links for goods trade to protect businesses and to fulfil a commitment to avoid having infrastructure on the border.  The 500-kilometre (300 mile) border has been largely invisible since army checkpoints were taken down after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of violence between the region’s pro-British majority and an Irish nationalist minority. Over 3,600 died.  “The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British Prime Minister could ever accept,” May is to tell a crowd at Belfast’s Waterfront Hall on Friday, according to the extracts of the speech provided by her office.  Instead, she will say that she believes the close regulatory alignment on goods trade as described in her white paper, will meet her commitment to prevent the “inconceivable” eventuality of a hard border.  It is “now for the EU to respond. Not simply to fall back onto previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind,” she will say, according to the text.”    Politicians have warned that the re-imposition of physical infrastructure on the border when it becomes the EU’s external frontier would anger Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland who aspire to unification with the Republic of Ireland and help militants opposed to the peace deal to recruit new members.  May has refused to accept a “backstop” solution proposed by the European Union in which Northern Ireland would remain closely aligned with the European Union’s single market and customs union on the grounds that it would create a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Johnson on Wednesday told parliament that May had unnecessarily let the “readily soluble” border issue “become so politically charged as to dominate the debate” pushing May towards a close alignment with the EU he described as a “miserable, permanent limbo”. “The process of withdrawal will be complex, and it will require hard work, serious work, and detailed work,” May will say in Belfast. “The Government has done that work. The White Paper is our plan for the future.”  The first stop in May’s visit was the border village of Belleek in Fermanagh, the home county of pro-British Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster, whose party provides 10 votes in Britain’s lower house of parliament that May needs to govern. She arrived in Belleek by helicopter before touring a pottery factory with Foster. “This visit will enable Mrs May to speak with people who live, work and travel across the much talked about Irish border on a daily basis,” Foster said in an earlier statement.    On Friday May will meet the leadership of the largest Irish nationalist party, Sinn Fein.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britons will from next week start receiving weekly information bulletins from the government about how to make sure they’re ready for a disorderly Brexit, The Times reported on Friday.  The information will be distributed as “bundles” to consumers and companies as Britain counts down to its departure from the European Union on March 29, 2019, said the newspaper. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan proposes negotiating the closest possible commercial links for goods trade, but even if she can secure enough support for it at home, she still needs to win agreement from the EU. That means that a disorderly or no-deal Brexit, where the two sides fail to agree a new relationship, is still on the table.  Under the government’s new campaign, the newspaper said that small businesses will be given information about how to make customs declarations while British holidaymakers will be told to buy health insurance in case current reciprocal deals end.

2019-02-08,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia will release on July 30 a long-awaited report into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, the transport minister said on Friday.  In May, Malaysia called off a privately-funded underwater search for the aircraft, which became one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries when it vanished with 239 aboard en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on March 8, 2014. The investigation team would brief families of those aboard on the report at the transport ministry on July 30, said the minister, Anthony Loke. “Every word recorded by the investigation team will be tabled in this report,” he told reporters, adding that a news conference would follow the closed-door briefing.  “We are committed to the transparency of this report,” Loke added. “It will be tabled fully, without any editing, additions, or redactions.” The report will be put online, with hard copies distributed to families and accredited media, among others, Loke said, adding, “The whole international community will have access to the report.” Voice 370, a group representing the relatives, has previously urged the Malaysian government for a review of the flight, including “any possible falsification or elimination of records related to MH370 and its maintenance”.       The only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777 aircraft have been three wing fragments washed up on Indian Ocean coasts. The search Malaysia called off on May 29, by U.S.-based firm Ocean Infinity, covered 112,000 sq km (43,243 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean within three months, ending with no significant new findings.       It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($147.06 million) search across an area of 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq miles) last year.

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Executives from top aerospace and aviation companies called on Thursday for stepped-up efforts to attract more women, saying this could help solve looming shortages of pilots, mechanics and top managers in the traditionally male-dominated sector. The industries are coming under scrutiny because of the low numbers of women employed as senior executives or airline pilots. At the same time, a growing shortage of pilots is putting the sector’s recent growth at risk. The head of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, caused a storm last month when he said that a woman could not do his job, although he later apologised, saying his comments had been intended as a joke and were taken out of context. Charlotte Pedersen, chief executive of Luxaviation Helicopters, a private aviation operator, said urgent action was needed since the sector faced a potential “huge gap” in management capacity in a decade as current executives retired. “We can’t just recruit from half the population,” Pedersen, the first female pilot in the Danish air force, told a panel discussion at the Farnborough Airshow. Marnie Munn, an airline captain with easyJet (EZJ.L), told the conference that only three to four percent of pilots globally were women. Jane Basson, chief of staff to Airbus CEO Tom Enders, said women now accounted for 17.5 percent of the company’s workforce of 140,000 but that was just a tick up from 15 percent in 2005. “It’s not progressing fast enough,” she said, adding that her company was now using data analysis tools to understand why it was proving so difficult to recruit and retain women. In addition, she said Airbus (AIR.PA) was using tools such as smart phone applications to provide encouragement and support to workers, but could tailor those to reach women specifically. Hundreds of industry executives attended the panel, with many signing a UK charter that commits organisations to support promotion of women to senior roles, set their own targets and report on their progress to boost accountability. More than 50 aviation and aerospace companies with operations in Britain have signed the charter, and the number is growing, said Katherine Bennett, a senior vice president with Airbus. It is modelled on a similar pledge in the finance sector. Signatories also agree to have a senior executive oversee diversity efforts, and to link pay of senior executives to meeting internal targets on gender diversity and inclusion. Budget airline easyJet has a target that 20 percent of its new pilots should be female by 2020 and British Aviation Minister Liz Sugg said other firms were taking similar steps. But more work was needed to close pay gaps that often exceeded 50 percent in the aerospace sector, add women to corporate boards and recruit more female pilots, she said, noting that women make up just 5 percent of pilots at UK-registered airlines. “We really do have a long way to go before these barriers disappear altogether. There are fundamental gender issues in aviation and aerospace,” Sugg said.     (This refiled version of the story removes extraneous word in paragraph 13).

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is stockpiling parts in case of a hard Brexit and Rolls-Royce (RR.L) is months away from doing so. But for smaller aerospace companies that supply them, Britain’s departure from the EU could be much more challenging.  The largest aerospace sector in Europe and second in the world behind the United States, the British industry generates exports worth 30 billion pounds a year and sustains 123,000 direct jobs, plus as many again indirectly.  Manufacturing planes and engines requires components to be at factories on a just-in-time basis. A disorderly or no-deal Brexit would threaten the smooth flow of parts across borders and prevent European regulatory approval for aerospace products. However much planning the industry giants do, they could still be damaged via their supply chains if component suppliers are not ready. John Rainey, chairman of Denroy, a maker of injected moulded components used on Airbus planes, has contingency plans in place, but won’t sign off on any changes for the company of 165 employees until he knows what Brexit means.  “Everybody says you need a plan but we don’t know what to plan for or against. We’re going to conferences now and we’re told to be very afraid but we don’t know what we have to be afraid of,” he said at the Farnborough airshow, the annual showcase for the British aerospace industry. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, but there is little clarity over its future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc. Alert to the potential problem, Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for aircraft and ships, has started to talk to smaller suppliers to look at “where some of the hotspots might be”, the company’s president of civil aerospace, Chris Cholerton, said. “We’ve got a bit of a heatmap of levels of risk,” he said. WORST-CASE SCENARIO Slow progress in the Brexit talks has convinced Europe’s Airbus, which makes the wings for its commercial aircraft in Wales, to activate plans to prepare for a worst-case, no-deal scenario. But few of the 4,000 companies in Airbus’s UK supply chain, many of which are small and medium-sized companies, have dedicated teams and sophisticated plans in place, a chink in the armour of big companies.  “There’s a limit to how much they (big companies) can do in terms of digging down,” said David Stewart, aerospace partner at consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.  “There’s a small company that does this piece of bearing, clip, pump. You can’t go and check every one of those single companies to see how well prepared they are.”  Big companies hope that building up stocks of parts will allow factories to continue producing even if goods are held up at the border between Britain and the EU. Depending on the future relationship, goods could require customs declarations and checks at borders, a major risk for Airbus whose components can cross borders two or three times before products are finished.  Tony Wood, CEO of Meggitt (MGGT.L), which makes wheels and brakes for planemakers and has 11,000 employees globally, says he has examined how the company would fare under all the different outcomes. “We’ve done so many scenarios around Brexit planning,” he said. Meggitt, which said only 5 percent of its business is trading directly between the UK and Europe, says it can cope with the extra administration.  “On day one, if there is a requirement for extra processing and paperwork to clear customs and such like, then yes, we have a solution to put people in place to do that,” Wood said.  But for Northern Ireland-based Denroy, it’s another story. Rainey, who owns the firm, said more paperwork could mean extra staff and extra cost for a small business to absorb.  “I’m worried about ... all the additional documentation requirements. The implications for two more employees is 60,000 quid (pounds) you know,” he said.  The head of France’s Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), Eric Trappier, urged Britain and the EU on Thursday to settle differences over Brexit and define a new partnership as quickly as possible to avoid hurting hundreds of suppliers. British Prime Minister Theresa May published a plan for the UK’s future relationship with the EU in July which was generally well-received by industry, but even if she can secure enough support for it at home, she still needs to win agreement from the EU. Under her plan, Britain would share a common rule book on goods with the EU and continue to participate in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), addressing a key worry for the industry which needs its parts to be EASA-approved to continue flying. If that fails, companies with existing facilities in mainland Europe can use those for approving parts. With six factories in Europe, Meggitt has options. “There are a number of alternatives as to how you ultimately will clear those parts. We have operations in France and Switzerland,” Wood said, adding that shipping parts there for EASA approval would be “a very extreme scenario”.  Rolls is one step ahead, putting in place plans to move the design approval process for its large jet engines from Britain to Germany. But setting up shop in Europe isn’t an option for many of the thousands of small and medium-sized companies, and the aerospace and defence industry body ADS said it isn’t advising them to move, or seeing evidence that they’re doing so.  “At this point we’re saying you do need to be aware, you need to have understood where the vulnerabilities lie,” ADS Chief Executive Paul Everitt said.  While the costs of Brexit are worrying for some, some smaller companies see an opportunity in the regulatory and customs difficulties that could lie ahead. The boss of Moyola Precision Engineering, a supplier of titanium and aluminium components to Airbus and Boeing, said it could win new business if it adapts quickly enough.  It employs 120 people at its base in Northern Ireland.  “Over the years we have been working to reduce our cost and to put ourselves in a situation where we can still be cost competitive,” said Managing Director Mark Semple, who owns the 18 million pound turnover business with his father. “You have to keep doing these things, Brexit’s just another thing that encourages you to look to continue to take out cost.”  ($1 = 0.7696 pounds) Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-airshow-brexit/ill-prepared-suppliers-threaten-aerospace-giants-in-case-of-hard-brexit-idUKKBN1K92M7,2019-02-08,,Ill-prepared suppliers threaten aerospace giants in case of hard Brexit
2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Royal Mail Plc’s (RMG.L) shareholders rejected a pay package for its senior executives on Thursday. The post and parcels company said about 70.17 percent votes cast by shareholders at the annual meeting were against the resolution on the director’s remuneration report.  Shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis had recommended that shareholders vote against the pay packages.  Royal Mail said it would consult with shareholder and representative bodies as part of its scheduled review of the remuneration policy. The review is due to take place in autumn. One of the concerns from shareholders is the company’s payment to retiring CEO Moya Greene on her exit, estimated to be 915,000, Royal Mail said.  “Support for the remuneration report is not considered warranted due to termination payments to the former CEO which exceed UK market norms and also include an element of guaranteed bonus payments,” ISS said in a report earlier this month.  ISS added the company’s treatment of Greene’s bonus is not considered to be on a cost-neutral basis for shareholders and the disclosures in previous years have fallen short of accurate representation on termination provisions.   The company defended the payment saying the arrangements have been in place since 2010 when Royal Mail was state owned.  However, it said similar provisions had not been replicated in any current contracts for executive directors and they would not be in future. Under Greene, one of the handful of female CEOs in the FTSE 100 .FTSE, Royal Mail was privatised in 2013 and has since reduced layers of management, upgraded technology and cut its property bill to save costs. The company in April named the boss of its fast-growing European parcels business, Rico Back, to succeed Greene. Back was given a near 17 percent higher salary at 640,000 pounds, which was also criticised by the advisory firms. An ISS spokeswoman said they does not comment on individual company meeting vote results. Glass Lewis was not immediately available for a comment.

2019-02-08,"GENEVA (Reuters) - World Trade Organization arbitrators will evaluate a U.S. request to impose billions of dollars worth of sanctions on European products after a final WTO ruling that found the European Union had given illegal subsidies to Airbus (AIR.PA). The request for retaliation for losses incurred by rival Boeing (BA.N) in the long-running dispute over claims of illegal handouts for aircraft makers adds fuel to mounting transatlantic trade tensions. It comes as EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in Brussels that she hoped an EU mission to Washington would help ease a trade dispute linked to steel and aluminium but that the bloc is preparing a list of U.S. imports to hit if the United States imposes tariffs on EU cars. The United States made the request to the WTO last Friday for three judges to set the level of retaliatory sanctions, the global watchdog said in a document posted on Thursday which gave no figure for the amount of sanctions sought. The WTO arbitration is expected to take around a year. The WTO appeals body ruled on May 15 that the EU had failed to remove subsidised government development loans for the world’s largest airliner, the A380, and Europe’s newest long-haul jet, the A350, causing losses for Boeing (BA.N) and U.S. aerospace workers.  It was the first of two key planemaker subsidy decisions due this year. The European Union has been locked in a parallel, long-running row with the United States over prohibited support it says Washington has given Boeing, and Malmstrom has said she wants to get that judgement on the table too before starting any negotiation. The EU told the WTO Dispute Settlement Body two weeks later that it had acted within days of the ruling in the 14-year-old case to bring its funding of Airbus into line with WTO rules, a trade official who attended the meeting said. But a U.S. representative at the WTO meeting said it was hard to give credence to the EU’s assertion, after four previous rulings that had disagreed with similar EU claims to have brought Airbus’s financing into line with market benchmarks. The United States, in its initial request in December 2011, said that based on data at the time, it estimated the annual value of lost sales at between $7 billion and $10 billion.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia’s envoy to North Korea said on Wednesday it would be logical to raise the question of easing sanctions on North Korea with the United Nations Security Council, as the United States pushes for a halt to refined petroleum exports to Pyongyang. “The positive change on the Korean peninsula is now obvious,” said the ambassador, Alexander Matsegora, according to the RIA news agency, adding that Russia was ready to help modernise North Korea’s energy system if sanctions were lifted and if Pyongyang can find funding for the modernisation. The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. China tried late last month to get the Security Council to issue a statement praising the June 12 Singapore meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and expressing its “willingness to adjust the measures on the DPRK in light of the DPRK’s compliance with the resolutions.” North Korea’s official name is Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).  But the United States blocked the statement on June 28 given “ongoing and very sensitive talks between the United States and the DPRK at this time,” diplomats said. The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi about the importance of sanctions enforcement. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to informally brief U.N. Security Council envoys along with South Korea and Japan on Friday. Diplomats say they expect Pompeo to stress the need to maintain pressure on North Korea during his briefing on Friday. In a tweet on Wednesday Trump said he elicited a promise from Russian President Vladimir Putin to help negotiate with North Korea but did not say how. He also said: “There is no rush, the sanctions remain!” The United States accused North Korea last week of breaching a U.N. sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers between ships at sea and demanded an immediate end to all sales of the fuel. The United States submitted the complaint to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, which is due to decide by Thursday whether it will tell all U.N. member states to halt all transfers of refined petroleum to Pyongyang.  Such decisions are made by consensus and some diplomats said they expected China or Russia to delay or block the move. When asked on June 13 about whether sanctions should be loosened, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: “We should be thinking about steps in that direction because inevitably there is progress on the track that should be reciprocal, that should be a two-way street. The other side should see encouragement to go forward.” Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow and Michelle Nichols at the United Nations; Writing by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky and James Dalgleish",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-northkorea-russia-sanctions/russia-urges-u-n-to-mull-easing-north-korea-sanctions-as-u-s-seeks-action-idUKKBN1K81I1,2019-02-08,,Russia urges U.N. to mull easing North Korea sanctions as U.S. seeks action

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - More than half of Americans disapprove of the way U.S. President Donald Trump is handling relations with Russia, according to a  Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted after his controversial summit and joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Trump’s performance at the Helsinki summit, where  Trump refused to blame the Russian leader for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and cast doubt on the findings of U.S. intelligence agencies, did not seem to have an impact on his overall approval rating. Forty-two percent of registered voters said they approved of Trump’s performance in office in the latest opinion poll, compared with a daily average of between 40 and 44 percent so far in July. The poll found that 55 percent of registered voters disapproved while 37 percent approved of his handling of relations with Russia. Among Republicans, 71 percent approved of his handling of Russia compared to 14 percent of Democrats. Trump still enjoys broad support among Republican voters despite criticism from party leaders about his words and actions while standing alongside the Russian leader answering questions from reporters, the poll results showed. Trump surprised even his supporters when he praised the Russian leader during the news conference for his “strong and powerful” denial of meddling. On Tuesday, Trump attempted to calm the political storm following his remarks, saying he misspoke at the news conference and had full confidence in U.S. agencies. But he appeared to veer from his script to add: “It could be other people also - there’s a lot of people out there,” he said. A majority of registered voters, 59 percent, agree with the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia attempted to influence the U.S. election, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found. But only 32 percent of Republicans think that is true compared to 84 percent of Democrats.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll also revealed a distinct split among Republican and Democratic voters over whether Russia should be considered an adversary of the United States.  Overall, 38 percent of registered voters agreed that Russia is an enemy of the United States. About the same percent considered Russia “a competitor” while 8 percent said it was “a friend.”  However, half the Democrats said it was an enemy while only about one in three Republicans considered it so.  Forty percent of Democrats described Russia as an imminent threat while only 14 percent of Republicans agreed.  Overall, 27 percent of registered voters considered Russia an imminent threat. Only North Korea got a higher response on that question, 31 percent. The poll also asked Americans whether they think authorities will find evidence of an illegal relationship between the Trump administration and Russia. A slim majority, 51 percent, said it was likely, while 77 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of Republicans did. The same general split was true when asked if Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Overall, 52 percent of registered voters agreed. But 81 percent of Democrats said that was true versus 19 percent of Republicans. The Reuters/Ipsos poll gathered responses from 1,011 registered voters throughout the United States, including 453 Republicans and 399 Democrats. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.

2019-02-08,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision on Monday to accept the demands of hardline Brexit campaigners will not change Ireland’s negotiating position on Britain’s exit from the EU, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday. Britain’s parliament on Monday accepted the insistence of eurosceptic hardliners in her Conservative Party for a legal guarantee that there will be no post-Brexit customs border in the Irish Sea. That move could complicate Ireland’s demand for a backstop agreement that could keep Northern Ireland but not the rest of the United Kingdom in an EU customs union so as to ensure the border between the North and Ireland remains open. Varadkar told Irish state broadcaster RTE that he believed Britain and the EU could reach agreement on the terms of Brexit by October, six months ahead of Britain’s intended withdrawal. “(But) we can’t make assumptions that the withdrawal agreement will get through Westminster (British parliament).”  He added, “It’s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit quite frankly. “That shouldn’t give us cause for panic and that shouldn’t give us any reason to change our position.”  Varadkar said Ireland needed to “step up preparations for a ‘no-deal’ scenario,” although he added that he thought it unlikely Britain would crash chaotically out of the EU.

2019-02-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for immigrant families separated by the U.S. government at the border with Mexico said a federal judge’s order barring rapid deportations until at least next Tuesday would give their clients breathing room as they decided their next steps.  The families had been separated amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration by President Donald Trump’s administration, sparking an international outcry and a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Trump ordered that the practice be halted on June 20, and the government faces a court-imposed July 26 deadline to reunite families. But with more than 2,500 children and their parents remaining separate, lawyers have been scrambling to stem deportations and give immigrant families a greater say in their futures. In Monday’s order, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego agreed with the ACLU that parents facing imminent deportation deserved a week to decide whether to leave their children in the United States to pursue asylum separately. The order gave lawyers more time to “figure out what reunification is going to mean for our clients,” said Beth Krause, a supervising lawyer at Legal Aid’s Immigrant Youth Project. Immigrant families won a separate victory on Monday night, when U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan temporarily barred the government from moving any of the dozens of separated children represented in New York by the Legal Aid Society without at least 48 hours’ notice. Legal Aid had sought an emergency injunction, saying the government was moving children and parents without giving them time to meet their lawyers and discuss possible legal consequences, including removal from the country. At a Tuesday afternoon hearing before U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, government lawyers sought to overturn Swain’s order, saying the case could impede its ability to comply with the order to reunify families. Furman declined to rule immediately, saying he had yet to read the underlying paperwork. Gregory Copeland, a Legal Aid lawyer, told the judge he did not believe any children had been moved out of New York since the lawsuit had been filed. Swain’s temporary order expires on July 19 unless a judge extends it. Jorge Baron, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said Sabraw’s broader ban on rapid deportations “buys us a little bit of time.”   “I am still uncertain we have made contact with all the parents who are detained in our particular region,” he said. Baron’s group has secured legal representation for several dozen separated parents sent to government detention centres in Washington state. But even on Monday, he said, he learned of an immigrant mother who had yet to make contact with a lawyer.  “She might have slipped through the cracks,” without the judge’s order, Baron said.  Many of the immigrants are fleeing violence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.

2019-02-08,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Communist-run Cuba has started providing internet on the mobile phones of select users as it aims to roll out the service nationwide by year-end, in a further step towards opening one of the Western Hemisphere’s least connected countries. Journalists at state-run news outlets were among the first this year to get mobile internet, provided by Cuba’s telecoms monopoly, as part of a wider campaign for greater internet access that new President Miguel Diaz-Canel has said should boost the economy and help Cubans defend their revolution. Analysts said broader web access will also ultimately weaken the government’s control of what information reaches people in the one-party island state that has a monopoly on the media. Cuba frowns on public dissent and blocks access to dissident websites. “It’s been a radical change,” said Yuris Norido, 39, who reports for several state-run news websites and the television. “I can now update on the news from wherever I am, including where the news is taking place.” Certain customers, including companies and embassies, have also been able to buy mobile data plans since December, according to the website of Cuban telecoms monopoly ETECSA, which has not broadly publicized the move. ETECSA has said it will expand mobile internet to all its 5 million mobile phone customers, nearly half of Cuba’s population, by the end of this year. ETECSA did not reply to a request for more details for this story. Whether because of a lack of cash, a long-running U.S. trade embargo or concerns about the flow of information, Cuba has lagged behind in web access. Until 2013, internet was largely only available to the public at tourist hotels in Cuba. But the government has since then made increasing connectivity a priority, introducing cybercafes and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots and slowly starting to hook up homes to the web. Long before he took office from Raul Castro in April, 58-year-old Diaz-Canel championed the cause.  “We need to be able to put the content of the revolution online,” he told Parliament last July as vice president, adding that Cubans could thus “counter the avalanche of pseudo-cultural, banal and vulgar content.” Cuba could use subsidies to encourage the use of government-sponsored applications, analysts said. Last month, ETECSA launched a free Cuba-only messaging application, Todus, while Cuba’s own intranet with a handful of government-approved sites and email is much cheaper to access than the wider internet. In a 2015 document about its internet strategy that leaked, the Cuban government said it aimed to connect at least half of homes by 2020 and 60 percent of phones. But many Cubans are skeptical. ETECSA President Mayra Arevich told state-run media in December it had connected just 11,000 homes last year. “I’ve been many times to the ETECSA shop to ask if they can give us home access,” said Yuneisy Galindo, 28, at a Wi-Fi hotspot on one of Havana’s thoroughfares. “But they tell us they still aren’t ready and will call us.” Most mobile phone owners have smartphones, although Cuba is only now installing 3G technology, even as most of Latin America has moved onto 4G, with 5G in its final testing phase. “This rollout will expand slowly at first and then more quickly, if the government is increasingly confident that it can control any political fallout,” said Cuba expert Ted Henken at Baruch College in the United States. The price could prove the biggest restriction for many, though. Hotspots currently charge $1 an hour, compared with an average state monthly wage of $30. It was not clear what most Cubans will pay for mobile internet, but ETECSA is charging companies and embassies $45 a month for four gigabytes.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump faced outrage on Tuesday for his failure to hold Russia accountable for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and some U.S. lawmakers threatened action in Congress to punish Moscow and show support for U.S. intelligence agencies. At a joint news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin after a summit in Helsinki on Monday, Trump stunned politicians back home by shying away from criticizing Putin for Moscow’s efforts to undermine the election, contradicting the findings of American intelligence agencies. Trump, whose summit with Putin concluded a week-long Europe trip that included a NATO meeting and talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May, pushed back on Tuesday at the storm of criticism, blaming media coverage. “While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!,” he tweeted. The condemnation for his performance at the Helsinki news conference, including from many fellow Republicans, matched or eclipsed previous controversies in Trump’s turbulent 18 months in office. “The president needs to understand he has damaged U.S. foreign policy,” Representative Mike Turner, a Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN. “He’s given them a pass and is certainly not holding them accountable for what they’re doing.” Some lawmakers said they would seek remedies in Congress. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a longtime Trump critic, has raised the idea of passing a resolution that would voice lawmakers’ support for the U.S. intelligence community and U.S. allies, many of who are feeling the sting of strong Trump criticism in recent weeks. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations panel, has floated a resolution similar to Flake’s. Several senators, including Republican Ben Sasse, Republican Pat Toomey, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel,  have backed more sanctions on Russia, but it was unclear whether Senate or House of Representatives leaders would support such a move or how new sanctions might be crafted. House Speaker Paul Ryan, calling Russia’s government “menacing,” said he was willing to consider additional sanctions on Russia, and reiterated his support for U.S. intelligence community findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Congress nearly unanimously passed a sanctions law last year targeting Moscow for election meddling and for its actions in Ukraine and Syria. In April, that law led the U.S. Treasury to impose major sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs, in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow. Schumer also called for the immediate passage of legislation to enhance election security, and reiterated calls for the Senate to hold immediate hearings to get testimony from Trump’s national security team about what transpired during the private Trump-Putin meeting “so we can find out what the heck happened there.” U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election campaign and sought to tilt the vote in Trump’s favour, something Moscow has long denied. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing that allegation and any possible collusion by Trump’s campaign. Trump has denied collusion and casts Mueller’s probe as a witchhunt that detracts from his election victory. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called on Tuesday for passage of legislation increasing funding to improve the security of U.S. election equipment and prevent cyberattacks. Pelosi also wants to force a vote on the House floor on a resolution rebuking Trump’s remarks in Helsinki. Other lawmakers called for members of the Trump administration to resign in protest.  Not all Republicans were angry with the president’s conduct in Helsinki. “The president did a good thing by meeting with Putin,” Senator Rand Paul told CBS “This Morning” programme, comments that won him public thanks from Trump on Twitter.  The issue of Russian election interference could come up later on Tuesday, when Trump was scheduled to meet with members of Congress, although it is expected to focus on tax reform.  Russia’s political and media establishment heralded the summit as a victory for Putin in breaking down Western resolve to treat Russia as a pariah. “The West’s attempts to isolate Russia failed,” read the headline on a report on Monday’s summit meeting in state-run newspaper Rossiisskaya Gazeta.  The summit capped a tumultuous trip during which Trump accused NATO allies of failing to spend enough on their militaries and embarrassed May by saying she had refused to take his advice about how to negotiate Britain’s exit from the EU. He referred to the European Union as a “foe” in trade and repeatedly criticized it.

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that a no-deal Brexit would have “big” economic consequences, prompt a review of interest rates and leave many bankers idle. Britain and the EU have negotiated a transition deal that would effectively keep Britain as non-voting member of the bloc from Brexit day next March until the end of 2020. But it has not been ratified yet, meaning the UK could crash out and have to rely on WTO trading terms which, Carney said, would leave the country worse off. “Our job is to make sure we are as prepared as possible,” Carney told MPs at a parliamentary hearing held at an air show in Farnborough, southern England. Crashing out would prompt the Bank’s monetary policy committee to reassess the economic outlook and interest rates. “It would be a material event. I wouldn’t prejudge in which direction, though,” Carney said. “Speaking very narrowly about the financial services side, in the event of a no-deal scenario... there would be big economic consequences. We might have a lot of idle bankers as there is not a lot of demand for their services,” Carney said Lenders, insurers and asset managers in Britain are playing safe and opening new EU hubs by March to maintain links with customers there irrespective of whether a transition deal of generous future trading terms are secured. But they worry that without a transition deal, existing cross-border contracts such as derivatives and insurance policies would be disrupted, leaving consumers unable to make claims or companies not covered against adverse moves in currencies or borrowing costs. Britain has said it will legislate to ensure “continuity” in contracts and that the EU must reciprocate, but the bloc says it was up to banks and not public authorities to get ready. “Yes, we are concerned that the EU has not yet indicated its solution. The private sector cannot solve these issues,” Carney said. “This is fundamentally about taking responsibility to protect the financial system... It’s cold comfort, but it will be worse in Europe than it is here.” Britain’s banks, however, hold enough capital and cash reserves to withstand a disorderly Brexit, Carney said. Britain last week published its proposals for a future trading agreement with the EU after Brexit, saying it wanted close ties in goods, but with financial services having less access to the bloc than now. The financial sector attacked the government for not backing  the industry’s more ambitious proposals that seek to replicate existing market access. The industry’s proposals, which the Bank had also backed, were rejected by EU officials in Brussels who say it would mean Britain getting all the benefits of EU membership without the costs and obligations. Carney said it was too soon to judge what the government’s proposals meant for financial services or for the Bank’s ability to take all decisions necessary to keep the financial system and banks stable. “It’s premature for us to make a judgement on the White Paper and the outcome of these negotiations. It’s also not clear which activities are going to be in scope,” Carney said. The White Paper was a “first step” in a hugely important negotiation, he added.

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British workers’ wages have risen at the slowest rate in six months despite a record number of people in jobs, challenging the Bank of England as it considers raising interest rates next month for only the second time since the financial crisis. Average weekly earnings increased by an annual 2.5 percent in the three months to May, slowing from 2.6 percent in the three months to April and the weakest growth since November, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Pay growth excluding bonuses, which the BoE says sometimes gives a better picture of the underlying trend, slowed by a similar amount, to 2.7 percent. Both readings were in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Markets took the data in their stride, with the numbers doing little to shift perceptions that the majority of the BoE’s policymakers will vote to raise rates after their next meeting on Aug. 2. “We see recent labour dynamics, including today’s report, as consistent with the Bank of England pressing ahead with an August rate hike,” said Investec economist Victoria Clarke. Britain’s economy appears to be picking up after a slow first three months of the year, when unusually heavy snow hurt demand, and the central bank worries that growth is close to the modest pace at which it will start to push up inflation. Tuesday’s data showed the unemployment rate remained at its joint-lowest since 1975 at 4.2 percent while the proportion of working-age people in employment rose to a record 75.7 percent after 137,000 jobs were created over the three months to May. But economic growth since 2016’s Brexit vote has been weak by historic standards due to high inflation and business uncertainty, and on Monday the International Monetary Fund cut Britain’s growth forecast for 2018 to 1.4 percent. Moreover, the BoE has been repeatedly surprised over the years as the labour market has tightened but wages have risen less than expected - a pattern seen to a slightly lesser degree in most other advanced economies in recent years. Pay growth is one of the pieces of data the Bank of England looks at most closely for signs that domestic inflation pressures are rising strongly enough for inflation to be at risk of breaching its 2 percent target over the medium term if the BoE does not raise rates in the immediate future.     BoE Governor Mark Carney said at the start of the month that both the economy as a whole and pay were growing as the central bank had forecast in May, smoothing the way for an August rate rise. But last week one of his deputies, Jon Cunliffe, who opposed November’s rate rise, said pay growth did not seem to be breaking out of its recent 2.5-3.0 percent range and heading towards the 3 percent growth rate that the BoE predicts for the end of the year. Britain had seen numerous “false dawns” for pay growth in the past, and there could be more spare capacity in the labour market than the central bank thought, he added. Tuesday’s figures showed average hours worked per employee had fallen, giving scope for a future increase in output. Investec’s Clarke said slower wage growth probably reflected unusually big increases a year earlier. The BoE said last month that wage growth could slow for a few months before picking up. In July, more than a million public-sector health workers will receive a pay rise of around 3 percent. But other economists are less sure pay will accelerate on a lasting basis.  “Low unemployment is yet to generate serious wage pressures and Brexit uncertainties continue to reign,” said Ian Stewart, chief economist at accountants Deloitte. “The case for raising interest rates in August may have strengthened, but is hardly compelling.” Editing by Alison Williams and Ed Osmond",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economy/uk-pay-growth-slows-to-six-month-low-despite-record-employment-idUKKBN1K70RP,2019-02-08,,UK pay growth slows to six-month low despite record employment
2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp, trying to keep its new regional jet on track after series of delays, was forced to cancel a demo flight for the world’s aerospace industry on Tuesday after the jet was hit by a truck.  The prang, which follows the jet’s debut at the show on Monday, will not interrupt marketing efforts. But it will do nothing to help the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) pull in orders  at a time when giants Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are extending their grip to the smaller end of the market. The 90-seat MRJ, Japan’s great hope for reviving a dormant commercial aviation industry, was launched a decade ago. Five delays later, it is now expected to enter service with Japanese carrier ANA Holdings Inc (9202.T) in 2020, compared with the initial target of 2013. As a result, it missed a potentially lucrative window of opportunity to be the first to market with the latest generation of fuel-efficient regional jets.  It is now up against the already in-service Airbus A220 - the newly rebranded former Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) CSeries - and the Embraer E2 series, which may be controlled by Boeing if a provisional deal between the manufacturers is completed. “These developments are disastrous for the MRJ,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president, analysis at Teal Group. “They are no longer competing with small companies from Canada and Brazil; they are now competing with global aerospace behemoths, with enormous pricing power and industrial scale.” Mitsubishi Aircraft is looking to gain orders despite the increased competitive threat, and executives at Farnborough, hosting a press conference as the rival A220 flew overhead, said they felt they had a good chance in the regional market. “This is the newest plane design in several decades,” Shunichi Miyanaga, President and CEO of parent Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (7011.T) said. “Engine-wise and aerodynamically it is the newest type of regional jet and is highly competitive.”  It will not compete with the larger variants of the Embraer and A220 planes, with Miyanaga saying that it wanted to focus on the 100-seat and under segment of the market.  However, analysts say the more immediate challenge is hanging onto its existing order book given Mitsubishi Aircraft has so far lost its bet on U.S. pilot unions relaxing strict rules about the size of jets flown by regional carriers. Of the 213 firm orders, 150 are split between two U.S. regional carriers, SkyWest Inc (SKYW.O) and Trans States Holdings.  The MRJ90 is too large for them to fly without the relaxation of the pilot union rules and the prospect of changes has dimmed due to a pilot shortage that has given unions more bargaining power. As a result, Mitsubishi Aircraft is now trying to bring the smaller MRJ70, which can be flown by U.S. regional pilots, into service as quickly as possible, with late 2021 the target date. FlightGlobal’s 2018 Flight Fleet Forecast released last week estimated the regional jet market as worth $120 billion over the next 20 years, with 40 percent of the value coming from 70-76 seaters serving the North American market. However, MRJ has yet to convince its key U.S. customers to switch to its smaller jet, which has its own challenges.  The MRJ70 has 69 seats rather than the 76 of the rival Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E175 when configured with business and economy class as is typical in the United States, meaning its fuel efficiency is less of an advantage than it might seem. “Downsized variants of jetliner families have inferior economics - fewer seats, but the same engines, systems, and most of the structures too,” Teal Group’s Aboulafia said. Embraer on Monday signed a firm order with United Airlines UAL.N for twenty-five 70-seat E175 jets, shortly after JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) opted to replace its fleet of Embraer jets with the A220. SkyWest and Trans States did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they plan to switch to the MRJ70. For the Japanese consortium behind the MRJ, led by Mitsubishi Heavy with a 64 percent stake, the project has so far been a financial disappointment due to the delays and technical challenges. Nikkei last week reported Mitsubishi Aircraft was looking to increase its capital through a combination of a debt-to-equity swap and raising fresh equity.  Japan Inc’s ultimate goal for the programme, however, goes beyond profit. It is about serving as a foundation for the revival of Japan as a passenger jet manufacturer, rather than just a major supplier to companies like Boeing.  “We are working without pause to deliver the first aircraft to ANA in 2020. It is the beginning of a countdown, not only to the first delivery but to a new era for the industry,” Miyanaga said.

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Planemakers racked up more than $20 billion (15.08 billion pounds) of deals on the opening day of the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, suggesting demand for new passenger jets remains in rude health despite worries over trade tensions and Brexit. The deal-making came as host Britain tried to convince a sceptical aerospace industry about its plans to leave the European Union, saying supply chains would continue to run smoothly and pledging money for a new fighter jet programme.  European jetmaker Airbus (AIR.PA) and U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) have been enjoying an almost decade-long boom thanks to rising emerging markets growth and a need among Western airlines to upgrade their fleets, and order books are bulging.  Higher oil prices, rising interest rates, global trade tensions and uncertainty over Brexit have all raised concerns that demand may slow.  But business was brisk on the first day of the July 16-22 air show, though analysts will be watching closely to see how many of the deals are new, and how many involve adjusting earlier business or switching models - something not always easy to spot at first. Even before the first displays had taken to the skies over a sun-baked southern England, Boeing said delivery firm DHL, part of Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPWGn.DE), had placed a $4.7 billion order for 14 777 freighters, and purchase rights for seven additional freighters.  It followed that up with a $3.5 billion deal for 30 of its hot-selling single-aisle 30 737 MAX 8 aircraft with U.S. aircraft leasing firm Jackson Square Aviation, while Qatar Airways finalised an order for five 777 freighters. Meanwhile, Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for Taiwanese start-up StarLux Airlines to buy 17 of its A350 wide-body planes worth around $6 billion at list prices, and another MoU with an unidentified leasing firm for 80 A320neo single-aisle jets worth about $8.8 billion.       The Farnborough Airshow is the industry’s biggest event this year. It alternates with the Paris Airshow and collectively they account for over a quarter of industry order intake each year. Opening the event south west of London, British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to reassure aviation bosses that her under-fire Brexit plan won’t disrupt their supply chains. “We will take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. But we will do so in a way that is good for business and good for our future prosperity,” she said. Businesses have been getting increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity over future trading relations less than nine months before Brexit day on March 29, 2019. Airbus, which employs around 15,000 people in Britain, warned earlier this month that if Britain left the EU without a deal - a so-called “hard” Brexit - it could result in production at its factories stopping and aircraft being grounded.  Also at the air show, Britain’s defence minister Gavin Williamson unveiled a model of a new fighter jet called “Tempest” that the country plans to build.  He announced 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) of funding for the project to 2025 and said he was looking for other countries to join, with a senior Royal Air Force official saying Sweden was the most likely partner.  The project faces competition from a rival European one after France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter programme, saying it would start as a bilateral effort with Germany that could be expanded later. WIDE-BODY WORRIES On the civilian side, the air show is expected to confirm demand for narrowbody jets from airlines such as Mexico’s VivaAerobus, which is shopping for some 40 Airbuses, and lessors like Goshawk, which ordered 20 A320neo jets on Monday but is also expected to be interested in 737 MAX. Major lessors Air Lease and Avolon are also in town. But both Airbus and Boeing are under pressure to increase orders for some of their wide-body jets due to a recent slowdown in that part of the market. One exception is the Boeing 787, after a multi-year effort to end delays and cost overruns. Speaking after the deal for wide-body A350s with StarLux, Airbus chief commercial officer Eric Schulz said he was confident the market for such planes would pick up.  “What I have said consistently is that I see the wide-body market picking up within 18-24 months. I am quite confident.” “There are explanations as to why this wave is now coming. We had a very massive wave 4-5 years ago with a lot of orders. I think the market had to pause a little bit until we could deliver consistently and get to ramp up and rate. I think this is behind us now.” Reporting by Tim Hepher, Eric M.

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Top Boeing Co (BA.N) and Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA) executives on Monday defended their planned commercial aircraft partnership, saying they were confident it would win regulatory and shareholder approvals while launching Embraer into new markets. “I can’t anticipate that anyone will be against this project given the benefits that this will bring to Brazil,” Embraer’s Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva told a news briefing at Farnborough Airshow. “Who can be against more jobs, more exports, more technology, more access to capital?” The two aircraft manufacturers announced last month a $4.75 billion joint venture giving Boeing a controlling stake in  Embraer’s commercial aircraft arm. The Boeing-Embraer alliance, following on the heels of the Airbus-Bombardier tie-up announced last year, represents the biggest realignment in the global aerospace market in decades, strengthening established Western planemakers against newcomers from China, Russia and Japan, analysts say. The new company thrusts Boeing into the lower end of the market, giving stiffer competition to the CSeries jets - now rebranded as the A220 - designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc (BBDb.TO) which are backed by European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA). The deal must still clear political and regulatory barriers before closing as proposed at the end of next year. The partnership, which adds a 70- to 130-seat family to Boeing’s lineup, is expected to boost the U.S. firm’s earnings per share from 2020, generating annual pre-tax cost savings of about $150 million by the third year, the companies said. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on Monday the partnership would mark one of the defining moments in Boeing’s long history in aerospace. In addition to the passenger jet deal, Boeing and Embraer will deepen a sales and services partnership on the new KC-390 military cargo jet through a separate defence venture that is likely to eventually receive a joint investment. The companies told reporters they would collaborate on next-generations or modifications to the KC-390 platform as well as mutual agreements for managing the supply chain on the military and commercial side, while giving Embraer access to more markets. The deal will allow the companies to go to customers with combinations of fleet services between the single-aisle 737 MAX airplane and Embraer’s E2 family, the companies said. “Our teams work together seamlessly,” Muilenburg said.

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc fell over 3.5 percent on Monday after Chief Executive Elon Musk directed abuse on Twitter at one of the British cavers involved in the rescue of 12 Thai children last week. A number of analysts and investors, requesting anonymity, told Reuters that Musk’s comments were adding to their concerns that his public statements were distracting him from Tesla’s main business of producing electric cars. The stock sell-off knocked almost $2 billion off the company’s market value. Tesla shares were at $307.20 in after-hours trading on Monday from Friday’s close of $318.87.  James Anderson, a partner at Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder, asset manager Baillie Gifford, called the weekend’s events “a regrettable instance” and said he had reiterated to the company the need for “peace and execution” of its core business. The billionaire entrepreneur’s spat with British caver Vernon Unsworth started last week, after rescue teams rejected Musk’s offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to help rescue a 12-member soccer team and their coach trapped inside a flooded cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai.  “He can stick his submarine where it hurts,” CNN quoted Unsworth as saying last week. “It just has absolutely no chance of working.” Musk shot back on Sunday on Twitter: “We will make one (video) of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” The tweet was later deleted.  Tesla spokespeople and lawyers did not respond to emails and phone calls from Reuters requesting comment on Musk’s comments on Twitter. Musk gave no evidence for alleging Unsworth was a pedophile. Unsworth said he would consider taking legal action against Musk over the remarks, in comments filmed in Chiang Rai on Monday by Australia’s 9News. “It’s not finished. No justification. At the end of the day we were here to rescue 12 young boys. I don’t really understand the guy. Obviously it’s a bruised ego. I’ll take advice when I get back to London,” Unsworth told 9News.  Reuters could not immediately reach Unsworth for comment.  His wife, Voranan Rattawipakhun, told Reuters on Monday that her husband would return to Britain on July 19, where he will speak to lawyers. A police officer in the Chiang Rai district where Unsworth has lived for seven years, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that no charges or complaints had ever been filed against Unsworth. In a Tweet, Musk had proposed “a tiny kid sized submarine” for the rescue. He showed a test of the submarine in a Los Angeles swimming pool on July 9. Last week, Narongsak Osottanakorn, the leader of the rescue operation in Thailand, rejected Musk’s mini-submarine as not suitable for the task. Musk responded on Twitter on July 10, calling Osottanakorn “not the subject matter expert.”  Musk also regularly uses Twitter to criticize media reports on Tesla, which has struggled to meet its own production targets for its Model 3 sedan, which is seen as key to the company’s profitability.

2019-02-08,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Britain unveiled a model of a sleek proposed fighter jet named Tempest on Monday, raising questions about the future of European defence cooperation, given that Germany and France launched their own fighter jet program a year ago. At the Farnborough Airshow, Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) had been earmarked to finance the programme out to 2025 and that Britain would seek international partners to provide additional funding.  The aircraft, meant to eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, will be developed and built by BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L), Britain’s biggest defence company, alongside UK engine-maker Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR.L), Italian defence firm Leonardo (LDOF.MI), and European missile maker MBDA.  Unveiled before visiting foreign military chiefs and industry executives at the BAE chalet, the new jet can be flown by a pilot or operated as a drone. Germany and France are already working on a new jet, with the program led by France’s Airbus (AIR.PA), part of the Eurofighter consortium and Dassault Aviation SA (AVMD.PA), the maker of the Rafale. Industry executives said the two programs could eventually be fused, once Britain and the European Union sorted out Britain’s departure from the economic bloc in nine months. Failure to unite around a single fighter programme risked further fragmenting the European defence market, but the decision was up to government leaders, Airbus’s defence chief Dirk Hoke told Reuters. “If the politicians decide differently, we’ll have to adapt, but in my opinion that would be bad for Europe,” he said. Leonardo Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo also voiced hope that Europe would unite around one program. “It’s up to the governments, but Europe is moving more and more towards being unified. I have to be optimistic.” Air Vice-Marshal Simon Rochelle from Britain’s Royal Air Force said Britain was having discussions with potential partner countries, including Sweden and Japan.  He said it was not clear if the UK project would eventually be merged with the Franco-German one, adding, “We are having a lot of conversations with a lot of countries.” Analysts see Sweden as a likely partner, although countries such as South Korea, Japan and Turkey, or Gulf arms-buying nations like Saudi Arabia, are also possibilities. But experts say there is unlikely to be sufficient demand to support two separate European programmes, particularly given the high cost of developing a cutting-edge new aircraft.  UK plans call for the new jet to be operational by 2035, in time to replace the Typhoon fleet when it ends service in 2040.  The jet is the centerpiece of a new UK combat air strategy that Prime Minister Theresa May said was aimed at “maintaining our world-class air power capabilities.”  France announced in June that it would take a leading role on a new fighter programme that would start as a bilateral effort with Germany but could be expanded later.  The Typhoon, in contrast, was developed by the four-nation group of Germany, Spain, Britain and Italy in the 1980s. A German defence ministry spokesman declined to comment on the UK programme, but said the Franco-German project was open to additional partners.  Michael Christie, BAE Systems strategy director for air, said Britain had the capability to develop Tempest alone but that it made sense to develop it with a partner given the cost and a desire to lock in future sales.  However, he added that BAE wanted to “play a leading role in whatever partnership that we are involved in.” Britain has not developed a fighter jet alone since the 1960s. However, it helped develop and build the most advanced stealth fighter in the UK fleet, the U.S.-made F-35, with BAE Systems carrying out about 15 percent of the work on each jet.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. intelligence community has been clear about the threat posed by Russian political interference and will continue “to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence” assessments, the Director of National Intelligence said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump, after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, said he saw no reason to believe his own intelligence agencies rather than trust the Kremlin leader on the question of whether Russia interfered to help him win the 2016 presidential election.    “We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy,” the director, Dan Coats, said in a statement.
