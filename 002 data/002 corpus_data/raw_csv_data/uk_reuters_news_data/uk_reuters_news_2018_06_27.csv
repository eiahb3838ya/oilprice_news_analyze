2018-06-27,"BENGHAZI, Libya, June 27 (Reuters) - East Libyan officials said on Wednesday they would send oil revenue from areas under their control to a central bank based in the east, defying pressure to return recently recaptured ports to the internationally recognised state oil firm. The comments were made as a parallel National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the eastern city of Benghazi said it had formally taken delivery of eastern oil ports at a ceremony at Es Sider terminal. It is unclear whether the Benghazi NOC will be able to export any oil, despite the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) promising them control of all eastern ports and fields. But the move has created deep uncertainty over OPEC member Libya’s oil production, and risks deepening a split between factions based in the east and west of the country. The ceremony at Es Sider was attended by representatives of Libya’s eastern-based parliament and government, which are aligned with the LNA and oppose the internationally backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital, Tripoli. NOC Benghazi head Faraj Said, who was also present, called it a “happy and historic” day. “We undertake that the money won’t go to someone shorn of legitimacy,” he said, a reference to Tripoli central bank head Sadiq al-Kabir, whom eastern factions have repeatedly tried to oust. “We have a central bank in (the eastern town of) Bayda, and it is recognised by the Libyan parliament.” Es Sider and the neighbouring terminal of Ras Lanuf have been under LNA control since 2016. It let the Tripoli NOC operate the ports along with other eastern oil facilities, with revenue flowing to the Tripoli central bank. But after fighting off the latest in a series of attempts by their opponents to seize the ports, the LNA said on Monday that this time they would hand Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, and other eastern ports and fields to NOC Benghazi instead. Eastern government spokesman Hatem al-Oraibi said all previous oil contracts would be respected, but eastern authorities had taken the step because oil revenue had been going to “militias and extremist groups”. In the past, Western powers have prevented NOC Benghazi from exporting oil independently of Tripoli under U.N. Security Council resolutions that give power over oil exports to the GNA and NOC in the capital. On Wednesday, the United States, France, Britain and Italy said in a joint statement they were deeply concerned by the LNA’s offer of oil facilities to NOC Benghazi, and that the international community would “hold those who undermine Libya’s peace, security, and stability to account”. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the return of oil resources, production and revenue “to the control of the recognised Libyan authorities”. Writing by Aidan Lewis

2018-06-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock prices fell on most major markets on Wednesday even though the Trump administration modified its approach to curbing Chinese investment in the U.S. technology sector.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled a plan for a stronger security review process of foreign investors acquiring domestic technologies, after earlier indicating it would specifically block Chinese investments.  But later on Wednesday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview on Fox Business Network that Trump’s announced plan did not indicate a softened stance on China. “The market took that as a sign that the hardline approach to China has not waned,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. As of the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 165.52 points, or 0.68 percent, to 24,117.59, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX lost 23.43 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,699.63 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 116.54 points, or 1.54 percent, to 7,445.09. After a morning rally, the S&P technology .SPLRCT and industrial .SPLRCI sectors, which have a relatively high revenue exposure to China, fizzled. Tech stocks fell 1.45 percent, while industrials dipped 0.79 percent. U.S. bank stocks also fell with the S&P500 financial sector stock index .SPSY down for the thirteenth day after a fall of  1.3 pct on Wednesday.  In Europe, despite concerns over immigration the pan-European STOXX 600  closed up 0.7 percent. But MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.79 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.5 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 0.31 percent. China's Shenzen-listed blue chip stock index .CSI300 sank about 2.0 percent, testing 13-month lows. Chinese equities have now fallen 20 percent from a peak in January and are 45 percent lower than a high seen in 2015.  Ongoing concerns about disruption to global supply chains resulting from U.S. trade policy, along with expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates, are driving safe-haven flows into the U.S. dollar and pressuring emerging market currencies.  The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies, including against the Swiss franc and Japanese yen.    The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.69 percent at 95.249, its second straight day of gains, after it saw the highest levels since last October last week.   Gold prices slipped to a six-month low as the dollar strengthened, making bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. The move takes gold’s decline this month to more than 3.0 percent, the biggest monthly drop since September, driven by the dollar rally and a large decline in gold held by exchange-traded funds.  Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.5 percent to $1,252.75 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.44 percent to $1,254.40 an ounce. U.S. Treasuries gave back some price gains after Trump’s statement, but yields continued lower on the uncertainty.  “For the most part, the spectre of trade wars is still really weighing on risk here and that’s what’s keeping Treasuries better bid,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Crude oil, meanwhile, hit a 3-1/2-year high as plunging U.S. crude inventories compounded supply concerns arising from uncertainty over Libyan exports, a production disruption in Canada, and U.S. demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude from November.[O/R] U.S. crude stocks fell by nearly 10 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly fall since September 2016, while gasoline and distillate inventories rose less than expected, the Energy Information Administration said. U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose $2.23, or 3.16 percent, to settle at $72.76 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.31, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $77.62 a barrel.

2018-06-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) must compete if it wants to continue operating Indonesia’s Rokan block, the country’s biggest source of crude oil, after its contract expires in 2021, Indonesia Energy and Mines Minister Ignasius Jonan said on Wednesday.  Chevron asked Indonesia’s government earlier this year to extend its operating contract for Rokan beyond 2021 and since then has been in discussions with Indonesian officials on the issue. “I just talked to Chevron’s new CEO and told him that it is up to him. If they propose to continue to operate the Rokan block the economics have to be justifiable,” Jonan told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Gas Conference in Washington. “And they may face some competition as well, from foreign operators and from Pertamina,” he said, referring to Indonesia’s state oil and gas company. Michael Wirth, who has been with Chevron since 1982, became CEO in February.  A Chevron spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indonesia has earned a reputation for favoring Pertamina to take over expiring oil and gas contracts in the past, stoking concern among foreign energy investors about the security of their projects. Jonan, who said he is eager to earn the trust of investors to boost development of Indonesia’s natural resources, said the days of playing favorites were “in the past.” “The only maxim we stick to is the economics. There is no favoritism about the origin of the company, there is no political play. The answer is no and no. It is the economics. That applies to everyone, foreign companies, local companies, and government companies,” he said. Jonan said Indonesia was also in discussions with Chevron about another project it is operating, Indonesia Deepwater Development, a natural gas production effort in East Kalimantan, after Chevron cut $6 billion in spending plans there. “We both agreed to go and find the best way to work on this block for both sides,” he said, adding the negotiations now “will go down to the technical level.” Jonan said he had not yet used his authority to adjust fiscal terms for oil and gas blocks to encourage investment, but was ready to do so in any cases where investment returns were projected to be below 15 percent. Jonan said he is “seriously considering offering fiscal adjustments to a number of smaller blocks” in Indonesia, but he did not name the blocks or the companies involved. Jonan also said he met this week with Freeport McMoRan (FCX.N) CEO Richard Adkerson to discuss the company’s Grasberg gold and copper mine in Papua. The Phoenix-based company has been in tricky negotiations with Indonesia to secure long-term operating rights at the mine after the government introduced rules last year forcing it to divest its controlling interest. Jonan said the two agreed that Freeport needs freedom to operate the mine in the way it sees fit in the near term, but that the government insists on having a voice. “We agreed that, operations-wise, Freeport has to be in charge at the moment. Honestly, we don’t have the expertise,” he said. “But if you talk about control, it is a very delicate word in terms of management. I would like to say we both control.” Jonan added that Indonesia, which produces and exports large amounts of coal, currently viewed the fuel as critical to keeping electricity costs down for its population. “We have a serious concern about global warming and are trying to reduce the use of coal as the primary energy for our power plants,” he said. “But we go with the affordability for the public.” He said Indonesia would find it difficult to reach its target of generating 23 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2025 - as pledged under the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change - but remained hopeful it could reach somewhere above 20 percent by that time.

2018-06-27,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani election tribunal disqualified outgoing Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Wednesday from running in his home constituency, dealing the latest blow to the party of ousted leader Nawaz Sharif.  The surprise barring of Abbasi applies only to the constituency of Murree, and not the separate Islamabad seat in which he is also standing in the July 25 election. However, with four weeks until the vote he could still face new challenges. The ruling follows the arrest by an anti-corruption body of another member of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) after he was named to contest a seat. In the case of Abbasi, an election commission tribunal ruled that he did not declare an accurate value of his assets in his nomination papers. Abbasi denied the charges and termed the decision illegal, saying he will appeal against the ban. “I declared an actual value of my property at the rate which my father bought it in 1974,” he told local TV channels. “It is an election for the parliament. They have made it a joke.” Abbasi was named prime minister last year after the Supreme Court disqualified then-premier Sharif, who had served twice as prime minister before and was ousted both times. Since his removal, Sharif has been arguing that the Pakistani military establishment, aided by top members of the judiciary, backed a series of decisions which banned him from politics for life. Sharif has a history of differences with the military, which has ruled the nuclear-armed country for almost half of its history. In his third term, Sharif and the military clashed over differences over handling Islamist militants and his desire to mend diplomatic ties with arch-rival India. Sharif is separately facing criminal charges in an anti-corruption court that could see him jailed in the coming weeks. The anti-graft body has also approved a fresh inquiry into both Abbasi and Sharif over a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal project. Sharif and his party have termed the cases and other several measures as a pre-election attempt to tip the scales in favour of pro-military opposition politician Imran Khan. On Monday, another PML-N candidate, Qamarul Islam, was arrested on orders of the National Accountability Bureau over accusations he awarded government water contracts at over the market price. Former premier Abbasi was among the PML-N leaders who decried the arrest of Islam as bias ahead of the election.

2018-06-27,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - The United Nations aviation agency on Wednesday approved new standards needed to implement a 2016 global agreement that seeks to limit emissions from international flights, an aviation industry group said. Starting Jan. 1, 2019, most airlines flying international routes will begin monitoring their fuel and carbon emissions as part of the landmark agreement brokered two years ago by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  Airlines had called on ICAO to approve the standards which they need to prepare for the agreement that officially goes into effect in 2021.  “This now allows governments and industry to make final preparations for implementation before the CO2 emissions monitoring and reporting obligations commence in January 2019,” Michael Gill, executive director of the cross-industry Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), said in a statement. The 2016 ICAO deal requires airlines to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world. The new standards, approved by a majority of ICAO’s 36-member governing council, including the United States, give governments a technical guide on how to compile airlines’ emissions and how much the carriers will need to offset. “This is a very significant step, but there are still important details needed to be filled in,” Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a telephone interview.  ICAO has yet to finalize the specific criteria for fuels allowed under the agreement, she said. In principle, fossil fuels can qualify, but they will have to meet the agreement’s standards. Complying with the agreement is estimated to cost airlines less than 2 percent of industry revenue. The deal is voluntary for the first five years and becomes mandatory from 2027 for the world’s largest emitters. Airlines have supported a global agreement in favor of a potentially more costly patchwork of national and regional deals. An ICAO spokesman could not provide an immediate comment.

2018-06-27,"PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - AngloGold Ashanti’s gold mining operations in Guinea have been hit by two days of violent protests over power cuts in the northeastern mining town of Siguiri, a resident and an official said on Wednesday. Over a thousand protesters were surrounding the mine late on Wednesday. “We are negotiating with them to calm the situation,” Siguiri government administrator Ibrahima Kalil Keita told Reuters by phone. AngloGold Ashanti could be reached for comment. Minerals-rich Guinea suffers from chronic power shortages and citizens take to the streets from time to time to protest against prolonged outages. The demonstration in Siguiri, which began on Sunday, turned violent after residents said they had gone for over a month without electricity, with soccer fans in the region missing soccer World Cup games. “Some young people barricaded the road between Bouré and Siguiri demanding electricity. They clashed with the police...,” resident Moussa Conde told Reuters by phone. “The police opened fire after some protesters tried to break the gates of the (AngloGold’s) mine and attack the facilities. I saw at least 10 people who were wounded by gunshot at the Siguiri hospital,” Conde said. A gendarme source in Siguiri confirmed that security forces have clashed with residents over the past two days but gave no further details. The Siguiri mine produced 324,000 ounces of gold in 2017, a 25 percent rise compared with the previous year thanks to improved productivity and access to higher grade, according to the company.

2018-06-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as plunging U.S. crude stockpiles compounded supply worries in a market already uncertain about Libyan exports, a production disruption in Canada and Washington’s demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude from November. Little spare capacity remains to offset any further production disruptions, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management.  “The bulls will run the table and are going to be helped out by random events that will come out of left field and keep this thing going,” Kilduff said.  U.S. crude futures rose $2.23, or 3.16 percent, to settle at $72.76 a barrel. The contract touched $73.06  a barrel, the highest since Nov. 28, 2014. Brent crude rose $1.31, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $77.62 a barrel.  Both contracts pared gains in post-settlement trade. U.S. crude was up $1.77 at $72.30 a barrel and Brent trading up 90 cents at $77.21 a barrel by 3:51 p.m. EDT (1951 GMT).  Because prices gained sharply for two straight sessions, some long positions were exiting the market to capitalize on the move as the end of the quarter approaches, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital in Laurel Hollow, New York.   U.S. crude stocks fell nearly 10 million barrels last week, the most since Sept. 2016, while gasoline and distillate inventories rose less than expected, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S] Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for the NYMEX futures contract fell 2.7 million barrels, EIA said.  “Cushing is a whopper,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.  The reported Cushing draw reflected just one day of a production disruption at a supplier in Canada. Syncrude’s oil sands facility was offline at least through July, after a power outage last week locked in 350,000 bpd. “Next week, you’re going to have a Cushing storage number that includes seven days of the Syncude outage. The math there would imply that you’d get an even bigger draw than this week,” Yawger said. The front-month U.S. crude contract traded at $4.67 above the sixth-month contract, the most since July 2014. This encourages further drawdowns from storage.  The fall in Canadian exports helped drain supplies of heavy crude across North America, analysts said. They also cited concern about the risk of a disruption to supplies from Africa and the Middle East. In Libya, a power struggle has left it unclear whether the internationally recognised government or rebels will handle oil exports. The future of Iranian crude exports was also in doubt. The United States has told all countries to stop importing Iranian oil from November. Trying to make up for disrupted supply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said last week it would increase output. Saudi Arabia plans to pump a record 11 million bpd in July, up from 10.8 million bpd in June, an industry source familiar with Saudi plans told Reuters on Tuesday. Despite widespread international opposition to the U.S. stance on Iran, analysts expect a significant reduction in exports from OPEC’s third biggest producer, perhaps in excess of 1 million bpd. Iran pumped 3.8 million bpd in May, Reuters’ monthly survey showed [OPEC/O]. Goldman Sachs said the planned unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran would likely have a “high level of efficiency.” Risk consultancy Eurasia Group said: “We are increasing our estimate of oil likely to come off the market by November to about 700,000 bpd — another bullish factor for prices.” Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Christopher Johnson in London and Ayenat Mersie in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-oil-rallies-as-supply-disruptions-seen-from-canada-to-libya-idUKL4N1TT1AJ,27 Jun 2018,"* Canada supply disruption, Libya uncertainty boost prices

2018-06-27,"LONDON, June 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - China could slash its climate-changing emissions by 30 percent if all its cities cleaned up pollution from their dirtiest power plants and factories, researchers said on Wednesday. The world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases needs to focus on its urban areas in order to meet national-level targets under the international Paris Agreement to curb global warming, according to scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA). “To do this successfully you need to have a good idea of how to cut pollution at a local level without devastating local economies,” said lead researcher Dabo Guan. A world-first analysis of emissions data from 182 cities across China shows the importance of setting emissions control policies for urban areas, Guan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Improving the efficiency and environmental impact of the top five percent of polluters in cities could see China’s emissions fall by 30 percent, according to Guan, a professor of climate change economics at UEA. The analysis revealed a vast discrepancy in the economic growth and carbon footprint of China’s cities, which range from high-tech urban hubs to coal-dependent manufacturing bases. To curb pollution, each city requires a “different low-carbon road map”, specifically tailored to its economy, energy industry and carbon dioxide output, Guan said. Under the Paris Agreement, China pledged to decrease its carbon intensity - the amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it produces per unit of economic growth - by 60 percent. China’s wealthiest cities like Shanghai have significantly cut emissions in the past five years by investing in renewable energy and outsourcing energy-intensive production to other regions. But manufacturing cities in northern Shanxi province, which rely heavily on coal, saw an annual average increase of more than 1.5 percent. Investment in hi-tech equipment, such as energy-efficient boilers, is the most effective way for China’s worst-polluting cities to reduce their emissions, Guan said.

2018-06-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A modest global rally in stocks on Wednesday spurred by a newly unveiled U.S. plan that takes a less confrontational approach to curbing Chinese acquisitions of American technology faded as investors shed optimism, but strong gains in oil limited losses. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled a plan for a stronger security review process of foreign investors acquiring American technology, easing its tone from previous remarks indicating it would specifically block Chinese investments.  “Such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity,” Trump said in a statement. By late afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 31.34 points, or 0.13 percent, to 24,251.77, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 6.99 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,716.07 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 56.50 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,505.13. After an initial rally, the S&P technology .SPLRCT and industrial .SPLRCI sectors — which have a relatively high revenue exposure to China – fizzled. Tech stocks fell 0.63 percent, while industrials held a slim 0.15 percent gain. Investors said the latest development in U.S.-China trade dispute was not enough to ease their concerns about global commerce. “Nothing today came out other than commentary from the administration,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.43 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 0.31 percent. Declines in that index were led by China's Shenzen-listed blue chips .CSI300, which sank 2 percent to a whisker above 13-month lows. Chinese equities have now fallen into bear market territory, having tumbled 20 percent from recent peaks.  Political concerns in Europe are also worrying investors at the margin as a fight over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government rumbles on, raising fears that Europe’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. That also contributed to pushing euro zone yields lower DE10YT=RR, with those in Germany edging toward one-month lows. Trump’s latest plans to screen foreign investments led some safe-haven investments lower. The dollar, however, rose broadly, including against the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, on the U.S. new plan on foreign investments.    The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.63 percent at 95.249, on pace for its second straight day of gains.   The Japanese yen weakened 0.15 percent versus the greenback to 110.23 per dollar. Gold prices slipped to a six-month low as the dollar strengthened, making bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. [nL8N1TT2RM] The move takes gold’s decline this month to more than 3 percent - the biggest monthly drop since September - driven by a dollar rally, a large decline in gold held by exchange-traded funds and a sharp fall in speculative bets on higher prices. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.4 percent to $1,253.70 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.34 percent to $1,255.60 an ounce. U.S. Treasuries gave back some price gains after Trump’s statement, but yields continued lower on the uncertainty.   “For the most part, the specter of trade wars is still really weighing on risk here and that’s what’s keeping Treasuries better bid,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Oil, meanwhile, hit a 3-1/2-year high as plunging U.S. crude stockpiles compounded supply concerns arising from uncertainty over Libyan exports, a production disruption in Canada and U.S. demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude from November.[O/R] U.S. crude stocks fell by nearly 10 million barrels last week, the most since September 2016, while gasoline and distillate inventories rose less than expected, the Energy Information Administration said. U.S. crude oil futures settled at $72.76 a barrel, up $2.23, or 3.16 percent. Brent crude futures settled up $1.31, or 1.72 percent, at $77.62 a barrel.

2018-06-27,"(Adds Enbridge comment) By Rod Nickel ST. PAUL, Minnesota, June 27 (Reuters) - Indigenous tribes and environmental groups took aim on Wednesday at Enbridge Inc’s preferred route for its rebuilt Line 3 oil pipeline, while others panned all options ahead of an expected decision this week by a Minnesota regulator to determine whether the project can proceed. Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660 km) pipeline that runs from Alberta, Canada, to Wisconsin. It needs approval from the five-member Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which must decide whether the project is needed, and the route. Public scrutiny has focused on Enbridge’s preferred route, which would follow Line 3’s existing corridor partway through Minnesota before veering south to miss the Leech Lake reservation and avoid a nine to 12-month pipeline shutdown. An administrative law judge recommended in April that Line 3 follow the existing corridor instead. The commission this week has also unexpectedly looked at lesser-studied route alternatives. “You may find that all of them suck,” said Paul Blackburn, a lawyer for the activist group Honor the Earth. The Sierra Club environmental group echoed that view, saying Line 3 should operate as is until regulators ultimately shut it down. Enbridge’s preferred route is “a non-starter,” said David Zoll, a lawyer for the Mille Lacs indigenous band, adding that the best solution might be more time to study alternatives. “We should not feel compelled to make uninformed decisions,” he said. Enbridge’s favored route is “by far the worst,” said Seth Bichler, a lawyer for the Fond du Lac band. But Leech Lake said Enbridge’s preferred route is the best option as it means the pipeline will no longer bisect the reserve. Line 3, which began service in 1968, operates at half its capacity because of age and deterioration. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Selecting a route is a tricky task for the commission, which must balance concerns about indigenous wild rice harvesting areas and culturally important sites with possible construction delays and a pipeline shutdown that could harm refiners. Enbridge lawyer Christina Brusven said there are few buildable alternatives because of tribal opposition. Its preferred route twists and turns to avoid harming environmentally-sensitive and culturally important sites, she said. “We think that is a testament to our engagement and this process,” Brusven said. Bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude this year, while refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies. “This is a very important project for Canada,” Canada’s Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr told Reuters in Washington D.C. “We’re very hopeful that there will be a positive result.” But if three projects proceed, the industry could soon see surplus capacity transporting Canadian crude. Line 3, the Ottawa-backed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL would raise Canada’s crude export capacity to 5.5 million barrels per day from nearly 4 million bpd in 2017, according to the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI). Canada’s crude oil production is not forecast to reach 5.5 million bpd until 2030. Retiree Terry Lamb, a volunteer with activist group MN 350, used to build pipelines for a living. Now he opposes them, first the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, and now Line 3. “We don’t want to take the chance of (a spill),” Lamb said. “It’s another big giant corporation rolling over everyday people.” Phillip Wallace, business representative for Pipeliners Union 798, said its members will have to leave Minnesota for work if the project is defeated. “If this is shut down, it would be another trophy for (activists),” he said. “But let’s face it - we need crude.” (Reporting by Rod Nickel in St. Paul, Minnesota; additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Washington D.C.; Editing by David Gregorio)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/enbridge-inc-pipeline/update-1-minnesota-pipeline-foes-pan-route-options-for-enbridge-line-3-idUKL1N1TT1CM,27 Jun 2018,"Indigenous tribes

2018-06-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) is expecting $2 billion in additional costs this year due to the swelling expense of jet fuel, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said on Twitter on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Delta blamed a 50 percent annual rise in fuel costs for its decision to lower its second quarter profit forecast to between $1.65 and $1.75 per share from a previous estimate of up to $2 per share. The rising cost of jet fuel already weighed on U.S. airlines’ earnings in the first quarter and prompted rival American Airlines (AAL.O) to cut its full-year profit forecast in April. Atlanta-based Delta and its competitors are hoping strong demand, higher ticket prices and benefits from reductions in the U.S. corporate tax rate will eventually offset the impact of higher fuel prices. Delta’s shares were down about 2 percent at $50.04 in afternoon trading, slightly underperforming a 1.5 percent decline on the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index .DJUSAR.

2018-06-27,"OSLO (Reuters) - Plastic refuse should be seen as a raw material, able to produce “completely waste-based” recycled goods, the incoming chief executive of Austrian plastics maker Borealis AG told Reuters, vowing his firm would do its bit to cut pollution.  An estimated eight million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in the oceans every year in a mounting threat to marine life, according to the United Nations. Companies from Coca-Cola to Volvo Cars are planning ways to limit use of plastics. Consumer unease about the environmental cost of plastic waste has become a hot political topic. Governments are working to outlaw single-use items such as drinking straws and retailers are rushing to make their packaging more sustainable. Borealis has previously described plastic waste as “the Achilles heel of the plastics industry.”  The company, which makes plastic products ranging from food packaging to pipes and light-weight car parts, plans new investments to raise the share of recycled plastic in its goods. “We have a long-term vision that we want to make plastic waste a raw material,” Alfred Stern said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.  Borealis, which has 6,500 employees and 7.5 billion euros  ($8.71 billion) in sales last year, would aim for recycled products that are “completely waste-based, just like we use other feedstocks today”, he said.  “That will result in further investments over time,” he said, declining to give any timetable or estimated numbers. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund owns 64 percent of the company, with the rest held by Austria-based OMV. Stern, now head of Borealis’ polyolefin business and innovation, will take over from Mark Garrett as CEO on July 2.  He said Borealis was working with Volvo, which said last week that at least 25 percent of the plastics used in new car models from 2025 would be from recycled materials, up from about five percent now. “The materials we supply to Volvo with post-consumer recycling content perform like virgin materials,” he said. And Borealis also said earlier this month that it would invest 15 million euros ($17.50 million) to raise annual recycling capacity at its German unit mtm plastics GmbH, acquired two years ago, to 80,000 tonnes from 60,000. Stern said recycling did not make economic sense in many markets. China has banned imports of some low-grade plastic waste for recycling from this year, upending markets in Europe in North America which lack recycling capacity. “The end goal needs to be commercial, economic viability,” he said. Borealis is also working on a 4 million euro initiative announced in 2017 to combat plastic pollution of the oceans and improve waste management in South-East Asia, with a pilot project in the Indonesian fishing port of Muncar. Martin Stuchtey, a founder of SYSTEMIQ which works with Borealis in the anti-pollution project STOP, said Muncar would be a test case of ways to limit waste, collect and recycle plastics in a possible guide for governments.

2018-06-27,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iran’s supreme leader demanded punishment for those who disrupt business, signaling a tougher line after two days of strikes by market traders, the biggest unrest since the start of the year. With the economy facing the prospect of new U.S. sanctions, the country’s leadership signaled it was taking a united front toward the unrest. In a speech, President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who has long sought more open economic relations with the outside world, blamed Washington for Iran’s hardship, calling on Iranians to “bring America to its knees”. At Tehran’s Grand Bazaar on Wednesday, business was back to normal after the two-day strike had closed most shops. On Monday traders had massed outside parliament to complain about the plunge to record lows of Iran’s currency. Reuters was unable to verify footage that showed police clashing with protesters. Public demonstrations are rare in Iran but in recent months there have been several over the state of the economy.     Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the hardline cleric in power since 1989, demanded the judiciary punish those “who disrupt economic security”, in remarks clearly intended to send a message to Iranians who may plan more demonstrations.  “The atmosphere for the work, life and livelihood of the people must be secure,” he said in a meeting with judiciary officials, according to his official website. “And the judiciary must confront those who disrupt economic security.” The bazaar strike is the biggest sign of domestic disquiet in Iran since the United States abandoned a deal to lift economic sanctions in return for curbs to Tehran’s nuclear program. The deal was the centerpiece of Rouhani’s plans to open Iran’s economy, which won him two landslide elections but has yet to bring widespread economic benefits for many Iranians. Washington has pledged even tighter sanctions than before, although its European allies and other world powers say they still support the nuclear deal.  “We will take problems. We will take pressure. But we will not sacrifice our independence,” said Rouhani in an address broadcast on state television. In the latest U.S. push against Tehran, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday that countries buying oil from Iran should prepare to halt all imports of it starting in November or face punishment. The threat of restored U.S. sanctions has caused the rial to collapse, hurting business by driving up the cost of imports. The rial traded at 78,500 against the dollar in the unofficial market on Wednesday, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com. This compares to around 43,000 at the end of last year. “It should surprise no one #IranProtests continue. People are tired of the corruption, injustice & incompetence of their leaders. The world hears their voice,” tweeted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. An Iranian oil official dismissed U.S. efforts to squeeze Iran’s oil industry. “Iran exports a total amount of 2.5 million barrels per day of crude and condensate, and eliminating it easily and in a period of a few months is impossible,” the official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Trump’s determination to deprive Iran of funding raises the stakes for Rouhani, who has attempted to appease anger over his government’s handling of the economy. The Iranian parliament showed the level of discontent over Rouhani’s performance, issuing a letter, signed by 187 representatives — more than half of the total — asking that the president change his administration’s economic team. Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at London’s Betamatrix consultancy, estimated U.S. sanctions could cause Iran’s crude oil exports to drop by between 500,000 and 800,000 bpd in coming months. He said a fall below 1.4 million bpd — the level two years ago, before the nuclear deal — was unlikely as Iran would remain able to sell some oil abroad through barter deals. Turkey said on Wednesday it did not consider itself bound by the U.S. effort to stop Iran exporting oil. But the sanctions may stifle Iran’s long-term plans to expand its oil industry. After a deal reached this month among global oil producers to raise output, Saudi Arabia and Russia look set to take market share from Iran.  “Iran is in a weaker position to cope with these sanctions than it was during the last sanctions period two years ago,” Emadi said. Then, Iran had some $150 billion of currency stored abroad in countries such as China and Turkey as well as European banks. Detailed figures for foreign exchange reserves are secret, but Tehran has now drawn down much of that buffer to handle expenses such as capital flight and foreign intervention, Emadi said. He predicted Iran might ultimately enter a fresh recession as lower oil revenues prompted the government to put public sector projects on hold and as the economy became more militarized in response to U.S. pressure.  A downturn in growth could worsen bad debt problems in the banking sector, which the International Monetary Fund has warned could destabilize the economy.

2018-06-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Canadian government would like to see construction accelerate on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, but has no control over decisions to resume or start new work until it takes ownership of the major crude oil pipeline project, Canada’s natural resources minister said. “We think that construction and staying on a schedule is important, but that will be up to Kinder Morgan as long as they are the owner of the pipeline,” Jim Carr said in an interview in Washington, D.C. where he is attending the World Gas Conference. Carr said he expects the deal to close in “mid to late summer.” The Canadian government agreed to buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s (KML.TO) Trans Mountain pipeline and project for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in late May, promising the deal would allow work on the massive expansion to begin immediately. Kinder Morgan halted all non-essential work on the C$7.9 billion project earlier in May, citing regulatory uncertainty and opposition from the province of British Columbia. The Trans Mountain pipeline runs from Edmonton, Alberta to a deepwater port in the Vancouver area. The expansion would nearly triple its capacity, giving Canadian producers greater access to Asia and other world markets. “We know that expanding export markets is a good idea and that has been reinforced by recent events,” said Carr, noting that 99 percent of Canada’s oil and gas exports go to the United States. Canada’s oil producers, who currently sell their crude at a steep discount to the North American benchmark, are desperate for construction to begin. Some aboriginal groups and the province of British Columbia fiercely oppose the expansion. On Wednesday, Kinder Morgan said it is seeking permits to start work on its Burnaby Terminal expansion, a major component of the project. It has previously said that work is underway at its Westridge Marine Terminal. It did not provide an updated construction schedule. Under the current schedule, terminal construction should already be well underway with pipeline construction starting in July. The anticipated in-service date is December 2020, though it was unclear if that was still attainable. “We think that there’s value in having the construction schedule accelerate, but until we own the project we can’t control that,” Carr told Reuters.  The government does not intend to own the pipeline for long and is looking for a new buyer.

2018-06-27,"LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska got a boost on Wednesday in a long-running battle for control of Norilsk Nickel when a high court judge ruled fellow investor Roman Abramovich did not have the right to sell shares in the miner to a third businessman.  Deripaska, who controls aluminum giant Rusal (0486.HK), wants to stop Abramovich from selling Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) (GMKN.MM) shares to Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin, saying that would violate a 2012 shareholder agreement. At London’s High Court, Judge Stephen Phillips ruled such a sale by Abramovich, the owner of England’s Chelsea soccer club, breached the terms of that shareholder pact. He found Abramovich’s company Crispian “was and is precluded under the framework agreement from disposing of shares”. The judge added the court was adjourned pending applications, including for permission to appeal.  Potanin said in March he purchased a 2 percent stake in Nornickel from Abramovich for about $800 million.  The deal increased Potanin’s holding in the miner to 32.9 percent, but the court said previously the sale could be reversed if the London court ruled in favor of Rusal. “Rusal is pleased with today’s London court ruling. This completely vindicates Rusal’s decision to challenge the notice,” Rusal said. Interros, which manages Potanin’s assets, declined to comment. A spokesman for Abramovich was not immediately available for comment. Rusal, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions since April, holds a 27.8 percent stake in Nornickel. Nornickel competes with Brazil’s Vale (VALE3.SA) for the rank of the world’s top nickel producer and is also the world’s largest palladium producer. Deripaska and Potanin have periodically been at loggerheads since Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer outside China, bought a stake in Nornickel just before the 2008 global financial crash.     Abramovich stepped in as a “white knight” minority shareholder in 2012 to act as a buffer between Potanin and Deripaska. Deripaska made his first public appearance since being made a target of U.S. sanctions to give evidence to the hearings in May that preceded Wednesday’s judgment. The judge has yet to detail his reasons, which he said would be published “at a later date”.

2018-06-27,"WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Natural gas production from U.S. shale fields can keep growing for decades, giving Washington a powerful diplomatic tool to counter the geopolitical influence of other energy exporters such as Russia, industry executives and government officials said at a conference here. Already the world’s largest gas producer, the United States can expand shale gas output another 60 percent in the coming decades, according to at least one estimate. So far, liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been spared from retaliatory tariffs in U.S. President Donald Trump’s intensifying trade conflicts with China and other countries. “We see a century of natural gas supply in U.S. shale,” Ryan Lance, chief executive of U.S. shale producer ConocoPhillips said this week at the triennial World Gas Conference in Washington. “Shale’s abundance is real and it’s not going away.” The United States currently produces about 72 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas each day, a figure that is expected to grow by 7 bcf per day this year. And within 20 years, U.S. shale gas output should grow an additional 60 percent, according to a study from IHS Markit Ltd. While Trump’s tariffs against China, Europe, Mexico, Canada and others have cast a short-term pall over Washington’s energy ambitions, the administration has repeatedly said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to global allies through supply agreements and technology sharing. Trump is also rolling back domestic regulations to encourage more oil and gas production. The strategy, which Trump dubs “energy dominance,” is aimed at making the United States a viable alternative to rival energy producers like Russia, as Washington seeks to forge bonds with big consumers like China. “We’re sharing our energy value with the world,” Rick Perry, the U.S. secretary of energy, said this week at the conference. Conoco and its U.S. peers have sharply ramped up natural gas production in the past decade, using hydraulic fracturing technology to tap shale fields in Texas, Pennsylvania and elsewhere. The United States is also boosting export capacity. LNG facilities from Cheniere Energy Inc, Tellurian Inc and others are either operating or planned across the U.S. Gulf Coast. “What the U.S. has done for the world with shale gas is given another form of affordable, competitive energy that can be relied upon,” said Jack Fusco, Cheniere’s CEO, said at the conference. Cheniere, one of the largest exporters of U.S. natural gas, has shipped more than 350 LNG cargos to 28 countries around the globe, including China. “Gas is much more of a global market than it used to be,” Dan Yergin, an energy economist and IHS Markit vice chairman, said at the conference this week. The ramp-up in U.S. shale gas production coincides with a demand spike from power producers, with coal-fired generation increasingly anathema across the developing world. Industry executives have aggressively touted gas as a way to increase access to affordable electricity and limit greenhouse gas emissions. “This shale gale has boosted the U.S. economy and transformed markets around the world,” Darren Woods, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp, said at the conference. Exxon has the most drilling rigs operating in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the second-largest U.S. gas producing region. By 2025, the company wants to more than triple its Permian output to more than 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Rising U.S. output has not gone unnoticed by major consumers around the world, with South Korea, China and others eager for stable fuel sources. “There’s going to be a big difference in the way the global gas market works in the future compared to how it’s worked in the past,” said Rusty Braziel of RBN Energy consultancy.

2018-06-27,"(Adds estimated cost of the project) June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday it expects to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2019 on whether to build the first liquefied natural gas export terminal in Mozambique. Mitchell Ingram, Anadarko’s executive vice president, international, deepwater and exploration, said at the World Gas Conference in Washington, D.C., that the U.S. oil and gas producer was ready to move forward with the Mozambique project after lining up enough customers for the LNG. Ingram said the company was in the process of converting the sales agreements into binding sales agreements and ramping up financing for the project. “Once we complete that, we will be ready to make a final investment decision in the first half of 2019,” he said. He spoke a couple of weeks after Anadarko and its partners in the Mozambique project signed sales agreements with units of Tokyo Gas Co Ltd and Centrica Plc. That deal with the Japanese and UK energy companies calls for the delivery of 2.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) from the start-up of production in Mozambique until the early 2040s. Other firms lined up to buy gas from the project include units of Electricite de France SA, Japanese utility Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc and Thailand’s state-run PTT. Anadarko’s partners in the project include units of Mitsui & Co Ltd of Japan and ONGC Videsh of India, among others. The Mozambique project, which is located between both the Asia-Pacific and European markets, will consist of two liquefaction trains with the capacity to produce 12.88 MTPA to support development of the Golfinho/Atum fields located entirely within Offshore Area 1. Ingram said Anadarko managed to squeeze about $4 billion out of the cost of building the onshore part of the project, bringing the cost down to about $600 per tonne, which according to a Reuters calculation would bring the total to about $7.7 billion. In the past, Anadarko has said it was looking to raise about $14-15 billion for the project. Officials at the company were not immediately available to comment on the latest total cost estimate. The company has said it expects to complete the facility in the 2023-2024 timeframe. As consumers shift from coal to cleaner burning gas for power generation and other uses, demand for LNG is expected to exceed supply in 2022 or 2023, according to a report from energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. In 2017, global LNG sales rose 9.9 percent to a record 289.8 million tonnes, according to the International Association of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL). Anadarko made its first discovery in Offshore Area 1 in 2010. In total, Ingram said the company and its partners have discovered about 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas in the field. Ingram said this project paves the way for significant future expansion of up to 50 MTPA in the future. Anadarko has said the Golfinho/Atum project will also supply initial volumes of about 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for domestic use in Mozambique.

2018-06-27,"(Adds quotes, details throughout) By Michelle Nichols NEW DELHI, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday it was important India cut Iranian oil use, but said the United States would work to allow India to use an Iranian port as corridor to Afghanistan. “Sanctions are coming (on Iran) and we’re going forward on that, and with India and the U.S. building strong relationships we hoped that they would lessen their dependence on Iran,” Haley, a member of U.S. President Donald Trump’s cabinet, told two reporters after her meeting with Modi in New Delhi. The United States said on Tuesday it has told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off funding to Iran. India is one of the largest importers of Iran’s oil. “There’s a will, a political will, from both sides to figure out how to make this work,” Haley said. “Prime Minister Modi very much understands where we are with Iran, he didn’t question it, he didn’t criticize it, he understood it and he also understands that (India’s) relationship with the U.S. is strong and important and needs to stay that way.” The U.S. push to curb countries’ imports of Iranian oil comes after Trump in May withdrew from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers aimed at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Trump ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that were suspended under the accord. Haley said the implications of Iran-related sanctions would be discussed when the foreign and defense ministers of India and the United States meet shortly. Japan and South Korea, also major buyers of Iranian oil, are in talks with the U.S. government in a bid to avoid the adverse effects of sanctions. Haley said she also discussed with Modi the Indian-backed Chabahar port complex in Iran, being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for landlocked Afghanistan and which could open the way for millions of dollars in trade and cut Afghanistan’s dependence on neighboring Pakistan. “We know the port has to happen and the U.S. is going to work with India to do that,” Haley said. “We know that they’re being a great partner with us in Afghanistan and really trying to assist the U.S. and trying to do more. The port’s vital in trying to do that.” “We realize we’re threading a needle when we do that,” said Haley, describing a balancing act of ensuring Indian use of the port in Iran while Washington is at the same time trying to once again cut Tehran off from international markets. Haley has used her role at the U.N. to regularly attack and ramp up pressure on Iran, accusing it of meddling in Syria and Yemen. She said she spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo early on Wednesday, before meeting with Modi. Despite rising trade tensions between the United States and India, Haley - the daughter of Indian immigrants - said “the idea of a trade war wasn’t even an option.” Bilateral trade rose to $115 billion in 2016, but the Trump administration wants to narrow its $31 billion deficit with India, and is pressing New Delhi to ease trade barriers. Haley said she also discussed military cooperation with Modi as the Trump administration has launched an effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China’s assertive posture across Asia.

2018-06-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Relief that the trading dispute between China and the United States was on course to de-escalate pushed European shares higher on Wednesday after a start in negative territory.       Fears over higher global barriers to trade had initially sent European stocks to 11-week lows but the Trump’s administration decision to use an existing, but strengthened, security review for investments in technologies, rather than China specific restrictions, fueled optimism. The pan-European STOXX 600  closed 0.7 percent higher as Wall Street opened higher, also boosted by the news. “Firmly strapped into the trade war rollercoaster, the markets saw a chunky upswing on Wednesday afternoon as Trump appeared to pull back from the brink”, said Connor Campbell, a financial analyst for Spreadex.  Energy stocks .SXEP added the most points to the index as crude prices climbed on supply disruption in Canada and after U.S. officials told importers to stop buying Iranian crude from November. BP (BP.L), Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) rose 3.3 percent, 2 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.  Industrials Airbus (AIR.PA) and Siemens (SIEGn.DE) which had been big drags on the index as investors priced in a more difficult trade environment for big exporters, rebounded with rises of 2.7 percent and 1.9 percent.  Autos stocks .SXAP also made a come-back in the black, up 0.2 percent and drove Germany’s DAX up 0.9 percent.  Imerys (IMTP.PA) shares rose 4 percent after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the mineral extracting and processing company to “outperform” from “neutral”.  Shares in French oil storage and distribution company Rubis (RUBF.PA) fell 5.1 percent after Berenberg cut the stock to “hold” from “buy, saying weakness in the oil storage business is likely to persist in the short- to medium-term. Despite the change of mood on Wednesday, investors have overall been pulling billions out of European stocks and shifting into U.S. stocks in recent weeks as trade tensions ratcheted up.  A global investor confidence index by State Street dropped in June, with the decline in sentiment largely driven by a significant fall in European investors’ confidence.  “Right now the environment is more positive for U.S. stocks but that could change fairly quickly,” said Invesco’s Hooper, adding: “One of the key themes this year is rotation of leadership.”  Analysts have been upgrading their earnings expectations for European stocks in the past weeks despite building trade tensions.

2018-06-27,"(Fixes typos in paras 11 and 19) By Munyaradzi Makoni CAPE TOWN, June 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a South African Airways Boeing 737 took off from O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg two years ago, headed for Cape Town, it was powered by an unusual fuel: tobacco. South Africa hasn’t yet repeated the jet biofuel feat, but in an effort to cut its climate-changing emissions and promote greener power the country’s researchers are looking for innovative ways to manufacture green aviation fuel at larger scale. A new “Waste to Wing” project aims to one day produce a significant share of the country’s aviation fuel from waste plants, including invasive species. “South Africa produces a large amount of agricultural waste, as well as waste from plantation forestry and waste biomass from alien vegetation clearing programmes,” said Tjasa Bole-Rentel, an energy economics and policy specialist for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), one of the groups involved in the biofuel push. So far the effort is a small “proof of concept” project, likely to produce just enough jet biofuel for one more flight, she said. But if the technology works, production could be scaled up significantly - perhaps to as much as 15 percent of the aviation fuel used at Johannesburg’s international airport, she said. Finding clean fuel for planes, ships and other forms of transport hard to plug into a clean energy grid remains one of the biggest challenges for reducing climate changing emissions. But as airlines face increasing pressure to become more sustainable, countries around the world are trying to find solutions, from hydrogen powered barges to, in South Africa’s case, planes that could fly on weeds. Scaling up jet biofuel - and making it cost effective - hasn’t been easy, however. Farmers in South Africa’s Limpopo province today continue growing solaris, a nicotine-free tobacco that produces large amounts of oil and that was used as a feedstock for the country’s first tobacco-powered flight. But “there is no local refining capacity available and the sheer scale of farming needed to make the economies of scale work at this moment in time” is difficult, Merel Laroy, a spokesman for SkyNRG, a Netherlands-based alternative jet fuel supplier, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One of the lessons learned, she said, is that making the biofuel locally is key. “When there’s no local production capacity, the feedstock must be shipped out of the country and shipped back after refining. This makes the sustainable aviation fuel much more expensive,” she said. The Waste to Wing project, with $1.4 million in funding from the European Union’s SWITCH Africa Green Programme, aims to solve that problem and cut costs and protect agricultural production and forests by using waste to create fuel. The effort, a partnership by South African social enterprise Fetola, WWF, and SkyNRG, aims to create a clean jet fuel supply in South Africa, a country with a long history of developing and using alternative fuels. As part of the project, 25 small businesses will collect and supply the plant matter needed to make the biofuel - an effort to create jobs in a country with one of the world’s biggest unemployment rates. Amanda Dinan, Fetola’s project manager, said the businesses could use invasive plants, collected in environmental restoration projects and currently simply stored or abandoned, as the raw material for jet fuel. Such stores of dried plants today can present a wildfire risk in a country suffering drought, so are often purposely burned to avoid that risk, she said. But the waste could provide jobs “in its harvesting, collection, pre-treatment and transport,” Dinan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She and Bole-Rentel said no biomass will be produced for being converted to fuel. “As the name suggests, the Waste to Wing project will focus on waste biomass”, including leftovers from food and livestock feed production, paper making and furniture production, Bole-Rentel said. At the moment, most of the agricultural waste produced in the country is burned, she said. In some areas, harvested invasive plants already are being used to produce charcoal or fibrous products such as coffins, but most of the waste is unused, she said, and only that unused supply will be diverted to the jet fuel project. Bole-Rentel said the project was designed to stand up to worsening drought linked to climate change in southern Africa, and ensure food-producing land isn’t used to make fuel instead. South Africa still has large swathes of invasive plants to clear, and the weeds are spreading faster than they can be cut back, Dinan said, which means the jet fuel project could both aid that effort and is unlikely to run out of stock to make fuel. Sampson Mamphweli, director of the Centre for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Studies at Stellenbosch University, agreed the country has plenty of organic waste. “Whether they use organic waste, or they plant the biomass for energy, whichever way the project is worth investigating,” he said. One huge challenge with such projects is the cost of transporting plant waste, so material would need to be sourced as close as possible to where jet biofuel is produced, Mamphweli said. And “the cost of the actual biomass material is also a big factor,” he said. Often, a once useless and free material becomes valuable when there is a use for it, he said. Bole-Rentel said it was too soon to get any real picture of how much of South Africa’s aviation fuel needs might be met by the waste-to-fuel project. But “our previous research into biomass availability suggests that, technically, there could be enough biomass to meet 100 percent of our aviation fuel demand,” she said. But under current technology the biofuel would need to be blended with conventional jet fuel, meaning the waste technology could supply at best half of the country’s needs, she said.

2018-06-27,"* Westinghouse sees no regulatory roadblocks to takeover * Brookfield to recapitalise the bankrupt reactor builder * Westinghouse resumes talks with India on six-reactor deal * Company confident it will be on Saudi tender shortlist By Geert De Clercq PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - U.S. nuclear firm Westinghouse expects to emerge from bankruptcy with sufficient equity in coming weeks and is targeting Saudi Arabia and India for new reactor sales, its CEO said. Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management in January agreed to buy Westinghouse from Toshiba for $4.6 billion after cost overruns on U.S. reactors pushed the atomic energy pioneer into bankruptcy in March 2017. Westinghouse CEO Jose Gutierrez said the Brookfield deal would close as soon as it had been approved by U.S. and British nuclear regulators and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). “We are confident we will get those approvals in the next few weeks, we don’t see any roadblocks,” Gutierrez told Reuters at the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris. Once the deal is closed, Westinghouse will officially emerge from bankruptcy and Brookfield will recapitalise the firm. “We will have the right capital structure and the necessary cash for running our business,” Gutierrez said. The amount of money to be injected is under discussion. Westinghouse hopes sales will get a boost when the first of four long-delayed AP1000 reactors in China starts up this year. Gutierrez said fuel had been loaded in the Haiyang 1 reactor on Tuesday and the Sanmen 2 reactor was waiting for permission to load fuel. The Haiyang 2 had finished hot functional testing and would be ready to load fuel soon, he said. Sanmen 1, in Zhejiang province, loaded fuel in April, ran its first nuclear reactions in June and is set for commercial operation by November, Chinese authorities said this month. Contracts for the four reactors - two at Sanmen and two at Haiyang in Shandong province - were signed in 2007-2009. The first one had been scheduled to launch in 2014. Gutierrez said Chinese authorities expect two or maybe three AP1000s will connect to the grid before end of 2018. Projects for six more AP1000s in China are pending and Westinghouse expects China will build a fleet of at least 20 AP1000s in the coming decade. As Westinghouse has transferred the technology to China it will not benefit from new builds, but expects to earn money on providing fuel and maintenance. About 85 percent of Westinghouse revenue comes from fuel and services, only about 15 percent from building new reactors. Not having a working AP1000 has hampered Westinghouse and other vendors have won major tenders instead. This month, Russia’s Rosatom stole a march on Westinghouse with a contract to sell four VVER-1200 reactors. Two of those will be built at Xudaobao in northeast China, on a site once earmarked for Westinghouse. In April, Westinghouse received strong support from U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry for its plan to build six AP1000s in India, a massive project set in motion by a U.S.-India agreement 10 years ago. But since Toshiba will no longer act as master builder, there are doubts about the plan. “Now that we are emerging from Chapter 11, we are resuming conversations with India,” Gutierrez said. Westinghouse is also waiting for Saudi Arabia to decide on a shortlist of two to three bidders to build two nuclear plants. Besides Westinghouse, state-owned companies from Russia, France, China and South Korea are in the running. “It is a reality that the other four bidders are countries and we are a private company,” Gutierrez said, adding that he was confident that Westinghouse would be on the shortlist. The Saudi authorities had been due to decide at the end of March. Once the shortlist is made, bidders will discuss business models and financing, a process that will take at least another year before Saudi Arabia picks a winner. Gutierrez said that during its bankruptcy, Westinghouse - which sells services, fuel and spare parts to almost 80 percent of world’s 450 reactors - had not lost a single contract. Gutierrez had no news on Toshiba’s attempts to sell its NuGen unit, which has a project to build reactors in Britain. Westinghouse is also working on finalising two AP1000 reactors in Vogtle, Georgia by 2021. Two other AP1000s under construction in the United States were abandoned, half-built as costs got out of hand.

2018-06-27,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s main opposition leader on Wednesday said he feared the government would use a blast that hit a weekend rally by President Emmerson Mnangagwa as an excuse to clamp down on opponents ahead of a July 30 vote. Mnangagwa is the election favourite and a spokesman for his ruling ZANU-PF party, Simon Moyo, said the government was not planning any clampdown. Nelson Chamisa, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which has formed a poll alliance with smaller parties, said Mnangagwa was leading an unstable government without capacity to resolve Zimbabwe’s problems, including the economy. “We know that they would also want to use that as a pretext to clamp down on the opposition, they would want to use it to start targeting certain individuals, certain candidates that they perceive to be their credible opposition,” Chamisa, 40, told Reuters in an interview. Mnangagwa, 75, blamed a ZANU0-PF faction loyal to former leader Robert Mugabe’s wife Grace for the attempt on his life in Bulawayo city and has said the government is taking steps to ensure peace endures. Two people died and dozens were injured in the explosion.  The presidential and parliamentary vote is the first since Mugabe was forced to resign in November after a coup. It is seen as a contest between generations. Chamisa said he was confident he would form the next government, which would include ZANU-PF elements, but complained the electoral field was tilted in Mnangagwa’s favour. He said the MDC was worried about “ghost voters” on the poll register and was also concerned over which firm would be granted the contract to print the ballots.  He said the army should publicly declare it would respect the result even if Mnangagwa lost. The military remains averse to any leader who was not part of the liberation war against white rule, analysts say.  While Zimbabwe lacks a reliable polling system, an unofficial survey released early this month in Bulawayo by the Mass Public Opinion Institute put Mnangagwa’s popularity on 42 percent against Chamisa’s 31 percent. The survey showed that a large group, 25 percent, declined to disclose a preference. The institute will publish another survey just before the vote. Chamisa, whose party has promised to revive the economy, said his government would review all investment deals signed by the government to ensure Zimbabwe did not lose out. Platinum and coal deals are among those that would be scrutinised, Chamisa said, adding he would seek better trade terms with China, a big investor in the country. Zimbabwe signed a $4.2 billion platinum deal with a Cypriot investor Karo Resources in March and is developing a $3 billion platinum joint venture with Russian partners.   “We need to investigate to see what was involved,” Chamisa said, referring to the coal and platinum deals.  He said he was not afraid to antagonise powerful forces. “I am not worried about the anger of dealers. We do not want dealers in Zimbabwe, we want investors,” he said, arguing that some of the investors were mere dealmakers.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled a plan for a stronger security review process of foreign investors acquiring American technologies, softening its tone from previous remarks indicating it would specifically block Chinese investments. “Such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security, and future economic prosperity,” Trump said in a statement. By mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 185.82 points, or 0.77 percent, to 24,468.93, the S&P 500 gained 13.14 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,736.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.14 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,573.76. Gains were capped by investors’ persistent concerns about the volatility in U.S.-China trade rhetoric. “Investors are trying to decide what the policy is going to be with respect to trade with China and the rest of the world. It vacillates between their feeling pessimistic about it and some sense of encouragement that it won’t be as severe as feared,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.90 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.10 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.24 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.31 percent. Losses were led by China, where Shenzen-listed blue chips sank 2.1 percent to a whisker above 13-month lows. Chinese equities have now fallen into so-called bear market territory, having tumbled 20 percent from recent peaks. “After a lot of saber-rattling, we are seeing Shanghai suffering a lot more than Wall Street, so clearly the first round (of trade war) has been won by America. Unfortunately, that then overflows into emerging markets and Europe,” said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at UK wealth manager Investment Quorum. Political concerns in Europe are also worrying investors at the margin as a fight over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government rumbles on, raising concerns that the euro zone’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. That also contributed to pushing euro zone yields lower , with German yields edging toward one-month lows. Trump’s latest plans to screen foreign investments led some safe-haven investments lower. The dollar, however, rose broadly, including against the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, on the U.S. new plan on foreign investments. The dollar was up 0.28 percent against the yen at 110.36 yen, and it advanced 0.47 percent against the franc. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was up 0.44 percent at 95.075, on pace for its second straight day of gains. Gold prices slipped to a six-month as the dollar strengthened, making bullion more expensive for buyers using other currencies. The move takes gold’s losses this month to more than 3 percent - the biggest monthly loss since September - driven by a dollar rally, a large decline in gold held by exchange traded funds and a sharp fall in speculative bets on higher prices. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,255.27 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.25 percent to $1,256.80 an ounce. U.S. Treasuries gave back some price gains after Trump’s statement, but yields continued lower on the uncertainty. In oil markets, prices rose on supply disruption in Canada, falling U.S. crude stocks, uncertainty over Libyan exports and U.S. demands that importers stop buying Iranian crude from November.

2018-06-27,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Dutch parliament will approve a law requiring the Netherlands to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 95 percent by 2050, compared with the level in 1990, lawmakers representing 75 percent of the seats in the Dutch Lower House said on Wednesday. The law also targets a 49 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, and requires the electricity supply to become carbon neutral by 2050. The proposed bill, expected to come into effect next year, did not give an estimate for the cost of reaching the goals, nor an indication of how they might be achieved. The Netherlands, where emissions of greenhouse gasses were 13 percent lower last year than in 1990, is among the most polluting countries in the European Union. “Politicians can’t deny climate change,” said Jesse Klaver, leader of the environmentalist Green Left party, at the presentation of the draft bill. “This makes clear which targets we should meet,” Socialist Party leader Lilian Marijnissen added. “These can no longer be discussed.”      The ministry of Economic Affairs has asked all sectors involved in the reduction of greenhouse gasses to come up with plans to meet the climate goals in the coming weeks.  But progress has reportedly stalled as large industrial companies fear they will become less competitive if the Dutch want to take on climate change faster than other European countries. Industry is responsible for a quarter of the total CO2 emissions in the Netherlands, with 12 large companies responsible for 75 percent of that amount.

Like other central African oil producers, Congo has been hit hard by low crude prices and is struggling under the weight of over $9 billion in debt, equivalent to around 110 percent of its gross domestic product. Following a mission to Congo in April, an IMF delegation said it had “reached broad understandings on policies” it could support within the framework of an arrangement under the Fund’s Extended Credit Facility. However, before it could submit a deal to the board, the delegation said Congo would need to fulfill conditions including making progress toward restructuring debt the Fund considered unsustainable.  Congolese authorities are currently in talks with creditors, including trading houses Trafigura and Glencore (GLEN.L), from which it has borrowed around $2 billion.  Congo joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last week as it moves ahead with new projects that could see it become sub-Saharan Africa’s third-largest oil producer with a target of 350,000 barrels per day this year.

2018-06-27,"* Supreme leader says economic security must be protected * Trump seeks to halt Iran oil imports * Rouhani under fire from Iranians over economy By Babak Dehghanpisheh BEIRUT, June 27 (Reuters) - Iran’s Supreme leader called on the judiciary to punish those “who disrupt economic security” on Wednesday, following protests earlier this week over the rial’s collapse and the prospect of more hardships to come thanks to U.S. measures against Tehran. Business at Tehran’s Grand Bazaar was back to normal on Wednesday after a two-day strike had closed most shops. On Monday traders massed outside parliament to complain about the plunge to record lows of Iran’s currency. Reuters was unable to verify footage showing riot police clashing with protesters. Public protests are rare in Iran but in recent months there have been several over the state of the economy. “The atmosphere for the work, life and livelihood of the people must be secure,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a meeting with judiciary officials, according to his official website. “And the judiciary must confront those who disrupt economic security.” Following Washington’s withdrawal from a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, some U.S. sanctions are due to be reimposed in August and some in November. This has caused the rial to collapse, threatening business by driving up the cost of imports. The rial traded at 78,500 against the dollar in the unofficial market on Wednesday, according to foreign exchange website Bonbast.com. This compares to around 43,000 at the end of last year. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has also told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday. This may cut Iran’s hard currency earnings from oil exports, and the prospect is triggering a panicked flight of Iranians’ savings from the rial into dollars. The United States’ efforts against Iran’s oil industry will fail, an Iranian oil official said on Wednesday. “Iran exports a total amount of 2.5 million barrel per day of crude and condensate and eliminating it easily and in a period of a few months is impossible,” the oil official told the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Trump’s attempts to cut off Iranian oil imports raises the stakes for President Hassan Rouhani, who on Wednesday moved to appease anger over his government’s handling of the economy. A ban on imports of over 1,300 products announced by Iran on Monday in order to prepare its economy for looming U.S. sanctions presented a big opportunity for Iranian companies, Rouhani said. “The government’s decision to ban the import of some goods to the country with the goal of protecting Iranian goods is a very big opportunity for domestic producers,” Rouhani was quoted as saying on state media. A senior commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guards said all Iranians were obliged to help the government cope with any financial crisis, according to Fars News. “It is all of our duty to work together to help the respected government and other governmental branches in solving the economic problems,” General Yahya Rahim-Safavi, who is also a senior advisor to Iran’s Supreme Leader, said on Wednesday. “We must neutralize the plans of the enemy for an economic war and psychological operations.” Reporting by Babak Dehghanpisheh

2018-06-27,"* Wall Street set for weaker open with futures down 0.4-0.8 pct * China yuan skids to fresh 6-month low, stocks follow * Oil higher as US pressures allies on Iran crude * Trade-sensitive currencies slip; yen, Treasuries, Bunds gain (Updates prices, adds charts) By Sujata Rao LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - A 2 percent slide in Chinese equities on Wednesday and a fresh weakening in the yuan highlighted mounting stress on the world’s number two economy from trade tensions with the United States, while global stocks slipped to approach two-month lows. Equity futures signalled a weaker opening for Wall Street, with S&P e-minis down 0.4 percent following sharp losses in Asia and Europe after news the U.S. House of Representatives had approved tightening foreign investment rules. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones indexes also are poised to open lower. And while the prospect of trade protectionism and tit-for-tat tariffs hammers equities and raises fears for the world economy, the growth and inflation outlook is further complicated by oil prices rising back above $75 per barrel, due to Washington pressuring its allies to halt Iranian imports. Oil’s rise, despite last week’s deal by crude producers to raise output, had helped Wall Street rebound on Tuesday. But the rally fizzled in Asian trading, driving MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian equity index almost one percent lower to a fresh two-year low. Losses were led by China, where Shenzen-listed blue chips sank 2.2 percent to stand a whisker above 13-month lows. Chinese equities have now fallen into so-called bear market territory, having tumbled 20 percent from recent peaks. The yuan too slipped to a fresh six-month low against the dollar, as the central bank allowed the biggest one-day weakening in the currency in percentage terms since January 2017. Many analysts now see authorities allowing currency weakness in order to counter the hit to trade. In contrast, the S&P500 is just 6 percent off peaks. “After a lot of sabre-rattling, we are seeing Shanghai suffering a lot more than Wall Street, so clearly the first round (of trade war) has been won by America. Unfortunately, that then overflows into emerging markets and Europe,” said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at UK wealth manager Investment Quorum. Lowman said a ten-year equity bullmarket had left many assets “priced for perfection”, meaning setbacks could have an outsize impact, especially because central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, are tightening policy after years of ultra-low interest rates. “Oil trading near $80 is going to put pressure on inflation around the world which means central bank policy may have to tighten quicker than expected,” Lowman added. The Iran supply worries have overshadowed a supply increase agreed by OPEC and other oil producers last week, pushing Brent futures more than half a cent higher to $76.8 a barrel European shares, meanwhile, touched 11-week lows , later recouping some losses as auto shares, vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, trimmed some big early falls. Many investors still caution against reading too much into the trade fallout, citing robust global growth and hopes of an ultimately pragmatic approach by leaders on the trade issue. “We still have fundamental macro drivers. It’s very much a push-pull between fundamentals mattering more versus political factors,” Kristina Hooper, global chief market strategist at Invesco, said. Nevertheless, trade-sensitive assets including currencies continue to feel the heat — the Australian dollar traded towards one-year lows hit recently and the New Zealand dollar touched seven month lows to the U.S. dollar. The greenback itself, recovered from 10-day lows, but fell 0.25 percent against Japan’s yen which is considered a safe-haven asset. Safe-haven bonds also gained from the turmoil, with 10-year Treasury yields slipping 3 basis points to around 2.84 percent, a near-one month low. But fears of an inflationary impact from the trade tensions and oil prices, have flattened the yield curve, with the yield gap between two- and 10-year Treasuries narrowing to a new decade-low. Political concerns in Europe are also worrying investors at the margin as a row over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government rumbled on, raising concerns that the euro zone’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. That also contributed to pushing euro zone yields lower , with German yields edging towards one-month lows. Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Helen Reid in

2018-06-27,"(Adds details on cocaine bust, background) ALGIERS, June 26 (Reuters) - Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Tuesday dismissed his powerful police chief, General Abdelghani Hamel, the official news agency APS said. It gave no details on the reason behind sacking Hamel, who took the job in 2010. Observers and local media have linked the unexpected dismissal to the seizure of 701 kg of cocaine at the western port of Oran at the end of May, and the handling of the subsequent investigation. Shortly before his dismissal was announced on Tuesday, Hamel told reporters as he was leaving a conference that there had been “excesses and violations during the preliminary inquiry” into the cocaine seizure. “If you want to fight corruption you need to be clean,” he said. The cocaine case has triggered renewed speculation about power struggles within Algeria’s opaque political, military and business elite ahead of a presidential election in 2019. The ruling FLN party has urged Bouteflika, who has been wheelchair-bound and rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, to run for a fifth term. The veteran leader, in office since 1999, has not said yet whether he will stand. Hamel, seen as a loyal ally of Bouteflika, has denied any links to the case, though press reports and a security source said one of Hamel’s drivers was involved. The cocaine, which was shipped from Brazil to Spain before arriving in Oran, was seized after a tip-off from Spanish police. Justice officials have said the main suspect is a businessman named Kamel Chikhi, a wealthy meat trader known to have links to politicians. He is under arrest. Colonel Mustapha Lahbiri, head of the civil protection since 2001, will take over from Hamel, APS said.

2018-06-27,"JAKARTA/KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Reuters) - Palm oil output in the world’s two-biggest producers may decline amid disruptions in the fruit harvesting process because of a backlog of farmers trying to sell fruit to Indonesian mills and as Malaysian planters struggle with a post-holiday labour shortage. Indonesian smallholder palm farmers have overwhelmed mills as they rush to sell fruit following a longer-than-usual break for the Eid-al-Fitr public holiday, which celebrates the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, causing a drop in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) prices, said planters and grower associations. While millions of Indonesian plantation workers typically take off for the Eid celebrations, this year the government extended the break to two weeks from one to ease traffic congestion, increasing the time the workers were away. “The congestion (at the mills) is caused by planters wanting to sell their FFB at the same time after a long break,” said an Indonesian planter who asked not to be identified, referring to the Eid holiday. “Since there are a lot of FFB ... mills are buying fruits at lower prices day by day because they are (running at) overcapacity.” “We expect a 5 to 8 percent drop of production due to losses of overripe fruit,” he said. Crude palm oil prices that are currently near two-year lows, are also weighing on FFB prices. In Indonesia’s East Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo, FFB were trading at 800 rupiah ($0.0564) per kilogram, down from 1,500 rupiah three months ago, according to the country’s Oil Palm Farmers Union (SPKS), a smallholders group based in the city of Bogor. Indonesian state media reported this week that farmers in Bengkulu province, on the island of Sumatra, had decided to stop picking palm fruit as FFB prices were as low as 500 rupiah per kilogram, barely covering their costs. “A lot of farmers postponed harvests before Eid,” said Kanisius, the head of the SPKS advocacy division for a region in East Kalimantan. “Now it’s overflowing. After Eid, the harvests are overloaded.” “Many mills are rejecting smallholders’ fresh fruit bunches. They are limiting purchases from farmers,” he said. In Malaysia, Indonesians make up nearly 70 percent of the palm industry’s workforce, a number of which have returned home for the extended Eid holiday, delaying the palm fruit harvest. Despite the holidays being over, many workers have still not returned to the estates yet, said one Malaysian planter who asked not to be identified, leaving plantation owners with fewer workers to pick ripe palm fruit bunches. “We are still struggling with our rounds because most of our workers take two to three weeks leave for Eid. Our harvesting intervals are disrupted,” he said. “There will be some marginal crop losses and the quality will be affected.” ($1 = 14,173 rupiah) Reporting by Bernadette Christina Munthe in JAKARTA and Emily

2018-06-27,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has exited the Majnoon oilfield in southern Iraq and handed over its operations to the state-run Basra Oil Co., two Iraqi oil officials close to the deal said on Wednesday. Officials from Shell and Basra Oil Co. met on Wednesday to mark the complete exit of Shell and the handover of operations. “The handing over process was smooth and without any issues,” said one Iraqi oil official after the meeting. Shell has said it plans to focus on developing its gas joint venture in Iraq. Shell also sold its stake in West Qurna 1 to Japan’s Itochu Corp (8001.T). On April 5, the Iraqi oil ministry signed a two-year contract with Anton Oilfield Services (3337.HK) and Petrofac (PFC.L) to operate the giant Majnoon oilfield on behalf of state-owned Basra Oil Company. Crude oil output from Majnoon is now about 235,000 barrels per day (bpd) and Iraq plans to boost output to 450,000 bpd in three years, oil officials said. “Shell’s exit will not have any effect on production operations and we can increase output without any hurdles,” said another Iraqi oil official who is part of Majnoon’s operation team.  Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is producing about 4.4 million bpd, below its capacity, in line with global supply cuts led by OPEC aimed at supporting prices and reducing oversupply.

2018-06-27,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, June 26 (Reuters) - When General Electric Co bought oilfield services giant Baker Hughes last July, it created a global industry colossus with $22 billion in annual revenue. GE promised to digitalize oilfields worldwide, marrying its expertise in big data, analytical software and subsea equipment with Baker Hughes’ experience in drilling services, chemicals and tools. Less than a year later, GE is bailing out of the deal, the firm announced Tuesday, planning to sell its 63 percent stake in the combined firm over time as part of a larger move to simplify its business and reduce debt. The retreat comes amid slipping market share, management missteps and culture clashes that have unsettled employees and frustrated suppliers and customers, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with more than 30 employees, former employees, recruiters, analysts, suppliers and customers. GE managers initially took 11 of the combined firm’s top 15 posts and ushered in a by-the-book culture more like its aviation business than that of oil industry, where relationships are more prized and handshake deals are still common, said people who have had dealings with both. In a Tuesday note to employees seen by Reuters, Baker Hughes GE Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli complimented his “amazing team” and reassured them about the path ahead, but acknowledged “the last year has not always been easy for you, or our customers and partners.” “I recognize that this moment is bittersweet for some, welcomed perhaps by others,” he wrote. Baker Hughes GE lost market share in 12 of 19 services and equipment sectors between 2016 and 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of data from prominent oilfield services consultancy Spears & Associates. In one area where Baker Hughes has been a pioneer, drill bits, its share fell to 17 percent from 20 percent between 2016 and 2017. In a statement to Reuters, Baker Hughes GE attributed the market share losses to “challenging market dynamics” and said most of the losses occurred before the merger closed in summer of last year. Since the merger, suppliers have chafed under strict cost-cutting demands, and some customers shifted to competitors after abrupt service-fee increases and contract changes, according to suppliers, customers and former Baker Hughes executives. The choppy transition also has driven out veteran Baker Hughes managers in key departments and rattled staff. Revenue for the combined company last year was $21.9 billion, well below the $23.8 billion estimated in its 2017 merger proxy. Baker Hughes GE oilfield services and equipment revenues declined by $700 million. Rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton posted higher revenues on a resurgence in the North American hydraulic fracturing market, said Chirag Rathi, a consulting director at market researcher Frost & Sullivan. Baker Hughes sold a majority of its hydraulic fracturing business in 2016. Baker Hughes GE said its financial performance reflects broader industry trends and called itself a “strong and differentiated company” that now has a “defined path” to unwind the merger over the next two or three years. It said it would stay focused on supporting workers, customers and boosting shareholder value. Baker Hughes GE’s shares were up 2 percent to $33.13 on Tuesday, but still down nearly 18 percent since the merger closed. The company will now set about dividing itself before ever fully integrating the two firms. While the combined culture remains a work in progress, “the old Baker Hughes structure has been torn apart,” said Edward Muztafago, director of equity research at Societe Generale. It remains unclear whether Baker Hughes will continue to benefit from GE’s financial clout and advanced manufacturing over the long term. Last year, Baker Hughes landed a major deal with Twinza Oil to provide oilfield services, equipment and financing for an offshore development near Papua New Guinea. Analysts say access to credit and lending from GE Capital, a unit GE is now planning to shrink, helped that deal come together. For now, Baker Hughes will continue to have access to vaunted GE technologies that were cited as key advantages in the original merger, including the GE Store, a technology and manufacturing exchange, and GE’s Predix operating system, which links and monitors equipment through the internet, the company said. But the company said Tuesday it would also develop solutions independent of the Predix system. Shortly after the merger closed last year, Baker Hughes GE made an “overnight” decision to raise prices and internal sales targets, a former employee told Reuters. The moves, along with squeezing costs from supplier contracts, aimed to raise revenue and margins. While oilfield margins have modestly improved, they still trail well behind those of top rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton, said Bernstein analyst Colin Davies, who noted the oil-price recovery has driven margin gains industrywide. One privately-held U.S. oil producer that uses Baker Hughes GE’s artificial lift products said the company raised its service prices by 20 percent late last year with little notice. The customer shifted some of its business to a rival, Novomet Inc, even after Baker Hughes GE agreed through negotiations to trim the increase. “They’re not managing the account as personally as they need to,” the customer said, declining to be named because of ongoing business between the two firms. Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on its pricing except to say it makes regular adjustments to stay competitive. Suppliers also have faced post-merger changes to contract terms and procurement processes. One company told Reuters that Baker Hughes GE pressed for a 3.5 percent discount on goods and a 120-day grace period on payments, terms the company rejected. Normally, customers pay within 30 to 60 days, the supplier said. One dispute escalated into a breach-of-contract lawsuit. Manufacturer Markall Inc built a successful business supplying components to Baker Hughes over four decades, but the relationship quickly deteriorated after the merger. In the suit, filed in November, Markall alleges Baker Hughes GE had not paid for more than $5 million in custom parts that it had agreed to buy before the merger. Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it deals with issues predating the acquisition. GE Chief Executive John Flannery, appointed shortly after the merger, foreshadowed Tuesday’s announcement last November when he said the firm was considering its “exit options” just months after acquiring its controlling stake. Then the company canceled a planned switch of former Baker employees to GE’s healthcare plan, several former Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas employees told Reuters. A move to cut staff just ahead of end-of-year holidays also hurt morale, two former workers said. Another sign of strain: the departure of veteran employees in key positions, according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the resignations. More than 50 resumes from Baker Hughes employees have landed with one professional recruiter since last summer, according to a headhunter there. Melissa Law - a 20-year Baker Hughes veteran and former president of its global chemicals business - joined food ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle last September. Eric Holcomb, formerly a Baker Hughes director of financial planning, left after more than a dozen years to join marine shipping company Kirby Corp in December. Chief Global Operations Officer Belgacem Chariag - one of a handful of Baker Hughes executives to remain in senior management after the merger - resigned in January without announcing a new position. Chariag did not respond to a request for comment. Baker Hughes declined to comment on the departures but called its overall retention rates “strong and in line with the market.” Reporting by Liz Hampton

2018-06-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Idemitsu’s founding family will drop its opposition to plans for a merger of Idemitsu Kosan (5019.T) and Showa Shell Sekiyu (5002.T), paving the way for the Japanese oil firms to combine, the Nikkei reported.  The family, led by descendants of founder Sazo Idemitsu and which has a little over 28 percent stake in Idemitsu, has said the two firms are too different for any merger to work, while the Idemitsu management says the combination is necessary to compete in Japan’s shrinking oil products market. In agreeing to a merger, the family, led by Shosuke Idemitsu, has demanded a pledge to maintain the principles held by founder Sazo Idemitsu and two board seats for family members at the combined company, the Nikkei said on Wednesday, without citing sources. Idemitsu, which acquired a little over 31 percent stake in Showa Shell in 2016, agreed to bring on the eldest son of Idemitsu Chairman Emeritus Shosuke Idemitsu as a director, it added.  Idemitsu has resumed discussions with major shareholders, the refiner said, adding no formal decisions have been made as yet. The founding family’s spokesperson said they could not confirm the report immediately. A few members of the founding family have agreed to the merger, while Shosuke Idemitsu is still opposing it, Jiji news agency reported on Wednesday. Talks on the merger are continuing and no decisions have been made, Showa Shell said.  The boards of Idemitsu and Showa Shell are set to meet in mid-July to make a final decision on the merger through a stock swap and have the matter up for approval at the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting within a year, the Nikkei added. Idemitsu management had long been keen to merge its operations with Showa Shell as shrinking gasoline demand in the country pushes the industry to consolidate, but has been locked in a battle with the Idemitsu founding family for about two years. The combined firm would account for about 30 percent of domestic gasoline sales, coming second only to JXTG Holdings (5020.T), which was created last year from JX’s takeover of TonenGeneral Sekiyu and controls about half of domestic oil sales. Shares in Idemitsu ended 13.6 percent higher at 3,980 yen, while Showa Shell jumped 8.5 percent after the news, compared with a 0.3 percent decline in the benchmark Nikkei share average .N225.

2018-06-27,"(Adds more detail on advice to government to ensure further reduction of output, changes dateline) THE HAGUE, June 27 (Reuters) - Production at the Groningen natural gas field will be lower  than originally envisaged this year as the Dutch government works towards the end of extraction in the next decade because of the risk of earthquakes. Output will have fallen to between 19 and 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year ending October 2018, the Dutch gas sector regulator said on Wednesday, lower than the original cap of 21.6 bcm set for the year and down from 24 bcm last year. The Dutch government will end production in Groningen completely by 2030, it said in March, as it tries to limit seismic risks in the region. As a first step, it promised to reduce production to less than 12 bcm as quickly as possible in the coming years, as that level would significantly reduce the risks of earthquakes. That level could be reached by 2020, Economy minister Eric Wiebes said this month, mainly by switching large industrial users from Groningen gas. But regulator SodM on Wednesday said more measures are needed to ensure that goal is met. The government will need to offer financial incentives to large industrial users in the short term, it said, and will ultimately have to ban them from using Groningen gas completely. “Reducing demand from large users is critical for reducing seismic risks”, SodM director Theodor Kockelkoren told reporters. “We need to give them an incentive to switch and we need to be clear exactly how much time they will get.” The regulator did not say when it thought factories should be cut off from Groningen gas, as it said that decision was up to the government.

The small reactor, owned by the IFE foundation and located in a mountain cave in the town of Halden in southern Norway, has been temporarily closed since March due to a valve failure. The Nordic country has two nuclear reactors, one in Halden and one outside Oslo. Both are owned and run by the independent IFE Foundation. The government has provided additional support in recent years to maintain the expertise of the reactor, it said. In October 2016, a leak in Halden’s reactor was detected, which caused the evacuation of its staff, with no injuries sustained and no environmental damage outside the facility. The small reactor, able to produce up to 25 megawatts, was built in the late 1950s some 120 km (75 miles) south of Oslo. Norway does not have nuclear power stations and its two research reactors only study nuclear safety issues.

2018-06-27,"* China yuan skids to fresh 6-month low, stocks follow * Oil sharply higher as US pressures allies on Iran crude * Asian markets hesitant amid trade uncertainty * Yen firmer as trade-sensitive currencies ease (updates throughout, changes byline, dateline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - A 2 percent slide in Chinese equities on Wednesday and a fresh weakening in the yuan highlighted mounting stress on the world’s number two economy from trade tensions with the United States, while global stocks slipped to approach two-month lows. While the prospect of trade protectionism and tit-for-tat tariffs are raising serious fears for the world economy, the growth and inflation outlook is being further complicated by oil prices rising back above $75 per barrel, due to Washington pressuring its allies to halt Iranian imports. Oil’s rise, despite last week’s deal by crude producers to raise output, helped Wall Street rebound on Tuesday, while technology stocks also jumped as President Donald Trump said he endorsed a measured approach to restricting Chinese investment in U.S. tech companies. But that rally has fizzled. Equity futures indicate Wall Street will open weaker and MSCI’s ex-Japan Asian equity index fell 0.8 percent to a fresh two-year low. Losses were led by China, where Shenzen-listed blue chips sank 2.2 percent to stand a whisker above 13-month lows. Chinese equities have now fallen into so-called bear market territory, having tumbled 20 percent from recent peaks. The yuan slipped to a fresh six-month low against the dollar , as the central bank allowed the biggest one-day weakening in the currency in percentage terms since January 2017. Many analysts now see authorities allowing currency weakness in order to counter the hit to trade. “After a lot of sabre-rattling, we are seeing Shanghai suffering a lot more than Wall Street, so clearly the first round (of trade war) has been won by America. Unfortunately, that then overflows into emerging markets and Europe, so it’s not a pretty time for investors,” said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at UK wealth manager Investment Quorum. Lowman said a ten-year equity bullmarket had left many assets “priced for perfection”, meaning setbacks could have an outsize impact, especially because central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, are tightening policy after years of ultra-low interest rates. “Oil trading near $80 is going to put pressure on inflation around the world which means central bank policy may have to tighten quicker than expected,” Lowman added. The Iran supply worries have overshadowed a supply increase agreed by OPEC and other oil producers last week, pushing Brent futures over $76 a barrel European shares, meanwhile, fell 0.5 percent to the lowest since April 12. A near-one percent fall in auto shares , among the most vulnerable to U.S. tariffs, took German equities 0.5 percent down to nearly three-month lows. Many investors still caution against reading too much into the fallout from the trade tensions, citing robust global growth and hopes of an ultimately pragmatic approach by leaders on the trade issue. “We still have fundamental macro drivers. It’s very much a push-pull between fundamentals mattering more versus political factors,” Kristina Hooper, global chief market strategist at Invesco, said. Nevertheless, trade-sensitive assets including currencies continue to feel the heat — the Australian dollar weakened towards one-year lows hit recently and the New Zealand dollar touched seven month lows to the U.S. dollar. The greenback itself firmed modestly against a basket of currencies, recovering from 10-day lows, but it fell 0.3 percent against Japan’s yen which is considered a safe-haven asset. Safe-haven bonds also gained from the turmoil, with 10-year Treasury yields slipping 3.5 basis points to around 2.84 percent, a near-one month low. Political concerns in Europe are also worrying investors at the margin as a row over migration policy in Germany’s coalition government rumbled on, raising concerns that the euro zone’s biggest economy could be headed for snap elections. That also contributed to pushing German yields lower , also edging towards one-month lows.

2018-06-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Fears over higher global barriers to trade sent European stocks to 11-week lows on Wednesday, with little other company and economic news to provide relief from rising protectionism which has hit equity markets hard. Europe’s falls came after Asian stocks sold off violently on trade fears, with Chinese blue-chips hitting a 13-month low.  The pan-European STOXX 600  extended its opening fall to 0.6 percent by 0830 GMT, hitting its lowest level since April 12 as financials and industrials stocks suffered.  The banks sector .SX7P was the worst-performing, down 1.4 percent as investors worried about the impact of protectionism on the economy and a flattening yield curve on banks’ margins. Bank shares fell to their lowest since December 2016 while the autos sector, a prominent target of higher U.S. tariffs, neared a 10-month low. “This is for sure an environment in which the market has been able to ignore protectionist concerns, but I believe it’s escalated to the point where it’s hard to ignore now,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Autos stocks .SXAP fell 1.1 percent and drove Germany’s DAX down 0.8 percent as BMW (BMWG.DE), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) declined.  Industrials Airbus (AIR.PA), Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and ABB (ABBN.S) were also big drags on the index, continuing their fall as investors priced in a more difficult trade environment for big exporters.  Energy stocks .SXEP helped limit losses, rising 1 percent as crude prices climbed on supply disruption in Canada and after U.S. officials told importers to stop buying Iranian crude from November. [nL4N1TT1AJ] BP (BP.L), Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) were the biggest gainers in the market. Shares in takeover target IWG (IWG.L), the British workspace firm, fell 4.3 percent after it warned on profit, blaming the cost of opening new space and a weak performance in Britain. Traders said the takeover interest from private equity firms Terra Firma and TDR Capital among others were supporting the stock despite the profit warning. With economic and company news relatively thin on the ground, broker recommendations also drove some big moves.  Imerys (IMTP.PA) shares rose 3.8 percent after analysts at Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the mineral extracting and processing company to “outperform” from “neutral”.  Shares in French oil storage and distribution company Rubis (RUBF.PA) fell 5.5 percent after Berenberg cut the stock to “hold” from “buy, saying weakness in the oil storage business is likely to persist in the short- to medium-term.  Czech utility CEZ (CEZP.PR) traded ex-dividend, down 5.3 percent. Overall, investors have been pulling billions out of European stocks and shifting into U.S. stocks in recent weeks as trade tensions ratcheted up.  A global investor confidence index by State Street dropped in June, with the decline in sentiment largely driven by a significant fall in European investors’ confidence.  “Right now the environment is more positive for U.S. stocks but that could change fairly quickly,” said Invesco’s Hooper, adding: “One of the key themes this year is rotation of leadership.”  Analysts have been upgrading their earnings expectations for European stocks in the past weeks despite building trade tensions.

2018-06-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday he discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia and Moscow’s plan to expand its Nord Stream gas pipeline to Germany, which has irked Washington, in talks with U.S. Treasury and Energy Secretaries. Russia is one of the world’s biggest crude oil and natural gas producers, and the United States has been urging global energy producers to boost output to stem an increase in prices. “We met. We discussed energy issues, among other things. We touched upon questions related to sanctions,” Novak said of his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at a press briefing in Washington. “We can’t sidestep these difficult questions, so of course we touched upon them during our contact.” Novak said other discussions with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry covered Russia’s Nord Stream undersea gas pipeline. Plans to double the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters per year have riled both Washington and Brussels, which is trying to cut its reliance on energy supplies from Russia. Washington believes the pipeline would give Russia, which has at times frozen deliveries to parts of Europe over pricing disputes, more power over the region and the administration of President Donald Trump has followed that of Barack Obama in opposing the Nord Stream 2 project. The planned volumes are more than half of Russian total gas exports to Europe, which is seen reaching a record high of 200 bcm this year. The move to expand the pipeline is also designed to bypass Ukraine, the main route of Russian gas exports to Europe. Novak said politics should not be allowed to intrude into discussion of the Nord Stream project which stood on its own economic merits.  “The implementation of such infrastructure projects has to be built on the economic basis without any political evaluation of this project,” Novak said after his meetings. The meetings took place while energy executives and ministers from around the globe converged on Washington for the triennial World Gas Conference, the industry’s biggest summit. The U.S. Congress has imposed economic sanctions in recent months against Russia that - among other things - seek to prevent companies from participating in Russian pipeline projects or oil and gas development efforts. The sanctions were designed to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Moscow denies it interfered in the election. Russia depends heavily on pipeline networks to get its energy production to European markets, and is also keen to develop energy reserves in its Arctic. Novak has said in the past that the United States should not be permitted to impose such sanctions without a vote of the United Nations Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member. The United States has been urging increased supply from the world’s biggest producers, including OPEC members, to help stem an increase in oil prices that threatens economic growth.  It is also renewing sanctions against OPEC-producer Iran after abandoning a global deal meant to stem its nuclear ambitions, and urging consumers of its oil to stop their imports completely - another factor pushing up oil prices. Perry told reporters on Monday, before meeting with Novak, that he was “amenable to having conversations, to creating a relationship” with Russia. “He had invited me to, actually, to come visit some of the things that they are doing in the Arctic,” Perry said. “I think we’ve got our issues with Russia, but I’m one of those that believe you need to be having conversations with folks and finding  places that we can work together.” Additional reporting by Polina Ivanova and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow; Editing by Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-usa-sanctions/update-2-u-s-russian-officials-discuss-sanctions-russian-gas-pipeline-plans-idUKL1N1TT01N,27 Jun 2018,"Russian Energy Minister

2018-06-27,"TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan and South Korea, two major buyers of Iranian oil, are in talks with the U.S. government in a bid to avoid adverse impacts from Washington’s reimposition of sanctions aimed at cutting Iran out of international markets. The United States is demanding countries cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off funding to Iran. Both countries won waivers that allowed them to buy limited amounts of oil from Iran during the previous round of sanctions that ended in 2016, but Washington has this time adopted a more aggressive stance. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference on Wednesday that Japan and the United States were in talks about the sanctions on Iran, but declined to reveal details. “Japan and the U.S. are in talks now on re-application of U.S. sanctions against Iran, and I decline to reveal the details of the discussions,” Suga said. “We are watching carefully the impact that the U.S. measure would cause, and we would like to negotiate with countries involved including the United States so as not to have an adverse impact on Japanese firms,” he added. In South Korea, an Energy Ministry official who declined to be named said the government would keep negotiating with the United States in order to get an exemption from the U.S. sanctions. “We are in the same position as Japan. We are in talks with the United States and will keep negotiating to get an exemption,” said the official.  While oil supplies were not mentioned by either official, the threat of losing Iranian supplies looms over both countries, who import virtually all of their crude needs. Iran is the third-largest exporter among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and Japan and South Korea are two of its major customers along with China and India. Buyers from Japan, South Korea and India have already started to dial back purchases from Iran. Oil prices LCOc1 on Wednesday did not react strongly as traders had anticipated Washington’s move and largely priced in the hard-line stance.[O/R] “This more aggressive tack from the Trump administration likely means Japan and South Korea will move more quickly to zero-out their imports (from Iran) too. On the other hand, China, India, and Turkey will likely balk at significant cuts to imports by November,” political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note. Iranian oil shipments to Japan and South Korea rose after sanctions against Tehran were lifted from 2016, but they peaked at 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in late 2016 and have fallen to around 200,000 bpd, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.

Chinese blue chips sank 2.2 percent to be a whisker above 13-month lows as a resolution of Sino-U.S. tensions remained a distant prospect. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost another 0.6 percent after touching a two-year trough on Tuesday. Japan’s Nikkei had been faring better but soon succumbed to risk aversion and fell 0.3 percent. European shares were expected to open flat, while E-mini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.18 percent. The fragile mood in Asia overshadowed gains in energy stocks made after news broke that Washington was pushing allies to halt imports of Iranian crude. U.S. crude added 17 cents to $70.70, having surged 3.6 percent overnight, while Brent climbed 18 cents to $76.49 a barrel. The jump in oil boosted the Wall Street energy sector 1.4 percent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500. But the S&P still only managed to add 0.22 percent overall, while the Dow rose 0.12 percent and the Nasdaq was up 0.39 percent. Confusion remained the watchword with U.S. trade policy. The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Tuesday to tighten foreign investment rules, spurred by bipartisan concerns about Chinese bids to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology. Yet President Donald Trump also endorsed a measured approach to restricting Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies, saying a strengthened merger security review committee could protect sensitive technologies. “We remain of the view that a large scale “trade war” remains a low probability though the odds of it happening appear to have increased,” said JPMorgan economist David Hensley. He noted that the latest tariff threats from the White House would cover more than 30 percent of U.S. imports, equal to almost 5 percent of annual economic output (GDP). “If all this were to happen, and U.S. trading partners were to retaliate, it would deliver a significant supply shock to the world economy, raising inflation and lowering growth.” In currency markets, trade-sensitive currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars lost ground while the safe-haven yen found demand.

The euro was back at $1.1650, having run into profit-taking at a top of $1.1720 overnight. Yet the dollar could not sustain gains on the yen and eased back to 109.85 from an early 110.12. The dollar has been aided in part by recent gains on the Chinese yuan, which has stirred speculation Beijing was allowing its currency to weaken to bolster exports. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) fixed the yuan midpoint at a six-month low of 6.5569 per dollar on Wednesday. That was down 0.6 percent from the previous fix but actually a little firmer than market expectations. However, the spot rate continued to slip with the yuan breaking past 6.6600 per dollar for the first time since December. “The PBOC’s preference might be to allow moderate weakening, pulling back if depreciation pressures started intensifying. But that’s a difficult balance to strike. The chances of a sizeable depreciation have risen,” economists at Capital Economics said in a note.

Brent crude futures were at $76.60 per barrel at 0111 GMT, up 29 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $70.79 a barrel, up 26 cents, or 0.3 percent. The United States has told countries to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero from November, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday. “Oil prices were flying higher overnight after catching an updraft from the U.S. administration calling for allies to cut Iran imports to zero tolerance,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA. He also warned “Libya will continue to be a significant point of concern in the oil supply chain”. A power struggle between the official government and rebels has left it unclear who will handle Libya’s large oil reserves, although as of late Tuesday sources said the country’s oil ports of Hariga and Zueitina in eastern Libya appeared to be working normally. For North America, Innes said “the market continues to focus on Syncrude Canada where 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) remain in limbo after a transformer blew and shut a critical oil sands upgrader on June 2”. He added that repairs would likely last until the end of July. Innes said the outage had contributed to a major draw in U.S. crude oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday reported a 9.2 million barrel reduction in U.S. crude inventories in the week to June 22 to 421.4 million barrels. Trying to make up for disrupted supply, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC partners including top producer OPEC said late last week they would increase output. Top exporter and de-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million bpd in July, the highest in its history, up from about 10.8 million bpd in June, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. “The OPEC+ agreement to elevate output still leaves production restraints in place, limiting the market’s ability to rebuild inventories while decreasing spare production capacity,” said French bank BNP Paribas. It also said rising U.S. oil production could be prevented from being exported until pipeline capacity was expanded next year. “Considering significant future supply losses faced by Iran (under U.S. sanctions) and supply risks in Venezuela and Libya ... oil fundamentals still remain favourable for oil prices to rise over the next 6 months despite the OPEC+ decision,” BNP said.

2018-06-27,"BENGHAZI, Libya/LONDON (Reuters) - Libya’s oil ports of Hariga and Zueitina in eastern Libya appeared to be working normally on Tuesday, after eastern-based forces said they had handed control of the terminals to a parallel National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Benghazi, sources said. Libya, politically divided since the 2011 uprising that toppled leader Muammar Gaddafi, has two rival versions of the NOC, the internationally recognised NOC based Tripoli in the west and the alternative NOC in the eastern city of Benghazi. The ports are vital to controlling Libya’s crude exports, the North African nation’s main source of revenue, although shifting who controls the terminals also creates uncertainty for international buyers of Libyan oil, deterring business. The announcement for transferring operations of eastern ports to NOC in Benghazi follows military action by the eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) under the command of Khalifa Haftar to retake Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports, which are also in the east and remain closed. Those two closures have disrupted oil flows amounting to about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), which has meant almost cutting in half Libya’s total output that had been running at about 1 million bpd earlier this year. But sources contacted by Reuters on Tuesday indicated that Hariga and Zueitina port operations were continuing. A shipping source said the Atlantic Explorer tanker left Hariga fully loaded on Tuesday morning, while an oil source said the vessel had been chartered by the NOC in Tripoli. In Zueitina, an oil official said the situation was normal, with two tankers at the terminal, with the first loading 600,000 barrels of oil and the second due to load one million barrels. Haftar earlier signed an order handing all ports “liberated” by eastern forces to the Benghazi NOC, which is aligned to the eastern government which rejects the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli. Alongside Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, a spokesman for the eastern LNA forces said the order included Zueitina and Hariga. Combined exports from the five ports now under eastern control - Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Brega - were about 520,000 barrels per day on June 1-25, compared with 780,000 bpd for the full month May, according to oil analytics firm Vortexa.  Eastern based factions have repeatedly tried and failed to export oil independently, unable to circumvent U.N. Security Council sanctions that recognise the Tripoli NOC as the sole legitimate producer and seller of Libya’s oil.  The Tripoli government said the decision by the eastern based LNA forces would deepen divisions in Libya, which has been split between the loose military and political factions in the two sides of the country since 2014. “Such actions increase tension and anger and do not serve the path of consensus or lead in any way towards reconciliation, but establish disunity and engrain division,” the GNA said. In its statement, the GNA also appealed to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions committee to “prevent all illegal sales operations that could happen due to these actions”.  The internationally recognised NOC in Tripoli has also condemned the LNA’s move as illegal, saying it would use “all options available” to legally pursue any companies that tried to buy oil from parallel institutions.  Analysts say Haftar’s decision to shift control of the ports could be aimed at leveraging more public money from Tripoli, where oil revenues are processed by a central bank governor whom eastern factions have tried to dislodge. GNA Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg told reporters in Tripoli that the NOC should be protected from politics. “This NOC does not deal with funds ... it manages the oil sector and operates production and it succeeded recently in raising production to an excellent level and standard,” he said.

2018-06-27,"(Adds background on Port Arthur, comments from Woodside CEO) WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Woodside Petroleum Ltd said on Tuesday that Australia’s biggest independent oil and natural gas company will soon decide whether to continue to invest in Sempra Energy’s Port Arthur liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Texas. Peter Coleman, who was speaking at the World Gas Conference in Washington, said the project’s ability to provide Woodside with an adequate return is “very challenged.” “We’ve got to make some decisions pretty soon about our continued pursuit (of Port Arthur) with Sempra,” said Coleman, noting that Woodside has been paying part of the project’s development costs. “What we’ve been doing is just paying our way (with Port Arthur), and whether that is going to give us an adequate return, I would say today that is very challenged,” Coleman said. In February 2016, Sempra and Woodside agreed to share the cost of developing Port Arthur, which could result in Woodside buying half the project once the parties made a final investment decision to build the facility. Officials at California-based Sempra, which announced on Tuesday that Polish Oil & Gas Co (PGNiG) agreed to buy LNG from Port Arthur, were not immediately available for comment. The Port Arthur project, which Sempra has said could cost $8 billion-$9 billion, includes two liquefaction trains capable of producing about 11 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG, up to three storage tanks and facilities to load LNG onto ships. Global LNG imports rose 9.9 percent to 289.8 million tonnes in 2017, according data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Exporters. The Port Arthur facility has been in the news a lot recently as Sempra moves closer to a final investment decision. That decision could come in 2019 with first LNG production in 2023, according to the project schedule on the Port Arthur website. On Tuesday, Sempra and PGNiG signed a 20-year contract at the World Gas Conference in Washington for the sale and purchase of two MTPA of LNG from Port Arthur starting in 2023. Last week, Sempra said it selected Bechtel as the engineering, procurement and commissioning (EPC) contractor for Port Arthur. Last year, Sempra signed a memorandum of understanding with Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) as a potential purchaser of LNG from and equity participant in Port Arthur. As consumers shift from coal to cleaner burning gas for power generation and other uses, global LNG demand is expected to grow about 4 percent per year through 2035, according to data from Woodside. China’s LNG demand alone is expected to grow at 7 percent per year through 2025, according to a report from energy consultant Wood Mackenzie, which projected world LNG demand would start to exceed supply in 2022 or 2023. To meet that demand growth, Port Arthur is one of more than two dozen U.S. LNG projects searching for buyers so they can make a final investment decision. In Canada, meanwhile, Woodside is working with Chevron to develop the Kitimat LNG project in British Columbia with a capacity of 10 MTPA. Coleman did not say when the company would make a final investment decision on Kitimat, noting Woodside and Chevron were working on getting the plant costs down. Woodside expects to produce between 85-90 million barrels of oil equivalents (MMboe) in 2018, most of which will come from its Australian LNG projects, up from 84.4 MMboe in 2017, according to a forecast in its 2017 full year results. LNG represents about 69-71 MMboe of the company’s 2018 production guidance. Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Leslie Adler and G

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.05 percent after touching a two-year trough on Tuesday. Markets have been pressured by sharp losses in China, where blue chips were near 13-month lows. Japan’s Nikkei has been faring better and was all but flat in early trade. U.S. crude oil futures jumped 3.6 percent on Tuesday after new broke that Washington was pushing allies to halt imports of Iranian crude. The market rallied further after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude inventories had fallen by much more than expected. Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up 8 cents at $70.61, while Brent climbed 24 cents to $76.55 a barrel. The jump in oil boosted the Wall Street energy sector 1.4 percent, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500. The S&P 500 still only managed to add 0.22 percent overall, while the Dow rose 0.12 percent and the Nasdaq 0.39 percent. Confusion still reigned over U.S. trade policy. The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Tuesday to tighten foreign investment rules, spurred by bipartisan concerns about Chinese bids to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology. Yet President Donald Trump also endorsed a measured approach to restricting Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies, saying a strengthened merger security review committee could protect sensitive technologies. “We remain of the view that a large scale “trade war” remains a low probability though the odds of it happening appear to have increased,” said JPMorgan economist David Hensley.

Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction firmer at 94.705, after bouncing from 94.171 on Tuesday. The euro was back at $1.1648, having run into profit-taking at a top of $1.1720 overnight. The dollar had also rallied to 110.12 yen, though that just left it in the middle of the recent 109.20/110.90 trading range.

2018-06-27,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc and Glencore Plc have abandoned talks on annual thermal coal supplies after failing to reach an agreement, the first time in decades the talks have broken down. Tohoku Electric said on Tuesday that the negotiations with Glencore, the world’s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, ended without an agreement after protracted negotiations on supplies from April 2018 to March 2019. “We could not reach an agreement with Glencore on the April to March annual contract,” a spokesman for the Japanese utility company said, citing their inability to agree on terms such as price and volume. “We will negotiate with Glencore for other contracts of coal as needed,” he said, adding that Tohoku has settled some annual contracts with other Australian suppliers. A Glencore spokesman in Australia said no comment when contacted by Reuters. But a senior Glencore official, who declined to be identified, said the talks failed because of price disagreements so they decided to skip this round and Tohoku has already covered its needs. Multiple industry sources said the producer and the utility were not able to reach an agreement on pricing as Tohoku, like its peers, is seeking to cut costs amid increased competition in Japan’s electricity market.  Benchmark thermal coal prices also surged to their highest since 2012 while the negotiations were taking place, making the talks more complex, the sources said.   The price for thermal coal agreed to by Tohoku and Glencore is used as a benchmark for other Japanese utilities and manufacturers and the breakdown in talks surprised other coal buyers. “This is the first time in my memory that the talks over an annual coal contract between a Japanese major utility and a key Australian supplier were broken off,” said a coal buyer with more than three decades of experience. “The absence of the reference price means that other buyers will need to negotiate with their suppliers without any guidance,” a coal trader based in Tokyo said.  The April to March long-term contracts between Australian suppliers and Japanese utilities have traditionally accounted for a major part of Japan’s annual thermal coal imports of about 115 million tonnes. But the volume under the long-term contracts has been declining in recent years as utilities tried to diversify their sources, according to multiple industry sources.  Japanese utilities usually pay a premium to secure high-quality supplies from Australia on long-term contracts as they prefer coal with a higher energy content to generate electricity more efficiently and with less environmental harm.

2018-06-27,"CELUKAN BAWANG, Indonesia, June 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - O ver the last three years, fisherman Iputu Gede Astawa has watched his daily catch off the northern tip of Indonesia’s Bali island fall at an alarming rate. Having swapped his paddle for an outboard motor in a futile effort to fish further out to sea where waters are more dangerous, Astawa blames a nearby coal power plant for harming his livelihood. “My catch is totally different to what it was before the power plant began operating,” said Astawa, a third-generation fisherman based near the port town of Singaraja who heads a group of about 30 other fishermen. Where once they caught 400 buckets of fish a day, they now net just 10. Astawa is one of three local residents fighting a legal battle to stop the planned expansion of the Celukan Bawang power plant, about 120 km (75 miles) from the main tourism hub of Denpasar, which began operating in 2015. “All the fishermen will be impacted and we will lose our jobs,” said Astawa, 43, who now makes furniture to get by. The legal bid, backed by environmental group Greenpeace, claims the planned expansion - which would more than double power capacity at the site - will be a setback to the remote area’s fledgling tourism industry. The legal action also warns of worsening air and water pollution, crop damage and a negative effect on wildlife at a nearby national park. PT General Energy Bali, which runs the Celukan Bawang power plant, could not be reached for comment, while the company’s majority owner, China Huadian Corporation, did not answer calls. Building additional coal or gas-fired power capacity at Celukan Bawang or elsewhere on Bali is needed to meet rising power demand, Jisman Hutajulu, a senior electricity official at Indonesia’s energy ministry, said by email. But the decision on whether to opt for more fossil fuel capacity or renewable energy is for local governments to make, he said, adding that energy security, the environment and cost should all be considered. Central government policy on renewable energy has sought to encourage investment while keeping electricity prices affordable for consumers, he noted. Indonesia is among the fastest-growing countries for energy consumption due to a steadily increasing population, economic development and a rise in urbanisation. Like other Asian nations, Jakarta also faces the challenge of boosting electricity access while meeting its pledge to cut climate-changing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Indonesia’s emissions targets can only be achieved by reducing its reliance on coal power and ramping up investment in clean, renewable energy projects, several power experts said. Indonesia currently has about 54.6 gigawatts of installed electricity capacity but to meet rising demand, especially on the main power-hungry islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra, the country wants to more than double this over the next decade. With huge coal resources, the archipelago relies heavily on coal-fired power stations to generate more than half of its power, according to experts. Natural gas contributes about 23 percent, renewable energy 13 percent, and diesel the rest. But having committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 29 percent by 2030 under the Paris accord to curb global warming, Jakarta wants renewable projects to provide almost a quarter of its power needs by 2025, and nearly a third by 2050. Dolf Gielen, director of innovation and technology with the International Renewable Energy Agency, said Indonesia was focused on coal for power generation as recently as a couple of years ago, but “that seems to be somewhat changing”. With more than 17,000 islands scattered atop the volcanic Pacific Ring of Fire, power experts say Indonesia has plenty of options on renewable sources - especially geothermal. The United States is the world’s biggest geothermal energy producer, but largely untapped Indonesia is second since the massive Sarulla geothermal power plant on Sumatra was expanded earlier this year. Hydro-power is another good renewable energy option for Indonesia, said Yuichiro Yoi, head of Indonesia infrastructure finance at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Manila. North Sumatra’s Asahan hydroelectric power plant, which began operating in 2011, has helped Indonesia reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, he added. Solar, tidal and wind farms are also suitable for many parts of Indonesia, experts said. Indonesia’s first wind power project - the 100-hectare (247-acre) Sidrap wind farm on the island of Sulawesi - began operating earlier this year, and is a source of national pride. There are also plans to build the world’s largest tidal power plant in East Flores, media reports say. Although a clean and abundant power source, Indonesia’s geothermal resources are often located on or near protected forest areas, which can put off many financial backers. One solution may be to exploit them on a smaller scale, said Almo Pradana, energy and climate manager at the World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia. Similar to challenges facing other renewable projects, Indonesia’s complicated land ownership structures and land acquisition procedures can create further risks, said ADB’s Yoi. New renewables plants also have to reach a power supply agreement with the state-owned utility and such discussions can lack transparency and lead to delays, power experts added. In addition, government legislation stipulates new renewable energy projects must provide electricity at a price about 15 percent cheaper than existing power plants in a province. As a result, renewables often cannot compete with coal. The WRI is working with international corporations operating in Indonesia that have pledged to cut their emissions to try and force the government to change tack. “If you don’t facilitate a company to switch to renewables, they will move to the Philippines or Vietnam where renewable energy regimes are more friendly,” Pradana said. Back in northern Bali, Surayah, who goes by one name, is the only resident left on cleared land that was Pungkukan village - where 50 residents once lived. All her neighbours have been paid to leave their homes over the last decade to make way for the Celukan Bawang plant’s planned expansion. Surayah did reach an agreement to sell, but it collapsed due to last-minute changes, she said, strengthening her resolve. Living alongside six family members, the 64-year-old is adamant she will not leave despite her family’s regular hospital trips to treat fevers and respiratory problems, she said. ""I feel the coal power plant doesn't care about me anymore,"" said Surayah, whose on-grid house is more than three hours' drive from the sprawl of hotels and restaurants in southern Bali that need the power from the plant. ""I feel exhausted."" (Reporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-06-27,"(Adds details on Grisolia, background) RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro said on Tuesday its board has approved Rafael Salvador Grisolia to serve as chief financial officer, replacing Ivan Monteiro, who took the helm of the company earlier this month. Grisolia, who served since August 2017 as CFO of Petrobras Distribuidora, Petrobras’ fuel distribution unit, was named to serve until March 2019. The executive reshuffle comes after a nationwide trucker strike last month over rising diesel costs forced the government to agree to subsidize diesel prices, leading to the resignation of Pedro Parente, a darling of international investors, as Petrobras CEO. The crisis also raised fears of further meddling in Petrobras pricing among investors, who saw the company as finally turning the corner after years of political interference and corruption. Grisolia, an engineer by training, previously served as CFO at small companies such as Brazilian healthcare products supplier Cremer SA, and retailer Inbrands SA. He also worked in the financial area of Esso, an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp , Petrobras said in the filing. Late last year, Petrobras raked in upwards of 5 billion reais ($1.5 billion) when it floated a 30 percent stake in Petrobras Distribuidora as part of a bid to reduce the heftiest debt load among oil majors worldwide. Earnings at the unit missed net income estimates in the first quarter.
