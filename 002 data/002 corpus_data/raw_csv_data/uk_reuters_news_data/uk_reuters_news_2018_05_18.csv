2018-05-18,"NEW YORK, May 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Scientists are hunting for the mysterious source of surging levels of a gas that is outlawed for depleting the planet’s protective ozone layer, United Nations officials said on Friday. Production of the banned gas should be near zero but recent findings showed an increase in the atmosphere of 25 percent since 2012, according to a report published this week in the academic journal Nature. Research points to it originating in East Asia, experts said. The gas, trichlorofluoromethane, or CFC-11, was once commonly used in refrigerators and spray cans and has industrial uses. U.N. experts want to “tighten down” the source of the gas emissions by fall, said Paul Newman, co-chairman of a panel helping enforce the agency’s Montreal Protocol that bans ozone-depleting chemicals. The planet’s ozone layer shields life from cancer-causing solar rays. CFC-11 is undetectable using common infrared techniques so scientists plan to utilize monitoring stations and aircraft observations, Newman said. But pinpointing the exact location will be difficult, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “You really have to get nearby the production facilities themselves and find the stuff,” he said. No country has been known to violate the Montreal Protocol in its 30 years of existence, said David Fahey, also a member of the treaty’s assessment panel. “There’s certainly somebody who is responsible in that part of the world, but it could be inadvertent,” he told the Foundation. In addition to damaging to the ozone layer, CFC-11 is also a planet-warming greenhouse gas thousands of time more potent than carbon dioxide, scientists say.

2018-05-18,"VORONEZH, Russia, May 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - K azakhstan is using natural gas and cows made genetically efficient to slow the pace of land degradation caused by deforestation and overgrazing, a top official from the Central Asian nation said on Friday. Damage to the region’s unique cold winter deserts could have long-lasting consequences that will leave residents with no way of making a living, officials warned at a three-day regional food conference in southwest Russia. The extent of degradation is difficult to assess because countries in Central Asia do not release official figures, but anecdotal evidence shows the situation is serious, said Christian Welscher, project coordinator for the Central Asian Desert Initiative (CADI) at University of Greifswald, Germany. Also, studies show a potential loss of 76 percent of saxaul trees, a shrub found only in the region’s deserts, due to rampant deforestation and overgrazing by cattle, said Welscher. The CADI is working with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to combat land degradation and conserve biodiversity. The deforestation causes sandstorms that devastate rural communities, Welscher said. Mars Almabek, deputy chairman of the State Agriculture Inspection, said Kazakhstan is buying and importing modified cattle from the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, France and Czechoslovakia. “We are bringing natural gas to rural areas so they won’t cut down trees ... and we are suggesting maybe they have three cows instead of 10 but produce the same volume of milk,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In the past five years, Kazakhstan imported some 50,000 cows to the oil-rich former Soviet republic of 18 million people, Almabek said. Plans also include increasing the number of nature reserves to protect biodiversity, he said. Cold winter, or temperate, deserts have unique ecological qualities, experts say, providing important feeding grounds for animals and migration areas for birds. They also are home to the critically endangered Saiga antelope. Almost all are in Central Asia, with a vast majority in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, according to the United Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO). The degradation must be addressed, warned the FAO. “If we do not reverse it, people will start leaving because there will be no livelihood in these areas,” said Yuriko Shoji, deputy regional representative for Europe & Central Asia for the FAO, which organised the conference. The Aral Sea is an extreme example of what could happen if actions are not taken, Shoji said. Once the world’s fourth biggest lake, it has shrunk by 70 percent in recent decades in what environmentalists describe as one of the worst man-made ecological disasters.

2018-05-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 stock index dipped on Friday on persistent trade concerns, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields declined from a near seven-year peak after a burst higher this week. In Europe, political uncertainty in Italy weighed on stocks and bonds as well as on the euro. The U.S. dollar rose for a fifth straight session against a basket of currencies. Investors were digesting moves from earlier in the week, when the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield broke above 3.1 percent and oil topped $80 a barrel. On Friday, oil prices settled lower but benchmark Brent logged a sixth week of gains. Trade was on the top of investors’ minds as U.S. President Donald Trump said he was determined to stop China from “taking our jobs, taking our money” as U.S. and Chinese negotiators met for a second day to try to avert a tariff war. On Thursday, the top U.S. trade official poured cold water on the prospect of an imminent breakthrough in talks to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). “The driver is continued concerns about trade and the seeming lack of progress on both NAFTA and the negotiations with China,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think that’s why you are getting markets that are caught and not moving much because no one is certain about which way any of these will go, and whether there’s good news or whether they need to worry more about what happens next.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 1.11 points to 24,715.09, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.16 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,712.97 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 28.13 points, or 0.38 percent, to 7,354.34. A disappointing report by Applied Materials (AMAT.O) weighed on chip stocks .SOX. A volatile week for Italian markets continued as two anti-establishment parties pledged to increase spending in a deal to form a new coalition government. Yields on Italy's 10-year bond IT10YT=RR rose to their highest in more than seven months, while the country's stocks .FTMIB slumped 1.5 percent. The euro EUR= was down 0.23 percent to $1.1766, for its fifth session of declines. “The possibility of a eurosceptic government in Rome is shaking investor confidence ... At this point a larger fiscal deficit and greater bond issuance (in Italy) does seem likely,” said David Madden, a strategist at CMC Markets. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.29 percent, but posted gains for an eighth straight week. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.26 percent. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields declined from a near seven-year high as buyers emerged following a bond market selloff earlier this week spurred by worries about growing inflation and government borrowing. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 13/32 in price to yield 3.0633 percent, from 3.109 percent late on Thursday. “It’s a grind higher in yields,” said Larry Milstein, head of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New York. “I think the data are still pretty good. They make people think the economy is doing well.” The dollar index .DXY rose 0.22 percent. Oil prices fell, but Brent crude marked a sixth straight week of gains, boosted by plummeting Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. The benchmark on Thursday broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled down 0.3 percent at $71.28 a barrel, while Brent LCOcv1 settled at $78.51, down 1 percent.

2018-05-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, but Brent crude marked its sixth straight week of gains, boosted by plummeting Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 79 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $78.51 a barrel. The global benchmark on Thursday broke through $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014, and investors anticipate more gains due to supply concerns, at least in the short term.  Brent, which has gained about 17.5 percent since the start of the year, rose about 1.9 percent this week. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 21 cents to settle at $71.28 a barrel, a 0.29 percent loss. The contract rose about 0.9 percent for the week, its third straight week of gains. “Nothing has changed fundamentally today to really drive that small price movement down,” said Nick Holmes, an investment analyst on the energy portfolio team at Tortoise Capital in Leawood, Kansas, adding that some investors were taking profits ahead of the weekend. Traders were looking ahead to Venezuela’s election on Sunday, which could then trigger additional U.S. sanctions if President Nicolas Maduro is re-elected for a six-year term, though the opposition party has largely boycotted and two of his most popular opponents have been banned from running.  The process has been criticized by the United States, the European Union and major Latin America countries. Additional sanctions could further hurt Venezuelan oil supply, already reeling from lack of maintenance and state-run PDVSA’s inability to pay its bills. Most recently, the company elected to close its refinery in Curacao after ConocoPhillips (COP.N) seized oil as it seeks to collect on a $2 billion (£1.48 billion) court award.  Barclays said output from Venezuela could fall below 1 million barrels per day. The country produced around 1.4 million bpd in April, according to OPEC secondary sources. PRODN-VE    OPEC leading producer Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it would make sure the world is adequately supplied with oil just as major consumer India expressed frustration with rising prices. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih called India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to assure him that supporting global economic growth was “one of the kingdom’s key goals,” the Saudi Energy Ministry said. Crude prices have received broad support from voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Oil has also been buoyed by this month’s announcement by the United States that it would withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear arms treaty and renew sanctions against the OPEC member. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said sanctions against Iran could remove more than 1 million bpd from the market. The U.S. oil rig count held steady at 844 this week after rising for six weeks in a row, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. BP Plc (BP.L), however, expects the rally to cool off. The oil major’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, told Reuters he saw the price of oil falling to between $50 and $65 a barrel due to surging shale output and OPEC’s capacity to boost production.

2018-05-18,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German cities are entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels in line with European Union rules, Germany’s top administrative court confirmed on Friday. A day after the European Commission lodged a complaint with Europe’s top court against Germany for its repeated failure to protect air quality in its cities, the details of the German ruling will add to pressure on Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and its German peers to provide hardware fixes for polluting diesel models. Research firm Evercore ISI has said this could cost the industry 14.5 billion euros ($17.1 billion). Germany opened the door to diesel bans in February when it allowed environmental groups to sue cities which fail to enforce Europe’s clean air rules, despite fierce lobbying to oppose bans from carmakers. Dozens of German cities including Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart exceed European Union limits on nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease.     In a 30-page statement on the ruling which was published on Friday, Germany’s administrative court in Leipzig said there should be no grace periods for driving bans. “Such restrictions, in their intensity, do not go beyond other passage and stopping bans as justified by road law requirements, which motorists always have to reckon with and which they principally have to accept,” the court said. European carmakers have invested heavily in diesel engines, which produce less of the carbon that causes global warming than gasoline, but more of other pollutants blamed for causing disease. Germany’s move to allow cities to ban diesel engines from streets could have wide implications for the future of the industry. Bans in the home of some of the world’s biggest automakers are a further blow for the sector, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, which has faced criticism for its close ties to the industry. “This ruling is a disaster for the government which one-sidedly stands in for the greed for profit by the carmakers while leaving 10 million owners of manipulated diesel cars alone,” said Juergen Resch, managing director of Germany’s DUH environmental lobby.     Immediate driving bans on major roads or road sections would be legitimate and could affect all models excluding those meeting the latest Euro-6 emissions standards, the ruling statement said.  Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, only 2.7 million have Euro-6 technology which was phased in 2014. For wider city areas encompassing a multitude of main roads and side streets, the court recommended a phased implementation of bans, starting with older cars that meet Euro-4 emissions standards. The Euro-4 standard was replaced by Euro-5 beginning in 2009. Germany’s VDA auto industry lobby urged cities to keep a sense of proportion when deciding their course of action, noting that NOx levels should fall significantly in coming months as more Euro-6 models are sold and the emissions-control software of older models is updated. “What’s at stake are not blanket driving bans but an assessment as to whether local measures are even necessary to meet the legal air quality targets,” VDA president Bernhard Mattes said. The Leipzig court had said in February that Euro-5 vehicles should not be banned until Sept. 1, 2019. Tradesmen and some residents too should be exempted, it said at the time. The ruling is the latest regulatory action to come in the wake of Volkswagen’s diesel emissions test-cheating scandal in 2015, and was prompted by legal action from Germany’s DUH. “The courts have been waiting for the ruling statement received today,” said Remo Klinger, a lawyer representing DUH which is pushing suits in 28 German cities including Munich and Frankfurt. “We believe that in many cases, it will swiftly come to oral hearings and rulings.” Germany’s second most populous city Hamburg on Wednesday said it had started putting up signs to enforce driving bans of older diesel cars, with local authorities expecting restrictions to start taking effect at the end of this month.

2018-05-18,"BRATISLAVA, May 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine will offer Gazprom discounted fees for natural gas transit to ensure a flow from Russia to Europe after 2020, European Commission Vice President for Energy Union Maros Sefcovic said on Friday. Russia’s Gazprom and five European companies, with German backing, plan to build the North Stream 2 gas pipeline on the Baltic seabed to connect Russia directly with Germany, bypassing eastern Europe and limiting the flows via Ukraine. The pipeline will double Russia’s gas export capacity to Germany but threatens to cost Ukraine valuable revenues, while increasing European Union reliance on Russian gas. “Ukraine is saying they want to maintain the transit of Russian natural gas to Europe and will seek solutions that would guarantee the higher the volume the cheaper for Gazprom,” Sefcovic told Reuters at the Globsec security forum. The volume of transit would have to be “commercially viable” for Ukraine, Sefcovic added. According to energy firm Naftogaz’s expectations, Ukraine will earn around $3 billion from transit in 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Moscow was ready for talks with Ukraine on continued gas transit through the country.

2018-05-18,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s No. 2 lender DZ Bank said on Friday it will suspend financial transactions with Iran in July following U.S. President Donald Trump’s pullout from the nuclear deal with Tehran.   Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the accord and his order that sanctions be reimposed have led several European companies to announce their exit from Iran, including French oil major Total (TOTF.PA) earlier this week. “We will completely suspend our foreign payment transactions related to Iran starting July 1st,” said a spokesman for Frankfurt-based DZ Bank, which is the umbrella organisation of German cooperative bank chain Raiffeisen-Volksbanken. Germany’s export credit insurer Euler Hermes AG said on Friday it has guaranteed exports to Iran worth 200 million euros (£174.7 million) since 2016. The programme remains in place for now and companies can still apply guarantees, Hermes said. European powers have vowed to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but have admitted they would struggle to provide the guarantees Tehran seeks.

2018-05-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will outline a “diplomatic road map” and call for broad support from European and other allies to apply pressure on Iran to force it back to the negotiating table, a senior U.S. official said on Friday, as Washington seeks to chart a course after it pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal. Rebuffing appeals from France, Germany and Britain, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States 10 days ago from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers and ordered that sanctions be reimposed on Tehran. In his first foreign policy speech on Monday, Pompeo will call for broad support to address “the totality of Iran’s threats,” said Brian Hook, senior U.S. policy advisor. Hook said U.S. officials hoped economic pressure from renewed sanctions would lead Iran back to the table as it did a few years ago, leading to the 2015 nuclear accord. But it was not immediately clear whether the Europeans would support the plan as they try to salvage investment and trade ties with Tehran that followed the accord. nL8N1SG2YJ] Hook said Washington was seeking a diplomatic outcome with Iran and sanctions were part of that. “The goal of our effort is to bring all necessary pressure to bear on Iran to change its behaviour and to pursue a new framework that can resolve our concerns,” Hook told reporters. “We very much want to be, to have a kind of up-tempo diplomacy, one that’s very focussed and very determined to achieve our national security objectives,” he said, adding: “We need a new ... framework that’s going to address the totality of Iran threats.” A senior European official whose country is party to the deal said there were concerns that the Trump administration was interested in pursuing “the maximum pressure and brutal show of strength idea” instead of negotiating. “We say that there has to be a negotiating method but if they are purely in the maximum pressure and brutal show of strength idea and they believe it will work because they believe it worked with North Korea then we will have a major problem,” the official said. The threat of U.S. sanctions has already forced some European companies to pull back from Iran. German lender DZ Bank said it will suspend its financial transactions with Iran in July, while French gas and power group Engie also said it would end its contracts in Iran by November. This week, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions against Iranian finance officials and financiers it said were linked to Iran-backed Hezbollah.    Hook played down differences between the United States and Europe over Iran. “We have a period of opportunity to work with our allies to try to come up with a new security architecture, a new framework,” he said, adding: “I think people are overstating the disagreements between the U.S. and Europe.” Trump said the 2015 agreement did not adequately curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions or address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and what the Trump administration views as its destabilising role in the region. Under the agreement Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against it. Iran has denied it sought in the past to develop an atomic weapon, saying its nuclear programme has always been for purely peaceful purposes. Hook said the Iran nuclear accord had given countries a false sense of security and the United States wanted to ensure any new agreement covered not only Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities, but also curbed its regional activities. “This involves a range of things around its nuclear programme, missiles, proliferating missiles and missile technology and support for terrorists and its aggressive and violent activities that fuel civil wars in Syria and Yemen,” said Hook. In recent days, U.S. officials have highlighted protests in Iran to illustrate economic discontent among Iranians and a reason Iran should return to talks. At least one person was killed and six others wounded in the southern city of Kazeroon, according to the semi-official Fars news agency on Thursday. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has assured Iranians that their oil-reliant economy can withstand new sanctions. “You have seen the protests in Iran and people have publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with a lot of the policies of the regime, which have not helped the Iranian people,” said Hook. Later, as he met his Dutch counterpart at the State Department, Pompeo also tweeted about the protests.

2018-05-18,"(Adds comments from minister, truckers’ strike threat, context) By Rodrigo Viga Gaier and Alberto Alerigi RIO DE JANEIRO/SÃO PAULO, May 18 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government is discussing possible tax cuts to reduce the price of fuel at the pump, the country’s energy minister, Wellington Moreira Franco, said on Friday as truck drivers planned a national strike to protest high diesel prices. Diesel and gasoline prices have surged more than 45 percent at Brazilian refineries since last year as state-controlled oil company Petrobras passes on recent increases in global crude prices. Moreira Franco said fuel prices were “too high” and there was a need to discuss the issue. “The government is impressed with the continuing increase in fuel prices and it is discussing a possible cut on taxes to reduce their costs,” the minister told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. He said the discussion is focused on both federal taxes, such as the so called PIS/Cofins, and state-level taxes. An eventual agreement, then, would have to involve state governors as well. Moreira Franco said there was no timeframe for a possible decision and implementation despite the ongoing talks. Truck owners are threatening a widespread strike if the government fails to act to reduce diesel costs. Abcam, a local truckers association, said truckers would go on strike on Monday if the government did not come up with a position on possible measures to reduce costs by the end of Friday. A large part of goods transportation in Brazil, including commodities such as sugar and grains, is by road. Fuel costs have also impacted the agricultural sector in Brazil and worldwide. Farmers are about to start to harvest the country’s main corn crop and have complained about high operational costs. Writing by Marcelo Teixeira

2018-05-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) shares fell more than 3 percent in New York trading on Friday amid investor concern about allegations mounted in court filings over alleged excess diesel emissions. The U.S. Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler and its VM Motori SpA unit in May 2017, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014. Court documents filed by lawyers suing Fiat Chrysler on behalf of owners this week in an amended complaint cited emails that VM Motori knew as early as 2010 that an auxiliary emissions control device (AECD) would be illegal if concealed from regulators. Fiat Chrysler shares fell as much as 3.2 percent after Bloomberg News reported on the documents earlier on Friday. The shares were down 1.7 percent at $21.81 (16.2 pounds) in early afternoon. The lawsuit disclosed emails from 2010 between a Fiat Chrysler (FCA) powertrain division employee and VM Motori about whether the AECD used “cycle detection” - a mechanism allowing vehicles to detect when they were being tested to see if they meet regulatory requirements, and modify emissions. VM Motori regularly admitted that an AECD employed cycle detection, the suit said. The company denies wrongdoing, saying it never engaged in any deliberate scheme to cheat emissions rules. “It is inappropriate to draw conclusions from isolated communications and internal deliberations, without the more detailed context that is part of the reviews FCA is conducting,” the company said in a statement. Reuters reported in 2017 the existence of emails from VM Motori that raised questions. Regulators have said Fiat Chrysler diesel vehicles had undisclosed AECDs that allowed vehicles to emit excess pollution during normal driving. Fiat Chrysler held two days of settlement talks last week with the Justice Department, but two people briefed on the talks said the sides remain far apart on the amount of a civil penalty. Another session is set for next week. The company faces a separate criminal probe into the matter. The Justice Department sent Fiat Chrysler a January settlement offer letter requiring it to offset excess pollution and the offer included language that a settlement must include substantial civil penalties. On Monday, Reuters reported Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne reprimanded the company’s top U.S. spokesman for issuing press releases about Fiat’s vehicle emissions practices days after Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) disclosure in September 2015 that the German automaker had used illegal software to evade emissions tests, citing court documents. Lawyers filed excerpts of an email from Marchionne to Gualberto Ranieri, then the company’s U.S. spokesman, criticising him for saying the company does not use defeat devices. “Are you out of your goddam mind?” Marchionne wrote in an email on Sept. 22, 2015, adding that Ranieri should be fired and calling his actions “utterly stupid and unconscionable.” The company said it was “understandable that our CEO would have a forceful response to any employee who would opine on such a significant and complex matter, without the matter having been fully reviewed.”  Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/fiat-chrysler-emissions/fiat-chrysler-shares-fall-on-latest-diesel-emissions-allegations-idUKL2N1SP13H,18 May 2018,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

2018-05-18,"(Adds rigs in Permian region) May 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count held steady this week after rising for six weeks in a row even as crude prices soar to multi-year highs, prompting drillers to extract record amounts of oil, especially from shale. The total oil rig count held at 844 in the week to May 18, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI More than half the total oil rigs are in Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there increased by four this week to 467, the most since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 720 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts to cut global output in a bid to take advantage of rising prices. U.S. crude futures traded over $72 a barrel this week on concerns that Iranian exports could fall because of renewed U.S. sanctions, their highest since November 2014. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $70 for the balance of 2018 and $66 for calendar 2019. Shale production is expected rise to a record high 7.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, with the majority of the increase from the Permian where output is forecast to climb to a fresh high of 3.3 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) this week projected. Earlier this month, the EIA forecast average annual U.S. production would rise to a record high 10.7 million bpd in 2018 and 11.9 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. In anticipation of higher prices, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 13 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $81.2 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.1 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise to 1,020 in 2018 and 1,125 in 2019. That is a bit lower than the firm’s projections last week of 1,020 in 2018 and 1,135 in 2019. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 987, up sharply from 2017’s average of 876. That keeps the rig count on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-05-18,"SOCHI, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday that he would stand up to any attempts by U.S. President Donald Trump to block a Russian-German gas pipeline project. Berlin and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea four years ago, but they share a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will allow Russia to export more natural gas to northern Europe. A U.S. government official this week said Washington had concerns about the project, and that companies involved in Russian pipeline projects faced a higher risk of being hit with U.S. sanctions. “Donald is not just the U.S. president, he’s also a good, tough entrepreneur,” Putin said at a news conference, alongside Merkel, after the two leaders had talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. “He’s promoting the interests of his business, to ensure the sales of liquefied natural gas on the European market,” Putin said, departing from his usual approach of being scrupulously respectful when speaking about Trump.  “But it depends on us, how we build our relations with our partners, it will depend on our partners in Europe.” “We believe it (the pipeline) is beneficial for us, we will fight for it.” As well as the differences over Nord Stream 2, European capitals are at odds with Washington over Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal. Moscow shares Europe’s position on the deal. Some commentators have said that a shared opposition to Trump’s stances on Iran and other issues could lead to a rapprochement between Europe and Russia, repairing a relationship badly damaged by the Ukraine conflict. Merkel, who earlier in the day received a bouquet of pink and white roses from Putin as she arrived at his residence in Sochi, also hinted at tensions between Berlin and the Trump administration. Asked about differences with the United States over the Iran deal and other issues, Merkel told reporters: “We have a strong transatlantic friendship, which during its history has had to withstand many questions of different opinions, and I think that might be the case now as well.” While the Russian leader is frequently critical of U.S. policy, he has been meticulous about not attaching blame to Trump personally. Kremlin officials have said in the past the two men have a personal rapport that Putin wishes to preserve. European states involved in Nord Stream 2 say it is a purely commercial project but the Trump administration say it is helping the Kremlin pursue its political agenda. The pipeline may result in less Russian gas being transported via Ukraine, depriving Kiev’s struggling pro-Western government of transit fees that are a vital source of revenue. In a nod to the U.S. concerns, Merkel said Russian gas should still be pumped through Ukraine. “We see Nord Stream 2 as an economic project but it also has implications and that’s why we are working on what guarantees Ukraine could be given,” she said. Putin said he was willing to negotiate with Kiev about continued transit of Russian gas. Despite the common ground on Nordstream and the Iran deal, long-standing tensions in the Berlin-Moscow relationship surfaced at the news briefing. Merkel said she was worried about a new property law implemented by the government of Syria, which is backed by Moscow. Rights activists say the law allows the Syrian government to deprive people who have been displaced by the fighting of their homes. “That is bad news for people who want one day to return to Syria. We will discuss that intensively and ask Russia to use their influence to persuade Assad not to do that. We must prevent facts being created on the ground,” Merkel said. Putin a day earlier had received Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad at his residence in Sochi for talks. At the briefing with Merkel, the Russian president chided European leaders over Syria, saying if they want Syrian refugees living in their countries to return home, Europe had to commit to reconstruction in Syria.  Diplomats say that is a bone of contention, because European governments believe Russia should pay the lion’s share of the multi-billion-dollar reconstruction cost since it is the main military force and powerbroker in Syria.

2018-05-18,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands will ban the use of coal in electricity generation in the coming decade and shut down two of its five coal-fired plants at the end of 2024 unless they switch fuels. The law announced by economy minister Eric Wiebes on Friday applies to plants build in the 1990s, while newer ones will have to shut by the end of 2029, and marks the first step towards the government’s goal of shutting all coal-fired plants by 2030.  The first two plants are run by Germany’s RWE (RWEG.DE) and Sweden’s Vattenfall in Geertruidenberg and Amsterdam, respectively, and have been in operation since 1994. The remaining three were built in 2015 and 2016. RWE, which also operates one of the newer coal-fired plants, said it was displeased by the decisions, as they offer no compensation for the ban on coal and for the 3.2 billion euros (2.8 billion pounds) RWE said it invested in its newest plant at the request of the government.  “We expect significant consequences for our activities”, the company said in a statement. “We will contemplate legal action if the law is implemented as currently proposed.”  Vattenfall subsidiary Nuon said it would abide to the law and would shut down its coal-fired plant, known as Hemweg-8, at the end of 2024. Shutting the coal-fired plants should help the government achieve its goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 49 percent relative to the 1990 level by 2030. Emissions were 13 percent lower last year than in 1990.

2018-05-18,"(Repeats to add picture with story) * EPH, Seven Energy submit bid for Engie plants - sources * Part of strategy to wring profits from fossil-fuel plants * Targeting assets discarded by energy giants going green * However face regulatory risks and threat of low prices By Michael Kahn, Jason Hovet and Arno Schuetze PRAGUE/FRANKFURT, May 18 (Reuters) - Two Czech power companies are targeting fossil fuel-fired plants in Germany as part of a contrarian strategy to snap up older, polluting assets on the cheap from European energy giants going green. EPH and Seven Energy have submitted rival offers for French group Engie’s plants near Munich and Bremen, as well as its 52 percent stake in a plant in Wilhemshaven, according to two utilities banking sources familiar with the matter. The assets are expected to fetch a few hundred million euros in total, they said. EPH and Seven Energy both told Reuters they were interested in acquisitions in Germany, but declined to comment on whether they had bid for the Engie plants. Engie declined to comment. The Czech firms, both backed by billionaires, have no links with each other, but share a common game plan: they are looking to buy up old coal and gas-fired plants being discarded by big players like Engie, Vattenfall and EnBW who are trying to set themselves up for the future by switching to renewable generation. Fossil fuel, or thermal, power still accounts for almost half of the EU’s electricity. EPH and Seven Energy are betting the plants will need to remain operational over the next 20 years for back-up power to stabilise grids when demand outstrips supply from less predictable wind and solar. There are potential difficulties and risks associated with this strategic focus on conventional power generation, where margins are increasingly squeezed because of low wholesale prices and a surge in renewable capacity. Governments or regulators, aiming to meet tough pollution targets, could also decide to limit power generation from coal plants. This happened to EPH in Britain where it announced in February it would close the Eggborough plant after failing to secure an agreement to provide back-up capacity. The company said without a contract for future years it would not be economically viable to continue operations. A planning application is in progress to develop a new gas-fired station at the site, but it is unlikely to be operational until the 2020s. Tomas David, vice chairman of EP Power Europe - EPH’s power generation division - said the company was interested in assets critically needed to meet a country’s power needs. “This is the reason for our interest in German lignite,” he told Reuters, referring to a type of coal. Privately held EPH - run by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky - has bought fossil-fuel plants in Germany, Italy and Britain over the past three years, from Sweden’s Vattenfall, German group E.ON and UK company Centrica. Producing more than 100 terawatt hours of power annually, EPH says it is among Europe’s top 10 electricity producers. Its power generation portfolio makes about 7 billion euros ($8.3 billion) in annual revenue, which along with an ability to raise billions more in debt provides a significant warchest for acquisitions. Newcomer Seven Energy, launched in February by Pavel Tykac, has more than 1 billion euros to spend and said it saw potential for acquisitions in Germany, Britain, Italy and the Benelux countries. Seven Energy CEO Alan Svoboda said he aimed to close at least one deal this year. Several others are in late-stage negotiations, each typically worth a few hundred million euros, he added. As part of its plan to wring profits from existing coal and gas plants, it has brought in a number of former top officials from Czech firm CEZ, central Europe’s biggest utility. Svoboda said Finnish group Fortum’s 3.8-billion-euro bid for a stake in German thermal power generation firm Uniper, if successful, would likely trigger sales of fossil fuel power assets that would be attractive for his company. “We are looking at it opportunistically,” he said. EPH and Seven Energy are not alone in targeting thermal power assets, although the field of potential buyers is small because such companies need to be free from political pressure to reduce carbon footprints, according to analysts. Investment funds such as I Squared Capital, First Reserve and KKR have all acquired utility assets in the past. Among others, I Squared Capital bought Irish energy group Viridian, First Reserve has bought the UK’s Morrison Utility Services, KKR bought France’s A2A Coriance. Other thermal plants that could come up for sale, according to utilities bankers, are EnBW’s German coal plants in Heilbronn, Karlsruhe as well as Rostock, which is co-owned with Vattenfall. Austria’s EVN could also sell its 49 percent stake in the Duisburg Walsum plant, the bankers said, adding that no decisions on these assets had been taken yet. EnBW and EVN declined to comment. Jiri Gavor, head of Prague-based energy consultant ENA, said EPH and Seven Energy’s strategy could bear fruit because Europe’s push to replace coal with renewables would not be as quick or smooth as politicians would like. He added: “(Other investors) don’t have the competence like EPH or Seven in running these old power plants.” $1 = 0.8488 euros

2018-05-18,"SOCHI, May 18 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday that he would stand up to any attempts by U.S. President Donald Trump to block a Russian-German gas pipeline project. Berlin and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea four years ago, but they share a common interest in the Nordstream 2 pipeline project, which will allow Russia to export more natural gas to northern Europe. A U.S. government official this week said Washington had concerns about the project, and that companies involved in Russian pipeline projects faced a higher risk of being hit with U.S. sanctions. “Donald is not just the U.S. president, he’s also a good, tough entrepreneur,” Putin said at a news conference, alongside Merkel, after the two leaders had talks in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. “He’s promoting the interests of his business, to ensure the sales of liquefied natural gas on the European market,” Putin said. “I understand the U.S. president. He’s defending the interests of his business, he wants to push his product on the European market. But it depends on us, how we build our relations with our partners, it will depend on our partners in Europe.” “We believe it (the pipeline) is beneficial for us, we will fight for it.” Merkel, who earlier in the day received a bouquet of pink and white roses from Putin as she arrived at his residence in Sochi, also hinted at tensions between Berlin and the Trump administration. As well as the differences over Nordstream, European capitals are at odds with Washington over Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal. Moscow shares Europe’s position on the deal. “Germany, Britain, France, and all our partners in the European Union continue to support this deal and remain in this deal and we know that a very specific situation arose that we Europeans need to discuss with Iran,” Merkel said at the news conference. “I know that the deal is anything but perfect but it is better than no deal.” Asked about differences with the United States, Merkel told reporters: “We have a strong transatlantic friendship, which during its history has had to withstand many questions of different opinions, and I think that might be the case now as well.” “But this does not challenge the intensity of the transatlantic relationship,” she said. Some commentators have said that a shared opposition to Trump’s stances on Iran and other issues could lead to a rapprochement between Europe and Russia, repairing a relationship badly damaged by the Ukraine conflict. Putin’s remarks about Trump were unusually forthright. While the Russian leader is frequently critical of U.S. policy, Putin has always been respectful in his comments on Trump, with whom Kremlin officials say he has built up a personal rapport.

2018-05-18,"BERLIN, May 18 (Reuters) - German cities are entitled to ban older diesel vehicles from streets with immediate effect to bring air pollution levels in line with European Union rules, Germany’s top administrative court confirmed on Friday. Germany opened the door to diesel bans in February when it allowed environmental groups to sue cities which fail to enforce Europe’s clean air rules, despite fierce lobbying to oppose bans from carmakers. In a 30-page statement on the ruling which was published on Friday, Germany’s administrative court in Leipzig said there should be no grace periods for driving bans. “Such restrictions, in their intensity, do not go beyond other passage and stopping bans as justified by road law requirements, which motorists always have to reckon with and which they principally have to accept,” the court said. European carmakers have invested heavily in diesel engines, which produce less of the carbon that causes global warming than gasoline, but more of other pollutants blamed for causing disease. Germany’s move to allow cities to ban diesel engines from streets could have wide implications for the future of the industry. Immediate driving bans on major roads or road sections would be legitimate and could affect all models excluding those meeting the latest Euro-6 emissions standards, the ruling statement said. Euro-6 was phased in in 2014. For wider city areas encompassing a multitude of main roads and side streets, the court recommended a phased implementation of bans, starting with older cars that meet Euro-4 emissions standards. The Euro-4 standard was replaced by Euro-5 beginning in 2009. The Leipzig court had said in February that Euro-5 vehicles should not be banned until Sept. 1, 2019. Tradesmen and some residents too should be exempted, it said at the time. The ruling is the latest regulatory action to come in the wake of Volkswagen’s diesel emissions test-cheating scandal in 2015, and was prompted by legal action from Germany’s DUH environmental lobby. “The courts have been waiting for the ruling statement received today,” said Remo Klinger, a lawyer representing DUH which is pushing suits in 28 German cities including Munich and Frankfurt. “We believe that in many cases, it will swiftly come to oral hearings and rulings.” Germany’s second most populous city Hamburg on Wednesday said it had started putting up signs to enforce driving bans of older diesel cars, with local authorities expecting restrictions to start taking effect at the end of this month.

2018-05-18,"TOBOLSK, Russia, May 18 (Reuters) - On a sprawling construction site in Western Siberia, about 20,000 workers are busy building what will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, part of a play by Russia to capture more of the value from the oil it produces. Russian energy companies, led by privately owned Sibur, have been increasingly shifting their focus to petrochemicals in a drive to capitalise on the fast-growing sector and offset the volatile market for crude oil exports. According to the EY consultancy, Russia accounts for about 1 percent of global petrochemical output, trailing not only the United States and Europe but also Thailand, Taiwan, Brazil, Iran and China. That is set to change, with the Sibur plant due to come on stream, while gas giant Gazprom plans to invest $5 billion in a petrochemical plant on the Baltic Sea, and oil major Rosneft has said it will ramp up its petrochemical capacity in Russia’s far eastern region. The Sibur plant is taking shape near Tobolsk, birthplace of Dmitry Mendeleev, the inventor of the periodic table and one of the founders of modern chemistry. It is also close to many of the fields that produce crude oil, the raw material for much petrochemical production. Most of Russia’s oil is exported as crude, a trade that has delivered diminishing returns as world oil prices have weakened over the past four years. Sibur is banking on growing domestic consumption of petrochemical products, which are used in construction, medicine, aviation, car making, clothes, bottling, packaging and many other sectors. “We see quite a huge potential for growth of the Russian market,” Dmitry Konov, head of Sibur, said at the construction site of the plant on the outskirts of Tobolsk. Once in operation, the complex, known as ZapSibNefteKhim, will have an annual production capacity of 1.5 million tonnes of ethylene and 500,000 tonnes of propylene. According to Vadim Drujina, a partner at McKinsey & Co consultancy in Moscow, petrochemicals is the fastest-growing segment of crude oil consumption. “Growing petrochemicals demand is partly explained by substitution of traditional materials, e.g. steel, in such segments as construction and automotive,” Drujina said. “Given the abundance of petrochemicals feedstock it makes a lot of sense for Russia to think about further growth of petrochemicals in order to create additional value.” Denis Borisov, director of EY’s oil and gas centre in Moscow, expects that in Russia alone, demand for petrochemicals - depending on product - will grow by 2 to 3 percent a year to 2025. The location, the Russian heartland of oil production, allows Sibur to cut transportation costs as it obtains the feedstock, such as associated petroleum gas and naphtha, from nearby fields operated by other companies. Grigory Vygon of Vygon Consultancy in Moscow said the oil petrochemical industry is the only area of oil products consumption that will grow long-term. “The pace of global petrochemical growth is double the growth of the global economy,” Vygon said. As they increase in prosperity emerging economies will consume more of the products, such as personal care items, paints and furnishings, that are derived from petrochemicals, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report. “Global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services,” it said. Rosneft, the world’s top publicly listed oil producer, plans to produce 3.4 million tonnes of petrochemicals in the Russian Far East. The head of the company, Igor Sechin, the most influential energy official in Russia, has said the hydrocarbon share in global energy consumption will decrease in the long term, while petrochemical products and gas consumption will offset the decline in oil demand. Gazprom has also announced plans for a large-scale gas chemical complex on the Baltic Sea with investments of around $5 billion.

2018-05-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum (APC.N) is seeking to raise a record $14-$15 billion (£10-£11 billion)  from banks and export credit agencies for its huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique, sources close to the matter said. Fast-growing gas demand from China and Southeast Asia is reassuring export project developers sitting on huge untapped gas discoveries in Mozambique and elsewhere that the market cycle is turning after three years of low prices. The full amount would be the largest loan ever in the LNG  sector.  French bank Societe Generale (SOGN.PA), the financial adviser on the $20 billion Mozambique LNG project, has already received interest for a combined $12 billion in cover and direct lending from export credit agencies (ECAs) in China, South Africa, Italy and Japan, one of the sources said. The ECAs include Export-Import Bank of China, Export Credit Insurance Corporation of South Africa, Italy’s Sace and Japan’s Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, the source said. Societe Generale will launch a global roadshow on May 21 to test demand among commercial banks.  ECAs typically provide large government-backed loans or insurance to support exports and domestic companies in other countries.  Asian and Chinese ECAs in particular have provided billions of dollars in loans and cover to Africa’s largest energy and infrastructure projects in recent years, paving the way for additional commercial bank financing.  “There’s enough meat on the bones of the project in terms of supply deals to start sounding out banks,” the first source said.  In all, Anadarko has agreed commercial terms including volume and price for 5.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG supplies from Mozambique, closing in on the 8.5 mtpa target needed to trigger its final investment decision on the project. Anadarko Petroleum spokeswoman Helen Wells confirmed the company had engaged with ECAs to negotiate the terms and conditions of project financing. “Our target is to raise financing equivalent to approximately two-thirds of the expected capital costs, which, if successful, would represent the largest project financing ever in Africa and one of the largest globally for a non-OECD country,” Wells said.  The U.S. oil major aims to build from scratch a 17,000-acre liquefaction complex in Mozambique’s remote north to chill gas pumped from the Golfinho/Atum fields in its Area 1 deepwater block, 16.5-kilometres (10 miles) offshore. It will produce 12.88 mtpa of LNG in its initial phase, which can be expanded to 50 mtpa.

2018-05-18,"PRAGUE/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two Czech power companies are targeting fossil fuel-fired plants in Germany as part of a contrarian strategy to snap up older, polluting assets on the cheap from European energy giants going green. EPH and Seven Energy have submitted rival offers for French group Engie’s (ENGIE.PA) plants near Munich and Bremen, as well as its 52 percent stake in a plant in Wilhemshaven, according to two utilities banking sources familiar with the matter. The assets are expected to fetch a few hundred million euros in total, they said. EPH and Seven Energy both told Reuters they were interested in acquisitions in Germany, but declined to comment on whether they had bid for the Engie plants. Engie declined to comment. The Czech firms, both backed by billionaires, have no links with each other, but share a common game plan: they are looking to buy up old coal and gas-fired plants being discarded by big players like Engie, Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and EnBW (EBKG.DE) who are trying to set themselves up for the future by switching to renewable generation. Fossil fuel, or thermal, power still accounts for almost half of the EU’s electricity. EPH and Seven Energy are betting the plants will need to remain operational over the next 20 years for back-up power to stabilize grids when demand outstrips supply from less predictable wind and solar.  There are potential difficulties and risks associated with this strategic focus on conventional power generation, where margins are increasingly squeezed because of low wholesale prices and a surge in renewable capacity. Governments or regulators, aiming to meet tough pollution targets, could also decide to limit power generation from coal plants. This happened to EPH in Britain where it announced in February it would close the Eggborough plant after failing to secure an agreement to provide back-up capacity. The company said without a contract for future years it would not be economically viable to continue operations. A planning application is in progress to develop a new gas-fired station at the site, but it is unlikely to be operational until the 2020s.

2018-05-18,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria must build a national consensus to undertake deep economic reforms and end its dependency on volatile gas and oil revenues, the new leader of the main Islamist opposition party said. Abderazak Makri, elected last week as the new head of the Islamist MSP party, also told Reuters he will stand in the presidential election in April 2019 if the government does not bring the opposition into its plans for taking the oil-producer country forward. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the veteran leader in power since 1999, has not declared yet whether he will seek a fifth term though the ruling FLN party and the biggest labour union have asked him to run again. Should the 81-year-old, who is wheelchair-bound following a stroke in 2013, run again this would provide short-term stability in the OPEC oil producer giving the military-backed power brokers time to sort out a smooth transition. But Makri said the oil producer had no time to lose to agree on economic reforms as Algeria’s model of a state dominated economic dependent on oil and gas revenues no longer worked. “A government needs full support from political parties, unions and organizations to implement difficult reforms. This is why we need a consensus,” Makri said in an interview. “If we do not reach a political consensus, all options will be then open. We may participate. We may boycott,” he said. Islamist parties now play no big role in Algeria where the FLN has dominated since independence from France. The MSP won only 6 percent in the 2017 election and it boycotted the presidential elections in 2014. Makri said rising domestic gas consumption eating into gas exports showed that the Algeria need to diversify its economy even if oil prices were continuing to pick up. Oil and gas revenues have halved since 2014, straining a welfare state used to discourage dissent. Algeria has responded to the economic crisis by reducing imports, a public service hire freeze and postponing some projects to cope with the crash of oil prices. But the government has maintained subsidies of key products such as milk and powerful elites have resisted opening up the country too much to foreigners. “The government needs to show very clearly to political parties that it will accept political change,” Makri said. Many ordinary Algerians prefer stability after the civil war in the 90s when the elite overturned an election which Islamists were poised to win triggering a conflict with them in which about 200,000 people were killed. Makri was undeterred by the apparent modest support for Islamist parties, pointing to Tunisia where Islamist and secular forces rule together. “Tunisia is a good sample. When elections are free and fair the winners are always Islamists,” he said. “In Morocco, the Islamists have won, in Tunisia they have won, and they would have won in Algeria if there had been no fraud.” Editing by Ulf Laessing and Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/algeria-islamists/algerias-islamist-opposition-urges-national-consensus-on-economic-reform-idUKL5N1SP25S,18 May 2018,"Algeria must build a national

Traders hit Italian bonds, stocks and the euro as a pledge to ramp up spending from a coalition government taking shape in Rome caused fresh unease, while Wall Street was waiting to see the outcome of U.S. and China trade talks..

Rome’s bonds have seen their biggest sell-off in over a year this week. Italy accounts for around 15 percent of euro zone GDP and a qaurter of the bloc’s public debt. For comparison, crisis poster child Greece contributed just 1.8 percent to euro zone GDP and 3.3 percent to its pile of public debt. “We have read the (Five Star-League government) contract and the big question mark is where are they going to get the money,” Angelo Media, head of equities at Banor SIM said. One policy includes issuing more short-term debt to pay companies owed money by the state, the economics chief of the one of the coalition parties, the far-right League, said on Friday. With the dollar’s surge back on though, and oil shares gleeful about its rapid rise, European shares were heading for an eighth straight week of gains despite the Italian turbulence. Slowing Japanese core consumer price growth that kept the Bank of Japan’s elusive 2 percent target well out of reach also kept the yen on the slide. It hit a four-month low of 111 per dollar. It helped the six-currency dollar index rise to a new five-month high of 93.63. The index has gained about 1 percent this week, buoyed by the surge in U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield scoring a seven-year peak of 3.128 percent. Euro traders meanwhile have nudged the shared currency back below $1.18. It has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week, largely pressured by the Italian uncertainty. It is also heading for its fifth successive weekly drop versus the dollar, which would be a first for the shared currency since 2015. “We don’t have an agreement on a (Italian) government at this point, but the market remains worried,” Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan said, also pointing to this week’s fall in the euro against the traditionally-safe Swiss franc. Elsewhere the two other macro spotlights were the hot oil markets after Brent crude broke up through $80 a barrel on Thursday, and the strain on emerging economy currencies. The Turkish lira was wobbling again having fallen to a record low this week, the Brazilian real plumbed a two-year low, while Mexico’s peso has shed more than 5 percent this month. That latter continues to be hit by negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which governs Mexico’s trade with the United States. “The NAFTA countries are nowhere near close to a deal,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement, pointing to “gaping differences” on a host of issues, including intellectual property, agricultural access, labor and energy. A retreat by Indonesia’s rupiah to a 2-1/2-year low prompted the central bank to tighten monetary policy on Thursday for the first time since 2014 to support the currency. It slipped again on Friday too. Overall for the big emerging market currencies it has been the worst week in 18 months. “Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the recent rupiah weakness has been the sheer speed in which the currency markets have turned against some emerging market countries,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “However, policy credibility is the most important tool and the fact that the Indonesian central bank has begun to tighten ought to alleviate some of the FX pressures.” In commodities, Brent crude oil futures were 47 cents higher at $79.76 a barrel after rising to $80.50 on Thursday, their highest since November 2014. Brent has risen 3 percent this week and is headed for a sixth week of gains. A rapid slide in oil supply from Venezuela, concern that U.S. sanctions will disrupt exports from Iran, and falling global inventories have all combined to push oil prices up nearly 20 percent in 2018. Gold meanwhile has had its worst week since early December, having dropped more than 2 percent.

2018-05-18,"COLOMBO, May 18 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan fuel retailer Lanka IOC will be forced to implement its own pricing mechanism to minimise losses if the government fails to implement its proposed fuel price formula, the company said on Friday. The move by Lanka IOC, a subsidiary of India’s IOC, comes after the government failed to increase fuel prices charged by state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) in line with rising global oil prices. On March 24 Lanka IOC raised its prices because of losses incurred after the government’s failure to implement a pricing formula for CPC. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera last week said that the cabinet has approved a price formula with revisions every two months. The government raised fuel prices last week after Lanka IOC raised its prices. “Cabinet approval is there, but the pricing of petroleum is a very touchy issue across the globe and the same is the case in Sri Lanka,” Lanka IOC’s Managing Director Shyam Bohra told Reuters. “If the proper pricing mechanism is in place, we will follow it. If it is not, then we will have to sell our products at the cost plus what ever actuals are there.” Lanka IOC posted a loss of 755.6 million rupees ($4.79 million) in the year to March 31, against a 3.07 billion rupee profit in the previous year, mainly because of high global oil prices in conjunction with low retail prices for fuel. “Most likely it will be that we will have to have our own prices ... We can’t keep on losing money,” Bohra added. President Maitripala Sirisena’s coalition government, which has pressed ahead with unpopular fiscal reforms since coming to power in 2015, has been hesitant to implement the fuel price formula before local elections. The coalition partners suffered a humiliating loss in local government polls in February. Bohra said the government has yet to inform the company about the new pricing formula and said it should also be transparent for the public. The government had agreed in principle with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirement to implement the pricing formula in return for a $1.5 billion three-year loan approved in 2016. The IMF on Thursday said that if the pricing formula is implemented properly, it “would eliminate fuel subsidies that benefit the rich rather than the poor”. “We think that an automatic fuel pricing mechanism marks a major step toward completing the energy pricing reforms that are under way in Sri Lanka, and minimises the fiscal risks,” said Gerry Rice of the IMF’s Communications Department.

2018-05-18,"(Updates with details, changed dateline, slug) By Danilo Masoni and Stephen Jewkes MILAN, May 18 (Reuters) - Italian utilities shares fell on Friday after the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far-right League published their joint government programme, promising a ramp up in spending and greater focus on green energy. State-controlled Enel was the major drag, as investors fretted the focus on renewables could dent power prices, while finding funds for broader policy needs could result in higher corporate tax or the sale of state holdings. “Utilities are under pressure and it’s clear that the creation of the new government is having a big impact,” said Enrico Vaccari, fund manager at Italy’s Consultinvest. The joint programme published on Friday spoke of the need to cut the use of carbon and fossil fuels and foster energy efficiency and greater electrification. It made no reference to specific policies on energy. Italy’s utilities index fell on Friday as much as 2 percent to its lowest level since end March. European utilities were little changed. The sector in Europe has been supported recently by a fall in government bond yields fuelled by expectations it would take longer for the European Central Bank to tighten monetary policy. Italian bond yields have been creeping upwards on growing concern Italy’s new government could relax fiscal discipline. Utilities are sensitive to the direction of bond yields due to their high debt and tendency to pay higher dividends compared to other sectors. On Friday, Goldman Sachs removed Enel from its “conviction list” of favourite stocks, citing the risk power bills could fall by around 15 percent due to higher green energy use. Shares in Enel, one of Europe’s most indebted utilities, fell by as much as 2.6 percent. Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM in Milan, said higher yields could help regulated companies like Terna and Snam. Their tariffs are partly based on bond yields. Renewable energy companies rose in early deals on Friday but later succumbed to the negative trend. Falck Renew, Alerion fell 3 and 1.2 percent respectively, while ERG edged up 0.2 percent. Enel also has big global renewable business. Consultinvest’s Vaccari said the decline could open up a buying opportunity. “Volatility is tied to uncertainty over future polices but I believe that it will settle down once the government sets in and policies become clearer,” he said.

2018-05-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley expects a flood of U.S. shale and the reopening of OPEC taps to cool the oil market after crude rose above $80 a barrel this week. U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to exit an international nuclear deal with Iran and revive sanctions on the OPEC member country, as well as Venezuela’s plummeting output, has helped to lift oil prices to their highest since 2014. But BP sees oil falling to between $50 and $65 a barrel due to surging shale output and OPEC’s capacity to boost production, Dudley told Reuters. “Clearly the withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has brought a lot of uncertainty to the market,” he said in an interview. Crude exports from Iran, the third-largest member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, could drop by 300,000 to 1 million barrels per day (bpd) as a result of U.S. sanctions, the CEO said, citing internal BP forecasts. Dudley said he expected the figure to be “at the lower end” of the range. The 30 percent recovery in crude prices since February has given strong tailwind to oil companies such as BP, whose profits recovered last year after a three-year slump in the market. The U.S. Energy Information Administration this month boosted its forecast of growth in domestic crude production in 2018 to an all-time high of 11.17 million bpd, as shale drillers accelerate activity. The surge in U.S. output has been offset by deep supply cuts for over a year by OPEC and other producers including Russia.  OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, assured key consumers that the world would have adequate supplies even if Iran’s exports dropped sharply. Markets have so far been able to absorb oil’s rise without impacting demand growth, but Dudley said a sustained crude price of over $80 would be unhealthy. “Two years ago, when the price was $27, it was great for global growth, the engines of the consuming economies, but it was terrible for producing countries and that led to producing countries not being able to purchase things as well. That was not a healthy price.”  “I think when you get above $80, it is not a healthy price either.” Although the International Energy Agency this week cut its outlook for oil demand growth in 2018 due to rising crude prices, BP still expects consumption to expand by 1.7 million bpd, extending a period of strong growth. The world has experienced an unprecedented decade of economic growth that is likely to continue even with sanctions and trade tensions between the United States and China, Dudley said. “We’re about to begin to see political factors creating trade dislocations, sanctions and things like that. They will have impacts here and there but the overall economic growth rates appear to be not overheated,” he said.

2018-05-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sixty global investors on Friday called on the oil and gas industry to do more to tackle climate change, ratcheting up pressure on company boards ahead of several high profile annual shareholder meetings. Companies needed to be more transparent about how they plan to change their operations as part of the global shift to a low-carbon economy, necessary to meet the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to keep global warming below 2 degrees. “As long-term investors, representing more than $10.4 trillion in assets, the case for action on climate change is clear,” the investors said in an open letter published in the Financial Times newspaper. “We are keenly aware of the importance of moving to a low-carbon future for the sustainability of the global economy and prosperity of our clients,” they said, adding related regulations would create additional costs to the industry. Among leading investors to sign the letter were Aberdeen Standard Investments, AXA Investment Managers, Fidelity International, Legal & General Investment Management, Schroders and Kames Capital.     The oil and gas industry and its products account for 50 percent of global carbon emissions, and so the most effective strategy for companies to take was to reduce the carbon impact of its products, the letter said. “The capital allocation decisions they make today are important to determine how likely they are to survive that transition,” it added. The issue has formed a central part of corporate engagement for many of the investors ahead of the season for annual general meetings.  BP holds its AGM on Monday, with fellow oil major Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday, at which shareholders are set to vote on whether the company should set firm carbon emissions targets linked to the Paris deal. “Regardless of the result at the Shell AGM, we strongly encourage all companies in this sector to clarify how they see their future in a low-carbon world.  “This should involve making concrete commitments to substantially reduce carbon emissions, assessing the impact of emissions from the use of their products and explaining how the investments they make are compatible with a pathway towards the Paris goal.” The letter also urged policymakers to take “clearer and more collective action” to implement regulation supporting investment in lower-carbon technologies and would talk with companies and maintain oversight of their actions. “The broad support for this letter sends one clear message- investors are embracing their responsibility for supporting the Paris agreement. It is time for the entire oil and gas industry to do the same,” a spokesman for Newton Investment Management, one of the signatories, told Reuters.

2018-05-18,"LAMAO, Philippines, May 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For Nestor Castro and the other residents of Lamao village, which sits near two coal-fired power plants and an oil refinery, the country’s shift to renewable energy cannot come soon enough. Not only would it lessen the pollution in their village in the northern Philippines, it could also mean cheaper electricity, Castro said. “Coal just adds to the pollution and we ... have expensive electricity,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the country’s first tax hike on coal in 30 years, introduced in March, may signal a shift in the government’s attitude towards the fossil fuel, environmentalists say. Today, the Philippines has some of the highest power generation charges in Southeast Asia according to the country’s energy agency. Renewable energy costs are falling around the globe, but the Philippines, up to now, has shown few signs of moving away from coal, despite ratifying the Paris Agreement to curb climate change and passing laws pushing for a shift to renewable energy. The 400 percent tax hike on imported coal - part of a wider package of tax reforms passed last year to help fund a major infrastructure project - could change that, environmental experts say. “Globally, coal is a sunset industry,” Antonio La Viña, a former environment undersecretary and veteran climate negotiator, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. “It is just being propped up by subsidies, and is the only reason it is cheap in the Philippines. The coal tax signals to investors that they should invest in other (energy) sources because coal is no longer the preferred energy source in the country,” he added. The Philippines imports 75 percent of its coal, mostly from Indonesia and Australia, according to the Philippines-based Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC). icsc.ngo/strandedcoal Some officials say coal is needed to power the nation’s growth, including the government’s centerpiece push to build new roads, airports and mass transit systems. “We need a continuous and stable supply of electricity, and coal is the most stable source of energy,” said Christine Danao, head of power, energy and electrification at the National Economic Development Authority. “In terms of fuel, coal is still the cheapest. In the long run, the government will see what (renewable energy) technology will bring,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the cost of electricity generated from solar and wind has plunged in recent years, and costs will be halved again by 2020 compared to 2017, according to predictions by the Abu Dhabi-based International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar Philippines, Southeast Asia’s largest solar company, is offering to produce solar electricity for about 6 cents a kilowatt-hour for Meralco - the largest electrical distributor in the country - and other electricity companies, said Koji Bulahan, a spokesman for Solar Philippines. That is about 40 percent less than Meralco charges on average for a kilowatt hour of power primarily generated from coal, according to the latest rates published on the company’s website. here A shift to renewable energy has been held back by the country’s major energy companies, said Glenis Balangue, a senior researcher at IBON Foundation, a think tank based in Quezon City. “If our power generation policy still favours corporations that are only interested in their bottom line, we can never truly push for renewable energy,” Balangue said. The high upfront costs of many forms of renewable energy - which require installation of expensive equipment, which then produces power at extremely low cost - can be a struggle for investors with short-term aims, or for risk-averse investors anxious about trying something new, experts say. International investors also have already poured billions of dollars into the Philippines' coal industry, helping it to thrive, climate activists said. here The Philippines government privatised the country’s power industry in 2001, saying the move would help bring more affordable and reliable electricity. Coal, seen as a cheaper alternative to oil at the time, became the country’s energy of choice. And because many coal plants have a lifespan of 30 years or more, investors in those plants are still demanding a payback on investment. The Philippines, however, still has plans for more than 10,000 MW of new coal power in the pipeline, worth $20.8 billion, according to a study published by the ICSC and the Institute for Energy Economics And Financial Analysis last year. here But international efforts to address climate change – including a potential flight of investor capital from dirtier fuels and the rise of ever-cheaper renewable alternatives – could mean that coal investment will not deliver the expected returns, the study noted. Worse, consumers may have to shoulder the losses from coal-fired power plants, the institute noted. In Mindanao, in the southern Philippines, for example, power producers lost about $60 million between 2014 and 2016 because of an excess capacity of coal and hydropower, according to ICSC. Gerry Arances, head of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development, a Manila-based think tank, said it was clear the government had not promoted “a level playing field for all kinds of energy sources, particularly on renewable energy”. “We are locked into a coal-based energy system that is more expensive than solar,” Arances added. Villagers like Castro say they cannot afford to put up their own solar panels, so they remain reliant on the main power grid for electricity. Frederick Epistola, a retail seller of solar panels, said there is not much demand for solar panels among homeowners. “The market is curious about shifting to solar power but they don’t want to shell out the capital expenses required to put up solar panels in their residences. It can still be expensive for the typical household,” he said. $1 = 52.2306 Philippine pesos

2018-05-18,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Stephanie Kelly and Tom Polansek NEW YORK/CHICAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - Farmers worldwide are feeling the pinch as fuel costs rise to near four-year highs just as they plant and harvest their fields, eroding agricultural income already hamstrung by depressed crop prices. The agricultural sector from the United States to Russia, and Brazil to Europe, is seeing profits harmed by the rise in diesel prices. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, touched $80 a barrel for the first time since late 2014 on Thursday. Coupled with local economic issues, the increase is making it even harder for many farmers worldwide to turn a profit in the estimated $2.4 trillion agriculture industry, casting a cloud over future investments. In the United States, fuel accounts for about five percent of farmers’ overall costs, and is hurting margins at a time when farm income is already half that of 2013. Massive harvests have depressed prices of staples such as corn, wheat and soybeans. Diesel fuel is essential for planting, harvesting, and shipping crops to market. In the United States, farmers will spend an estimated $15.25 billion on fuel and oil in 2018, an 8 percent increase from 2017, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. The price of ultra-low sulfur diesel used for farming equipment and transporting crops has not been this high in May since 2014. Heating oil futures, the proxy for ultra-low sulfur diesel, traded at $2.29 a gallon on Thursday. Ron Heck, who grows soybeans in Perry, Iowa, said his fuel costs could go up $1,000 to $2,000 during the northern hemisphere’s spring. “You feel the pain right away,” Heck said. In Russia, fuel prices for farmers are up 50 percent compared with a year ago, Arkady Zlochevsky, the head of Russia’s Grain Union, a non-governmental farm lobby, told Reuters. Farmers will need to spend more ahead of harvesting, which starts in about a month in Russia, he said. U.S. farms are also factoring in potential losses of income due to a 25 percent tax China announced on major American imports following the U.S. government’s decision to slap duties on steel and aluminum. “We’re seeing financial stress occurring in agriculture that we probably haven’t seen for a decade or so,” said Scott Brown, director of strategic partnerships at the University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. “If diesel prices continue to go higher, it continues to put more pressure on.” Net farm income is forecast to fall to $59.5 billion in 2018, an 8.3 percent decline from 2017, according to the USDA. It has fallen by 55 percent since 2013. In Holly Grove, Arkansas, Tim Gannon paid about $17,000 in February to fill a 7,500-gallon tank with diesel used to run equipment and irrigation. The price increase means it may cost up to 25 percent more, or an extra $4,000, to refill it in coming weeks, he said. “That’s a fairly significant amount of income to lose,” he said. Gannon has been taking steps to cut his diesel costs over the past year by reducing the number of times he plows, or tills. In Brazil, farmers are also taking steps to deal with higher costs, as diesel prices have climbed 43 percent in the country since July 2017. Eder Ferreira Bueno, a farmer in grain state Mato Grosso, said increased fuel costs meant he had “no other option but to spend less to treat the soil.” Other farmers might hire fewer workers or delay investment plans, he added. In neighboring Argentina, the top shipper of soybean meal and oil worldwide, farmers are having to deal with a weakening currency at the same time fuel costs are rising. “Where the impact is felt greatest is in trucking costs. We are already at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors on freight costs within Argentina,” said David Hughes, a farmer in Buenos Aires province and president of Argentine wheat industry chamber Argentrigo. In Europe, French grain producers say rising oil costs may have a knock-on effect on fertilizers and crop protection products. “It comes at a time when things are already difficult for farmers economically,” said Philippe Pinta, head of grain growers group AGPB in Paris. Wamego, Kansas, farmer Glenn Brunkow said he may lock in diesel prices in advance for the first time ever next year, to avoid the pain of future increases. “You just kind of all of a sudden realize, ‘Wow, it’s pretty high,’” he said.

2018-05-18,"(Adds additional detail on payment methods) By Zoe Tabary LONDON, May 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Moldova, a small, landlocked country in eastern Europe, imports three-quarters of its energy and has seen its energy prices rise by more than half in the past five years. But that could soon change, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which this year will launch an innovative effort to power a Moldovan university with cryptocurrency-funded solar energy. The initiative with Sun Exchange, a South African solar power marketplace, will allow people to buy solar cells using SolarCoin, a cryptocurrency launched by blockchain start-up ElectriCChain, and then lease them to the Technical University of Moldova, one of the country’s largest universities. Buyers also can pay for the solar cells using euros or bitcoin, Sun Exchange officials said. The idea is to find new sources of finance to “help buildings go green overnight” - in this instance with rooftop solar panels, said Dumitru Vasilescu, a programme manager with UNDP in Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries. “One of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is a lack of finance, as you often have to wait 10 to 15 years before you get a return on your investment,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the university will get a full 1 megawatt of energy installed in the summer, he said, as a result of the crowd-funding effort. Owners of the solar cells, in turn, will receive SolarCoins as soon as the university produces energy, earning interest of about 4 percent on their investment, Vasilescu added. Moldova currently has over 10,000 square metres of unused rooftop space on public buildings that could be potentially used for such efforts, he said. Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralised authority. It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions without the need for middlemen. Research firm IDC estimates global investment in blockchain will more than double in 2018 to $2.1 billion from $945 million last year, most of it for banking. IDC expects “strong, double-digit growth” in the energy space between 2016 and 2021. Kevin Treco, an associate director at the Carbon Trust, an environmental consultancy, said blockchain-based technologies could significantly change energy use in countries striving to decentralise power and boost renewable sources. In Moldova, for example, cryptocurrency-funded renewable energy could reduce the country’s dependence on energy imports such as oil and gas from Russia, Vasilescu said. Darius Nassiry, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute, a British think tank, predicted that most of the growth in cryptocurrency-funded energy would occur in the developing world. “They have faster-growing energy needs… and a more accommodating legal and regulatory environment towards such innovations,” he said by email. But a lack of understanding on how blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies work could slow their take-up in the energy sector, he added. For Abraham Cambridge, the founder and CEO of Sun Exchange, the solar currency exchange system “has all the right incentives in place”. “It reduces the costs of going solar dramatically for the end user and makes it easy for anyone in the world to own a solar cell anywhere in the world and, from it, make a steady source of sunlight-powered income,” he said in a statement. Blockchain is also being used in the energy sector to facilitate carbon trading, with U.S. computing giant IBM announcing this week that it will partner with Veridium Labs, an environmental tech start-up, to turn carbon credits into digital tokens. If the Moldovan solar currency pilot is successful, UNDP plans to replicate it in neighbouring countries, said Vasilescu, adding that it could ""revolutionise the renewable energy market for Eastern Europe and Central Asia"".

2018-05-18,"(Corrects spelling to linchpin in paragraph six) By Tom Finn LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - From global finance and merchandise trade to investment, the dollar’s supremacy in the world economy is being underscored by the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran and all those doing business with it. President Donald Trump this month pulled out of a nuclear accord with Iran, sparking consternation among European companies which now risk punitive U.S. measures if they continue business dealings with Tehran.. Oil firm Total, insurer Allianz and shipping company Maersk are among European names signalling an exit from Iran. European leaders are meeting in Bulgaria to try to salvage the Iran deal but many remain frank about the prospects for operating beyond the reach of U.S. law. British foreign minister Boris Johnson, for instance, said governments had to be realistic about “the electrified rail, the live wire of American extra-territoriality and how (it) can serve as a deterrent to business”. The linchpin of U.S. financial might is of course the dollar, which pervades nearly all aspects of global commerce. “No company or bank is going to go deal with Iran knowing they will face U.S. sanctions,” said Peter Kinsella, head of FX and debt strategy at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “The U.S. would cut off your dollar funding and that would be a nightmare as the U.S. has the deepest and more liquid currency,” he said. The dollar has defied years of efforts by foreign governments to end their reliance on it. This is what may complicate international efforts to preserve Iranian business links. Here are four of the key ways in which the dollar is used in the global economy: Over 60 percent of the world’s $11 trillion currency reserves — used by governments to settle international claims and intervene in foreign exchange markets — are held in dollars. The greenback’s share amounts to $6.3 trillion, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in March, with the euro, the next largest, totalling $1.6 trillion or 20 percent. True, the dollar’s share was at a four-year low after a prolonged weak spell that bred concern about its standing as the premier reserve currency. Yet years of hype about the Chinese yuan’s growing popularity among central banks has not translated into its share in global reserves amounting to much more than 1 percent, the IMF said. Dollar reserves are held largely in U.S. Treasury bonds, and while data shows foreign creditors cooling on U.S. debt, big reserve managers in Beijing, Tokyo or Seoul have few viable alternatives to the immensely large and liquid $21 trillion Treasury market. INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS, INVOICING The dollar remains the dominant vehicle for foreign exchange transactions, being on one side of 88 percent of all trades in 2016, according to The Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Contributing to its role in foreign exchange transactions is its widespread use in the invoicing of international trade. In 2014, 51.9 percent of international trade by value and 49.4 percent of international trade by volume of transactions were invoiced in U.S. dollars, even when a U.S. counterparty was not part of the transaction, the BIS said. European Union statistics office Eurostat said over half of all goods imports were invoiced in dollars in 2016, as was 85.5 percent of petroleum and petroleum products. The euro share was 13.7 percent. As a result, BIS data shows that in 2016 the dollar comprised 90 percent of the $3 trillion-a-day market for FX swaps and forwards, derivatives used by companies to hedge currency risks. “It’s very hard to escape the interaction with the U.S. financial sector,” said Claire Dissaux, head of global economics and strategy at Millennium Global Investments. “If you are a French carmaker you would have dealings with U.S. banks and dollar funding.” In 2015, a U.S. court fined BNP Paribas $8.9 billion for moving money through the U.S. financial system for Sudanese, Iranian and Cuban entities subject to U.S. sanctions. Internationally traded commodities such as oil and gold are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, as are benchmark futures such as Brent crude oil. Analysts estimate over 80 percent of traded oil is priced in the greenback. China, pushing to denominate imports in other currencies, has launched yuan crude futures which could eventually become a global price benchmark alongside Brent and WTI crude. But a pre-requisite would be liberalising China’s capital account to allow free movement of money. Gulf oil producers peg their currencies to the dollar and would face foreign exchange risks by invoicing sales in other currencies. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, $13.950 trillion, or close to half, of all cross-border claims were denominated in U.S. dollars, Eurostat said. The United States is the biggest recipient and source of foreign direct investment (FDI), with inflow and outflow of $391 billion and $300 billion respectively in 2016, United Nations data shows. U.S.-based investors accounted for more than a quarter of flows to emerging market debt, 42 percent to emerging equities and a tenth of all FDI to the developing world, according to the Institute of International Finance.

2018-05-18,"(Reuters) - Ophir Energy (OPHR.L) is replacing CEO Nicholas Cooper with immediate effect, the company announced on Friday, amid delays in funding a major gas project in Equatorial Guinea that have slashed its share value in the past year. Alan Booth, currently a non-executive director, has been named interim CEO and executive director, Ophir said. The company is looking “to rebalance its portfolio towards a larger production and cash flow base, to support more focussed and sustainable exploration activity,” the board said in a statement. Cooper served as chief executive for almost seven years. He led the company’s IPO in 2011, its sale of part of its interest in Tanzania in 2013 and its acquisition of Salamander in 2015. Most recently, Cooper initiated a proposed acquisition of Santos Ltd’s (STO.AX) Southeast Asian assets.  However, the company has struggled to secure $1.2 billion (889 million pounds) in bank loans needed to fund the Fortuna deepwater liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Equatorial Guinea, forcing it to push back first production to 2022. This week, Equatorial Guinea’s energy minister told Reuters that Ophir would be forced out of the project unless loan deals were presented to the government by December. Gabriel Obiang Lima said the country had already lined up a potential replacement. Ophir’s board said it would continue to focus on realising value for shareholders from the Fortuna project and work with Equatorial Guinea on achieving that.  However, Morgan Stanley analyst Sasikanth Chilukuru said in a note that Cooper’s departure “adds more uncertainty to the investment thesis, one that is dominated by the Fortuna FLNG project”.  Ophir shares fell as much as 8 percent of Friday and stood down 3.2 percent at 63.70 pounds at 1014 GMT.  The stock is down 33 percent in the past year, losing out on gains enjoyed by peers courtesy of a rise in energy prices including Brent crude oil LCOc1 and spot LNG LNG-AS .

2018-05-18,"* Multiple U.S. corn cargoes cancelled after trade spat escalated * More cargo washouts possible as trade tensions linger By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - China’s purchases of U.S. corn have slowed significantly due to worries the grain might be drawn into the trade spat between the world’s two largest economies, and as Chinese customs keeps the brakes on clearances for cargoes, four traders told Reuters. Chinese buyers have cancelled multiple cargoes of corn so far this year, the latest product roiled by the China-U.S. trade tensions, traders and industry sources said. Now some traders say they have halted buying from the United States completely despite signs some of the trade tensions may be starting to ease. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He met officials this week in Washington for talks aimed at resolving the tensions, and Beijing announced on Friday it was dropping its probe into U.S. sorghum imports. The waning appetite from one of the world’s top consumers of corn will unnerve U.S. farmers, who have been hit hard by the prolonged trade spat between Washington and Beijing. Some Chinese corn buyers switched to rival supplier Ukraine earlier this year, as Beijing tightened controls on processing genetically modified strains of the crop. Corn from the United States is mostly genetically modified. “I have washed out more than 20,000 tonnes of U.S. corn in the recent couple of months because getting a GMO processing certificate has still been impossible, and the situation is very unclear with the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war,” said a trader based in southern China. The Ministry of Agriculture, the General Administration of Customs, and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. pork, apples, logs and Ford Motor Co vehicles are still being held up at Chinese ports as customs increased scrutiny of goods shipped from China’s top trading partner. The United States was the second-largest exporter of corn behind Ukraine into China last year, shipping in just over 750,000 tonnes worth about $180 million. Shipments have been noticeably slower this year. “There haven’t been many offers of U.S. corn in the market. Few buyers would consider buying from America, as there is a risk,” said Cherry Zhang, an analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence. Another trader who cancelled over 10,000 tonnes of U.S. corn in February and bought from Ukraine instead, has stayed away from shipments from the United States since. “You just can’t get the GMO processing permit. There might be some political calculations, given the Sino-U.S. trade tension,” the trader said. U.S. President Donald Trump proposed 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese products in early April, and China shot back a list of similar duties on major American imports, including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. “Soon after America proposed 25-percent tariffs on some Chinese products, many of our clients washed out their (corn) cargoes,” said a source at an international trading house. “We are not trading U.S. corn now. No one is willing to take the risk,” the source said. China’s purchases of U.S. soybeans have also come to a grinding halt, as fears grow that Beijing will take further action to curb imports of U.S. crops.

2018-05-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pumped $11.9 billion into global equities in the past week and also put money into bank loans, likely viewing the rise in U.S. bond yields as reflecting a robustly growing economy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. The bank’s data, which tracks fund flows from Wednesday to Wednesday, also showed some relatively small $400 million inflows into emerging stocks which have taken a hit from the U.S. Treasury selloff and the dollar’s rise but tend to benefit from an improving U.S. economy. “The rise in 10-year U.S. yields from 2 percent to 3 percent over the past 18 months is a “good” rise in yields but if more than 3 percent (is considered) a “bad” rise... this should be revealed in coming weeks by further outflows from financials, emerging markets, credit as well as rising private client cash levels,” BAML told clients in a note. A “good” yield rise would indicate faith in economic growth while a “bad” rise on the other hand could reflect the view that inflation is gaining the upper hand. The bank said its private clients’ cash allocations currently stood at 9.8 percent of assets under management, a record low, testifying to their appetite for risk. Within equities, U.S. funds took in $8.8 billion and Japanese stocks took in a modest $700 million but Europe posted its 10th straight week of losses, losing $800 million. European shares have suffered as economic data has underwhelmed, indicating a growth slowdown even as U.S. companies have benefited from swinging tax cuts that boosted their bottom line at least in the first quarter. Another indication of growth optimism was large inflows into pharmaceutical and technology stocks which took in $700 million and $500 million respectively, BAML said, adding “Investors show preference for growth over value”. The data also showed $900 million inflow into bank loans, which BAML attributed to the fact that markets are now pricing in a roughly 40 percent probability of three more U.S. Federal Reserve rate rises this year, instead of two. Banks tend to benefit as interest rates rise. Bond funds absorbed $3.4 billion. However, emerging debt recorded its fourth straight week of outflow, shedding $1.3 billion. Junk-rated bonds, also considered vulnerable to higher U.S. borrowing costs, also saw a second week of outflows. BAML said, however, there were signs the Treasury yield rise could be approaching its end, noting $400 million in redemptions from financials stocks, bring three-week losses to $1.6 billion. “This is important as the reversal in flows to financials funds preceded the peak in bond yields in both 2013 and 2017,” the bank added.

Traders were wondering if it would all flare up again with Italian politics unsettled, the United States and China locked in trade talks and Donald Trump’s decision to dump the Iran nuclear deal still causing fallout. European stocks were 0.3 percent lower, but with the euro near a 5-month low following the dollar’s surge and oil shares gleeful about its rapid rise, the region was heading for an eighth straight week of gains. Slowing Japanese core consumer price growth that kept the Bank of Japan’s elusive 2 percent target well out of reach saw the dollar hit a four-month high of 111 yen though it stalled had elsewhere. Italian government bonds continued their struggles too. They have seen their biggest sell-off in over a year this week over plans being floated by a proposed new anti-establishment coalition government. One policy includes issuing more short-term debt to pay companies owed money by the state, the economics chief of the one of the coalition parties, the far-right League, said on Friday. “We don’t have an agreement on a government at this point, but the market remains worried,” Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan said, pointing to this week’s fall in euro against the traditionally-safe Swiss franc. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies steadied at 93.471 having risen to a five-month peak of 93.632. The index has gained about 1 percent this week, buoyed by the surge in U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield scoring a seven-year peak of 3.128 percent. Euro traders nudged the shared currency back above $1.1805 , but it has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week, largely pressured by the Italian uncertainty. It is also heading for its fifth successive weekly drop versus the dollar, which would be a first for the shared currency since 2015. Elsewhere the two other macro spotlights were the hot oil markets after Brent crude broke up through $80 a barrel on Thursday, and the strain on emerging economy currencies. The Turkish lira was holding up a bit better having fallen to a record low this week, the Brazilian real plumbed a two-year low, while Mexico’s peso has shed more than 5 percent this month. That latter continues to hit by negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which governs Mexico’s trade with the United States. “The NAFTA countries are nowhere near close to a deal,” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement, pointing to “gaping differences” on a host of issues, including intellectual property, agricultural access, labor and energy. A retreat by Indonesia’s rupiah to a 2-1/2-year low prompted the central bank to tighten monetary policy on Thursday for the first time since 2014 to support the currency. It slipped again on Friday. “Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the recent rupiah weakness has been the sheer speed in which the currency markets have turned against some emerging market countries,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “However, policy credibility is the most important tool and the fact that the Indonesian central bank has begun to tighten ought to alleviate some of the FX pressures.” In commodities, Brent crude oil futures were 16 cents higher at $79.46 a barrel after rising to $80.50 on Thursday, their highest since November 2014. Brent has risen 3 percent this week and is headed for a sixth week of gains. A rapid slide in oil supply from Venezuela, concern that U.S. sanctions will disrupt exports from Iran, and falling global inventories have all combined to push oil prices up nearly 20 percent in 2018. Gold meanwhile has had its worst week since early December, having dropped more than 2 percent.

2018-05-18,"(Adds details, quotes, context) MOSCOW, May 18 (Reuters) - TMK, Russia’s largest maker of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, reported an 80 percent fall in first-quarter net profit on Friday, distorted by a decline in foreign exchange gains compared to a year ago. TMK’s top line increased on the back of strong demand in the Russian market, the company, which is controlled by Russian businessman Dmitry Pumpyansky, said in a statement. First-quarter net profit fell to $8 million, but earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to $160 million from $142 million a year ago. TMK said it still expected its 2018 adjusted EBITDA margin to be broadly flat compared to 2017, while overall adjusted EBITDA would rise, but it did not say by how much. In February, TMK’s U.S. subsidiary, IPSCO Tubulars, halted an initial public offering of its shares in New York, when a global sell-off in equities gripped global markets. On Friday, TMK made no mention of whether IPSCO would revive its share sale plan. It said that first quarter EBITDA of its U.S. division totalled $26 million, up from $9 million a year ago but down from $39 million in the last quarter of 2017 due to an increase in raw materials prices and lower sales prices.

2018-05-18,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Friday it is consulting other oil producers in and outside OPEC to ensure the world has adequate supplies to support economic growth after prices hit $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. OPEC’s most influential energy minister, Saudi Arabia’s Khalid al-Falih, said in a Twitter post that he had called his counterparts in the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Russia, as well as major oil consumer South Korea, to “coordinate global action to ease global market anxiety”. Falih also said he had reassured the executive director of  the International Energy Agency of “commitment to the stability of oil markets and the global economy” and that he would contact others over the next few days. On Thursday, Falih called Indian Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan to assure him that supporting global economic growth was “one of the kingdom’s key goals”, the Saudi government said in a statement, after India expressed frustration with the recent surge in oil prices. Oil prices held firm on Friday, with Brent crude LCOc1 trading at around $79.70 per barrel after the international benchmark broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014 the previous day.         The Saudi Energy Ministry said on Thursday that the kingdom together with other producers would ensure the availability of adequate supplies to offset any potential shortfalls.     India’s Pradhan had expressed concern about the negative impact of escalating prices on consumers and especially the Indian economy, the world’s third-largest oil consumer. India is one of the world’s fastest-growing energy consumers and its oil use lags only that of the United States and China. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its ally Russia have cut their output since January 2017 to help reduce excessive global stockpiles. So far, OPEC has said it sees no need to ease output restrictions despite a fall in global stocks to the group’s desired levels and concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could lead to demand destruction. OPEC member the UAE said on Thursday OPEC had bigger issues to consider than the impact of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with oil producer Iran, such as Venezuela’s collapsing oil output. U.S. President Donald Trump has also called on OPEC to help cool oil prices, saying they were artificially high.

2018-05-18,"* Natural gas consumption rises 14 pct on yr in Jan-April * Curbs on gas feeds catch industrial users by surprise * State gas producers suffer losses in gas import businesses By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, May 18 (Reuters) - PetroChina, the country’s top gas producer, has curbed supplies of the fuel to some industrial users in northern and western regions, in the first sign of emerging tightness only two months after China experienced one of its worst winter gas crunches. To prevent another around of winter shortages, state-run PetroChina started from early May limiting gas supplies and hiking prices for major customers, including city gas distributors and inland gas liquefaction plants in some western provinces, four sources briefed on the matter said. They declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. “Suppliers are managing the increases in demand, so that they won’t be caught up in a serious supply crunch later in the year,” said Chen Zhu, managing director of consultancy SIA Energy. China’s natural gas consumption rose almost 14 percent in the first four months of the year to 71.1 million tonnes, according to Reuters calculations based on official data. That led to a surge in spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in recent weeks and has lifted prices to a two-month high of $8.7 per million British thermal unit LNG-AS. The expansion in demand, driven by an extension of Beijing’s gasification drive and an improving economy, exceeds a 10-percent annual growth forecast by state energy giant CNPC early this year. PetroChina did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The firm raised feed prices to 1.78 yuan ($0.2795) per cubic metre up from 1.68 yuan per cubic metre for big users in the western part of Inner Mongolia from May 11, a document reviewed by Reuters showed. It also halved the gas feed to Erdos Hong Ji Yi Tai Energy Co Ltd, a gas liquefaction plant based in Inner Mongolia, starting this week, an official from the plant said. “We were caught by surprise,” the official said. “This is the first time PetroChina has reduced our supplies ahead of summer. The price hike once again will dampen our margin.” He requested anonymity because he is not allowed to speak with media. Wang Haohao, an analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group, said the price hike and supply curb will likely hit all LNG plants in the Inner Mongolia region and neighbouring Shaanxi province. China operates more than 100 small inland LNG plants that source gas from state producers PetroChina and Sinopec and supply super-chilled fuel to steel mills, glass makers and residential compounds, users that are not covered by the pipeline grid. In another sign of supply curbs, PetroChina wanted to cap volumes supplied this year to the Inner Mongolia regional government at 2016 consumption levels, a government official told Reuters. “The negotiation reached a deadlock as we asked for more supplies for this year,” said the official. “The company is only willing to offer us the same amount they supplied in 2016, which is not enough. We cannot accept it” The official said a sweeping campaign to switch industries and household from coal to gas has led to a surge in the region’s demand for the fuel. In a broader attempt to avoid a winter squeeze, the state planner has asked national gas producers to sign annual supply contracts with major users by the end of April. State producers, however, are suffering ongoing losses in their import business of long-term oil-indexed LNG contracts as global oil hit multi-year highs of $80, while China’s domestic benchmark city-gate gas prices remained unchanged since last August, said SIA’s Chen. In debut trading at Chongqing Oil and Gas Exchange, PetroChina sold about 35 million cubic metres of piped gas at 0.155 yuan per cubic metre over government-set city-gate rates, or about a 10-percent premium, reflecting a tight market in a traditionally low season. $1 = 6.3684 Chinese yuan renminbi

2018-05-18,"(Repeats to additional codes. No changes to text) BERLIN, May 18 (Reuters) - A close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a stark warning to the United States about the risks of placing “America First”, accusing Washington of seeking to block a planned Russia-Germany gas pipeline to shore up its own exports. Economy minister Peter Altmaier defended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is strongly opposed by many East European countries as well as the U.S., who say that by circumventing Ukraine the pipeline will increase Russia’s leverage over countries that rely on Moscow’s energy sales. Ahead of a summit due later on Friday between Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Altmaier said the European Union should guarantee that Ukraine will continue to receive gas transit fees, even after the pipeline is built under the Baltic. But he accused Washington of wanting to block the pipeline, built by Russia’s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom and a consortium of European energy companies, in order to boost its own shale gas exports. “They are looking for markets, which we can understand, and they can land it here easily,” he said. “But it is much more expensive than pipeline gas, so blocking Nord Stream 2 on its own won’t guarantee exports.” He added that Europe would respond firmly to U.S. attempts to place its own economic interests before those of partners. “The U.S. are our friends and partners, and we want to defend our common values. “But if it’s America first, and they put their economic interest before others, then they have to expect Europe to define their own interests and fight for them.” (Reporting by Thomas Escritt Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-russia-pipeline/rpt-update-1-u-s-driven-by-self-interest-in-wanting-to-block-russia-pipeline-german-minister-idUKL5N1SP1JX,18 May 2018,"A close ally of German Chancellor

2018-05-18,"(Reuters) - Oilfield service firm Petrofac Ltd (PFC.L), which is being investigated by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), said it was awarded more than $1.7 billion (1.3 billion pounds) of new orders so far this year as tendering activity remained high. Oilfield service companies have been seeing a recovery in orders after subdued oil prices since mid-2014 forced explorers and producers to cut capital expenditure and defer or cancel contracts. The company also said on Friday it was making good progress in 2018, delivering its strategy of focusing on its core, delivering organic growth and reducing capital intensity. Petrofac said in late June last year that order intake had reached $1.7 billion. The company reported better-than-expected core earnings in March and said Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari would resume full duties with immediate effect after it concluded that restrictions imposed on Asfari in May 2017 were no longer appropriate. The SFO began an investigation in May 2017 into the activities of Petrofac and its units in connection with a probe into Monaco-based Unaoil on suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering. The company said in February its top management, including chairman and executive directors, would be interviewed by the SFO. Petrofac shares, which have fallen more than 23 percent since the SFO investigation was disclosed, rose as much as 1.7 percent in early trading.

2018-05-18,"* Cabin upgrades will cost more than $74.5 mln * In-flight entertainment, new seats to be installed from 2020 * SilkAir’s operating profit fell 57 pct in FY18 (Adds CEO, CFO and analyst comment) By Jamie Freed SINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd plans to absorb its underperforming regional arm SilkAir after 2020 when a programme to upgrade cabins at a cost of more than S$100 million ($74.5 million) gets underway. The move comes as Singapore Airlines undertakes a three-year transformation programme designed to cut costs and boost revenue amid competition from Chinese and Middle Eastern rivals and low-cost carriers. Singapore Airlines topped market expectations by reporting on Thursday a 148 percent rise in full-year net profit to the highest level since 2011, as passenger and cargo revenue rose and the transformation programme produced early results. But SilkAir was a weak spot, reporting a full-year operating profit of S$43 million for the 12 months ended March 31, down 57 percent from a year earlier. Average fare prices at SilkAir, which is wholly owned by Singapore Airlines, have been falling as it competes against lower-cost rivals such as AirAsia Group Bhd on short flights to destinations like Kuala Lumpur and Bali. “That is not to say there is no place for SilkAir,” Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong told media and analysts at a post-results briefing on Friday. “In fact there is still a lot of demand for SilkAir type of service specifically on the bigger destinations, bigger cities in Southeast Asia.” More than 60 percent of SilkAir’s traffic connects through the Singapore hub, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Barnes said after the briefing, including to Europe and North America where the Singapore Airlines brand is better known. The cabin upgrade will include the installation of seatback in-flight entertainment in all seats and lie-flat seats in business class on SilkAir’s all-narrowbody fleet. Through the upgrade, Singapore Airlines seeks to close a gap with rival Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, whose regional arm, Cathay Dragon, operates jets with cabins more similar to its parent than the wider gulf between Singapore Airlines and SilkAir products. “Upgrading the narrowbody product and folding SilkAir into Singapore Airlines is sensible and was inevitable,” CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. “The product gap between SilkAir and Singapore Airlines has become too wide.” The upgrade would start in 2020 due to the lead times required by seat suppliers, Singapore Airlines said. The merger would take place after a sufficient number of jets had the new product. As part of its transformation programme, Singapore Airlines had already handed some of SilkAir’s routes to the group’s budget carrier Scoot and merged part of SilkAir’s finance team with its parent. Singapore Airlines shares were trading 1.9 percent higher at on Friday afternoon, while the broader Singapore market was down 0.2 percent.

2018-05-18,"BARCELONA, May 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies and governments are transforming the way they provide energy to families forced to flee their homes around the world - from setting up solar power plants at camps for Syrians in Jordan, to funding a small solar panel for a Malian refugee to run a fridge for her water shop in Burkina Faso. Energy has always been needed in the camps and informal settlements home to tens of millions of people uprooted by conflicts or natural disasters. But it has largely been in the form of polluting diesel generators, fossil fuels for trucks to move relief supplies, or locally harvested firewood for cooking. That is changing, with U.N. agencies, aid groups, major refugee-hosting countries and businesses preparing in July to sign up to a global action plan to provide all displaced people with access to sustainable energy by 2030, in line with U.N. development goals. “People are beginning to realise that this is an important issue, and something that deserves priority, resources and attention,” said Owen Grafham from the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI), a partnership managed by London-based think tank Chatham House, which is working on the action plan. In camps, about 90 percent of people lack electricity, while 80 percent rely on firewood and other solid fuels to cook, which are harmful to their health and local forests, according to MEI. Electric power has not been regarded as a human “right” in emergency situations, unlike shelter, water, food or healthcare, said Andrew Harper of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR). “Energy is really not something that is fully taken into account,” he said. But it is “the key to empowering refugees and displaced persons”, added the UNHCR’s director of programme support and former representative in Jordan. In 2012 when Jordan’s Za’atari camp opened - home at one point to as many as 130,000 Syrian refugees - Friday prayers would be followed by “a riot”, with frustrated, anxious residents destroying things and throwing stones, Harper said. But once UNHCR began spending up to $450,000 each month on electricity supplied to the camp via a grid connection, refugees used it to set up some 3,000 shops and businesses, and the rampages stopped as their sense of dignity grew, he said. “They started feeling possessive, protective, engaged in the stability of the camp,” he added. Since last year, two of Jordan’s main refugee camps have used power produced by their own solar plants - one in Za’atari funded by German development bank KfW and the other in Azraq backed by the IKEA Foundation - that can also feed back surplus electricity into the national grid. Sarah Rosenberg-Jansen, head of humanitarian energy at UK-based charity Practical Action, said Jordan’s government takes the wider view that getting camps connected will improve the country’s infrastructure and support national development. “They see it as an opportunity, and as a way to change perceptions in host communities that this is good for both of us - not just for refugees,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Practical Action is embarking on a project in the north Jordan city of Irbid, also funded by the IKEA Foundation, that will assist landlords renting properties to vulnerable refugee families to install rooftop solar systems for heating water. The development charity will also work with UNHCR and other partners in Rwanda to set up solar micro-grids and home systems to power schools, clinics, street lighting and home appliances in three camps hosting Congolese refugees, offering an alternative to candles and kerosene. It will also look at ways to provide more sustainable fuel and efficient stoves for cooking. Government officials and others at a meeting on Wednesday in Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, about the “Renewable Energy for Refugees” project emphasised the need to move away from the environmentally harmful use of firewood, co-host MEI said. Energy underpins many things displaced people need to do in their daily lives, said Rosenberg-Jansen - from charging mobile phones used to contact relatives and transfer money, to washing clothes, lighting, entertainment and moving around. But the answer is not to distribute energy for free, she added. “There is already a market there (in camps),” with households spending a relatively high proportion of their disposable income on energy, she noted. Handouts risk destroying that market, and making people worse off by giving them products they do not want, she said. The challenge is to supply cleaner power and cooking methods for a lower price, Rosenberg-Jansen and other experts said. The forthcoming global action plan will include targets and concrete ways of reaching them, those drafting it said. Practical Action’s Rosenberg-Jansen hopes that in five years, aid workers will factor in the provision of clean energy from the outset of an emergency and include it in funding plans. Doing so would also bring significant cost savings for agencies that spend millions of dollars each year on power from unreliable diesel generators that often break down, cutting off the health clinics and other services they run, she added. UNHCR’s Harper said aid organisations needed to collaborate with business, governments and development banks to overcome barriers to building and operating clean energy services for refugees and displaced people. Problems include high upfront costs, onerous bureaucracy and restrictive regulations. In Za’atari, for example, UNHCR found refugees were willing to buy electricity but the agency had no mechanism to receive payment. A new partnership called the Smart Communities Coalition, co-chaired by credit card giant Mastercard and the U.S. government’s “Power Africa” programme, will attempt to resolve such issues by putting in place digital infrastructure in refugee camps and settlements, starting later this year in Kenya and Uganda. The aim is for governments, aid agencies and companies to develop a model to provide refugees with internet and mobile connectivity, digital financial tools and access to low-cost clean energy. That will require fresh thinking on all sides, said Tara Nathan, who leads on public-private partnerships for Mastercard, which will offer its expertise in digital payments. ""The money, the capacities exist - it's about... finding a way for everyone to act like grown-ups and intervene together,"" she said on the sidelines of a conference on energy access in Lisbon this month.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open mixed, with Britain’s FTSE dipping 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX rising 0.13 percent and France’s CAC little changed. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed. The index was headed for a 1 percent loss this week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.17 percent and Shanghai climbed 0.3 percent as some investors bet Beijing and Washington will reach a deal in the latest round of trade talks. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.35 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.3 percent and Australian stocks dipped 0.2 percent. Wall Street ended slightly lower on Thursday as investors grappled with U.S.-China trade tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump said that China “has become very spoiled on trade”. But helping ease some of the tension, Beijing has offered Trump a package of proposed purchases of American goods and other measures aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China by some $200 billion a year, U.S. officials familiar with the proposal said. A second round of talks between senior Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts started on Thursday, focused on cutting China’s U.S. trade surplus and improving intellectual property protections. “President Trump does not do the actual trade negotiations, which are done by officials from both sides,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “China should be well accustomed to Trump’s ways by now. Judging from how the talks are proceeding so far, there is a greater chance of the negotiations ending in some sort of a compromise instead of falling through, and such an outcome would bode well for risk sentiment,” he said. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 93.471 after rising to a five-month peak of 93.632 on Thursday. The index has gained about 1 percent this week, buoyed by the surge in U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield hitting a seven-year peak of 3.128 percent. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1805, but not far off a five-month trough of $1.1763 brushed on Wednesday. The currency has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week, largely pressured by Italian political uncertainty. Reports this week that Italian populist parties likely to form the country’s next government may ask the European Central Bank for debt forgiveness have raised concerns about Italy abandoning fiscal discipline. The dollar extended an overnight rally and rose to 111.005 yen, its highest since late January. The greenback has gained about 1.4 percent against its Japanese peer this week. Emerging market currencies have also lost ground against the dollar this week as the rise in U.S. yields showed little signs of slowing. The Turkish lira fell to a record low against the dollar this week, the Brazilian real plumbed a two-year low while Mexico’s peso has shed more than 5 percent this month. A retreat by Indonesia’s rupiah to a 2-1/2-year low prompted the central bank to tighten monetary policy on Thursday for the first time since 2014 to support the currency. “Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the recent rupiah weakness has been the sheer speed in which the currency markets have turned against some emerging market countries,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “However, policy credibility is the most important tool and the fact that the Indonesian central bank has begun to tighten ought to alleviate some of the FX pressures.” In commodities, Brent crude oil futures were 16 cents higher at $79.46 a barrel after rising to $80.50 on Thursday, their highest since November 2014. Brent has risen 3 percent this week and is headed for a sixth week of gains. A rapid slide in oil supply from Venezuela, concern that U.S. sanctions will disrupt exports from Iran, and falling global inventories have all combined to push oil prices up nearly 20 percent in 2018. Inflation concerns, strong U.S. economic indicators and worries over increasing debt supply have pushed Treasury yields higher this week.

2018-05-18,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farmers worldwide are feeling the pinch as fuel costs rise to near four-year highs just as they plant and harvest their fields, eroding agricultural income already hamstrung by depressed crop prices.  The agricultural sector from the United States to Russia, and Brazil to Europe, is seeing profits harmed by the rise in diesel prices. The global oil benchmark, Brent crude LCOc1, touched $80 a barrel for the first time since late 2014 on Thursday. Coupled with local economic issues, the increase is making it even harder for many farmers worldwide to turn a profit in the estimated $2.4 trillion agriculture industry, casting a cloud over future investments. In the United States, fuel accounts for about five percent of farmers’ overall costs, and is hurting margins at a time when farm income is already half that of 2013. Massive harvests have depressed prices of staples such as corn, wheat and soybeans. Diesel fuel is essential for planting, harvesting, and shipping crops to market. In the United States, farmers will spend an estimated $15.25 billion on fuel and oil in 2018, an 8 percent increase from 2017, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.     The price of ultra-low sulfur diesel used for farming equipment and transporting crops has not been this high in May since 2014. Heating oil futures, the proxy for ultra-low sulfur diesel, traded at $2.29 a gallon on Thursday. Ron Heck, who grows soybeans in Perry, Iowa, said his fuel costs could go up $1,000 to $2,000 during the northern hemisphere’s spring.  “You feel the pain right away,” Heck said. In Russia, fuel prices for farmers are up 50 percent compared with a year ago, Arkady Zlochevsky, the head of Russia’s Grain Union, a non-governmental farm lobby, told Reuters. Farmers will need to spend more ahead of harvesting, which starts in about a month in Russia, he said. For a graphic on farmers' cash expenses, click tmsnrt.rs/2rXHHQf U.S. farms are also factoring in potential losses of income due to a 25 percent tax China announced on major American imports following the U.S. government’s decision to slap duties on steel and aluminum. “We’re seeing financial stress occurring in agriculture that we probably haven’t seen for a decade or so,” said Scott Brown, director of strategic partnerships at the University of Missouri’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. “If diesel prices continue to go higher, it continues to put more pressure on [farmers].” Net farm income is forecast to fall to $59.5 billion in 2018, an 8.3 percent decline from 2017, according to the USDA. It has fallen by 55 percent since 2013. In Holly Grove, Arkansas, Tim Gannon paid about $17,000 in February to fill a 7,500-gallon tank with diesel used to run equipment and irrigation. The price increase means it may cost up to 25 percent more, or an extra $4,000, to refill it in coming weeks, he said. “That’s a fairly significant amount of income to lose,” he said. Gannon has been taking steps to cut his diesel costs over the past year by reducing the number of times he plows, or tills. In Brazil, farmers are also taking steps to deal with higher costs, as diesel prices have climbed 43 percent in the country since July 2017. Eder Ferreira Bueno, a farmer in grain state Mato Grosso, said increased fuel costs meant he had “no other option but to spend less to treat the soil.” Other farmers might hire fewer workers or delay investment plans, he added. In neighboring Argentina, the top shipper of soybean meal and oil worldwide, farmers are having to deal with a weakening currency at the same time fuel costs are rising.  “Where the impact is felt greatest is in trucking costs. We are already at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors on freight costs within Argentina,” said David Hughes, a farmer in Buenos Aires province and president of Argentine wheat industry chamber Argentrigo. In Europe, French grain producers say rising oil costs may have a knock-on effect on fertilizers and crop protection products. “It comes at a time when things are already difficult for farmers economically,” said Philippe Pinta, head of grain growers group AGPB in Paris.     Wamego, Kansas, farmer Glenn Brunkow said he may lock in diesel prices in advance for the first time ever next year, to avoid the pain of future increases. “You just kind of all of a sudden realize, ‘Wow, it’s pretty high,’” he said.

2018-05-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. federal agency tasked with restoring electricity to Puerto Rico, after Hurricane Maria hit the Caribbean last year, is leaving the island though thousands still have no power heading into the next hurricane season starting next month. Only a last-minute request from the governor of the island, bemoaning the “fragile state” of the power grid, managed to keep most of the generators brought by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Puerto Rican soil for another six months.  The remaining generators might help keep the lights on for hospitals or police stations if the island gets hit again during the coming hurricane season, which begins June 1.  Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last September, leaving 1.5 million homes and businesses in the dark. Both the island’s power utility and the Trump Administration’s Federal Emergency Management Agency were criticized for a slow response. Most power has been restored by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers but the electricity grid remains unreliable, and suffered an island-wide blackout last month.   (For a graphic on power restoration after hurricanes, click tmsnrt.rs/2xvCFyU) “The whole world is very nervous about hurricane time,” said Rosalina Abreu Gonzalez, who lives near Mariana, on the eastern side of the island, where power has still not been restored. “There is a real concern - the government hasn’t provided an energy system that is more secure.”    The Army Corps, a unit of the U.S. armed forces, has said  its task is largely complete now that most people have power. About 22,000 customers are still without electricity, most in remote areas, according to the new head of the island’s power utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. “Our mission wasn’t to build a modern resilient system,” Charles Alexander, Director of Contingency Operations and Homeland Security Headquarters at the Army Corps, said at a Senate hearing last week.  On April 29, Governor Ricardo Rossello asked U.S. officials to leave behind 850 generators at critical facilities, along with three larger generators used to keep the grid stable. FEMA agreed to leave the mega-generators and generators for 700 critical facilities. Mega-generators supply 75 megawatts of power, enough to power 75,000 homes.  New PREPA Chief Executive Walter Higgins, who has only been on the job for two months, said he is focusing on emergency procedures in the event of another disaster in coming months.  He said there is a plan for building a more resilient grid in the future. Higgins took over from Ricardo Ramos, who resigned as CEO in November after coming under fire for signing unvetted, little-known contractors to restore power, rather than immediately ask for assistance from other utilities. “Unfortunately, pain causes learning, and what we’ve learned is how to get mutual assistance called for and on the island immediately,” Higgins told Reuters.  Still, PREPA’s grid lacks buried power lines or reinforced poles, common in other hurricane prone areas. The power utility ran up an $8 billion debt over many years, largely due to poor bill collection, causing the system to fall into disrepair. “It is very hard to see these messages where the government is saying we’re ready for next season. We’re not,” said Sheylda Diaz, a biology professor who lives near Utuado, in the island’s center, where some lines and poles have yet to be fixed.  The Army Corps will not provide further line restoration after Friday, FEMA said.  “People here have no idea that they are leaving,” said Abreu Gonzalez, who runs a center where people without power can go for meals.   Higgins said he sympathizes with those who want the Corps to remain. “I can understand why somebody would want them to stay longer, as long as there’s a single customer out.” Maria hit shortly after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma slammed the U.S. mainland in 2017, but in both cases, power was largely restored within a week.  “I cannot imagine a scenario where 20,000-plus Texans or 20,000 Floridians were without power and FEMA would make that decision,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico. “I think that’s reprehensible.” Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/puertorico-power-army-corps/puerto-rico-power-grid-braces-for-hurricane-season-idUKL1N1SG136,18 May 2018,"The U.S. federal agency tasked

2018-05-18,"JAKARTA, May 18 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s government expects the rupiah to trade at 13,700-14,000 a dollar on average next year, taking into account higher interest rates in the United States, according to a preliminary budget document submitted by the finance ministry to parliament on Friday. The rupiah has slid to its weakest in more than two years in recent weeks as global investors pull funds from emerging markets. It hit 14,135 a dollar, the weakest since October 2015, on Friday, much weaker than the government’s assumption for a 2018 average of 13,400. The ministry said the forecast reflected four U.S. interest rate hikes in 2018 and a hawkish stance in 2019 by the Federal Reserve, as well as less portfolio flows into emerging markets in the next two years. The government also expects Indonesian crude oil prices to average $60-$70 per barrel next year. Reporting by Tabita Diela;

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1 percent higher. The index was headed for a 1 percent loss this week. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.25 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI was up 0.4 percent and Australian stocks dipped 0.15 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.25 percent and Shanghai climbed 0.3 percent. Wall Street ended slightly lower on Thursday as investors grappled with U.S.-China trade tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump said that China “has become very spoiled on trade”. But helping ease some of the tension, Beijing has offered Trump a package of proposed purchases of American goods and other measures aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China by some $200 billion a year, U.S. officials familiar with the proposal said. A second round of talks between senior Trump administration officials and their Chinese counterparts started on Thursday, focused on cutting China’s U.S. trade surplus and improving intellectual property protections. “President Trump does not do the actual trade negotiations, which are done by officials from both sides,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “China should be well accustomed to Trump’s ways by now. Judging from how the talks are proceeding so far, there is a greater chance of the negotiations ending in some sort of a compromise instead of falling through, and such an outcome would bode well for risk sentiment,” he said. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 93.498 after rising to a five-month peak of 93.632 on Thursday. The index has gained about 1 percent this week, buoyed by the surge in U.S. Treasury yields, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield hitting a seven-year peak of 3.128 percent. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1807, but not far off a five-month trough of $1.1763 brushed on Wednesday. The currency has fallen nearly 1.2 percent this week, largely pressured by Italian political uncertainty. Reports this week that Italian populist parties likely to form the country’s next government may ask the European Central Bank for debt forgiveness have raised concerns about Italy abandoning fiscal discipline. The dollar extended an overnight rally and rose to 110.990 yen, its highest since late January. The greenback has gained nearly 1.4 percent against its Japanese peer this week. Emerging market currencies have also lost ground against the dollar this week as the rise in U.S. yields showed little signs of slowing. The Turkish lira fell to a record low against the dollar this week, the Brazilian real plumbed a two-year low while Mexico’s peso has shed more than 5 percent this month. A retreat by Indonesia’s rupiah to a 2-1/2-year low prompted the central bank to tighten monetary policy on Thursday for the first time since 2014 to support the currency. “Perhaps the most unnerving aspect of the recent rupiah weakness has been the sheer speed in which the currency markets have turned against some emerging market countries,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “However, policy credibility is the most important tool and the fact that the Indonesian central bank has begun to tighten ought to alleviate some of the FX pressures.” In commodities, Brent crude oil futures were 30 cents higher at $79.60 a barrel after rising to $80.50 on Thursday, their highest since November 2014. Brent has risen 3 percent this week and is headed for a sixth week of gains. A rapid slide in oil supply from Venezuela, concern that U.S. sanctions will disrupt exports from Iran, and falling global inventories have all combined to push oil prices up nearly 20 percent in 2018. Inflation concerns, strong U.S. economic indicators and worries over increasing debt supply have pushed Treasury yields higher this week.

2018-05-18,"(Repeats May 17 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2wUWBvY By John Kemp LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices are now in the top half of the cycle, with benchmark Brent on Thursday trading above $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. In real terms, prices averaged $75 per barrel over the course of the last full cycle, which lasted from December 1998 to January 2016. The recent rise in prices sends a strong signal about the need for more production and slower growth in oil consumption. In the next few months, the narrative will increasingly turn to boosting supply and restraining demand in order to stabilise inventories and return the market to balance. Between 2014 and 2017, oil market “rebalancing” meant restricting production, stimulating demand and cutting excess inventories. For the rest of 2018 and 2019, rebalancing will mean precisely the opposite. The oil industry has always been subject to deep and prolonged cycles of boom and bust, and there is no reason to think the next few years will be any different. (tmsnrt.rs/2wUWBvY) Cyclical behaviour is the single most important distinguishing characteristic of oil markets and prices, and is deeply rooted in the industry’s structure. The price cycle is driven by the low responsiveness of production and consumption to small changes in prices, at least in the short term. The behaviour of many oil producers and consumers exhibits a strong backward-looking component, so decisions tend to be based on where prices have been recently rather than where they are likely to go. But most importantly, the oil markets are a complex adaptive system which is subject to multiple feedback mechanisms operating at different speeds and timescales. The price cycle is driven by the interaction of positive feedback mechanisms (which magnify shocks) and negative feedback mechanisms (which dampen them). In the short run, positive feedback mechanisms are more influential and tend to push the market even further away from balance following an initial disturbance. In the medium and long term, however, negative feedback mechanisms dominate and will eventually force production and consumption back into alignment. Negative feedback mechanisms are familiar to economists as Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” and in the long run they exert a powerful influence on the oil market. But the existence of positive feedback mechanisms can cause a lot of volatility in the short term and tends to cause oil prices to oscillate rather than converge on a steady equilibrium value. In the next few months, positive feedback will tend to push oil prices even higher by boosting demand further and capping supply growth. Rising oil revenues will drive faster economic growth in oil-producing countries, increasing their domestic fuel consumption and tightening the oil market even more. Rising oil prices and production will also increase the oil industry’s internal fuel consumption for drilling, refining, transportation and all along the supply chain. At the same time, rising oil prices and output tend to be associated with tightening markets and increasing costs for everything from labour and raw materials to engineering and service contracts. Resource-owning governments will also tend to take the opportunity to push for higher tax and royalty rates to capture more of the windfall from higher prices. And as prices rise, oil producers will be able to achieve their revenue targets by holding output unchanged rather than increasing it. For all these reasons, oil production will tend to respond slowly to an increase in prices in the short term, while consumption will remain more buoyant than expected, intensifying the upward pressure on prices. In the medium term, however, negative feedback mechanisms become progressively more important and will eventually push the market back towards balance. Higher oil prices will boost corporate cash flows and improve the availability of equity and debt financing for oil producers. In time, that will boost exploration and production spending and eventually output. Most of the initial production gains will come from expansions of existing fields and projects, which tend to be faster, cheaper and lower-risk, before firms turn to developing more ambitious and risky new sources of supply. On the demand side, high prices will eventually promote renewed interest in fuel economy as well as operational/behavioural changes intended to cut fuel consumption. High prices will push energy conservation back up the agenda for corporations and governments and renew interest in switching to cheaper non-oil sources of energy. Rising prices will probably spur interest in buying smaller and more fuel-efficient cars as well as electric vehicles and trucks, trains and ships running on liquefied natural gas/compressed natural gas. Higher prices will also restrain demand by slowing economic growth in consuming countries, at least at the margin. All these supply- and demand-side responses take time to have an impact, but the higher prices rise and the longer they are expected to stay high, the more significant the eventual response. The period of very high prices between 2011 and the first half of 2014 stimulated record increases in oil production as well as restraining consumption growth, and created the conditions for the subsequent slump. That slump created the conditions for the current recovery by restraining production growth in the United States and other non-OPEC countries as well as stimulating demand. Voluntary production restraints by OPEC and some other oil-exporting countries, coupled with the involuntary collapse in production from Venezuela, accelerated a recovery that was starting to happen anyway. Now the market is embarking on the next stage of the cycle, with high and rising prices beginning to stimulate an increase in production, restrain fuel use, and eventually create conditions for the next downturn.

2018-05-18,"* Brent back below $80 after breaking through on previous day * Surge in U.S. production to offset some disruptions * High oil prices could also dent crude demand By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices held firm on Friday on strong demand, ongoing supply cuts led by producer cartel OPEC and looming U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. But markets remained below multi-year highs from the previous day as surging output from the United States is expected to offset at least some of the shortfalls. Brent crude futures were at $79.48 per barrel at 0041 GMT, up 5 cents from their last close. Brent broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014 on Thursday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.55 a barrel, up 6 cents from their last settlement. Crude prices have received broad support from voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aimed at tightening the market. Helped by strong demand, especially in Asia, as well as a U.S. announcement earlier this month to renew sanctions against OPEC-member Iran, Brent has climbed 20 percent since the start of the year. “Global inventories are approaching long-run averages, suggesting that the coordinated OPEC/non-OPEC supply cuts have been successful,” said Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. Despite this, he said he saw “little to drive benchmarks much higher in the immediate term (as) there is a building concern over demand growth, partially on account of higher prices.” At $80 per barrel, Asia’s thirst for oil costs the region a whopping $1 trillion a year, more than twice what it was in 2015/2016, the two years prior to the OPEC-cuts which started in 2017. LONGER-TERM The crude oil price forward curve is in firm backwardation, a structure that suggests a tight market as prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for later dispatch. Front-month Brent prices are now almost $1.80 per barrel more expensive than those for delivery in December. “Longer-dated (crude) futures ... remain in backwardation, driven by confidence in indefatigable U.S. shale producers,” U.S. firm Height Securities said in a note, although it warned that strong demand as well as looming disruptions due to renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran and falling output in Venezuela could soon start lifting the crude forward curve too. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared by more than a quarter in the last two years, to a record 10.72 million barrels per day. That puts the United States within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd. As a result of its surging production, U.S. crude is increasingly appearing on global markets as exports. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-05-18,"(Reuters) - Pipeline operators Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), Williams Cos (WMB.N)  and Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A) said on Thursday they would restructure after a U.S. rule change removed a key tax benefit for publicly traded partnerships controlled by those companies. Williams said it would buy all common units of its master limited partnership (MLP) Williams Partners WPZ.N in a deal valued at $10.5 billion. Enbridge said it would buy its independent units including Spectra Energy Partners SEP.N and Enbridge Energy Partners EEP.N as well as its pipeline assets and bring then under a single listed entity for C$11.4 billion ($8.94 billion). Cheniere said it will buy out shares it does not already hold in Cheniere Partners Holdings CQH.N for about $6.54 billion. MLPs are tax-exempt corporate structures that pay out profit to investors in dividend-style distributions. In 2016, a U.S. Appeals Court ruled that energy regulators were allowing these companies to benefit from a “double recovery” of taxes. In March, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said the companies, largely oil and natural gas pipeline firms, will no longer be allowed to recover an income tax allowance as part of the fees they charge to shippers under a “cost of service” rate structure. “I would expect more of them to be rolled up in a similar fashion. If the reaction to Enbridge is stronger you might see TransCanada do the same thing but it’s not nearly as material to them,” said Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management. The transaction will not hurt Enbridge’s three-year financial outlook, the company said. “Under the newly changed FERC tax policy, holding certain interstate pipelines in MLP structures is highly unfavorable to unitholders and is no longer advantageous,” Enbridge said. The Calgary-based company, which has been trying to recast itself as a pipeline utility, has been under pressure to sell non-core assets and reduce its debt of more than $60 billion as of Dec. 31. “This is the first step of the board taking control and taking steps to put the company in good standing,” Bushell said. The company has been saddled with debt following its $28 billion takeover of U.S.-based Spectra Energy last year. Earlier this month, it sold some assets worth $2.5 billion. Rolling up Spectra will allow Enbridge to mitigate impact from the tax related changes by 21 percent, compared with a zero percent benefit if long-haul assets are held in a MLP structure, analysts at Tudor Pickering and Holt said.
