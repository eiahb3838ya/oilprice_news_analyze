2018-05-22,"CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of two top U.S. diplomats in Caracas in retaliation for a new round of sanctions over Venezuela’s widely-condemned election, accusing them of a ‘conspiracy’ that was denied by the State Department. The United States, European Union and most major Latin American nations have all said Sunday’s vote did not meet democratic standards.  Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez, won re-election easily, but critics said the vote was riddled with irregularities, from the barring of two popular opposition rivals to the offering of a government “prize” to voters.  President Donald Trump responded on Monday with an executive order limiting Venezuela’s ability to sell state assets. Accusing U.S. charge d’affaires Todd Robinson of being involved in “a military conspiracy,” Maduro ordered him and another senior diplomat, Brian Naranjo, to leave within 48 hours. He gave no details of the accusations, but said the U.S. Embassy had been meddling in military, economic and political issues, and vowed to present evidence shortly. “Neither with conspiracies nor with sanctions will you hold Venezuela back,” Maduro said, at an event in downtown Caracas at the headquarters of the election board. The U.S. State Department rejected Maduro’s “false allegations” against the two diplomats, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a news briefing in Washington. Robinson gave a brief speech at a public appearance on Tuesday afternoon in Venezuela’s western city of Merida. “We energetically reject the accusations against me and against Brian Naranjo,” said Robinson, in comments streamed live on Facebook by local media. “This was my first visit to Merida, but it will not be my last,” added Robinson, who assumed the charge d’affaires role in December. In an interview on Tuesday, Venezuela’s Trade Minister Jose Vielma said the latest round of sanctions would have a “more serious” impact on the country’s financial system. Previous sanctions were limited to assets linked to individual Maduro administration members. The executive order prohibits U.S. citizens from being involved in sales of Venezuela’s pending invoices related to oil and other assets, though Vielma said shipments of fuel and crude to the United States would continue. It appears to target in part Citgo , a U.S.-based oil refiner owned by Venezuela state oil company PDVSA . More obstacles to PDVSA’s ability to sell oil abroad could restrict already-dwindling foreign exchange earnings, worsening the economic crisis and pressuring Maduro.  “This attack against Venezuela, which seeks to completely strangle the country, is unheard of,” Vielma said, adding that Venezuela would continue to collect on its accounts receivable. Among widespread international condemnation of the vote, the European Union said in a statement on Tuesday the elections did not comply with “minimum international standards for a credible process” and repeated it would consider the “adoption of appropriate measures.” The mainstream opposition coalition boycotted Sunday’s vote, calling it a sham aimed at legitimising Maduro’s rule. Maduro, whose second term will begin next January, won 68 percent of the vote. Former state governor Henri Falcon, who broke with the boycott to challenge Maduro, said he received reports of hundreds of irregularities. Turnout was less than 50 percent, compared to 80 percent in 2013.  Electoral council chief Tibisay Lucena, who is on individual U.S. and European Union sanctions lists, certified Maduro’s victory in a presentation on Tuesday. The Trump administration has also tried to convince China and Russia to stop issuing new credit to Venezuela, U.S. officials told reporters on Monday. The two countries have provided billions of dollars in funding for Venezuela in recent years.  But they appeared unlikely to heed the U.S. warnings. Beijing said on Tuesday it believed the United States and Venezuela should resolve their differences via talks, while Moscow said it would not comply with the sanctions. In a statement on Tuesday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said the sanctions violated international law and blamed the U.S. “blockade” of the country for “blocking the population’s access to basic goods.”  Most mainstream economists say the country’s strict currency controls, heavy state intervention and money-printing are responsible for a crisis that has caused widespread shortages of food and medicine and led to mass emigration.

2018-05-22,"* Truckers not convinced by proposed CIDE tax cut * Protests affect ports, threaten soy, meat deliveries * Petrobras cuts diesel prices, shares fall * Finance minister, Petrobras CEO deny interference (Recasts with proposal to cut fuel tax, truckers’ reaction) By Ana Mano and Alberto Alerigi SAO PAULO, May 22 (Reuters) - Brazilian truck drivers on Tuesday vowed to extend their protest against high fuel prices into a third day despite a government compromise to cut a fuel tax, threatening to slow economic activity and interrupt exports of grains and other goods. Thousands of trucks were parked to obstruct major roads as the protests interrupted traffic along a major soy shipping route in the grains state of Mato Grosso and impeded access to the country’s two main export ports, Santos and Paranaguá. Brazil is a key global supplier of grains, meat, coffee and sugar — most of which reach ports by road. Soy futures rose in Chicago on Tuesday for a second straight day as the protests threatened to halt shipments of Brazil’s record soybean harvest. In an effort to address truckers’ demands, congressional leaders floated a plan on Tuesday afternoon to eliminate the CIDE fuel tax and put additional revenue from payroll taxes toward reducing fuel prices, which have surged nearly 50 percent in less than a year. Diesel prices ended last week at 3.595 reais ($0.99) per liter, according to regulator ANP. However, the trucking group organizing the protests, ABCAM, said demonstrations would continue on Wednesday, complaining that the CIDE accounted for only a fraction of the taxes on diesel fuel. According to Petrobras, state and federal taxes make up 29 percent of the final price paid by the consumer. “That doesn’t solve the problem. We want to be heard. We want diesel taxes to be eliminated,” ABCAM President José da Fonseca Lopes told Reuters. His comments added to pressure on the government to provide relief from fuel costs, giving it the choice of backsliding on efforts to close Brazil’s fiscal deficit or interfering in the state-controlled oil company’s pricing policy. A small diesel price cut announced on Tuesday by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, did nothing to reduce protests. But it did raise concerns about interference in a program of near-daily adjustments to track global markets since last July. That new pricing policy, which has allowed the company to sell fuel at a profit after absorbing losses for years, has been key to the operational turnaround at Petrobras, lifting its share price to an eight-year high this month. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente and Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia both denied that the government had asked the company to change its pricing policy on Tuesday. Petrobras shares fell as much as 3.4 percent on concerns of political interference, but pared losses to 1 percent on news of the proposal to lower pump prices through tax policy. ABCAM said truckers protested in 23 states as participation rose from around 200,000 drivers on Monday, the first day of demonstrations, to an estimated 300,000 on Tuesday. That would represent around a tenth of Brazil’s total truck fleet, according to data from transport lobby CNT. A toll road operator in  Mato Grosso said blockades had expanded overnight to four points along the key BR-163 highway, which carries grains to northern and southern ports for export. An official with road operator Rota do Oeste said protesters would let only passenger vehicles, ambulances and live or perishable cargo get through. At the port in Santos, Latin America’s largest, truck drivers blocked traffic near the terminals, said Codesp, the state-run firm that administers the area. Pork and poultry processor group ABPA said the protests are affecting transportation of feed and animals, adding that blockades had stopped work at eight plants on Tuesday and 30 more would stop on Wednesday. Aurora, Brazil’s third-largest chicken and pork producer, said it would halt work at fifteen plants in four states on Thursday and Friday due to the lack of storage space or transportation options. Automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co said the strike was disrupting car production, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said parts deliveries were affected. Vehicle assembly relies on “just in time” delivery of components, which keeps stockpiles low to reduce costs.

2018-05-22,"VANCOUVER, May 22 (Reuters) - British Columbia’s attorney general said on Tuesday that the West Coast province is not delaying Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, despite the company’s saying that B.C.’s opposition was making the build “untenable.” The attorney general, David Eby, told reporters that British Columbia is approving Trans Mountain permits on the same timeline as other major projects, and that its new environmental rules and a jurisdictional challenge simply come down to the province protecting its interests. “It is not to stop the pipeline, it is not to prevent it - it’s to ensure that we have the protections in place for when the pipeline is built and turned on,” Eby said. His comments run up against assertions from Kinder Morgan, which stopped all non-essential work on the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project last month, citing permitting delays and political opposition in British Columbia, and set a May 31 deadline to decide if the build would go ahead or not. Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, said separately that her province was “getting closer” in its talks with Kinder Morgan to ensure the expansion gets built, but she declined to provide details. Notley backed out of a meeting with other Western Canadian provincial leaders this week, including B.C. Premier John Horgan, saying she would instead focus on Trans Mountain as the May 31 deadline looms. Canadian oil trades at a steep discount to the North American benchmark, with the gap widening in recent months due to tight capacity on rail and pipelines. That has Alberta desperate to get new pipelines built, particularly a line to the coast to access overseas markets. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Alberta to a Metro Vancouver port. The project is fiercely opposed by environmental groups, some aboriginal groups and the B.C. government. B.C. said on Tuesday that it had filed a challenge to a new Alberta law that would allow the oil-rich province to cut fuel shipments west.

2018-05-22,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday after a volatile session in which potential supply concerns surrounding Venezuela and Iran jockeyed with comments from President Donald Trump, who said he was not pleased with U.S.-China trade talks. Brent LCOc1 futures rose 35 cents to settle at $79.57 a barrel, a 0.44 percent gain. Last week, the global benchmark topped $80 for the first time since November 2014.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 11 cents to settle at $72.13 a barrel, a 0.15 percent loss. They earlier touched $72.83 a barrel, the highest since November 2014. Futures pulled back from session highs in afternoon trading after Trump said he was not pleased with recent trade talks between the United States and China, but kept the door open for further negotiations. “Trade is positive for energy demand,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “If we get into a trade war, it could potentially slow economic growth.” Further weighing on prices, Trump also said on Tuesday there was a “substantial chance” his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will not take place as planned on June 12 amid concerns that Kim is resistant to giving up his nuclear weapons. The U.S. government imposed new sanctions on Venezuela following Sunday’s re-election of President Nicolas Maduro, a move that analysts say could further curb the country’s oil output, already at its lowest in decades. Concern about a potential drop in Iranian oil exports following Washington’s exit from a nuclear arms control deal with Tehran also supported prices.  On Monday, the United States demanded Iran make sweeping changes - from dropping its nuclear program to pulling out of the Syrian civil war - or face severe economic sanctions. Iran dismissed Washington’s ultimatum and one senior Iranian official said it showed the United States is seeking “regime change” in Iran. Venezuela and Iran are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which with its allies has curbed production since January 2017 to get rid of a supply glut that in mid-2014 led to a price collapse. OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The OPEC-led supply curbs have largely cleared an inventory surplus in industrialized countries based on the deal’s original goals, and stocks continue to decline. U.S. crude inventories fell 1.3 million barrels in the week to May 18 to 433.9 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group showed on Tuesday, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.6 million barrels. Rising supply in the United States, where shale production is forecast to hit a record high in June, has limited the upward pressure on prices.

2018-05-22,"(Updates with Cheniere approval of new LNG unit) By Scott DiSavino May 22 (Reuters) - China’s interest in reducing its trade surplus with the United States through increased energy imports could advance plans for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants and ethanol sales, analysts and energy executives involved in developing new LNG facilities said. Washington and Beijing stepped back from the brink of a full-blown trade war after talks last week, with the United States appearing to set aside for now its demands that China revamp key planks of its industrial policy. “China represents an enormous economic opportunity for U.S. LNG and ethanol exports as both products will likely see dramatic demand growth in the coming years, during which time the United States is also expected to dominate global export markets,” Katie Bays, energy analyst at Height Securities in Washington, D.C., said in a note on Tuesday. Bays estimated that substantial LNG sales commitments could bring in between $20 billion and $30 billion annually and ethanol sales could reach $5 billion to $7 billion annually. She noted, however, that the LNG and ethanol markets are not big enough by themselves to meet President Donald Trump’s goal of reducing the Chinese trade deficit by $200 billion per year. On Tuesday, Cheniere Energy Inc said its board approved financing for an LNG unit, the first new approval in the United States since 2015. The decision adds a third unit capable of producing 0.7-billion cubic feet per day of liquefied natural gas to its Corpus Christi, Texas, plant. There are more than two dozen proposed U.S. LNG plants waiting for customer commitments to reach a final investment decision, many of them looking to China for deals. China overtook South Korea in 2017 as the world’s second biggest buyer of LNG behind Japan. The country, which imported 5.6 billion cubic feet per day last year, is looking to buy more low-cost sources of energy, like gas, to reduce its use of coal and cut pollution. Charlie Cone, LNG proprietary analyst for energy data provider Genscape, said at least 13 percent of total U.S. LNG cargoes currently go to China. “We expect this number to grow as more U.S. firms sign long-term agreements with Chinese buyers as their nation continues to develop its gas infrastructure,” Cone said. Bays said a hold on the trade war could drive Chinese customers to sign new LNG contracts with Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass or Corpus Christi facilities, Sempra Energy’s Cameron, Freeport LNG, NextDecade Corp’s Rio Grande, or Pembina Pipeline Corp’s Jordan Cove. “We see it as a positive development,” said William Daughdrill, director of health, safety and environmental matters at Delfin Midstream. The company’s chief executive was in Asia last week pursuing customers, Daughdrill said. Delfin is proposing a floating LNG facility in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and aiming for a final investment decision as early as this year to go ahead and produce up to 13 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export. “For us, it’s strictly been about marketing to China,” said Greg Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd, which is developing an LNG plant in Louisiana and another in Nova Scotia in Canada. It hopes to reach a final investment decision on the U.S. project by year-end and begin exports in 2022, he said. “If you look at some forecasts for 2035, there are really only two places that have significant increases in LNG imports. Europe goes up about 100 mtpa and China goes up about 200 mtpa,” Vesey said. Texas LNG, which is proposing a 4-mtpa export facility in Brownsville, Texas, and has five early-stage agreements with Chinese customers, hopes to make a final decision next year, about six months behind its original goal. “Sentiment in the LNG markets is heating up again,” said Langtry Meyer, co-founder of the company. He added, however, that Texas LNG was not considering developing an import terminal in China, which would likely be needed to expand U.S. exports. As for ethanol, Bays at Height Securities said ethanol producers like Archer Daniels Midland Co and Green Plains Inc could benefit from negotiations with China given the political importance of corn producers to Trump, coupled with China’s need to increase ethanol imports dramatically to meet its 2020 renewable fuel objectives.

2018-05-22,"New York (Reuters) - Global stock markets tipped downward on Tuesday as Wall Street investors locked in recent gains while taking a cautious view of fresh U.S.-China comments even as European shares approached four-month peaks and China moved to further open up its economy. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was not pleased with recent trade discussions with China, reversing optimism about a warming relationship between the world’s two largest economies that led to a strong rally the prior session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 177.3 points, or 0.71 percent, to 24,835.99, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.38 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,724.63 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 15.58 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,378.46. Trump also said no deal had been made with ZTE Corp (000063.SZ), as U.S. lawmakers from both political parties worked to block him from easing penalties on the Chinese telecoms gear maker. The United States’ change of tone on China chilled Wall Street investor sentiment, said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.  “It makes people less enthusiastic,” O’Rourke said. “Investors are at a point where they’re taking everything that is said tentatively, with a grain of salt.” Trump’s remarks followed Beijing’s announcement that it would steeply cut import tariffs for automobiles and car parts, leading to a rally in shares of U.S. auto makers Ford Motor Co (F.N), General Motors Co (GM.N), and U.S.-listed shares of Fiat (FCAU.N). [.N]  Europe’s big carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) also rose on the news.

Analysts said the price falls of recent days might render the debt attractive again for some. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.29 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.01 percent. Meanwhile, oil prices rose on mounting supply concerns tied to Venezuelan crude output and a possible cut in Iranian exports that could further curb global supply. The concerns were exacerbated when Washington added sanctions against Venezuela following President Nicolas Maduro’s disputed re-election over the weekend. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 35 cents to settle at $79.57 a barrel, a 0.44 percent gain after recently topping the global benchmark of $80 for the first time since November 2014. After six days of gains, the U.S. dollar retreated as Treasury yields dipped and investors sought incentives to buy after a 7 percent rally since mid-February. The dollar’s recent uptrend has been supported by generally upbeat U.S. economic data that has kept the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least two more times this year. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.11 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.09 percent to $1.1779.

2018-05-22,"KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Gulf OPEC countries are leading the initial talks on when the exporting group can boost oil production to cool the oil market after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week, and how many barrels each member can add, the sources said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2018 to reduce high global oil stocks, but the inventory overhang has now fallen close to OPEC’s target. “All options are on the table,” one Gulf oil source told Reuters, adding that a decision to raise output might be taken in June when OPEC next meets to decide on its output policy, but there is no certain number yet by how much the group would need to ease its oil supply curbs. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies may opt to relax record high compliance with the supply curb agreement, another source said. OPEC’s compliance with the deal reached an unprecedented 166 percent in April, meaning it has cut well above its target. “We are still studying the different scenarios,” the second source said, adding that even if OPEC decided to ease the output restrictions in June it may take three to four months to put into effect. “That is one of the options,” an OPEC source said, referring to adding more supply at the June meeting.  Falling Venezuelan output due to an economic crisis has helped OPEC and its allies deliver a bigger cut than intended. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih is set to meet his counterparts from Russia and the United Arab Emirates, which holds the OPEC presidency in 2018, in St. Petersburg this week to discuss this issue, sources said. So far, OPEC has said it sees no need to ease output restrictions despite a fall in global stocks to the group’s desired levels and concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand. But the sources said that the quick decline in global oil inventories and worries about the impact on oil supplies after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran, as well as Venezuela’s collapsing oil output, were behind the change in OPEC’s thinking.  Concerns raised by the United States that oil prices were too high also made the exporting group start internal discussions, the sources added.  U.S. President Donald Trump accused OPEC last month of “artificially” boosting oil prices. Last week, Falih, OPEC’s most influential energy minister, said he had called his counterparts in the UAE, the United States and Russia, as well as major oil consumer South Korea, to “coordinate global action to ease global market anxiety”. Earlier this month, an OPEC source familiar with the kingdom’s oil thinking told Reuters that Saudi Arabia is monitoring the impact on oil supplies of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and is ready to offset any shortage but it will not act alone to fill the gap.

2018-05-22,"HOUSTON, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp this year boosted its imports of Venezuelan crude ahead of U.S. sanctions over the country’s disputed presidential election and as other customers received less of the OPEC-member’s exports, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. Venezuelan oil production has tumbled to a multi-decade low this year, cutting shipments to buyers in the United States and elsewhere and worsening a severe economic recession. Its crude exports averaged 1.19 million barrels per day (bpd) in the January-April period, 28 percent less than the same period in 2017. The country’s exports this month also have been hit by ConocoPhillips’ moves to seize PDVSA cargoes and storage facilities in the Caribbean to pay a $2 billion arbitration award over a 2007 expropriation of its projects in the country. Amid the dwindling exports, Valero received over 200,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude from state-run oil company PDVSA and its joint ventures in March and April, the largest monthly volumes since December 2016, according to the data. Valero, the largest U.S. refiner by capacity, and PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The San Antonio, Texas company’s imports vaulted it over PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum as the largest receiver of Venezuelan barrels in the United States this year, the data shows. Valero’s purchases rose 5.4 percent to 173,080 bpd in the first four months of 2018, while Citgo’s decreased 26 percent to 155,527 bpd. Purchases by PDVSA’s other large U.S. customers, including Chevron Corp, Phillips 66 and PBF Energy , continued to fall on a year-over-year basis. In April, the United States overall imported 512,182 bpd of Venezuelan crude, a 12.6 percent increase compared with the prior month, but levels were 31 percent below April 2017, according to the data. U.S. buyers are among PDVSA’s few cash-paying customers since its oil is used to pay off loans to China and Russia. Venezuela’s large export decline and international condemnation of President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election this week, which has started triggering new sanctions, is creating tension in the global oil market. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose on Tuesday amid worries that Venezuela’s crude output could drop further following the election. OPEC is looking closely at the nation’s production drop to decide if the loss of supply will require action by the group, according to sources. PDVSA last year started requesting crude from its joint ventures in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela’s largest producing region, to supply its domestic refineries, which also has reduced the volume of oil available to U.S. customers, including Citgo. Since 2017, financial sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA and quality problems with some PDVSA’s crude grades also have created obstacles for U.S. customers to import or pay for oil shipments from the South American country, affecting refiners such as PBF and Phillips 66. But the export drop has not stopped Valero from receiving more Venezuelan oil through its existing, long-term supply contracts with PDVSA. Most of its purchases are made under open-credit terms that have not been affected by U.S. financial sanctions, according to traders. In April, Valero received 13 cargoes of Venezuelan crude for its U.S. Gulf refineries compared with nine cargoes imported by Citgo Petroleum, according to the Reuters data.

2018-05-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - A U.N. monitoring group wants to enlist the help of the world’s biggest oil trading companies to enforce sanctions that cap the amount of crude and related products North Korea can import, the coordinator said. The U.N. Security Council ramped up sanctions last year after North Korea said it had conducted missile tests that put the U.S. mainland in range of its nuclear weapons. Under the restrictions, Pyongyang is limited to importing 4 million barrels of crude and 500,000 barrels of products a year. But the panel of experts appointed by the Security Council said in March that additional fuel was being sold to North Korea via illicit deals involving transfers of petroleum from large ships to smaller vessels at sea to evade detection. The panel said in its March report that it had investigated at least four such transfers and was “also investigating several multinational oil companies for their roles in the supply chain of petroleum products”. Hugh Griffiths, the U.N. monitoring group coordinator, told Reuters he was seeking support from the top traders to help implement sanctions and proposed clauses that they could add to their oil deals to prevent fuel ending up in North Korea. He said the big traders “represent the choke point in the supply chain and if all the big ones sign up and make this the industry standard ... all smaller players will have to comply”. The panel sent a letter in May to 10 major traders operating in the region, outlining the recommended contract clauses. The letter was also sent to regional refiners and some specialist firms, mainly in Singapore. Griffiths, who did not identify the 10 firms or the other companies targeted, said all the firms had been asked to respond within a month of receiving the letter. A list of those that failed to reply would be published after that period, he said. In its March report, the U.N. panel named Switzerland-based Trafigura as a trader that initially handled fuel that eventually ended up in North Korea in ship-to-ship transfers. It was the only multinational named in the report on the issue. Trafigura denied involvement in the illicit trade and said it had no knowledge that its fuel would end up in North Korea. Ben Luckock, Trafigura’s co-head of risk, said his firm had consulted with U.N. officials and had added new clauses requiring proof of a cargo’s final discharge. “We are also stipulating that buyers require that vessels they use for such cargoes do not switch off their Automatic Identifier System (AIS),” he said, referring to a ship’s satellite tracking system.   Several major firms active in Asian trading said they already had measures in place to prevent sanctions-busting. A spokeswoman for Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), who did not say whether the firm had been sent a letter from the U.N. panel, said the company had clauses prohibiting clients selling to countries under U.N. sanctions, while BP (BP.L) said it complied with all sanctions requirements. Vitol [VITOLV.UL] said it had “robust” compliance procedures in place, while Mercuria said it was “always happy to help international bodies to bring additional transparency on these issues”. Glencore (GLEN.L) and Gunvor, two other major oil traders in the region, had no comment. Griffiths said the main focus was on free-on-board (FOB) contracts, in which a seller hands responsibility to the buyer once a cargo is loaded on a ship. Typically, the contracts have a final destination clause but no further proof of a cargo’s fate is usually required after the sale. “Once the product is sold, they don’t really pay attention to what happens afterward,” Griffiths said. He said traders, or those selling the cargoes, “should be implementing end-use verification measures which means that if a product is delivered to another ship ... all details of the shipment are provided”, including official documents showing that a cargo’s entire volume was delivered to a ship or port. He said clauses should prevent a ship with a fuel cargo from turning off its AIS and an insurer could invalidate a policy if the AIS was switched off. In March, the Security Council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping firms over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea. The United States also imposed sanctions on dozens of firms to shut down what it said was illicit oil and coal smuggling activities. Griffiths said the U.N. panel was also “investigating multiple companies particularly down the supply chain, smaller brokers” over suspected violations. He did not name the firms.

2018-05-22,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oilfield service company Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) may have to sell one of its larger businesses next year to pay down its sizeable debt, Chief Executive Officer Mark McCollum said on Tuesday.  McCollum, who became CEO 14 months ago, has been restructuring operations and selling assets to reduce the firm’s about $7.8 billion in debt. Last December, Weatherford sold its U.S. fracking equipment business to rival Schlumberger (SLB.N) and currently has several other businesses up for sale.  He did not identify which businesses the company was considering selling. It is a major provider of artificial lift gear, equipment used to increase oil and gas production in aging wells.  Weatherford was hit hard by the 2014 downturn in oil prices and has not posted a quarterly profit since September 2014. It posted 2017 revenue of $5.7 billion.   “I’m working for shareholders,” McCollum said at the UBS Global Oil and Gas Conference in Austin, Texas, noting that he is “not falling in love with anything.” The company this year expects to close on the sale of four smaller assets, that together will generate around $500 million. Weatherford also is selling its land rig business, and has “multiple options” for that unit, McCollum said.  Weatherford’s shares were up about 1.4 percent in midday trading at $3.63.

2018-05-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for the Bodo community in Nigeria’s oil-producing Niger Delta, which was devastated by two major oil spills a decade ago, went to court in London on Tuesday to fend off what they said was an attempt by Shell to kill off their litigation. The Bodo oil spills have been the subject of years of legal wrangling. In 2015, Shell accepted liability for the spills, agreeing to pay 55 million pounds ($83 million at the time) to Bodo villagers and to clean up their lands and waterways. Oil spills, sometimes due to vandalism, sometimes to corrosion, are common in the Niger Delta, a vast maze of creeks and mangrove swamps criss-crossed by pipelines and blighted by poverty, pollution, oil-fuelled corruption and violence. The spills have had a catastrophic impact on many communities where people have no other water supply than the creeks and rely on farming and fishing for survival. At the same time, oil companies have run into problems trying to clean up spills, sometimes because of obstruction and even violence by local gangs trying to extract bigger payouts, or to obtain clean-up contracts. After years of delays, the clean-up in Bodo is currently underway and litigation in the London High Court is stayed, or on hold. Lawyers for SPDC, the Nigerian arm of Shell, argued on Tuesday that the litigation should be struck off in October 2018, or at the latest a year later, and that it should only be re-activated if SPDC failed to comply with its obligation to pay for the clean-up. Lawyers for the Bodo community said that was unacceptable, because the clean-up could go wrong for any number of reasons and that under Shell’s proposal the villagers would be left without the recourse of going back to court. “The effect of what Shell is trying to do is to kill off the case,” said Dan Leader, the Bodo community’s lead lawyer, on the sidelines of the hearing. “It’s only because of the pressure of litigation that the clean-up is getting back on track.” But Shell’s lawyers, citing an earlier judgment, compared the stayed litigation to a “gun in the cupboard” that the Bodo community’s lawyers wanted to be able to hold to Shell’s head at their convenience, for years on end. They said the litigation was a hindrance to the clean-up because it gave some local community members the impression that there was still the possibility of a bigger payout, incentivising them to block the clean-up rather than cooperate. “The previous persistent delays to the clean-up process clearly demonstrate that litigating Nigerian oil spill cases in the English courts does little to resolve the complex underlying security and community issues which can frustrate attempts to clean up areas impacted by oil pollution,” an SPDC spokeswoman said. “We hope that the community will continue to grant the access needed for clean-up to progress as planned.” A judgment on the litigation issues is expected on Friday.

2018-05-22,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian energy group OMV (OMVV.VI) is continuing with planned Iranian energy projects despite the United States’ withdrawal from a nuclear pact with Tehran, but said on Tuesday it had made no investments there yet. European firms doing business in Iran face U.S. sanctions after President Donald Trump withdrew from a deal between the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and Iran, which lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme. The other signatories have indicated that they hope to salvage the deal. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire brought up the idea that the European Union could compensate European companies that might face U.S. sanctions. Last week, French energy giant Total (TOTF.PA) joined other European companies in signalling a possible exit from Iran in light of Trump’s decision. OMV was monitoring political developments in the U.S. and the European Union very closely, OMV’s upstream chief Johann Pleininger told its annual shareholder meeting in Vienna. “The project has not come to a standstill, it is continuing,” Pleininger said with regard to Iran, adding that “no investments have been made yet”. The Austrian group, which generates the bulk of its profit in Europe, started operations in Iran in 2001 as the operator of the Mehr exploration block in the west of the country.  OMV halted operations in 2006 due to sanctions, but following sanctions relief it signed in May 2016 a memorandum with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for projects located in the Zagros area in the west and the Fars field in the south, where foreign firms often need a local partner. In June 2017, OMV and Russia’s Gazprom Neft announced a memorandum of understanding to work in Iran’s oil sector. At last year’s shareholders meeting, Pleininger said the NIOC still owed OMV $48 million (35.7 million pounds). OMV bought Iranian crude oil in April, a spokesman said this month but did give any more detail. OMV is Austria’s former state petroleum company and the government still holds a 31.5 percent stake. Its second-biggest investor is Abu Dhabi industrial group Mubadala Investment with 24.9 percent.

Washington neared an agreement to lift its ban on U.S. firms supplying to Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp, sources said, while Beijing said it would steeply cut import tariffs for automobiles and car parts. That boosted auto stocks, with Ford, General Motors , and U.S.-listed shares of Fiat up between 1 percent and 2.4 percent. Europe’s big carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler jumped 1 to 1.6 percent too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.25 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,004.04, the S&P 500 gained 6.02 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,739.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.49 points, or 0.18 percent, to 7,407.52.lost 0.18 “The market is taking very well to what appears to be the fact that (President Donald) Trump is able to maneuver the trade talks in our favor,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Jersey-based Janlyn Capital LLC, of the mostly upbeat tone. “We’re seeing a continuation of that positive momentum.” Early European trading saw Italian government bond yields come off 14-month highs, after six days of heavy selling on concerns over high-spending policies mooted by a potential new ruling coalition. The proposed tie-up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League has pushed Rome’s 10-year yields up nearly 70 basis points since the start of the month. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.36 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.46 percent. Oil jumped to $80 a barrel, its highest since late 2014, on expectations Venezuelan crude output and a possible reduction in Iranian exports could further curb global supply. U.S. crude rose 0.64 percent to $72.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.25, up 1.3 percent. After six days of gains, the U.S. dollar retreated as Treasury yields dipped and investors sought incentives to buy after a 7 percent rally since mid-February. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 93.584. It was on track for its largest daily loss in two weeks. Gold steadied as the dollar lost momentum, but risk appetite in the broader financial market cooled the metal’s gains. Reporting by Marc Jones, Alex Lawler, Gertrude

2018-05-22,"SOCHI, Russia, May 22 (Reuters) - Russian state nuclear company Rosatom is ready to take part in a tender to develop Bulgaria’s Belene nuclear power plant, Rosatom head Alexei Likhachev said on Tuesday. Bulgaria is reviving plans for the plant and is open to Russian participation, its president Rumen Radev said on Monday, a day before meeting President Vladimir Putin. The 2,000 megawatt plant was cancelled in 2012 after failing to find investors. Bulgaria had also faced pressure from Washington and Brussels to limit its energy dependence on Russia, which was under contract to build the plant. However, the Bulgarian government decided last week to ask parliament to lift a ban on the development of the plant. “All of us are waiting for the decision of Bulgaria’s parliament,” Likhachev told reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi following the meeting between Putin and Radev. “We are not aware of the economic model which will be proposed and chosen by the Bulgarian side for the completion of this project ... Rosatom plans to take part in it in any case.” Bulgaria had to pay more than 620 million euros ($730 million) to Rosatom for cancelling the Belene project, but also received nuclear parts for two 1,000 megawatt reactors. As a result, the country has to decide what to do with the equipment.

2018-05-22,"MUMBAI, May 22 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country’s top refiner, will turn to its traditional oil suppliers, mostly in the Middle East, if U.S. sanctions against Iran result in supply disruptions, its head of finance said. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month pulled out of a 2015 international nuclear pact with Iran, and said he would impose sanctions on Tehran - and companies that continue to work with it - unless it curbed its influence in the Middle East. Other signatories of the pact - France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China - said they would try to salvage the deal and keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing. “So far we haven’t cut any volumes from Iran. We have to see how strongly the U.S. takes up sanctions. From our side, we would like to continue. Otherwise we will look to our traditional suppliers,” A.K. Sharma said. IOC, which controls 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity or about a third of the country’s overall capacity, plans to buy 140,000 bpd of Iranian oil in 2018/19 and has an option to buy an additional 40,000 bpd. State refiners such as IOC have raised imports after Iran agreed to steep shipping discounts. “Iran’s high sulphur oil can be replaced with other crudes. It is just a case of economics. Replacing will mean slightly cost disadvantage,” Sharma added. IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh said the government had so far not directed refiners to cut imports from Iran. “We have to see how situation unfolds in future,” he said. Previously, India obtained a waiver from Western sanctions as the country had cut imports from the Islamic Republic. “We are working on a strategy. We are working on alternate plans if those volumes go down, then how do we manage the situation,” Singh said. IOC is Iran’s biggest Indian oil client. The company meets about 70 percent of its oil needs through annual contracts deals, mainly with Middle Eastern producers. It makes sense for IOC to look for alternatives to Iranian oil from other parts of the Middle East, due to geographical proximity and similarities in the oil produced. However, an IOC official said separately the company could also tap the spot market to buy U.S. oil. “There is an option to buy U.S. oil like Mars, but we will do that if arbitrage is favorable,” the official said. IOC recently bought 3 million barrels of U.S oil via a tender.

2018-05-22,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Top investors in Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Tuesday put pressure on the oil and gas giant to commit to hard targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to battle climate change. Shell has set out “ambitions” to halve carbon emissions by 2050 and expand in renewables, goals Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said were ground breaking for the oil industry. But he clashed with shareholders who had pushed climate to the forefront of the annual general meeting (AGM) and demanded Shell give specifics on how it would turn promises into action. However, a motion that proposed setting targets was defeated. “Nobody else comes close, it is seriously ambitious,” van Beurden told investors when explaining Shell’s plans at the AGM. To view a graphic on Shell carbon reduction goals, click: reut.rs/2JOGJgZ But a growing number of major shareholders, who praised Shell’s overall plans, urged the Anglo-Dutch company to commit to firm targets to reduce carbon emissions from its oil and gas production, as well as from fuels it sells around the world. “We call for this ambition to be translated into firm medium and short term targets, aligned with the Paris Agreement,” a group of 27 investors managing $7.9 trillion in assets said in a statement read at the AGM. The group includes HSBC, BMO Capital Markets, AXA and UBS.  Shell’s board has urged shareholders to vote against a resolution brought forward for a vote at the AGM by activist group Follow This that called on Shell to set targets to reduce emissions and meet the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement goal that aims to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. The resolution was rejected by a majority of 95 percent. The previous two climate resolutions tabled by Follow This in 2016 and 2017 secured support of 2.8 percent and 6.3 percent of the votes, respectively. Van Beurden said that setting targets would hamper Shell’s efforts to adapt to the transition going on in energy. He rejected accusations by Follow This founder Mark van Baal that Shell’s plans fell short of the Paris agreement goals. To view a graphic on Shell emissions, click: reut.rs/2Iya7Hf “The reputation of our company is irrevocably linked to targets,” the chief executive said. “Nobody can see how the energy transition will play out over this period.” Although the Follow This motion was defeated, van Baal said companies were under more pressure to set clear goals. “There is a very clear signal that investors want targets, not ambitions,” he told reporters, adding that “the oil industry can make or break the Paris climate agreement.” Last week, a group of 60 global investors urged companies to do more to reduce emissions and become more transparent about their plans.     Shell announced last year an ambition to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2035 and by half by 2050. The targets include Shell’s operations and emissions from consumers of its products. Producing and burning of oil and gas account for around 50 percent of global carbon emissions. At the AGM, shareholders also approved management’s 2017 remuneration, including van Beurden’s 8.9 million euro package, by an unusually small majority of 75 percent.

2018-05-22,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah and its political allies made significant gains in Lebanon’s parliamentary election, official results showed, boosting an Iranian-backed movement fiercely opposed to Israel and underlining Tehran’s growing regional clout.  The leader of Shi’ite Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, called the result a “a very big political, parliamentary and moral victory for the choice of resistance”.    The number of Hezbollah MPs was the same or little changed, but candidates supported by the group or allied to it gained in major cities. Hezbollah and its political allies won just over half the seats in parliament, according to final results from all but one of Lebanon’s 15 electoral districts.  Branded a terrorist group by the United States, heavily armed Shi’ite Hezbollah has grown in strength since joining the war in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad in 2012. The strong showing by parties and politicians who support Hezbollah’s possession of weapons risk complicating Western policy in Lebanon, which is banking on foreign aid and loans to revive its stagnant economy and receives U.S. military support.  An Israeli minister said the outcome showed the Lebanese state was indistinguishable from Hezbollah, signalling the risk of Israel hitting Lebanon’s government in a future war.     Western-backed Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri lost over a third of his seats, the results showed. He blamed a complex new voting law and gaps in his party’s performance.  But with 21 MPs, down from 33 in the last parliament, he still emerged as the Sunni Muslim leader with the biggest bloc in the 128-seat house, making him the frontrunner to form the next government.   The staunchly anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces, a Christian party, emerged as a big winner, nearly doubling its lawmakers to around 15, according to initial indications. Lebanon’s prime minister must be a Sunni under its sectarian power-sharing system. The new government, like the outgoing one, is expected to include all the main parties. Talks over cabinet posts are expected to take time. “Hariri is going to be further weakened in any kind of government going forward,” said Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute. “His ability to substantially tame or restrain Hezbollah... in Lebanon is going to be very limited.” Official results released late on Monday showed that Hezbollah, along with allied groups and individuals, secured at least 65 seats. The final results for Akkar district have yet to be announced. Seats in parliament are divided according to a strict sectarian quota.  Hezbollah-backed Sunnis won seats in Beirut, Tripoli and Sidon, strongholds of Hariri’s Future Movement, where the army was forced to deploy on Monday evening to break up clashes between Hariri and Hezbollah supporters. The pro-Hezbollah al-Akhbar newspaper declared the election a “slap” for Hariri. Hezbollah-backed winners include Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired Shi’ite general and former Lebanese intelligence chief who is a close friend of Syria’s Assad. Sayyed was one of the most powerful men in Lebanon in the 15 years of Syrian domination that followed the 1975-90 civil war.  At least five other figures who held office then returned to parliament for the first time since Syrian forces quit Lebanon after the 2005 assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, Saad’s father. Faisal Karami, son of the late pro-Syrian prime minister Omar Karami, won a seat for the first time. Iranian media appeared to gloat at Hariri’s setback. The hardline Tasnim news agency ran a report headlined: “Lebanese election result puts an end to Hariri’s monopoly among Sunnis.” Hezbollah’s big allies include the Shi’ite Amal Movement, led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement of President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally since 2006 who has said its arsenal is needed to defend Lebanon. While Hezbollah and its allies do not always see eye to eye, their support for its arsenal is vital to the group in Lebanon, where its weapons have been a major point of friction for years. Hezbollah lost ground in the Baalbek-Hermel constituency, one of its strongholds. Two of 10 seats there were won by its opponents, one by the Lebanese Forces and the other by Future. It also failed to take a Shi’ite seat in Byblos. Turnout was 49.2 percent, down from 54 percent the last time legislative elections were held nine years ago.     An independent candidate running against the political establishment won a seat in Beirut. An anti-Hezbollah coalition led by Hariri and backed by Saudi Arabia won a majority in parliament in 2009. But that “March 14” alliance disintegrated and Riyadh has switched its attention to confronting Iran in other parts of the region, notably Yemen.  Samir Geagea, the Lebanese Forces leader, said the results showed there was still a “popular ground” that backs “March 14” and would “give us strength... to fix the path much more than we were able to in past years”. Geagea is Hezbollah’s most prominent Lebanese Christian opponent. He led the Lebanese Forces militia in the last years of the civil war, during which he was an adversary of Aoun. Hariri has urged the quick formation of a government after the election so it can press ahead with reforms needed to reduce state debt levels, among the highest in the world. He said the international community should look at the election result “in a very positive way”.  Donors want to see reforms before they release some of the $11 billion of aid and soft loans pledged in April. Lebanon has been a big recipient of foreign aid to help it cope with hosting one million refugees from neighbouring Syria. Nasrallah called for the quick formation of a new government and said it should be done in a spirit of cooperation, putting aside differences.  Lebanon should have held a parliamentary election in 2013 but MPs instead voted to extend their own term because leaders could not agree on a new parliamentary election law.  The question of Hezbollah’s weapons has slipped down on Lebanon’s political agenda in recent years. Hariri, who led years of political conflict with the group, says it is an issue to be resolved regionally through dialogue. The Lebanon vote is to be followed on May 12 by an Iraqi election that is also set to underline Iran’s reach, with one of three pro-Tehran Shi’ite leaders set to become prime minister. Iran said it respected Lebanon’s election, while France said the vote was an important step.

2018-05-22,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares inched toward four-month highs on Tuesday, as an easing of pressure on Italy’s debt markets coincided with China’s latest move to open up its giant economy to the rest of the world. A pause in the dollar’s recent rally also meant respite for some battered emerging markets — though still not Turkey — while signs of better U.S. and China trade relations had Wall Street futures pointing higher. [.N][EMRG/FRX]  Early European trading saw Italian government bond yields come off 14-month highs, after six days of heavy selling on concerns over high-spending policies mooted by a potential new ruling coalition.  The proposed tie-up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League has pushed Rome’s 10-year yields up nearly 70 basis points since the start of the month. And plenty of questions remain. [GVD/EUR] “Who will be the next finance minister in Italy, that is the question in the market at the moment,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. One of the names in the frame is Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and former industry minister. “He is seen as quite a eurosceptic,” de Groot added. “It would be quite tough for the market to digest.”  Italy’s main bourse also outperformed as the news flow eased. Europe’s big carmakers Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), BMW and Daimler jumped 1 to 1.6 percent too, after China said it would cut import duty on passenger cars and car parts from July 1.[.EU] Shares of Ford, General Motors and electric car maker Tesla were up between 0.8 percent and 2.4 percent in pre-U.S. market trading. [.N] In Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei had ended 0.2 percent lower and Australian shares fell 0.7 percent. Chinese stocks also finished in the red, with the blue-chip CSI300 off 0.4 percent. [.SS] Analysts said investors in the region were worried about the growth outlook, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans to increase its interest rates pushing up global borrowing costs. “Stocks have rallied several times on the belief that trade tensions were easing, only to fall back down as investors took the opposite view,” said James McGlew, executive director of stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut. A total of three hikes is almost fully priced-in by the market for 2018 although some investors expect the Fed to be more aggressive. The U.S. central bank will publish minutes of its May 2 meeting, when it held rates steady, later this week. Emerging market stocks snapped a three-day losing streak and many of the more beaten-down currencies, such as the South African rand, Mexican peso and Indian rupee, pulled out of their recent dives as the dollar eased back. [EMRG/FRX] Turkey’s lira had initially clawed higher too, only to fall sharply again, to a fresh record low, after another warning about the country’s credit rating. It has now plunged over 18 percent since the start of the year. “The market is clearly screaming out for a massive rate hike, but it’s not getting it, and the (rising) oil price is killing them too,” said Standard Life Aberdeen’s Kevin Daly.   “We are short the lira and short Turkish bonds so we are certainly not being tempted at this point.” The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against the other main world currencies, was last down 0.3 percent at 93.40 from Monday’s five-month top of 94.058, as the euro clawed back above $1.18. [/FRX]  Elsewhere, oil prices bobbed just under highs last seen in 2014 after Venezuela’s weekend presidential election heightened persistent worries about falls in global oil output. The market is bracing for the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on the country following President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election. U.S. crude added 31 cents to $72.55 per barrel and Brent rose 52 cents to $79.73. [O/R] The combination of higher oil and conciliatory actions on the U.S.-China trade front boosted the Australian dollar, a liquid proxy for risk, to a one-month peak.   As the dollar edged back, gold prices eased off December lows to get to $1,294 an ounce.

2018-05-22,"BEIRUT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Iran poured scorn on threatened U.S. sanctions on Tuesday and told European powers to step up and salvage its international nuclear deal - though Germany signalled there was only so much it could do to fend off Washington’s economic clout. Senior Iranian military and political figures queued up to issue defiant statements a day after Washington threatened “the strongest sanctions in history” if Iran failed to make a series of sweeping changes. Two weeks on from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear pact, his administration told Iran to drop its nuclear programme and pull out of the Syrian civil war among other demands, setting Washington and Tehran further on a course of confrontation. “The people of Iran should stand united in the face of this and they will deliver a strong punch to the mouth of the American Secretary of State and anyone who backs them,” Ismail Kowsari, a senior commander with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency. The 2015 nuclear agreement, worked out by the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and Iran, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its atomic programme. Trump called it the worst deal ever negotiated but European powers see it as the best chance of stopping Iran developing a nuclear bomb. After Trump pulled out, the other signatories said they would try to salvage the deal and keep Iran’s oil trade and investment flowing. But European companies say they are worried about getting caught up in the new U.S. sanctions, given the extent of Washington’s global reach, and some have already started pulling out. The head of Iran’s National Security and Foreign Policy committee in parliament said that the only way to salvage the nuclear deal would be for the European signatories to stand up to the United States. “Today they must show their strength in the face of American pressure,” Alaeddin Borujerdi said, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Monday told reporters in Argentina he would travel on from there to Washington to discuss the nuclear deal with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He gave no date for his meeting. Germany’s economy minister earlier told a newspaper the Berlin government would help German firms with business in Iran where it could, but could not entirely shield them from the U.S. decision to quit the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions. Asked how the German government could assist German firms feeling nervous in the wake of the U.S. decision, Peter Altmaier told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that Berlin would help them assess the situation and developments while also urging the U.S. to grant exemptions and deadline extensions. “We will help where we can, but there is no way of completely averting the consequences of this unilateral withdrawal,” he said. His statement was echoed by Luxembourg’s foreign minister Jean Asselborn who said there were limits to the European Union’s powers to persuade its larger firms to stay in Iran in the face of threatened U.S. sanctions. “We know there are hardly any larger companies in Europe that do not also trade with the United States. The pressure on European companies from the U.S. is quite large,” he told reporters in Brussels. “We are in the situation that we’re in.”  “I believe we should not give up, we should try until the end, to show, with our heads held high, that we are right and Mr. Trump is wrong,” he added. French President Emmanuel Macron last week acknowledged the dilemma faced by firms choosing between trading with the biggest economy in the world, the United States, and risking sanctions and massive fines by trading with Iran.

2018-05-22,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Santos (STO.AX) on Tuesday ended talks with Harbour Energy and rejected the U.S.-based firm’s $10.8 billion takeover offer, saying it undervalued the oil and gas producer as oil prices surge. The decision shocked analysts and leaves Harbour, which had tabled an increased and final offer this week, sorely disappointed, after increasing its proposed bid five times in nine months following a steep rise in global crude oil prices.  “(The board) resolved to reject the final proposal on the basis that it does not represent a full value of the company  and, when combined with the associated risks, is not in the best interests of Santos shareholders,” Santos said in a statement.      Santos said both Brent oil and the share prices of its Australian Securities Exchange-listed energy peers had risen since Harbour made an indicative proposal on April 3.  Harbour, which had already secured the support of large shareholders ENN Ecological Holdings (600803.SS) and Hony Capital, said it was disappointed in Santos’s decision to reject a fully funded offer with a “compelling” premium, adding there was insufficient engagement from its board.  “There was ... no meaningful attempt by Santos to discuss a realistic price which could be supported by any reasonable set of technical and commercial assumptions,” Harbour said in an emailed statement, where it added that it remained open to engage constructively with the board.     “Harbour remains of the view that all shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to decide for themselves on the merits of our offer,” it said, without saying whether it would consider a hostile bid.  A source close to Harbour said a hostile approach was unlikely. The source spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.  Shares in the oil and gas producer had risen on the back of the sweetened proposals to A$6.4 per share, giving the company a market value of A$13.4 billion ($10.17 billion) - that was still below the offer price amid uncertainty over whether the deal would go ahead. Oil prices LCOc1 have risen about 17 percent since Santos received Harbour’s initial $4.98 per share offer in April. [O/R] Santos, a recently revived company with a low cost of gas production and stakes in liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Asia-Pacific, where demand is soaring, said its own strategy could achieve “superior” value.  “Santos has had regard to ... the superior value for shareholders that the Santos Board believes could be realized through the execution of Santos’ existing strategy, capitalizing on its strong free cash flows, sustainable low cost operating model and significant growth opportunities,” the company said in the statement.  RBC Capital markets said the rejection was a surprise, and put the board and executive team under pressure to demonstrate it can deliver value to shareholders.  “The rejection is a shock to us as we saw the bid price as very much full,” RBC analysts wrote in a note to clients.  “The onus is now firmly on the board and executive to execute strategy, grow the company and hope that oil, gas and LNG prices do not retreat materially,” they added. Citing other drawbacks to the offer, Santos said Harbour’s final bid was highly leveraged on private equity, and that Santos would have to provide fundraising support to Harbour and hedge a large part of its oil-linked production.  The deal had also been subject to approval by Australia’s foreign investment regulator.

2018-05-22," (This May 18 story corrects reference to Iran in second paragraph to Islamic Republic.) By Alissa de Carbonnel TEHRAN (Reuters) - Europe’s energy chief will seek to reassure Iran’s top ministers on Saturday that the European Union wants to keep trade open despite the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal. Miguel Arias Canete, European commissioner for energy and climate, will meet with five top Iranian minister over two days, including the Islamic Republic’s nuclear chief, oil minister and foreign minister. EU leaders have united behind the 2015 accord, with Brussels considering banning EU-based firms from complying with the sanctions that President Donald Trump has reimposed and urging governments to make money transfers to Iran’s central bank to avoid fines. But EU officials admit there is a limit to what they can do to parry sanctions as a wave of European companies quit business with Tehran, fearing the global reach of U.S. sanctions. “There is no magic wand beyond trying to offer Iran a bit of reassurance,” a senior EU official involved in Iran talks told Reuters. The mission led by Canete is a symbolic gesture to urge Iran’s leadership to stick to the nuclear deal and shore up support for the relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani against hardliners looking to constrain his ability to open up to the West, EU officials said. “The mission is very important to us because it shows the EU’s determination to stand by its commitment,” a senior Iranian official said. Europe sees the pact, limiting Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the relaxation of economic sanctions, as vital for international security.  Trump denounced it as “the worst deal ever” for failing to curb Iran’s separate ballistic missile programme and its influence in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. With the reimposition of U.S. sanctions threatening the accord’s economic payoff for Tehran, EU diplomats worry they will lose what little sway they have in the Islamic Republic. Canete will raise with Tehran the possibility of EU governments bypassing the U.S. financial system by making direct payments to Iran for oil exports and to repatriate Iranian funds in Europe - though the move will be up to member states. In other efforts to shield European firms, the EU’s “blocking statute” would ban EU companies from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce American penalties. The EU is also seeking to allow the European Investment Bank to do business in Iran and to scale up euro-denominated credit lines from EU states. But some big names are already heading for the door. French energy group Total said it may quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project that Tehran had repeatedly hailed as a symbol of the nuclear accord’s success. The first sanctions to snap back into place are limits on Iranian oil exports that choked off more than half of Iran’s oil exports after 2012 - largely due to European and Asian buyers cutting back. “One of the big factors for how the Iranians will react is what oil importers will do and how well the energy system can cope,” another EU official said. “It will be difficult for us to deliver on the benefits the Iranians are expecting.” FACTBOX-Iran sanctions risk Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; editing by Jon Boyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-europe/corrected-after-trumps-withdrawal-from-nuclear-pact-eu-energy-chief-courts-iran-idUKL5N1SP1KZ,22 May 2018,"Europe's energy chief will seek

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Tuesday it had charged Basil Al Jarah and Ziad Akle with conspiracy to give corrupt payments to secure the award of a $733 million (545 million pounds) contract to Leighton Contractors Singapore PTE Ltd for a project to build two oil pipelines in southern Iraq. Al Jarah, 68, who was Unaoil’s Iraq partner, was charged with two offences of conspiracy. Akle, 43, who was Unaoil’s territory manager for Iraq, was charged with one offence, the SFO said.  Akle and Al Jarah have been told to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 23.   Akle and Jarah were charged in November by requisition with conspiracy to make corrupt payments to secure contracts in Iraq to Unaoil’s client SBM Offshore between June 2005 and August 2011.

2018-05-22," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are rolling forward long positions in the Brent futures contract, and in the absence of offsetting factors this is depressing the value of expiring contracts, pushing futures prices into contango. Since the end of June 2017 hedge funds and other money managers have built up a near-record net long position in Brent in the expectation that prices will continue to rise. Hedge funds held long futures and options positions equivalent to almost 615 million barrels on May 15, according to position reports published by the Intercontinental Exchange. These were partially offset by short positions amounting to 66 million barrels, giving a net long of almost 549 million barrels. Fund managers also held 374 million barrels of positions in the calendar spreads, offsetting long and short positions in different contract months. Some positions were held in the form of options, but most were futures, with a net long position in futures alone amounting to 519 million barrels. For the Brent contract as a whole, the total number of open positions in futures across all maturities and all market participants was equivalent to 2,704 million barrels. Of all the open positions, almost 44 percent were concentrated in the first three contracts expiring in July 2018 (437 million barrels), August 2018 (463 million barrels) and September 2018 (281 million barrels). Unless the hedge fund positions were distributed very differently to other market participants, a substantial number must have been held in the first three months. In fact, many fund managers, especially those following momentum-based strategies, have a strong preference for liquidity, so they tend to hold their position in the closest and most liquid contract months. But as those contracts approach expiry, positions must be rolled forward or allowed to terminate automatically with the passage of time (tmsnrt.rs/2Ln8DBI). (Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LkQO6q) (Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2Ln8DBI) The rolling forward of long positions tends to push the front end of the futures curve from backwardation towards contango because they involve the simultaneous sale of a near-term contract and purchase of one further forward. Of course, for every long position there is a short, and the rolling of short positions tends to have the opposite effect, pushing the market from contango towards backwardation. In theory, the impact of rolling forward long and short positions should be neutral. In practice, different groups of market participants employ different strategies and have a different impact on price formation. Hedge funds and other money managers tend to be dynamic price-makers rather than passive price-takers because they trade on expectations of where prices will move in future. The sheer number of hedge fund long positions already established in the market and needing to be rolled forward each month is now weighing on prices at the front end of the curve. While fund managers were still accumulating net longs between June 2017 and March 2018, the negative impact on near-term calendar spreads was masked by the amount of new buying each month. But hedge funds have been reducing their net position in Brent since the middle of April. The net position has been cut by 84 million barrels, or 13 percent, since April 10. If the problem of rolled longs persists, many more hedge funds are likely to try to escape it by shifting positions further along the curve towards contracts expiring in 2019 or 2020.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-05-22,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore authorities have levied new charges against a group of fuel thieves operating at Royal Dutch Shell’s oil refinery in the city-state, raising the value of the stolen fuel to over $40 million (30 million pounds) from around $10 million in earlier charges, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday.  Five former employees of Shell’s (RDSa.L) Singapore subsidiary received 51 additional charges in court on Friday for suspected theft at the Pulau Bukom refinery, Shell’s biggest, to bring the total allegations against them to 63 each, the documents showed.  The charges relate to incidents involving a total of 66,141 metric tonnes of gasoil valued at around $32.1 million between late April 2017 through to early January this year.     An additional three former Shell employees received eight additional charges for incidents involving 16,394 metric tonnes of gasoil valued at around $8.4 million, raising their total allegations to 15. The values given in the court documents were a mix of Singapore dollars and U.S. dollars and Reuters converted them based on Tuesday’s exchange rate.  Pulau Bukom is located on an island just south of the main island of Singapore. Southeast Asia is a hot spot for illegal fuel trading but the regularity of the thefts, many of which occurred during working hours, has prompted the company to take measures to improve security.  “We continue to be disappointed by what we uncovered last year,” a Shell spokeswoman said in an emailed response to Reuters.  “We are already taking short- and long-term actions to improve,” the spokeswoman said. Those measures include closer monitoring of products moving in and out of Pulau Bukom, tightening vessel management procedures, and stepping up ethics and compliance training for employees.  The Shell spokeswoman also said it is working with government authorities and industry associations to address the wider issue of oil theft. The Singapore police said investigations related to the Shell case were still ongoing. Shell first contacted Singapore authorities about suspected theft at its refinery back in August. That prompted a raid earlier this year which led to several arrests and the seizure of a tanker and millions of dollars in cash. Initial charges from the first months of the investigation related to around $10 million worth of oil. There have also been charges related to the thefts brought against former employees of one of Singapore’s biggest marine fuel suppliers Sentek Marine & Trading Pte Ltd; a Singaporean who worked for Intertek (ITRK.L), a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products; and three Vietnamese nationals who allegedly received stolen property aboard ships.

2018-05-22,"(Repeats story published Monday with no changes) By Scott DiSavino May 22 (Reuters) - China’s interest in reducing its trade surplus with United States through increased energy imports could advance plans for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, said energy executives involved in developing new facilities. The White House and China on Saturday said a U.S. trade team would travel to China to explore new energy and agricultural deals. The joint communique lowered trade tensions, lifting stock markets in Asia and the United States on Monday. There are over two dozen proposed U.S. LNG plants waiting for customer commitments to reach a final investment decision, many of them looking to China for deals. About 13 percent of U.S. LNG cargos went to China last year, according to data provider Genscape. China imported 5.6 billion cubic feet per day last year, making it the world’s largest buyer after Japan. “We see it as a positive development,” said William Daughdrill, director of health, safety and environmental at Delfin Midstream. Its chief executive was in Asia last week pursuing customers, Daughdrill said. Delfin is proposing a floating LNG facility in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and aiming for a final investment decision as early as this year to go ahead and produce up to 13 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export. “For us, it’s strictly been about marketing to China,” said Greg Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd, which is developing an LNG plant in Louisiana and another in Nova Scotia in Canada. It hopes to reach a final investment decision on the U.S. project by year-end and begin exports in 2022, he said. “If you look at some forecasts for 2035, there are really only two places that have significant increases in LNG imports. Europe goes up about 100 mtpa and China goes up about 200 mtpa,” Vesey said. Texas LNG, which is proposing a 4-mtpa export facility in Brownsville, Texas, and has five early-stage agreements with Chinese customers, hopes to make a final decision next year, about six months behind its original goal. “Sentiment in the LNG markets is heating up again,” said Langtry Meyer, co-founder of the company. Texas LNG is not considering developing an import terminal in China, he said, which would likely be needed to expand U.S. exports. Cheniere Energy Inc this month said it would soon make a final investment decision on a third liquefaction line at its Corpus Christi, Texas, facility. A spokesman on Monday declined further comment on its decision. Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Gary

2018-05-22,"* Investors managing $7.9 trln in assets call for targets * Shell says targets will limit its ability to adapt * Shell urges shareholders to oppose AGM resolution By Ron Bousso THE HAGUE, May 22 (Reuters) - Top investors in Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday stepped up pressure on the oil and gas giant to commit to hard targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to battle climate change. Shell has set out “ambitions” to halve carbon emissions by 2050 and expand in renewables energy, which Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said were ground breaking for the oil industry. “Nobody else comes close, it is seriously ambitious,” van Beurden said of Shell’s plan at the company’s annual general meeting in The Hague. While praising Shell for its plan, a growing number of major shareholders has urged the Anglo-Dutch company to commit to hard targets to reduce carbon emissions from its oil and gas production, as well as from fuels it sells around the world. “We call for this ambition to be translated into firm medium and short term targets, aligned with the Paris Agreement,” a group of 27 investors managing $7.9 trillion in assets said in a statement read at the AGM. Shell’s board has urged shareholders to vote against a resolution brought forward for a vote at the AGM by activist group Follow This calling on Shell to set hard targets to reduce emissions in order to meet the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement goal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. Van Beurden warned that doing so would hamper Shell’s efforts to adapt to the transition going on in energy. “The reputation of our company is irrevocably linked to targets... Nobody can see how the energy transition will play out over this period,” van Beurden said. The previous two climate resolutions tabled by Follow This in 2016 and 2017 won the support of 2.8 percent and 6.3 percent of the votes, respectively. Last week, a group of 60 global investors urged companies to do more to reduce emissions and become more transparent about their plans. Shell announced late last year an ambition to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 percent by 2035 and by half by 2050. The targets will include all of Shell’s operations as well as emissions from products consumed by consumers. Producing and burning of oil and gas account for around 50 percent of global carbon emissions.

2018-05-22,"* European shares hit four month, Italy bond sell-off relents * Dollar eases off five-month highs, EM FX rebounds * Oil hovers just under 2014 highs By Marc Jones LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - European shares inched to a near four-month high on Tuesday, as an easing of pressure on Italian markets coincided with China’s latest move to open up its giant economy to the rest of the world. A pause in the dollar’s recent rally also meant some respite for emerging markets, tempting some investors back into hard-hit assets of countries like Turkey and South Africa. Early European trading saw Italian government bond yields come off 14-month highs, after six days of heavy selling on concerns over high-spending policies mooted by a potential new ruling coalition. The proposed tie-up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League has pushed Rome’s 10-year yields up nearly 70 basis points since the start of the month. And plenty of questions remain. “Who will be the next finance minister in Italy, that is the question in the market at the moment,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. One of the names in the frame is Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old economist and former industry minister. “He is seen as quite a eurosceptic,” de Groot added. “It would be quite tough for the market to digest.” Italy’s main bourse also outperformed as the news flow eased. Europe’s big carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler jumped 1 to 1.6 percent too, after China said it would cut import duty on passenger cars and car parts from July 1. In Asia overnight, Japan’s Nikkei had ended 0.2 percent lower and Australian shares fell 0.7 percent. Chinese stocks finished in the red too, with the blue-chip CSI300 off 0.4 percent. Analysts said investors in the region were worried about the growth outlook, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s plans to increase its interest rates pushing up global borrowing costs. “Stocks have rallied several times on the belief that trade tensions were easing, only to fall back down as investors took the opposite view,” said James McGlew, executive director of stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut. A total of three hikes is almost fully priced-in by the market for 2018 although some investors expect the Fed to be more aggressive. Emerging market stocks snapped a three-day losing streak and many of the more beaten-down currencies, such as the Turkish lira and South African rand, pulled out of their recent dives as the dollar pulled back. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against the main world currencies, was last down 0.3 percent at 93.40 from Monday’s five-month top of 94.058 as the euro clawed back above $1.18 too. Elsewhere, oil prices bobbed just under highs last seen in 2014 after Venezuela’s weekend presidential election heightened persistent worries about falls in global oil output. The market is bracing for the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on the country following President Nicolas Maduro’s re-election. U.S. crude added 26 cents to $72.50 per barrel and Brent rose 19 cents to $79.40. The combination of higher oil and conciliatory actions on the U.S.-China trade front boosted the Australian dollar , a liquid proxy for risk, to a one-month peak. As the dollar edged back, gold prices eased off December lows to get to $1,294 an ounce. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-05-22,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military commander poured scorn on U.S. threats to tighten sanctions on Tuesday, saying the Islamic Republic’s people would respond by punching U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the mouth. Pompeo said on Monday Washington would impose new penalties if Tehran did not make sweeping changes, including dropping its nuclear program and pulling out of the Syrian civil war. Two weeks after President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, his administration has threatened to impose “the strongest sanctions in history,” setting Washington and Tehran further on a course of confrontation. “The people of Iran should stand united in the face of this and they will deliver a strong punch to the mouth of the American Secretary of State and anyone who backs them,” Ismail Kowsari, the deputy commander of the Sarollah Revolutionary Guards base in Tehran said, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency.     Limiting Iran’s missile capabilities was one of Pompeo’s main demands. “Who are you and America to tell us to limit the range of ballistic missiles?” Kowsari said, according to ILNA. “History has shown that with the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America is the top criminal with regard to missiles,” he added. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the branch of the Revolutionary Guards that carries out operations outside Iran’s borders, was singled out by Pompeo as a top troublemaker in the Middle East. Kowsari said that the Iranian people back Soleimani. “Soleimani is not a single person. The great people of Iran support him,” Kowsari said. Separately, Iran’s government spokesman said that the plan outlined by Pompeo would exacerbate the public’s hostility to the United States. “Do the Americans think that the silk glove that they’ve taken out and the iron hand that they’ve extended to the people, a hand that’s backed by Israel and the [Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization], will make Iranian people think that America wants democracy?” Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said on Tuesday, according to state media. The Mujahedin-e-Khalq Organization (MKO) is an exiled Iranian armed opposition group which has called for the overthrow of the Iranian government for decades. John Bolton, the U.S. national security advisor, has been a supporter of the MKO, which the Iranian government sees as a terrorist group.

2018-05-22,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China rebuffed U.S. concerns about its ties with Venezuela on Tuesday after Washington imposed new sanctions on the crisis-stricken oil-producing country following the re-election of its socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, hailed his win in Sunday’s election as a victory against “imperialism”. But his main challengers alleged irregularities and refused to recognise the result. In response to the vote, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting Venezuela’s ability to liquidate state assets and debt in the United States, the latest in a series of sanctions that seeks to choke off financing for the already cash-strapped government. While the order applies only to U.S. citizens and residents, a senior U.S. official said the Trump administration had had “fairly pointed discussions” with China and Russia over the issuing of new credit to Venezuela. Maduro has counted on the support of China and Russia, which have provided billions of dollars in funding in recent years. Asked what China had told the United States in response to its concern about Chinese loans to Caracas, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believes the United States and Venezuela should resolve their differences via talks. “China develops normal relations with other countries in the world, including normal cooperation. I think other countries should not make irresponsible remarks about this,” Lu said, without elaborating.

2018-05-22,"BANGKOK, May 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Farmers and fishermen in western India have welcomed a U.S. Supreme Court decision to hear their lawsuit against a World Bank agency, which financed a power plant they blame for damaging the environment and their livelihoods. The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an appeal by the villagers of a lower court ruling that the International Finance Corp (IFC) was immune from such lawsuits under federal law. The court must now consider for the first time whether international organisations are immune from such suits under federal law, according to the advocacy group EarthRights International (ERI), which is representing the plaintiffs. “This is a big victory for us,” said Bharat Patel, a plaintiff and general secretary of the fishermen’s group Machimar Adhikar Sangharsh Sangatha. “We fought for so many years to be heard. This decision gives us hope,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The case revolves around the IFC’s decision in 2008 to provide $450 million in loans for a coal-fired plant operated by a Tata Power unit near Mundra, in Gujarat state. Loans from the IFC include provisions requiring that certain environmental standards will be met. But the 4,000 megawatt plant - billed as key to providing cheap energy and creating jobs - has had a “devastating and irreversible impact” on the coastal ecosystem, according to the submission by villagers who live near the plant. Coal ash damages crops, water for drinking and irrigation have been contaminated, while discharges from the plant’s cooling system have reduced fish stocks, they said. Lead plaintiff Budha Ismail Jam and others sued in federal court in Washington in 2015, saying the IFC had failed to meet its obligations. Representatives for Tata Power and the World Bank in India did not respond to e-mails seeking comment. A district court in 2016 and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2017 ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the IFC is immune from such litigation under a 1945 law. The question before the Supreme Court now is whether there are limits to immunity for entities like the IFC under the 1945 International Organizations Immunity Act. That law gives international organisations “the same immunity” from suit “as is enjoyed by foreign governments”. However, governments “are not entitled to immunity from suits arising out of their commercial activities” under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, according to ERI. “Since a foreign government would not be immune from this suit, the IFC, which is made up of foreign states, should not be immune either,” it said. The court will hear arguments and decide the case in its next term, which begins in October. (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Jared Ferrie.

Europe was set for a muted start, with futures for London’s FTSE index and the Eurostoxx 50 up 0.1 percent each but E-Minis for the S&P 500 were flat. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.2 percent lower and Australian shares fell 0.7 percent. Chinese stocks were in the red too with the blue-chip CSI300 off 0.5 percent. Liquidity was relatively thin due to holidays in South Korea and Hong Kong. Even though most major Asian markets edged lower, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to eke out a small 0.17 percent gain. The index is well below an all-time peak of 617.12 points hit in January, and is flat so far this year after a super-charged 33.5 percent gain in 2017. “We are seeing U.S. dollar strength and that is causing money to flow out from emerging markets to the U.S. There is some sort of risk aversion going on,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “People are cautious about taking exposure in emerging markets.” Those concerns offset the boost to sentiment from overnight gains on Wall Street over the apparent reconciliation between the United States and China over import duties.

A total of three hikes is almost fully priced-in by the market for 2018 although some investors expect the Fed to be more aggressive.

2018-05-22,"* To transfer 451,000 tonnes per year of capacity from Henan * Joins others in courting Yunnan’s hydropower potential * Construction of two-phase project to start in July By Tom Daly BEIJING, May 22 (Reuters) - China’s Henan Shenhuo Coal & Power Co will transfer more than 450,000 tonnes per year of aluminium smelting capacity to the southwestern province of Yunnan, according to a provincial government notice. The move illustrates Yunnan’s increasing popularity as a location for aluminium smelters in China, the world’s biggest producer of the metal. The companies are keen to tap the province’s large hydropower capacity to replace their current coal-fired plants for the power needed during the electric-intensive smelting process. The Yunnan Industry and Information Technology Commission said late on Monday that Yunnan Shenhuo Aluminium Co, a unit of Henan-based Shenhuo, had completed the formalities to transfer 451,100 tonnes per year of smelting capacity to the province. This represents the first phase of a 900,000 tonnes per year two-phase integrated hydropower and aluminium smelting project Shenhuo is building in Yunnan, it said. Construction is expected to start on July 18, with production to begin in a year. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology allows smelters to move or acquire new capacity in regions that have available quotas. “Yunnan is a hot spot,” said Jackie Wang, an aluminium analyst at consultants CRU in Beijing, noting that another Chinese smelter, Sichuan Qiya, had recently decided to relocate 350,000 tonnes per year of capacity to the province. The Yunnan Industry and Information Technology Commission announced that transfer on May 10, saying the company was having trouble building a planned project with the same capacity in the Xinjiang region in northwest China. Yunnan’s hydropower provides an alternative to coal-fired power generation and that will help smelters produce “green metal,” said Wang. State-run Aluminum Corp of China , or Chinalco, is planning to link up with existing companies in Yunnan. Shenhuo Coal & Power could not immediately be reached for comment. The 451,100 tonnes of capacity in Yunnan is replacing a total of 510,000 tonnes at three plants in the central Chinese province of Henan that the group has already closed down. The first of these, a 60,000 tonne-per-year facility, stopped production in 2010 and was demolished in 2017, while the last, a 210,000 tonne-per-year plant, was only closed last month and is to be demolished in December. $1 = 6.3763 Chinese yuan renminbi

In the short-term, analysts expect stocks to trend higher. “As trade tensions settle and peak growth/earnings anxieties subside, the clouds are lifting for stocks,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “However, obstacles still exist on the horizon,” they added, pointing to the future path of Fed tightening. It was the fear of higher inflation and thus faster Fed rate rises that caused a bond market rout earlier this year, sending yields sharply higher and causing a share market sell-off. “Thus any China trade celebration may only last a couple of weeks as investors turn their focus to the June 13 Fed meeting.” Two more rate hikes are almost fully priced-in by the market for this year, taking the tally for 2018 to three, although some investors expect the Fed to be more aggressive. The dollar hovered near five-month highs against a basket of currencies, boosted by the U.S.-China trade optimism. The dollar index was last down 0.1 percent at 93.52 from Monday’s top of 94.058. The euro held at $1.1784, within spitting distance of a more than six-month trough of $1.1715 touched on Monday amid continued political uncertainty in Italy. Italy’s far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and to implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of the country’s debt pile. Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level since April 2017 before easing back. The Japanese yen steadied near four-month lows at 110.99 per dollar, while sterling paused at $1.3431 after two straight sessions of losses ahead of key data that could determine whether the Bank of England raises rates in 2018. In emerging markets, Turkey’s lira was among the worst performers on concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy and the central bank’s inability to rein in double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, oil prices soared to their highest since 2014 after Venezuela’s presidential election spurred worries that the country’s oil output could fall further. The market is also weighing the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on the country. U.S. crude added 24 to $72.48 per barrel and Brent rose 17 cents to $79.33. Gold prices steadied after sinking to the lowest since late December, with spot gold last at $1,292.12.

2018-05-22,"* Venezuela vote stokes concerns over oil supply from country * Oil markets tight on OPEC cuts, looming U.S. sanctions on Iran * U.S., China appear to step back from brink of trade war By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, May 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday amid worries that Venezuela’s crude output could drop further following a disputed presidential election in the country and with potential sanctions on the OPEC-member. Brent crude futures were at $79.37 per barrel at 0110 GMT, up 15 cents, from their last close. Brent broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014 last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $72.49 a barrel, up 25 cents from their previous settlement. “The markets’ positive take on ‘no trade war’ and Venezuela’s political woes are driving oil prices higher,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro faced widespread international condemnation on Monday after his re-election in a weekend vote his critics denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken oil producer. The United States is actively considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, where output has dropped by a third in two years to its lowest in decades. “Tightening the economic screws will severely cripple ... Venezuela’s ability to export while making it virtually impossible for the country to acquire dollars,” said Innes. Meanwhile, Washington and Beijing both claimed victory on Monday as the world’s two largest economies stepped back from the brink of a global trade war and agreed to hold further talks to boost U.S. exports to China. Elsewhere, concerns that looming U.S. sanctions on Iran will curb that country’s crude exports have also been boosting oil prices in recent weeks. OANDA’s Innes said that and the impact of output curbs led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had created “ultra-tight” supply conditions, with any signs of supply disruption sending prices sharply higher. “Supply-side dynamics are apparently in the driver’s seat, suggesting prices should push higher near-term,” he said.

2018-05-22,"SANTA MARIA DE DOTA, Costa Rica, May 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - C limbing the steep slope by his house, Fernando Solis Arguedas examined a leaf on one of his 50-year-old trees that produces arabica beans for the world’s first officially certified carbon neutral coffee. Blaming an increasingly unpredictable climate for the first spots of roya fungus, he explained how sustainable techniques such as reducing chemical sprays and planting more shade trees meant higher prices for his coffee cooperative, Coopedota. But forget organic. Carbon neutral produce has become the buzz term in the Central American nation of 5 million people as countries look to slash greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while feeding growing populations. “It’s the trend, but it means we can put our coffee in the international market and if the market is at $120, we might get $180 or $200,” said Solis, the third generation of his family to farm coffee. “Although in reality a lot goes in costs, we think we come out better,” he said, watching the hawks drifting on currents of warm air over the town of Santa Maria de Dota, some 70 km (40 miles) south of the capital San Jose. Costa Rica is now home to three zero emission coffee companies plus some carbon neutral banana, pineapple and cattle producers, putting the nation at the forefront of a movement that is slowly growing. Coffee is not the only drink going carbon neutral. Companies in Sri Lanka, India and China are producing zero emission tea. Coffee production has played a major role in Costa Rica’s history and it is famed for its high-quality arabica varieties. It is the world’s 14th largest coffee producer although it only accounts for about one percent of the world’s coffee. ECO-PARADISE But with a reputation for being environmentally friendly, Costa Rica set itself an ambitious - and increasingly improbable - target in 2007 to become carbon neutral by 2021, which means tackling the 37 percent of its emissions coming from farming. Coffee makes up nearly 10 percent of its total emissions. Globally agriculture, forestry and other land use accounts for about 24 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Persuading Costa Rica’s coffee farmers to switch fertilisers or mills to cut energy and water consumption or turn pulp into biogas, is helping lower costs alongside their environmental footprint, said people in the coffee industry. Many are keen to adapt as the changing climate clouds the future for producers, prompting the government recently to lift a 30-year ban on planting robusta trees that are more heat and disease resistant than arabica. But getting consumers on board remains a major challenge as producing zero emission coffee comes with costs. Inside the vast Coopedota facility in Santa Maria de Dota - where most livelihoods are tied to coffee - millions of beans are sorted into sacks as the smell of roasting coffee pervades. In the quality control room, a pair of tasters tested dozens of cups of coffee, comparing the fragrance and notes from the brews before spitting the remainder into steel beakers. Although it is now ranked as the world’s first carbon neutral coffee company, the 900-member cooperative originally set out to cut costs and increase efficiency but along the way realised the environmental benefits of the new processes. Now with water consumption down 80 percent and energy use 40 percent lower, it uses coffee husks instead of firewood to dry beans in cylinders, said environmental manager Adrian Cordero. Coopedota tracks the emissions produced at each stage, from planting and fertilising the seeds, taking the coffee cherries from the farm to be depulped, the beans dried and in some cases roasted - buying carbon credits to offset part of its impact. Cordero said the cooperative exports about half its coffee to the United States and the rest to newer markets in Asia where people are willing to pay the higher price. “The social angle, the environmental angle, ensures our prices don’t go down,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Cordero acknowledged that becoming carbon neutral was a slow process and required hefty initial investments for Coopedota. The cooperative secures contracts several years in advance, which is security for farmers change the way or crops they farm. However facing stiff competition from bigger coffee producers such as Brazil, low or zero emission coffee gives Costa Rica an edge, said Carlos Fonseca Castro, technical manager at the country’s ICAFE coffee institute. Costa Rica was the first to adopt a Nationally Appropriated Mitigation Action (NAMA) plan to help coffee producers cut emissions. It now has a plan in place for cattle. While only three coffee companies are certified carbon neutral, more are working to slash emissions, seeing knock-on cost benefits, said Fonseca at ICAFE on San Jose’s outskirts. “It’s not necessarily expensive but it’s a change of mentality around (coffee) production and processing,” he said. However he said difficulties in accurately measuring how carbon is stored and the need to buy credits was a disincentive. Roberto Azofeifa, head of the Ministry of Agriculture’s agro-environmental production programme, said training and loans were helping farmers speed up to reduce environmental impact. But raising consumer awareness and finding niche markets for carbon neutral products remained a hurdle. “The carbon neutral target is inspiring people to do interesting things and even if they don’t have certification, they’re doing important work such as reducing emissions through waste reuse,” said Azofeifa, in his San Jose office. “How to convince the consumer to be part of this trend is an enormous challenge.” Sri Lanka’s Bogawantalawa Tea Estates, which became carbon neutral this year, is confident buyers will catch on to carbon neutral as they did with organic products. “When we mention it’s carbon neutral, they are very much interested because they also are able to mention this on their packs,” said Shivashankary Rajarammohan, head of corporate social responsibility. Eventually companies may have to show their carbon footprint as they do with nutritional values, said Peter Laderach, climate specialist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. ""It's the same as food safety and traceability. Consumers get more informed and they just want to know they're buying the right thing,"" he said.

2018-05-22,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington and Beijing both claimed victory on Monday as the world’s two largest economies stepped back from the brink of a global trade war and agreed to hold further talks to boost U.S. exports to China.  Over the weekend, the two sides pledged to keep talking about how China could import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States so as to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China, although details and a firm timeline were thin. The biggest immediate beneficiary appeared to be China, which won a reprieve from threatened tariffs on $50 billion of its exports to the United States as well as a lifeline for ZTE Corp, China’s second biggest telecom equipment maker whose existence had been threatened by U.S. sanctions.  The United States, meanwhile, appeared to have won promises of more imports by China, although there were no specifics. Threatened U.S. restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States also appeared to be put on the back burner. The U.S. Treasury said it met a legal obligation to report progress to President Donald Trump on the development of such restrictions, but it declined to provide details. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin “discussed options for the president’s consideration on the matter,” a Treasury spokeswoman said.  The Treasury has considered invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, used extensively after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, to limit Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies. Economists at Morgan Stanley estimated that exports of U.S. agricultural products, primarily beef, and energy, mostly liquified natural gas, could add between $60 billion and $90 billion to sales to China over a period of years. That is far less than the $200 billion reduction in China’s trade surplus that Trump demanded at the start of talks. “China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday. China’s government praised the cooling of trade tensions with the United States, saying agreement was in both nations’ interests, while state media trumpeted what it said was Beijing’s refusal to surrender to U.S. economic threats. There were, however, more questions for the Trump administration, which stands accused by critics of selling out on plans to stop the theft of U.S. companies’ trade secrets in exchange for a quick deal to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. Questions also remained over the administration’s handling of ZTE. The Chinese company was sanctioned by Washington after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran and effectively put out of business, but its fate was made a precondition of last week’s trade talks in a conversation between Trump and President Xi Jinping. Trump agreed to allow ZTE to stay in business, and the United States and China struck a deal to drop their tariff threats while they worked on a wider trade agreement, Mnuchin said on Sunday. Washington had threatened to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports unless Beijing rectified its theft of U.S. intellectual property. After China responded with its own tariffs on U.S. agriculture, Trump threatened to impose duties on an additional $100 billion of Chinese goods, a move that hit global stock markets hard due to fears of rising protectionism. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to China next week to help finalize a trade agreement, Mnuchin said on Monday. Most observers say a firm deal is likely to take a long time. In an interview earlier on Monday with CNBC, Mnuchin characterized the U.S. tariff plan as suspended, but warned that “the president can always put tariffs back on.” Speaking at a daily briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said both countries had clearly recognized that reaching a consensus was good for all. “China has never hoped for any tensions between China and the United States, in the trade or other arenas,” Lu said. But others were quick to point out how the country had successfully defended its interests. Mei Xinyu, a Commerce Ministry researcher, wrote on the WeChat account of the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily that the agreement preserved China’s right to develop its economy as it sees fit, including moving up the value chain. The deal also focused on China’s “positive position” to increase imports rather than a “negative position” of getting it to cut exports, Mei said. The official China Daily said everyone could heave a sigh of relief at the ratcheting down of the rhetoric, and cited China’s chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, as saying the talks had proved to be “positive, pragmatic, constructive and productive.” “Despite all the pressure, China didn’t ‘fold,’ as U.S. President Donald Trump observed. Instead, it stood firm and continually expressed its willingness to talk,” the English-language newspaper said in an editorial. Some in U.S. business groups who had been pushing for tougher measures to pressure China to ease long-standing market barriers on U.S. companies expressed disappointment.  James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Trump administration’s decision to walk back its threatened trade actions was premature and a “lost opportunity” for American companies, workers and consumers.  But Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, called the apparent de-escalation in trade tensions “a great bit of progress.” “We were never supportive of tariffs, so any actions that can be taken to stop those from being implemented are positive from our view,” Parker told Reuters. Stocks with major exposure to China such as Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc gained on news of a softening in the trade rhetoric of recent weeks. The dollar also gained against a basket of currencies.
