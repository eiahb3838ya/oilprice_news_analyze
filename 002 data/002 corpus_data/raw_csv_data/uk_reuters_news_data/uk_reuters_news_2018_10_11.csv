2018-10-11,"MEXICO CITY/CARACAS (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) is negotiating the sale of its stake in a Venezuelan oil joint venture to Paris-based Maurel & Prom (MAUP.PA), three sources said this week, a move to scale down its crude business in the ailing OPEC-member country to focus on gas. The Anglo-Dutch company is seeking to sell its 40 percent stake in Petroregional del Lago, a joint venture with Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA in the western state of Zulia near Colombia.  The area has been plagued by frequent theft of equipment and near-daily power cuts as Venezuela remains mired in deep recession, hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine. Foreign companies also have complained in private that joint ventures with PDVSA are stymied by convoluted bureaucracy, dodgy contracts, and lack of resources, according to dozens of sources in the industry.  At Petroregional, Shell has grown frustrated by delays in receiving dividends from PDVSA and a ban on minority partners independently exporting production, one of the sources said. That has deprived Petroregional, which in 2016 produced about 33,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, of much-needed income and dented profitability, the source added.  Its potential sale is being analysed by Venezuela’s Oil Ministry, according to two of the sources. The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak about the negotiations.  In the last few weeks a disagreement with Venezuela has emerged over a fee called an entrance bonus that Maurel & Prom would have to pay to the government, as required by Venezuelan law, to gain access to the field’s reserves, two of the sources said. Negotiations are currently on hold, they added. “Everything was going very well but suddenly there were discrepancies over the entrance bonus,” one of the sources said. The persons were unaware of a possible price tag negotiated between Shell and Maurel & Prom, whose main stakeholder is Indonesian state energy firm Pertamina [PERTM.UL]. Shell declined to comment. Maurel & Prom, Pertamina, PDVSA and Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for information. Pertamina in 2013 tried to enter Venezuela by buying a stake in another joint venture, Petrodelta, but did not receive government approval. Maurel & Prom has traditionally been focussed on Africa, but it has also formed strategic alliances with Toronto-based Frontera Energy Corp (FEC.TO) in Colombia and Peru in recent years. One of the sources said Maurel & Prom was planning to buy Petroregional as part of a consortium.  “There are Venezuelan investors involved in the purchasing consortium,” the person said. The identity of the investors was not immediately clear. Shell’s potential scale-back comes as Venezuela’s oil industry, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves, is in meltdown. Its oil output declined again in September to 1.434 million barrels per day (bpd), OPEC data showed on Thursday,  knocking down the annual average to a six-decade low. Workers unable to feed their families on PDVSA wages are quitting in droves, underinvestment has left many installations in precarious conditions, and the production drop has accelerated under new military management.      Shell was a pioneering firm in Venezuela and has operated in its oil industry for more than a century. But it has maintained a low profile in Venezuela since late President Hugo Chavez nationalized swaths of the energy sector in 2007, converting all oil projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures.  Petroregional, which operates the Urdaneta Oeste crude field in Venezuela’s traditional oil hub of Maracaibo Lake, is Shell’s only crude operation in Venezuela. In recent years, production has plummeted in what used to be the country’s most important crude producing zone, Zulia state. Exiting Petroregional would allow Shell to focus more on natural gas, a priority for the company.  Under a plan still under negotiation with Venezuela, Shell is pushing for a deal to let it produce gas in the Dragon field, one of four areas that form part of the Mariscal Sucre offshore project in the Caribbean sea. Shell has said the gas would be processed at facilities it operates in Trinidad and Tobago. Shell in 2016 completed the $52 billion purchase of BG Group, creating the world’s largest trader of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The takeover and other purchases gave Shell greater access to gas operations in Trinidad, a few kilometres from Venezuela’s eastern coast.

2018-10-11,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro would tackle chronic energy shortages by expanding nuclear and hydroelectric power in the Amazon despite environmental concerns, the adviser overseeing his infrastructure plans told Reuters. Oswaldo Ferreira, one of several retired generals advising Bolsonaro, said, if he were elected, the government would also complete Brazil’s corruption-plagued Angra 3 nuclear power station on the coast between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. He said a Bolsonaro administration would complete the massive Belo Monte hydro dam on the Xingú river, a tributary of the Amazon, which has been criticized for displacing indigenous communities and causing damage to the sensitive biome. Shelved plans for other dams in the Amazon basin could also be revived, he said. Far-right Bolsonaro easily outpaced his leftist rival Fernando Haddad in Sunday’s first-round vote, taking 46 percent compared to Haddad’s 29 percent, but short of the majority needed to avoid an Oct.28 runoff. A Wednesday poll showed Bolsonaro 16 percentage points ahead. At a Thursday press conference in Rio de Janeiro, Bolsonaro confirmed that Chicago University-trained economist Paulo Guedes would be his economy minister, overseeing a “super ministry” combining the current finance, planning and development ministries. He also said retired army general Augusto Heleno Pereira would be defense minister and conservative congressman Onyx Lorenzoni his chief of staff.  Private investors would be called on to help build the infrastructure Brazil badly needs, Ferreira said. The country is one of the world’s top food exporters, but the poor state of roads and lack of railways makes getting goods to ports slow and expensive.  Popular with Brazil’s powerful evangelical and farming lobbies, Bolsonaro, 63, has pledged to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement climate deal due to disagreements over how the Amazon should be protected. His top agriculture adviser, Nabhan Garcia, told Reuters on Tuesday that Bolsonaro’s government would slash fines for farmers who break environmental laws in sensitive areas like the Amazon rainforest.  Environmentalists are also concerned about Bolsonaro’s plans to stop recognising new native reservation lands and to merge the agriculture and environment ministries under the control of a farm lobby representative.   Garcia, a well-known conservative voice in agriculture in Brazil, had been floated in the local press as a candidate to head that ministry. Bolsonaro said on Thursday that Garcia would not have that post, without elaborating.  Ferreira said hundreds of unfinished infrastructure projects, including railways and roads for exporting grains, will be studied and completed if viable with the help of investors through public-private partnerships. But energy will be a priority. “If Brazil is to return to the rates of growth that we all want, there will be a need for energy that cannot be supplied from other sources,” he said in a Wednesday night telephone interview. Bolsonaro said on Thursday that his team had an economic agenda “practically ready” to present upon taking office in January, if he wins, including a tax overhaul that would not raise taxes but rather cut red tape. Ferreira said Bolsonaro favoured privatising the transmission and distribution units of Brazil’s largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras, but retaining state control of power generation. He emphasized that a Bolsonaro administration would focus on “clean” energy from hydropower to wind and solar, and that environmental concerns would be given “full attention.” Ferreira struck a less moderate tone in an interview published on Thursday by newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, where he described environmental regulators as a nuisance. When the army was responsible for opening up roads in the Amazon during the 1964-1985 military regime, trees could be felled without permission, but today to cut down one tree “a handful of people will come and bother you,” he told the paper.

2018-10-11,"(Adds details from report) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A NiSource Inc affiliate failed to require contract repair crews to relocate pressure sensors during natural-gas pipeline work, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Thursday, resulting in overpressured lines that caused explosions and fires in three Massachusetts communities last month. Overpressurized gas poured through Columbia Gas Co of Massachusetts’ distribution system in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, flooding into homes and businesses and sparking explosions and fires that killed one person and injured 21. Critical valves controlling the gas flow were not shut for nearly 3-1/2 hours after the first alarm was raised at Columbia Gas’s monitoring center, NTSB said in a preliminary report. The center had no ability to remotely open or close valves on its own, but did notify technicians, it added. NiSource is fully cooperating with the NTSB, Chief Executive Joe Hamrock said in a statement on Thursday. However, it will not comment on the cause of the incident until the NTSB completes its work, he added. The incident raised safety concerns about the sprawling U.S. networks of aging pipelines. The September explosions and fires damaged 131 homes and businesses as Columbia Gas was replacing cast-iron pipe with safer plastic lines when the accident occurred. The NTSB laid out the timetable of events in a dry account of the company’s activities that day. Crews were working for Columbia Gas in Lawrence, a city northwest of Boston, to replace an aged cast-iron main with a new plastic distribution main line. The abandoned main had regulator sensing lines used to detect pressure in the system. After that main line was disconnected, the sensing lines lost pressure and the regulators fully opened, “allowing the full flow of high-pressure gas into the distribution system supplying the neighborhood,” the report said. Columbia Gas had approved a “work package (that) did not account for the location of the sensing lines or require their relocation to ensure the regulators were sensing actual system pressure,” according to the NTSB. Minutes before the explosion, Columbia Gas’ monitoring center in Columbus, Ohio, received high pressure alarms for its South Lawrence gas pressure system. The company shut down the regulator at issue about 25 minutes later, around 4:30 p.m, the NTSB said. September’s explosion was the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline accident since 2010 in terms of structures involved. Eight years ago, an interstate gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company ruptured in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, destroying 38 buildings and damaging 70 others, according to the NTSB. Columbia Gas has said all cast iron and bare steel piping in affected neighborhoods will be replaced with high pressure plastic mains that have regulators at each service meter.

2018-10-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street extended its slide into a sixth session and a global equity index fell to a 1-year low on Thursday as investors feared an escalating U.S. trade war with China and risks from a recent climb in interest rates. The Nasdaq flirted with correction territory, sliding as much as 10.3 percent from its Aug. 29 closing record high, before paring losses to end off those levels and avoiding confirming a correction.  MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS dropped 2.2 percent, falling below its February lows to trade at its lowest since October 2017. Gold, typically seen as a safe-haven asset during times of extreme volatility, rose as sliding global stock markets prompted risk-wary investors to buy the metal, and a drop in U.S. Treasury bond yields helped push the dollar lower. In equities, Wall Street slid as risk-appetite showed no signs of picking up and volatility spiked. The Cboe Volatility index .VIX ended the day up at 24.98, its highest close since Feb. 12, a day after the S&P 500 dropped more than 3 percent in its biggest daily decline since Feb. 8. “When you have a shock day like yesterday, people are caught off guard, and there are a lot of adjustments going on below the surface. There tends to be a lot of volatility the day after a shock day, and over the next several days or weeks,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. The selloff came as investors prepared for the start of U.S. quarterly earnings, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) due to report Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 545.91 points, or 2.13 percent, to 25,052.83, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 57.31 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,728.37 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 92.99 points, or 1.25 percent, to 7,329.06. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares lost 2 percent. U.S. Treasury yields fell to one-week lows as stocks sold off. A weaker-than-expected rise in U.S. inflation for September also added to Treasuries bullish tone. In late afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year note yields were at 3.146 percent US10YT=RR, down from 3.225 percent late on Wednesday. Earlier in the global session, 10-year yields hit a one-week low of 3.124 percent. U.S. consumer prices rose less than analysts had forecast in September, reducing expectations the pace of inflation is accelerating despite a tightening labor market. Whether the lower reading will quell expectations the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in December remains to be seen, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone in New York. “The thing people are trying to hang their hat on is a cooler CPI read. That potentially gets us to rally,” Abbasi said. The dollar fell to a near two-week low against a basket of currencies. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.52 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.63 percent to $1.1591. Oil prices slumped to two-week lows as global stock markets fell, with investor sentiment made more bearish by an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories rising more than expected.

2018-10-11,"(Adds Marathon acquisition of Andeavor in paragraph 2, updates fuel prices in paragraphs 8 and 9) Oct 11 (Reuters) - Andeavor’s Anacortes plant on Thursday joined a list of oil refineries in Washington state forced to shut or curb operations after natural gas supply to the facilities was disrupted by a pipeline fire in Canada on Tuesday. Andeavor, which was just acquired by Marathon Petroleum Corp last week, said it had begun shutting various units at the 120,000 barrel-per-day Anacortes refinery due to a disruption in natural gas supply to the plant “following an upset in a third party pipeline.” The shutdown follows actions by two other refineries, and sent fuel prices in the Pacific Northwest region and across the West Coast soaring. Tuesday’s fire followed a rupture on the 36-inch (91-cm)Enbridge Inc pipeline in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The line carries natural gas to the Pacific Northwest. Enbridge on Wednesday said it was approved to restart operations on an adjacent 30-inch natural gas pipeline, which had been depressurized following the fire. The stoppage of operations at the Anacortes plant follows Royal Dutch Shell’s announcement on Wednesday that it was shutting units at its 145,000 bpd Puget Sound refinery. Phillips 66 also said it was adjusting operations at its 105,000 bpd Ferndale plant until natural gas supply could be restored. Pacific Northwest gasoline for prompt delivery in the physical market strengthened by about 40 cents a gallon Thursday, trading at as much as 55 cents per gallon above gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, market participants said. Pacific Northwest diesel fuel for physical delivery also rose, climbing to 9 cents a gallon above the futures contract from 2 cents a gallon in the previous session. The increases in the Pacific Northwest lifted fuel prices across the West Coast, with gasoline strengthening in San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well.

2018-10-11,"BOGOTA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Colombia’s constitutional court has ruled that local referendums that ban mining and oil extraction cannot halt energy projects, local media reported on Thursday, after a raft of votes that spooked multinational companies. A wave of environmentally focused anti-mining referendums over the past 18 months have worried investors and forced AngloGold Ashanti to suspended a potential $2 billion project last year. At least one municipality has said it will mount a pro-mining referendum to protect local companies and subsistence miners, while multinational miners have repeatedly called for clarity on whether the referendums, be they pro or anti-mining, are binding. The previous government failed to legislate the issue, but President Ivan Duque, who took office two months ago, promised during his campaign to boost investment in the sector. The country’s subsoil is national property and cannot be restricted by local authorities, local media quoted the court ruling as saying. The national government, however, cannot exercise sole control over extractive projects and Congress must pass regulations within two years that allow communities to voice opposition to mining and oil projects. The ruling on the suit brought by Mansarovar Energy Colombia, a joint venture between India’s ONGC-Videsh and China’s Sinopec, was backed 5 to 1 by magistrates, several local outlets reported. Mansarovar brought the suit after residents of Cumaral municipality in Meta province voted last year to ban oil exploration. A spokesperson for the Constitutional Court did not confirm the content of the ruling and said it did not yet have a statement or a copy of it. The content of the ruling was reported by at least three major local news outlets. Mansarovar could not immediately be reached for comment. The private oil producers association, ACP, which joined the Mansarovar suit, said it had not yet received a copy of the ruling. The mines and energy ministry had no immediate comment.

2018-10-11,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian ex-head of state Olusegun Obasanjo backed his former deputy on Thursday for next year’s presidential election, ending a public feud that had threatened to undermine the main opposition candidate.  Atiku Abubakar, who on Sunday won the race to be the candidate of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), was vice president under Obasanjo from 1999-2007 but their relationship became strained at the time. Opposition to his candidacy by Obasanjo - a former military ruler who was democratically elected when Nigeria switched to civilian rule 19 years ago and remains influential - could have cut Abubakar’s access to vital patronage networks needed to mobilise grassroot support and funds.  Abubakar poses the biggest challenge to President Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking a second term in the February election. The country emerged in 2017 from its first recession in 25 years but economic growth remains sluggish and inflation is above the central bank’s single-digit target.  “You have capacity to perform better than the incumbent. You surely understand the economy better; you have business experience, which can make your administration business-friendly and boost the economy and provide jobs,” Obasanjo said in a statement carrying comments addressed to Abubakar.   Abubakar has long enjoyed support from the business elite in Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos for his conservative-capitalist ideals and as vice president he implemented a liberalisation programme in areas including the telecoms sector. The statement was issued when the two men met in the southwestern city of Abeokuta where they posed for pictures that were posted on Abubakar’s Twitter feed. “Whenever or wherever you might have offended me, as a Christian who asks for God’s forgiveness of my sins and inadequacies on daily basis, I forgive and I sincerely advise you to learn from the past,” said Obasanjo.  Abubakar, 71, told Reuters earlier this year that if elected he would privatise parts of the state oil company and allow the naira currency to float to attract foreign investment. Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the former president’s comments amounted to a “predictable U-turn and somersault”.

2018-10-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows on Thursday as global stock markets fell, with investor sentiment made more bearish by a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $2.83 to settle at $80.26 a barrel, a 3.41 percent loss, after hitting a low of $79.80, its weakest since Sept. 24. The global benchmark has retreated after hitting a four-year high of $86.74 on Oct. 3. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $2.2 to settle at $70.97 a barrel, a 3.01 percent loss. WTI hit its lowest since Sept. 21. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 6 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, more than double analysts’ expectations of a 2.6 million-barrels increase. [EIA/S] “The significant increase in crude oil inventories is a reflection of refineries going down for maintenance,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Refinery crude runs USOICR=ECI fell by 352,000 barrels per day as utilization rates USOIRU=ECI dropped 1.6 percentage points, the EIA data showed. Falling U.S. equity markets and a global risk-off environment also weighed on crude futures. On Wednesday, U.S. stock markets tumbled, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Industrials indexes posting their worst day in eight months, as solid economic data reinforced expectations of multiple interest rate hikes over the next year. “The demand side of the oil equation is always much more difficult to discern than the more transparent supply side and as equities slide amidst rate increases, the oil market could begin to discount a worst case scenario with regard to oil demand expectations,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast of global demand growth for oil next year for a third straight month, citing headwinds facing the broader economy from trade disputes and volatile emerging markets. OPEC sees the oil market as well supplied and is wary of creating a glut next year, the group’s secretary-general said on Thursday. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, producers had cut output by 40 percent on Thursday due to Hurricane Michael, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), even as some operators began returning crews to offshore platforms. The cuts represent 680,107 barrels per day of oil production, BSEE said, citing reports from 30 companies.  Michael crashed ashore Florida on Wednesday as the third most powerful hurricane ever to strike the U.S. mainland. It has since weakened to a tropical storm.

2018-10-11,"(Adds details of U.S. Agriculture Department forecast, analysts’ comments, updates market reaction) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department surprisingly trimmed its forecasts for both domestic corn and soybean production on Thursday, with the soy cut stemming from a reduction in acres while the corn harvest will be lower due to smaller-than-expected yields. Soybean production was seen falling from the government’s September estimate due to a decrease in harvested acres in key states such as Illinois and Minnesota. Despite the cuts, the U.S. soybean crop was still projected as the biggest ever, while corn harvest was pegged as the second-biggest on record. The corn crop was seen at 14.778 billion bushels, based on an average record yield of 180.7 bushels per acre, the government said in its monthly supply and demand report. Soybean production was pegged at 4.690 billion bushels, with yields averaging a record 53.1 bushels per acre. “It’s still a very big crop,” said Bob Utterback, president of Utterback Marketing. “It’s not as bad as we thought it could have been. With the rain delays, I think the trade is going to take the attitude that (yields) could shift down a little.” Analysts had been expecting corn production of 14.872 billion bushels, with yields of 181.8 bushels per acre, and soybean production of 4.733 billion bushels, with yields of 53.3 bushels per acre, based on the average of estimates given in a Reuters poll. In September, USDA had forecast a corn crop of 14.827 billion bushels and a soybean crop of 4.693 billion bushels. Chicago Board of Trade corn and soybean futures, which had traded lower for most of the morning, turned higher after the report. CBOT December corn led the gains, rising 1.7 percent to its highest level in more than seven weeks. “It makes you wonder what happens if the yield comes down even more, especially with the weather that we’ve got,” said Ted Seifried, chief agriculture market strategist for brokerage Zaner Group in Chicago. “The low is in for corn.” USDA estimated harvested soybean acres at 88.348 million, and harvested acres for corn at 81.767 million. USDA raised corn ending stocks for the 2018/19 crop year to 1.813 billion bushels and soybean ending stocks to 885 million bushels, both lower than analysts were expecting. If realized, the soybean ending stocks would be the biggest on record. U.S. wheat ending stocks were raised to 956 million bushels from 935 million bushels.

2018-10-11,"(Adds details, quotes, prices) Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose last week for the third consecutive weekly build as refineries continued to reduce output for seasonal maintenance, while gasoline inventories grew unexpectedly, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories rose 6 million barrels in the week to Oct. 5, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.6 million barrels. The build was in part due to a 2.4 million-barrel increase in stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures.. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 1.4 million barrels per day to 4.8 million bpd, the lowest rate since at least 2001 when the EIA began tracking the data. Weekly figures like this are volatile, however. The stock build fed recent selling in the oil market, which has also been happening in tandem with a broader sell-off across global equity and bond markets. U.S. crude futures dropped 2.5 percent to $71.26 a barrel, while Brent crude was off 2.7 percent to $80.88 a barrel. Refinery crude runs fell by 352,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 1.6 percentage points to 88.8 percent of nationwide capacity, led by a slowing in activity in the Midwest, where utilization fell to 73.3 percent of capacity, the lowest since EIA started tracking that data by region in 2010. “The steep decline in refinery run rates helped to produce the inventory gain,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Several major refineries in the Midwest, including BP Plc’s facilities in Whiting, Indiana, and HollyFrontier Corp’s plant in El Dorado, Kansas, are currently undergoing maintenance. Gasoline stocks rose by 1 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a fall of 42,000 barrels. Gasoline futures were down 3.2 percent to $1.9557 a gallon, in part due to an increase in East Coast stocks, which have risen to 70.6 million barrels, compared with 58.2 million barrels at this time a year ago. “Gasoline is leading the market down as continued high levels of imports into the East Coast have led to inventory levels that are 20 percent higher than this time last year,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 2.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 2 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-10-11,"* Imports from Iran rose 1 pct m/m, up 27 pct year/year * Other sources show Iranian exports falling ahead of sanctions * India aims to continue to buy Iranian oil despite U.S. sanctions By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran edged up in September from the previous month as refiners pushed back loading of some August cargoes due to a delay in obtaining government approval to use Iranian ships and insurance, data obtained from sources showed. Last month, India shipped in about 528,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil from Iran, about 1 percent more than the 523,000 bpd of August and about 27 percent more than a year earlier, tanker arrival data obtained from shipping and industry sources showed. “Refiners had to delay lifting of some cargoes to late-August and early September as the government permission to use Iranian ships and insurance came in the last week of August ... We could not lift full volumes in August because of this,” said a source at one of the state refiners. Data from other sources, such as from the Institute of International Finance, show that Iranian oil exports are declining before the United States imposes sanctions on Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 4 after pulling out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear activities. India’s oil imports from Iran plunged by a third in August compared with July, after most insurers and reinsurers backed out of trade with Iran to avoid falling foul of the sanctions given their large exposure to the United States. About 44 percent of the Iranian oil volumes that arrived in India in September were originally meant for August lifting, the data showed. This was confirmed by officials at the two state-refiners. India’s September oil imports were also boosted by the import of 2 million barrels of Iranian oil by Reliance Industries Ltd. Reliance did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comments. Reliance, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to stop importing Iranian oil in October or November. Iran continued to be the third biggest oil supplier to India in September, after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, was one of the few nations that continued to trade with the Middle Eastern country when sanctions were previously in force. New Delhi wants to continue purchasing Iranian oil through this round of sanctions, although it is preparing to trim imports to win waivers from the United States. Indian refiners have already placed orders to buy 9 million barrels, or about 300,000 bpd, of Iranian oil in November, industry sources told Reuters last week. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan confirmed that two Indian refiners will lift Iranian oil in November. India’s November loading of Iranian oil will be sharply lower than its purchases in the April to September period. Between April and September, the first half of India’s financial year, the country’s oil imports from Iran surged 40 percent to 627,000 bpd, tanker arrival data showed. In January-September, India’s oil imports from Iran rose by 21 percent to 592,000 bpd, the data showed. India had reduced purchases from Tehran last year due to a dispute over development rights of a giant gas field. The South Asian nation was hoping to lift significantly higher volumes in the current fiscal year, after Tehran offered a discount on shipping and an extended credit period, before the U.S. decision on sanctions changed its plans.

2018-10-11,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Europe buckles again as sell-off rumbles on * Bunds, Treasuries benefit in safe-haven scramble * Oil prices and industrial metals slide By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A global measure of equity prices fell to a 1-year low on Thursday as Wall Street extended its October slide into a sixth session as investors feared an escalating U.S. trade war with China and risks from a recent climb in interest rates. Gold rose as sliding global stock markets prompted risk-wary investors to seek the metal, and a drop in U.S. Treasury bond yields helped push the dollar lower. MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries fell 2.2 percent, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional share lost 2.1 percent. Most sectors in Europe traded in the red, with tech stocks bearing the brunt of selling pressure after the big overnight sell-off in U.S. technology shares. U.S. consumer prices rose less than analysts had forecast in September, reducing expectations the pace of inflation is accelerating despite a tightening labor market. Whether the lower reading will quell expectations the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again in December remains to be seen, said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone in New York. “The thing people are trying to hang their hat on is a cooler CPI read. That potentially gets us to rally,” Abbasi said. In midday trade, Wall Street remained lower as risk-appetite showed no signs of picking up. The benchmark S&P 500 dropped below its 200-day moving average price, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped below its 100-day moving average. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 198.28 points, or 0.77 percent, to 25,400.46. The S&P 500 lost 24.93 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,760.75 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.71 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,391.34. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes rose 14/32 in price, pushing their yield down to 3.1724 percent. It will take more than a daily stock market correction to stop the Fed from hiking, said George Goncalves, managing director and head of fixed income strategy at Nomura in New York. “The market is not necessarily going to take out much from the yield path,” Goncalves said. “I don’t view this as an indication that there’s a turn in the market. I just think it’s natural to see bonds rally after a big equity move.” The dollar index fell 0.31 percent, with the euro up 0.4 percent to $1.1564. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 112.29. Oil prices slumped to two-week lows as global stock markets fell, with investor sentiment made more bearish by an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories rising more than expected. U.S. crude fell 1.98 percent to $71.72 per barrel and Brent was last at $81.30, down 2.15 percent on the day. Reporting by Herbert Lash

2018-10-11,"* Wind sector could add over 2 GW per year * Lengthy appeals, administrative hurdles delay projects * Government aims to boost renewables in energy plan By Bate Felix PARIS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - French wind power developers could increase the rate at which they add capacity and boost their share of the energy mix if the government created a stable and simple regulatory environment in its long-term plan, industry lobby group FEE said on Thursday. France is expected to unveil the plan at the end of the month which will set out targets, a timeline, and energy priorities to reduce the country’s dependence on nuclear electricity and increase renewables energy. The government has received proposals from industry for the plan, known as PPE, to cover 2019-2023 and 2024-2028. It will lay out how and by when it will cut the share of nuclear in power generation to 50 percent from 75 percent. Olivier Perot, president of France Energie Eolienne said the wind sector was currently adding around 1.5 GW to 2 GW of capacity per year and given the backlog of projects it could hit the upper end of the target and add up to 26 GW by 2023. Although France is on track to reach its target of 15 GW of installed onshore wind capacity in 2018, it has lagged some of its European peers such as Germany. It takes around six to seven years to develop a wind project in France compared with half that time in Germany. Perot told journalists that Germany was adding around 4 GW of wind capacity per year. He said the sector had the ability to add over 2 GW every year after 2023 to take France’s installed onshore capacity to 37 GW by 2028, representing around 18 percent electricity generation. It also has a target for 3 GW of offshore wind in 2023, which could reach 10 GW in 2028. For this to happen, Perot said the industry needed a stable and simplified regulatory environment. “What we almost need is a sort of moratorium on regulations,” he said. A 10-point scheme was announced by the government in January to remove administrative hurdles that have hindered the growth of France’s wind sector, and halve the time it takes for projects to come onstream. But most of the reforms are still pending, said Pauline Le Bertre, a senior FEE official. She said measures, such as those that aim to reduce the time it takes to develop projects, particularly one that would cut length of time it takes to deal with appeals against projects and accelerate the administrative procedure, have not been taken. “The decree is being finalised and we hope that it will be published in the coming weeks,” Le Bertre said.

2018-10-11,"HOUSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil producers on Thursday were checking Gulf of Mexico production platforms and beginning to return crews to more than 90 offshore facilities evacuated this week as Hurricane Michael moved through the Gulf. Production shut-ins that temporarily halted 42 percent of Gulf oil output and nearly a third of natural gas production was restarting in some areas. BP Plc conducted its first flyovers on Wednesday to check the status of four platforms that were evacuated, said spokesman Jason Ryan. Restarting production can take several days. Producers lost about 1.7 million barrels of oil through Wednesday as a result of shut-ins and the figure is expected to rise. However, Gulf production cuts have been less of an impact on supplies due to rising volumes of U.S. shale oil. The storm brought winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) when it made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday. Drenching rains were falling on Georgia and the Carolinas on Thursday as Florida residents assessed the damage to coastal areas. U.S. crude futures continued to drop for second day, losing $1.39 to $71.78 in morning trade, after OPEC again cut its forecast of global oil demand growth for 2019 over economic worries. Anadarko Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it had expanded its shut-ins to three offshore platforms, and for safety reasons was waiting to return workers. Gas production should move up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Thursday from a low of 2.2 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data. A week ago, energy firms were pulling 3.5 bcfd from the offshore wells. Southern Co kept the two reactors at its 1,751-megawatt Farley nuclear power plant in Alabama reduced at around 30 percent early Thursday. The company reduced the reactors from around full power on Wednesday as Hurricane Michael approached the coast. The Farley plant is located in Dothan in southeast Alabama about 90 miles (150 km) north of the Gulf Coast. Hurricane Michael knocked out power to over 850,000 homes and businesses in the U.S. Southeast. More than 830,000 customers located mostly in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina had no service on Thursday morning.

2018-10-11,"BRASILIA, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro plans to tackle Brazil’s chronic energy shortages head-on by expanding nuclear power and hydroelectric energy despite environmental concerns over the impact of new dams on the Amazon, the retired general devising his infrastructure program told Reuters Oswaldo Ferreira, one of half a dozen retired generals advising the election front-runner, said a Bolsonaro government would complete Brazil’s corruption-plagued Angra 3 nuclear power station on the coast between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro at whatever the cost. He also said a Bolsonaro government would push ahead with the massive Belo Monte hydro dam on the Xingú river, a tributary of the Amazon, which was criticized for displacing indigenous communities. Shelved plans for other dams in the Amazon basin could also be revived. Ferreira said private investors would be called on to help build the infrastructure Brazil needs and that environmental factors would be fully taken into account. Belo Monte and other hydro plans for the Amazon, the world’s largest tropical rainforest, have been slammed by environmentalists for harming its biodiversity. Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former army captain-turned-congressman favored by financial markets, fell just short of an outright majority in Sunday’s election. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, in a second-round ballot on Oct. 28. Popular with Brazil’s powerful evangelical and farming lobby, Bolsonaro has pledged to pull Brazil out of the Paris Agreement climate deal due to disagreements over how the Amazon should be protected. His top agriculture adviser told Reuters on Tuesday that his government would slash fines for farmers who break environmental laws in sensitive areas like the Amazon rainforest. Ferreira said hundreds of unfinished infrastructure projects, from railways and roads for exporting grains, will be studied and completed if viable with the help of investors through public-private partnerships. But energy will be a priority. “If Brazil is to return to the rates of growth that we all want, there will be a need for energy that cannot be supplied from other sources,” he said in an interview late on Wednesday. A Datafolha poll on Wednesday showed Bolsonaro strengthening his lead to 58 percent of voter support, compared with Haddad’s 42 percent. Bolsonaro, who is recovering from a near-fatal stabbing while campaigning last month, plans to rally the support of elected lawmakers on Friday near his home in the Barra de Tijuca beach district of Rio de Janeiro. In an interview posted late on Wednesday to social media, Bolsonaro said his team had an economic agenda “practically ready” to present upon taking office in January, if he wins, including a tax reform that would not raise taxes but rather cut red tape. Ferreira said Bolsonaro favored privatizing the transmission and distribution units of Brazil’s largest utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras, but retaining state control of power generation. He emphasized that a Bolsonaro administration will focus on “clean” energy from hydro to wind and solar, and that environmental concerns will be given “full attention.” Ferreira struck a less moderate tone in an interview published on Thursday by newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, where he described environmental regulators as a nuisance. When the army was responsible for opening up roads in the Amazon during the 1964-1985 military regime, trees could be felled without permission, but today to cut down one tree “a handful of people will come and bother you,” he told the paper. Environmentalists are most concerned with Bolsonaro’s plans to stop recognizing new native reservation lands and to merge the agriculture and environment ministries under the control of a farm lobby representative.

2018-10-11,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to halt exports of light and heavy oil products to Belarus from next month until the end of next year, with restrictions also applying to shipments of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), two Russian government sources told Reuters.  Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have a duty-free arrangement under which Moscow has been sending crude oil and oil products to Minsk with no export fee. Belarus then re-exports some of those goods, pocketing the associated charges. Russia has used cheap energy exports and loans to Belarus as a way of keeping its former Soviet neighbour in Moscow’s geopolitical orbit, but the arrangement has become harder to sustain as Russia’s budget tightens.  On Wednesday, Russia and Belarus signed amendments to intergovernmental agreements regarding exports of oil and oil products from Moscow to Minsk, according to Russian Energy Ministry data.  The two government sources told Reuters that exports of light oil products such as gasoline and diesel, as well as heavy oil products and LPG - also used in the petrochemical industry - would be suspended after the revised agreement.  The sources said Moscow would not cut exports of products Minsk does not produce itself - for example, certain oil products used in petrochemicals. One of the sources said exports of crude oil also would not be revised.  The Russian Energy Ministry declined to comment, redirecting questions to Ilya Dzhus, spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, who oversees the energy sector in government.  Dzhus told Reuters on Thursday that Moscow would suspend exports of heavy oil products to Belarus but declined to elaborate on other oil products.   Moscow supplies Belarus each year with around 2 million tonnes of duty-free oil products but wants to cut that to 100,000-300,000 tonnes, the Russian Finance Ministry has said. Reuters reported in July that Belarus, often seen as a buffer between Moscow and the rest of Europe, has capitalised on a general aversion from trading with the Kremlin to become the largest re-exporter of Russian LPG.

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy companies and investors are focused on profits and reluctant to boost spending even after crude prices surged to four-year highs, a senior Goldman Sachs banker said on Thursday. Rattled by the recent downturn in the sector and long-term concerns over oil demand and the switch to renewables, Big Oil is facing an unprecedented challenge. “We’re firmly through that survival phase and the better capitalized players are now positioned to do well on the other side of it,” Andrew Fry, global head of energy at Goldman said at the Oil & Money conference in London. Companies typically seek to increase spending as they emerge from a downturn in order to capture low drilling costs and an expected supply shortage. But this time round, the barriers for investments are high, with investors seeking returns of as much as 15 to 20 percent from multi-billion dollar oil and gas projects, Fry said. “In the near term the focus is on returns as opposed to growth for the sake of growth,” he said. As a result, companies are currently focusing on buying back shares and paying dividends to investors with the excess cash they generate. “For the first time since the downturn, the oil companies now have their balance sheets in order. They are all starting to think about growth but it is very conservative,” James Janoskey, global co-head of oil and gas at JPMorgan, said. “When we came out of downturns in the past, we didn’t have energy transition issues and there probably wasn’t that much pressure from investors.” Capital expenditure among the world’s top oil companies is expected to rise to $140 billion by 2021, from the current $100 billion, but will remain well below the $200 billion before the 2014 oil price collapse, according to Adam Brett, HSBC global head of natural resources advisory.  That means oil majors will show very healthy returns on capital invested, he added.  He said that even in the United States, where oil output has resumed spectacular growth on the back of high oil prices, large companies will try to maintain capital discipline and focus on returns rather than pure production growth. “For Big Oil, value will prevail over volume,” Brett said, adding that most remuneration reports now made clear that top executives at oil majors are being rewarded for delivering robust cash flows rather than production increases. Acquisitions, another way to boost production and reserves, are also expected to be constrained and focused. Energy mergers and acquisitions amounted to $360 billion last year and stand at $280 billion so far this year, said Brett. Although the volume of M&A has been relatively stable in recent years, the structure has changed since China largely suspended its buying spree over the past three years, he said.  An anti-corruption drive and revisions of overly expensive deals have prompted China to cut down on buying resources around the world in the past three years.  Brett said that M&A were currently dominated by downstream and mid-stream transactions with the share of upstream declining to 35-40 percent, from as high as 60-70 percent when China was an active asset buyer.  “You see much more downstream M&A activity. And I expect this to continue in the years ahead,” Brett said.

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Naftogaz is in talks in London with a number of big oil and gas firms to help it develop the country’s existing and yet-to-be-tapped gas fields, the company’s chief executive has told Reuters. Ukraine is looking to increase domestic production so it can lessen its energy dependence on hostile neighbour Russia, the cost of which is straining Kiev’s limited finances. Ukraine used to produce around 70 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year when it was part of the Soviet Union but now draws out only around 20 bcm. “One of the reasons why I am currently in London is that I am negotiating with big international oil and gas companies potential partnership agreements to develop gas fields in Ukraine,” Chief Executive Andriy Kobolev said in an interview. Kobolev believes the potential to recover some of the production lost over the last 50 years is sizable if it can revive existing gas fields and tap new shale and offshore areas. “We have done lots of studies, we have lots of geological materials, we have lots of experience producing from those fields and we see huge potential,” he said. “By the end of the year we will sign at least one partnership ... and I believe if we have one partner this year, I would expect we could sign partnership agreements with at least two big names next year.” Ukraine imported almost 30 percent of its gas during last year’s icy winter but the cost has risen in recent years due to the hryvnia’s devaluation in international currency markets. The International Monetary Fund is also demanding Kiev hike what households are charged for gas to match what it costs the country to buy it.  At the moment, that requires a roughly 60 percent increase. It’s a tough political sell ahead of presidential elections next year, but without it the IMF is unlikely to disperse a much-needed $1.9 trillion aid tranche. “My hope is the (IMF) deal will be reached this month,” Kobolev said. “This might sound strange,” he added, “but at the end of the day such reforms (gas price rises), if they are done the right way they can actually be positive for the government.” His advice was to make sure poorer parts of the population receive special payments to help cover their increased bills. On top of that, they should be able to keep any money they save by cutting their consumption.   “It is simple, you need to monetise subsidies.” If Kiev and the IMF cannot agree a new aid deal, however, Kobolev said Naftogaz would almost certainly have to shelve its plans for a $0.5-1 billion bond sale that has been pencilled in for sometime over the next month. “If the deal doesn’t happen, our probability of success will be very, very low.”     Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets in Kiev; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-naftogaz-partnership/exclusive-naftogaz-courting-partners-to-develop-ukraine-gas-fields-idUKL8N1WR4N5,11 Oct 2018,"Ukraine's Naftogaz is in talks in

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC sees the oil market as well supplied and is wary of creating a glut next year, the group’s secretary-general said on Thursday, suggesting producers are in no rush to expand a June agreement that raises output. Oil prices have rallied this year on expectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran will strain supplies by lowering shipments from OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Brent crude LCOc1 last week reached $86.74, the highest since 2014. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, speaking at the Oil & Money conference in London, said there were many non-fundamental factors influencing the oil market that were beyond oil producers’ control. “The market has been reacting to perceptions of a possible supply shortage. The market remains well supplied,” he told a briefing. “The projections for 2019 clearly show a possible rebuild of stocks,” he said of the supply and demand balance for next year. OPEC separately updated its oil supply and demand forecasts on Thursday, cutting demand estimates for next year due to economic challenges such as trade disputes and volatile emerging markets, and pointing to excess supply. One of the factors boosting prices, according to analysts and some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to reimpose sanctions on Iran.  Trump has demanded that OPEC cool prices by pumping more oil. Barkindo, asked whether Trump’s criticism of OPEC was unfair, said: “The market is currently being largely driven by decisions taken elsewhere - outside OPEC, outside non-OPEC.” OPEC and allied producers - not including the United States - agreed in June to return to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above 160 percent. OPEC’s report said its own production rose by 132,000 barrels per day in September to 32.76 million bpd, the highest this year, although producers have yet to increase supply enough to reach 100 percent compliance. Barkindo, responding to a question whether producers needed to go beyond full delivery of the agreement, said they were taking it step by step.  “We have to continue to assess to see how and when we will achieve the 100 percent conformity and how the market would respond, hoping that some of these non-fundamental factors will evaporate by then,” he said.  “We remain faithful to what we agreed in June.” OPEC and its allies hold their next meeting in December to decide policy for next year. In the report released on Thursday, OPEC cut the estimate for demand in 2019 for its own crude to 31.8 million bpd because of weaker demand and rising supplies outside the group. Should OPEC keep pumping at September’s rate, the report points to an excess supply of almost 1 million bpd in 2019 - although this is before any sizeable reduction takes place in Iranian output. Iran pumped 3.45 million bpd in September, according to figures in OPEC’s report on Thursday, down 150,000 bpd from August. Production dropped below 2.7 million bpd under previous sanctions that were lifted following the 2015 nuclear deal. (Graphic: Iran's monthly oil production - reut.rs/2yvl8FO) Barkindo said oil producers were worried about their levels of spare output capacity, which reduces their ability to make up for sudden supply shortages, amid a reduction in energy-industry investment. “We are very concerned,” Barkindo said when asked about spare capacity, citing a continued decline in oil industry investment resulting from a market downturn that began in 2014. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, is the only oil producer with significant spare capacity on hand to supply the market if needed.  The kingdom will invest $20 billion in the next few years to maintain and possibly expand its spare oil production capacity, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said this month.

2018-10-11,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ytPIiZ By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Storm clouds were building over the global economy, even before the brutal sell off in stock markets during the last 24 hours. Escalating oil prices, rising interest rates, an appreciating dollar, and growing uncertainty about the outlook for international trade are proving a poisonous cocktail for global growth and have been triggered crises in the past. Economic growth and corporate earnings have remained strong in the United States but in much of the rest of the world momentum has been slackening since the start of the year. Strong and synchronised growth in 2017 has been replaced by an unbalanced expansion that increasingly relies on U.S. consumers and businesses to be sustained. * The OECD’s composite leading indicator points to a progressive loss of momentum in the advanced economies since the start of 2018 and is now at the lowest level since 2016. * World trade growth peaked in the three months to January at 5.2 percent year-on-year but slowed to 3.8 percent in the three months to July, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis. * South Korea’s KOSPI-100 index, a useful proxy for global trade given the country’s heavy export orientation, peaked at the end of October 2017 and has since fallen to a 17-month low this week. * Air freight volumes are still rising but more slowly than in 2017, reflecting a mixed outlook for export orders, according to the International Air Transport Association. * Manufacturers around the world reported global export orders fell slightly in September, for the first time in 27 months, according to the new export orders component of the JP Morgan Global PMI. These trade-oriented indicators are all correlated closely with one another and with the rate of expansion in the world economy - and they all tell a consistent story of slowing momentum outside the United States (tmsnrt.rs/2ytPIiZ). The global economic expansion shows signs of increasing maturity with unemployment rates falling to multi-decade lows in many of the major economies, spare capacity dwindling and input prices rising. Oil prices have risen strongly, especially when expressed in terms of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and are now at levels that have preceded recessions in the past for countries outside the United States. The global economy shows signs of being at a relatively late stage in the cycle and policymakers have made a series of choices that have complicated the outlook still further: * In the United States, the combination of an expansionary fiscal policy (tax cuts) with a restrictive monetary policy (rising interest rates) is causing the real exchange rate to appreciate. * Dollar appreciation is worsening U.S. trade deficit while rising interest rates are increasing debt-servicing costs for some of the most vulnerable and over-leveraged borrowers in emerging markets. * Aggressive sanctions on Iran are reducing global crude supplies and using up what remains of the industry’s spare capacity, intensifying the upward pressure on oil prices. * Proliferating tariffs are increasing costs for businesses and sowing uncertainty about the future of global supply chains, which will likely cause a pause in investment. * Intensifying superpower competition between the United States and China has led to growing concerns about national security and the proliferation of trade and investment restrictions. * National security officials have increasingly become more influential than economy-focused officials in many countries, reversing the balance of power that had prevailed for much of the previous 25 years. * Sanctions policies have disrupted supply chains from oil and aluminium to electronics and telecommunications equipment. * The political environment for business has turned much more uncertain, with increasing country risk and weakening commitment to a rules-based international order. As the global economic expansion has become longer and memories of the downturn have faded, policymakers have started to take it for granted, and adopted policies that put it at increasing risk. There is a significant possibility that the global economy experiences either a gradual slowdown or an outright recession before the end of 2019. Slower growth in economic activity may be needed to ease some of the pressure on oil supplies and in other parts of the supply chain. Crucially, the threat of slower growth might concentrate the minds of policymakers on the need to provide a more predictable and supportive environment for growth.

Losses in London, Paris and Milan were at nearly 2 percent ahead of what looked set to be another early dive from Wall Street, although it wasn’t quite as dramatic as the overnight session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asian shares not including Japan ended down 3.6 percent, having struck its lowest level since March 2017. China’s main indexes had slumped over 5 percent. It meant MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was having its worst day since early 2016, after Wall Street’s swoon had given the 47-country world index equivalent its worst day since February. “Equity markets are locked in a sharp sell-off, with concern around how far yields will rise, warnings from the IMF about financial stability risks and continued trade tension all driving uncertainty,” summed up analysts at ANZ. The sell-off, which came as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said stock market valuations have been “extremely high”, erased hundreds of billions of dollars of global wealth . Japan’s Nikkei ended down 3.9 percent, its steepest daily drop since March. The broader TOPIX lost around $207 billion in market value, falling 3.5 percent. Shanghai’s drop was its most severe since February 2016 and left it at its lowest level since late 2014. Shares in Taiwan were even harder hit, losing 6.3 percent. Seoul’s Kospi index dropped 3.8 percent. “I think what happened was that we were a maximum elevation of risk appetite and maximum valuation of (U.S.) large caps and tech, so when you have that situation you are always vulnerable,” said UBP macro and FX strategist Koon Chow. Europe’s traders retreated to the safety of German and other higher-rated government bonds. Italian bonds aren’t on that list though, and though they squeezed through a 6.5 billion euro debt sale, they saw more selling amid ongoing concern about the country’s financial health. “It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. Sinking global shares had raised the stakes for U.S. inflation figures which ended up coming in relatively tame. High inflation would only stoke speculation of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve - one of the things that has spooked markets. On Wall Street, the S&P500’s sharpest one-day fall since February on Tuesday had wiped out around $850 billion as the S&P toppled over 3 percent and the Nasdaq’s high-flying tech shares tumbled even more on fears of slowing demand. The bloodletting attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. “I think the Fed has gone crazy”. Hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers triggered the sell- off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared with bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits. “The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook,” said Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.” The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets. More than $1 trillion has been wiped off MSCI’s EM index since January and there has been particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States. China’s central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9377 at 0602 GMT. China’s move has forced other emerging-market currencies to weaken to stay competitive and drawn the ire of the United States, which sees it as an unfair devaluation. “The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,” said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s global head of G10 FX strategy. “Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital and a loss of control.” The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favoured currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses. The euro was at $1.1550, up from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen, a retreat from last week’s 114.54 peak. That left the dollar at 95.263 against a basket of currencies. In commodity markets, gold struggled to get any safety bid and edged down to $1,192.77. Oil prices skidded in line with U.S. equity markets, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which shut down some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output.

2018-10-11,"OSLO (Reuters) - Declining costs and rising power prices mean major new wind farms could be built in the south of Norway without subsidies, the country’s state-owned grid operator said on Thursday.  The report by Statnett is part of an analysis that Norway’s energy regulator NVE is putting together on the potential for increasing the country’s wind power generation, which currently has a total estimated capacity of about 1.3 gigawatt (GW). “The development of increased European and Nordic power prices combined with continued declining operating and development costs has made it profitable to build wind power without subsidies in Norway,” Statnett said. The analysis said a large amount of wind power could be generated in southern Norway without creating new bottlenecks in the main grid. However, Statnett added that: “without significantly higher consumer growth and possibly more network capacity, northern Norway and the northern parts of central Norway appear less favourable for further wind power development.” Statnett did not give a figure for the amount of new wind capacity that could be built.  Norway’s current wind capacity is behind that of neighbour Sweden, although several wind farms are being built.  “There is currently more wind power under construction in Norway than is in operation, and a multiplication of wind power production in Norway is expected in the next few years,” regulator NVE said earlier this week.

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Profits from supplying gas and electricity at Britain’s big six energy firms fell by a combined 10 percent last year as they lost customers to smaller rivals, a report by industry regulator Ofgem said on Thursday. Earnings at Britain’s energy firms are under political scrutiny, with Ofgem set to impose a price cap in time for winter following a government promise to tackle “rip-off” prices. Britain’s big energy suppliers are also facing competition from more than 60 smaller challenger firms, often offering cheaper prices. Ofgem said the market share of the challenger companies had risen to 25 percent by June 2018, up from 20 percent a year earlier and up from just 1 percent around six years ago. The lower customer numbers led aggregated domestic supply revenues at the big six companies to fall by 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to 22 billion pounds in 2017, Ofgem said in its annual state of the market report. Total domestic supply profits aggregated across the six companies, measured as earnings before interest and tax, fell for the first time since 2014, by 10 percent to 900 million pounds in 2017, the report said. Profit margins from supplying energy at the big six companies – Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, SSE SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Innogy’s npower (IGY.DE), E.ON (EONGn.DE) and EDF Energy (EDF.PA) - varied widely. British Gas and SSE made the highest margins, at 8 and 7 percent respectively, while npower had the lowest at -5 percent. E.ON’s margins were at 5 percent, Scottish Power at 0.5 percent, while EDF Energy recorded a positive margin for the first time since 2009 of 0.9 percent, the report said. Ofgem said the big difference in margins was likely due to varying operating costs and the extent to which costs were passed onto customers. The big six will soon be the big five after Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority this week gave the go-ahead for a merger between SSE and npower. The companies aim to complete the deal by the first quarter of next year at the latest, they said earlier this year.

2018-10-11,"BHUBANESWAR, India (Reuters) - A cyclone slammed into India’s eastern seaboard on Thursday, killing at least five people, destroying huts, uprooting trees, snapping telephone poles and power lines and leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity. Strong gusts caused a storm surge with waters inundating low-lying areas in the eastern states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and the winds, on par with a Category 2 hurricane, wreaked havoc on infrastructure, blocking roads and hampering emergency work.   “Five people died due to falling trees and a wall collapse,” Disaster Management Commissioner of Andhra Pradesh D. Varaprasad told Reuters, adding drinking water shortages were a concern in many places due to electricity failure and generator outages.          Tropical cyclone “Titli,” with gusts of up to 165 kph (100 mph), made landfall in the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh in the early hours of Thursday, the India Meteorological Department said. “We fear that 6,000 to 7,000 electricity poles may have been uprooted,” K. Dhananjaya Reddy, district administrative chief of Srikakulam, told Reuters. “Around 400,000 to 500,000 people are now without electricity.” TV footage showed massive waves, tin roofs of several houses being blown away and trees toppled over. Odisha’s Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi said so far there had been no reports of casualties in the state. “There has been preparation at all levels within the state,” Sethi told Reuters, adding that it had used social media to keep people informed. “There have been large number of WhatsApp groups working at different levels and they help,” he said, adding the state also experimented with a early warning dissemination system, warning those near the coast through sirens and voice broadcasts. “Television channels, along with radio stations, also helped to spread messages,” he said. Officials in Odisha evacuated over 300,000 people, suspended operations at the port of Paradip and cancelled many trains and flights on Wednesday. The Odisha Chief Minister’s office in a tweet on Wednesday said schools and colleges across the state would remain closed for the week. “Operations at Paradip have been suspended and all ships have been shifted to deep sea,” said the Deputy Conservator of Paradip Port, Captain A.K. Mohapatra. The Bay of Bengal often witnesses cyclones at this time of year, with some causing widespread death and destruction. Odisha was hit last month by a low-intensity storm.

2018-10-11,"* Focus on returns even after oil prices hit 4-year high * Concerns over long-term oil demand weigh * M&A likely to remain constrained By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Energy companies and investors are focused on profits and reluctant to boost spending even after crude prices surged to four-year highs, a senior Goldman Sachs banker said on Thursday. Rattled by the recent downturn in the sector and long-term concerns over oil demand and the switch to renewables, Big Oil is facing an unprecedented challenge. “We’re firmly through that survival phase and the better capitalized players are now positioned to do well on the other side of it,” Andrew Fry, global head of energy at Goldman said at the Oil & Money conference in London. Companies typically seek to increase spending as they emerge from a downturn in order to capture low drilling costs and an expected supply shortage. But this time round, the barriers for investments are high, with investors seeking returns of as much as 15 to 20 percent from multi-billion dollar oil and gas projects, Fry said. “In the near term the focus is on returns as opposed to growth for the sake of growth,” he said. As a result, companies are currently focusing on buying back shares and paying dividends to investors with the excess cash they generate. “For the first time since the downturn, the oil companies now have their balance sheets in order. They are all starting to think about growth but it is very conservative,” James Janoskey, global co-head of oil and gas at JPMorgan, said. “When we came out of downturns in the past, we didn’t have energy transition issues and there probably wasn’t that much pressure from investors.” Capital expenditure among the world’s top oil companies is expected to rise to $140 billion by 2021, from the current $100 billion, but will remain well below the $200 billion before the 2014 oil price collapse, according to Adam Brett, HSBC global head of natural resources advisory. That means oil majors will show very healthy returns on capital invested, he added. He said that even in the United States, where oil output has resumed spectacular growth on the back of high oil prices, large companies will try to maintain capital discipline and focus on returns rather than pure production growth. “For Big Oil, value will prevail over volume,” Brett said, adding that most remuneration reports now made clear that top executives at oil majors are being rewarded for delivering robust cash flows rather than production increases. Acquisitions, another way to boost production and reserves, are also expected to be constrained and focused. Energy mergers and acquisitions amounted to $360 billion last year and stand at $280 billion so far this year, said Brett. Although the volume of M&A has been relatively stable in recent years, the structure has changed since China largely suspended its buying spree over the past three years, he said. An anti-corruption drive and revisions of overly expensive deals have prompted China to cut down on buying resources around the world in the past three years. Brett said that M&A were currently dominated by downstream and mid-stream transactions with the share of upstream declining to 35-40 percent, from as high as 60-70 percent when China was an active asset buyer. “You see much more downstream M&A activity. And I expect this to continue in the years ahead,” Brett said.

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will be able to meet power and gas demand this winter, even in the event of an extreme cold snap, National Grid said in its 2018/19 winter outlook report on Thursday. “For this winter, even under colder conditions than experienced in recent years, we are confident we have the right products and strategies in place to help us balance the gas and electricity networks,” National Grid said. In March this year National Grid was forced to issue a gas deficit warning for the first time in eight years after Europe was gripped by a cold snap, dubbed the “Beast from the East”, and after several pieces of gas infrastructure suffered outages. National Grid said the warning had the desired effect, encouraging more gas to come to the market and demonstrated that Britain can meet its gas demands from a variety of sources even if there is an extreme event. Total gas demand is forecast at 46.6 billion cubic metres this winter, slightly lower than last winter, which National Grid said was due to lower forecasts of demand from gas-fired power generators. “As global gas prices have risen, it is likely that coal will replace gas in the generation merit order for some of the winter,” the report said. National Grid said the country would also have enough electricity to meet demand this winter, with the so-called de-rated margin, or surplus power margin, forecast at 7.1 gigawatts (GW), 0.9 GW more than the forecasted margin of winter 2017/18. Electricity demand is expected to peak in the first half of December, with peak demand forecast at 48 GW. Wholesale electricity prices are likely to be volatile over the period partly driven by the weather dependency of renewable generation, the report said. Electricity prices in continental Europe are likely to be lower than in Britain in winter, meaning National Grid expected to see a net flow of electricity imports into Britain over the period. “However, outages on the Belgian nuclear fleet... could increase continental prices and create some uncertainty on interconnector flow direction,” the report said. Belgium faces an unprecedented power shortfall ahead of winter, with only one of seven nuclear reactors scheduled to operate in November, which provide around 50 percent of the country’s electricity. Britain has electricity interconnectors with France, the Netherlands and Ireland.

2018-10-11,"LONDON, Oct 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Cheap, reliable and hard to hijack, the sun could be an ideal energy source in many war zones and disaster areas, prompting aid agencies to consider ditching costly fuel for solar power. While the technology has not advanced far enough to make a full swap viable, some solar projects are already underway in the field and aid workers expect many more to follow. “It’s very easy to exploit the fuel chain and it happens in a number of big emergencies. It’s too easy to nick. There’s a lot of bad practice around making money out of fuel,” said Andy Bastable, head of Oxfam’s water and sanitation projects. Traditional fuel can be used as a weapon, hijacked by militants, sold on the black market, or must be flown vast distances to reach off-grid relief camps, increasing costs and volatility for the hard-pressed aid sector. And the sun shines in most areas where they work. “In 90 percent of cases, we are acting in places where there is abundant solar supply,” said Per-Erik Eriksson, an engineer with medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF). “To avoid logistical challenges and over time, to save costs, (solar energy) would certainly be a very good solution in most of our projects,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Renewable energy sources, such as solar power, are key to reducing climate-changing emissions and keeping the earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. A report this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said renewable energy would need to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. For engineer Talal Kanaan, rolling out nearly 500 solar panels to power hospitals in war-battered Syria last year was the logical way to keep the country’s health system running. “We didn’t want to put solar for the sake of it because it’s ‘cool’ or environmentally friendly,” said Kanaan, founder of Syria Solar, part of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), a coalition of medical groups. “The role of solar was to increase the resilience of the health system,” he said in a phone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Syria’s electrical grid has taken a big hit after seven years of war with infrastructure destroyed, leaving hospitals relying on diesel generators and at the mercy of fuel shortages. “The costs and the availability of fuel is volatile. That’s the problem: the source of it is coming from an area that is in conflict or across the firing line,” said Kanaan. He said fuel could easily be used as a weapon of war, referring to 2015 when Islamic State militants hijacked oil fields in northern Syria, which drove up diesel prices and paralysed hospitals, ambulances and rescue services. In contrast, Syria Solar says if there was an outage, its solar system can fully power an intensive care unit, operating rooms and emergency departments for up to 24 hours without diesel, which is 20 to 30 percent of the hospital’s energy cost. The group said it also saves about 7,000 litres of diesel per month and cuts about 200 tonnes of carbon each year. Using grant money, Kanaan said he hopes to deploy electric ambulances next year, and remotely connect people in Syria with overseas doctors through online services like Skype, which would be powered by the existing solar energy system. MSF’s Eriksson said there was a dire need to use solar in emergencies, especially in rural areas that are not connected to the grid. Eriksson, who has worked in remote parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo on renewable energy projects, said delivering fuel was often the hardest and most expensive part. “In some projects, we even fly in fuel and that’s really tough and costly. But it’s been the only alternative and that’s why we do it,” he said in a phone interview. Many aid groups told the Thomson Reuters Foundation they already run some solar energy projects, but admit that a complete switch to cleaner energy could take years. Humanitarian agencies still largely depend on diesel generators, said Alain Oppliger, a sustainable development adviser at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). “Renewable energy sources such as solar panels take time to be installed. When you require energy immediately in an emergency, then fuel-powered generators are still the best option,” said Oppliger in emailed comments. Many locals in the community already know how to use traditional fuel-powered generators, but implementing solar energy would need specialised knowledge, aid agencies said. But one of the biggest hurdles is storing excess renewable energy in large enough batteries, several aid agencies said. “Battery technology hasn’t moved much at all - it’s the final frontier,” said Oxfam’s Bastable. “If they can come up with some kind of innovation around how to store the energy better, then renewables become a lot more attractive.” Batteries have long held the promise of solving the intermittent nature of renewables such as wind and solar. Pairing big batteries with renewable energy boosts reliability without creating carbon emissions, and more homes and businesses are looking to batteries for backup power and to capture excess energy to use when the sun is not shining. MSF’s Eriksson was confident technology would trickle down. “Prices (for solar technology) are coming down quite rapidly but it’s still a few years away, which is why it might be more difficult in the emergency context,” said Eriksson. “But I really strongly believe that we will see a stronger movement (towards renewable energy) over the coming, say, five years.” Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Lyndsay

2018-10-11,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Indonesia coal exports vs price: tmsnrt.rs/2yvX8lH By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Indonesia wants to export more coal in order to earn U.S. dollars to shore up its faltering currency, but the problem is buyers don’t seem to be hearing the message. Indonesia’s coal exports dropped to 24.8 million tonnes in September, down 12.4 percent from August’s 28.3 million tonnes and 10 percent from 27.6 million tonnes in the same month last year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. If the drop isn’t worrying enough, it comes even as the price of lower-grade Indonesian coal is at its widest discount to higher-quality Australian thermal coal. Indonesia is planning to increase its 2018 output of coal to around 507 million tonnes, up from a previous target of 485 million tonnes. The aim is to convert the additional U.S. dollars from sales of the polluting fuel into rupiah, which has dropped about 12 percent so far this year against the U.S. currency. In theory, importers should be keen to ramp up purchases of Indonesian coal, as the massive discount to Australian cargoes more than compensates for the lower energy value. The price of thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port , as assessed by Argus Media, was $112.25 a tonne in the week ended Oct. 5. Low-rank Indonesian coal, with an energy content of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), was at $38.88 a tonne at the end of the same week, according to Argus. This represents a discount of $73.37 a tonne - the widest on record, exceeding the $61.07 recorded in November 2016, according to the Argus data. Even Indonesian coal with a similar energy content to Newcastle is trading at a fairly wide discount, with the Indonesian government’s reference price, known as the HBA COAL-HBA-ID, set at $100.89 a tonne for October. The HBA is a composite price made up equally of the Platts Kalimantan 5,900 kcal/kg assessments, the Argus-Indonesia Coal Index for 6,500 kcal/kg, Newcastle Export Index of 6,322 kcal/kg and the globalCOAL Newcastle grade of 6,000 kcal/kg. In effect, the HBA index sets the price for much of Indonesia’s thermal coal exports, and its discount to Newcastle should provide support for exports from the Southeast Asian nation. Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal used in power stations, has two major customers, China and India, the planet’s two largest coal importers. Chinese buyers mainly use Indonesian coal as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, trading off a loss in energy value for lower sulphur and ash. Indonesia’s exports to China are up strongly in the first nine months of the year, reaching 89.7 million tonnes, 18.8 percent above the level for the same period last year, according to the ship-tracking data. However, much of this strength was in the first quarter of 2018, and September marked a third month of declining imports from Indonesia. China imported 7.5 million tonnes from Indonesia in September, down sharply from August’s 9.7 million tonnes, making it the weakest month so far this year. The news on India’s imports isn’t quite as bad for Indonesian exporters, with September’s 7.1 million tonnes down slightly from August’s 7.4 million tonnes. However, for the first nine months of the year, India’s imports from Indonesia have been relatively flat, dropping fractionally to 57.8 million tonnes from 58.2 million in the same period in 2017. What may be worrying for Indonesian coal exporters is that their rivals seem to be gaining on them in India, while they stand still. India bought 12.5 million tonnes of coal from the United States in the January-September period, up 49 percent on the 8.4 million tonnes imported in the same period last year. From South Africa, India imported 25.9 million tonnes in the first nine months of 2018, up 16 percent from 22.4 million tonnes in the same period a year ago. Although the overwhelming majority of Australia’s coal exports to India are coking coal used in steel-making, it’s worth noting that these are also up in the first nine months of 2018, climbing to 34.7 million tonnes compared to 30.4 million tonnes in the same period last year. What the numbers are showing is that Indonesia is likely to struggle to ramp up exports of its mainly low-rank thermal coal, as there doesn’t seem to be appetite among buyers, even though the discount to higher-grade fuel is as wide as it has ever been.

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC cut its forecast of global demand growth for oil next year for a third straight month on Thursday, citing headwinds facing the broader economy, and key consuming countries in particular, from trade disputes and volatile emerging markets. In its monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said world oil demand would increase by 1.36 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, marking a decline of 50,000 bpd from its previous estimate.  The group also cut the estimate for demand in 2019 for its own crude by another 300,000 bpd from last month to 31.8 million bpd, which in turn marks a decline of 900,000 bpd from the projection for 2018. OPEC said its own production rose by 132,000 bpd in September to 32.76 million bpd, the highest according to the monthly report since August 2017. Saudi Arabia and Libya increased output last month by 108,000 bpd and 103,000 bpd respectively, more than offsetting the 150,000-bpd decline from Iran to 3.447 million bpd, as reported by secondary sources. OPEC said Iran told the group its oil output had fallen by just 51,000 bpd to 3.775 million bpd. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, has pledged to increase output to compensate for the loss of any Iranian supply to U.S. sanctions that come into force next month.

2018-10-11,"ISTANBUL, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Turkey has transferred the operating rights of seven high-potential coal fields to private companies, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said on Thursday, in an effort to reduce the country’s reliance on energy imports. Once a darling of foreign investors, Turkey’s energy sector, which relies almost entirely on imports, has been hit by a sharp decline in the lira. The currency has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year, sparking worries over its impact on the wider economy and the banking sector. State pipeline operator Botas raised prices for natural gas used in electricity production by 50 percent in August. Natural gas and electricity prices for residential use have also been hiked for three consecutive months. Speaking at the signing ceremony, Donmez said 19 million tonnes of coal would be produced with the new agreements, which is expected to halve annual imported coal costs. “Every move that will decrease our dependence on foreign countries and increase local production will make us stronger and more independent,” Donmez said, adding the production would also help bring down Turkey’s current account deficit. He did not give a time scale for the increased production. The Turkish Hardcoal Authority signed agreements with Erdemir Madencilik, TUMAS and Emsa Enerji, while the Directorate of Turkish Coal signed agreements with Imbat Madencilik, FERNAS, Yapi-Tek and Koc Holding’s Demir Export for the operating rights of the coal fields, the energy ministry said. Turkey produced 78.9 million tonnes of raw coal in 2017, including 1.8 million tonnes of hardcoal, and imported 36.6 million tonnes of hardcoal, data from Turkey’s statistics institution shows. Turkey also announced last week it would hold a tender for the operating rights of three solar energy power plants with a total capacity of 1,000 megawatts.

2018-10-11,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Ahmed Aboulenein ERBIL, Iraq, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Iraq’s government has named Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi as head of a new National Oil Company which will serve as an umbrella organisation for state oil firms, an oil ministry spokesman told Reuters on Thursday. Parliament voted in March to establish the company, which is meant to manage Iraq’s upstream operations, freeing up the ministry to set plans and strategies for developing the sector. The decision was voted on unanimously in cabinet last week, spokesman Asim Jihad said. The positions of oil minister and National Oil Company chief are not related, he added. “The appointment decision was made for many reasons, including the experience Luaibi has,” Jihad said. Luaibi will also remain as oil minister in Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s outgoing government, he said. Iraqi President Barham Salih named former oil minister Adel Abdul Mahdi as prime minister-designate earlier this month and tasked him with forming a new government. It is unclear if Luaibi will remain after that. “The issue of selection of a new minister is the responsibility of the prime minister-designate. Anything is possible, we will wait and see,” said Jihad. Luaibi remains a minister until a new government is formed and approved by parliament, he said.

2018-10-11,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa’s GDP growth is rising but it must do more to solidify a fragile recovery and prepare for major disruptions in the global economy, the International Monetary Fund’s top official for Africa said. Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is on track to hit 3.1 percent this year, up from 2.7 percent in 2017 and a turnaround from the 2014-15 commodities crash, Abebe Selassie, director of the IMF’s African Department, told Reuters. It could quicken further to 3.8 percent in 2019. One-third of Africans live in countries where per capital GDP fell last year however, according a report released by the IMF on Thursday.   Trade tensions between the United States and other major economies including China could lead to a cumulative loss of GDP for Africa of up to 1.5 percent by 2021. And Africa will face long-term challenges due to rapid advances in artificial intelligence and increased automation which are expected to shape future job markets.  “If you are not equipping your labor force for the jobs that have to be created, you could end up with much lower growth rates. And that’s what we’re worried about,” Selassie said in a telephone interview.  Africa will need to create an average of 20 million new jobs for its rapidly growing population each year through 2035, more than double the job creation rate of the past five years.  Though the pan-African growth rate is dragged down by the sluggish performances of large economies like South Africa, Angola and Nigeria, many countries are seeing robust expansion.  “We have 22-odd countries that are growing at close to 6 percent or more, and quite a lot of others in the 3, 4 or 5 percent,” Selassie said.   However despite pledges to reform, little progress has been made to improve revenue mobilisation and diversify economies to make them less vulnerable to future crises, he said.  Capital inflows to Africa have grown exponentially in recent years, but there too risks exist. Much of the increase has come from debt. Liability inflows ballooned from $3 billion in 2000 to $60 billion last year, Selassie said.  “We are very, very careful to highlight that this is a double-edged sword,” he said. “A very healthy, stable macro environment is paramount. Those are necessary conditions. They’re not sufficient.” Governments must also promote digital connectivity, ensure flexibility in their education systems to meet the demands of the future job market, better allocate public spending and nurture private investment.  Economies can potentially benefit greatly from new technologies that are already transforming the continent, Selassie said.  The widespread adoption of mobile money, for example, has given millions of Africans access to financial services for the first time. But an enormous amount of work is required to ensure Africa is not left behind.  The region currently has the lowest internet penetration rate in the world at less than half the global average. Secondary education enrolment rates in Africa are also the world’s lowest.

2018-10-11,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German consumers, who pay the highest electricity bills in Europe, are likely to see a 4.2 percent drop in the surcharge they have to pay to support renewable power next year, green energy lobby group BEE forecast on Thursday. The levy is a key part of Germany’s Energiewende policy to switch to less environmentally damaging sources of energy, but has sparked criticism from some consumers, with all government fees now accounting for over 50 percent of final power bills.  The surcharge under the renewable energy act (EEG) could fall to 6.51 euro cents (7.52 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2019 from 6.792 cents in 2018, BEE said in a statement. It gave a forecast range was 6.4-6.6 cents. Germany’s four network operators (TSOs), which collect the fee, are due to announce the 2019 surcharge next Monday, but BEE’s predictions have in the past been close to the outcome. The fee accounts for about a fifth of consumers’ final bills. Explaining the expected fall, BEE pointed to a rise in wholesale power prices, which has allowed renewable producers to achieve higher revenues and so rely less on subsidies. [EL/DE] Indeed, the funds collected to support green electricity are expected to exceed anticipated payouts next year, even though an increase in wind and solar installations will raise the number of potential recipients for subsidies.  The eventual cost depends on weather patterns, which determine how much renewable energy is generated, and so how much producers can claim from the EEG account. Payouts under the EEG this year are expected to amount to over 25 billion euros ($29 billion), according to industry estimates. So far, the surcharge has only fallen twice since its introduction in 2000 - in 2015 and 2018. Internet portal Check24 said last week annual power bills paid by German households had risen 17 percent year-on-year to a total of 5.36 billion euros. The wholesale price of German round-the-clock power delivery next year has increased by 38 percent since the start of the year to stand at 51 euros a megawatt hour (MWh), Refinitiv Eikon data shows.

2018-10-11,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Tomato paste is not the most obvious economic indicator, but in Iran, where it is a staple that some people have started panic-buying, it says a lot about the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions. While Iran makes its own paste from an abundant crop of locally grown tomatoes, sanctions reimposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since August have played havoc with supply. A 70 percent slide in the rial this year has prompted a scramble for foreign currency that has made exports much more valuable in local terms than selling produce at home. Some shops are limiting purchases of tomato paste, which is used in many Persian dishes, and some lines have sold out as people buy up existing stock. The government has responded by banning tomato exports, one of a raft of interventions to try to limit economic instability that has fuelled public protests and criticism of the government this year. But the tomato policy is not working. An industry representative said tomatoes were being smuggled abroad. “We have heard that trucks full of tomatoes are still leaving the country, especially to Iraq,” Mohammad Mir-Razavi, head of the Syndicate of Canning Industry, said by telephone. “They put boxes of greenhouse tomatoes on top and hide normal tomatoes at the bottom,” he said, referring to an exemption for hot-house grown tomatoes that left a loophole. It is one of many ways in which the sanctions are hurting ordinary Iranians while benefiting those with access to hard currency. Washington reintroduced steps against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after the U.S. withdrawal from a deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump said the deal was not strict enough. With U.S. curbs on Iran’s oil exports set to come into force next month, some Iranians fear their country is entering an economic slump that may prove worse than the period from 2012 to 2015, when it last faced major sanctions. “There is an emerging consensus that the economy will go through a period of austerity similar to that recorded during the Iran-Iraq war,” said Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at London’s Betamatrix consultancy. Jumps in prices are occurring in a range of goods — particularly imports such as mobile telephones and other consumer electronics, but also some staples. A bottle of milk, 15,000 rials last year, now sells for 36,000. An 800-gramme (28-ounce) can of tomato paste was selling in Tehran stores for around 60,000 rials in March; it is now 180,000 rials, or $1.24 at the unofficial rate, prompting a scramble by households to stock up. The price of tomatoes has increased more than five-fold compared to last year. Signs on the shelves of some stores limit each customer to two cans. Iranian online shopping site Digikala lists the top nine tomato paste items as out of stock, and the rest as “coming soon”. In supermarkets in Najaf in neighbouring Iraq, meanwhile, supplies of Iranian tomato paste are plentiful. Adding to the pressure is a fourfold rise in the price of cans, Mir-Razavi said. Traders importing material to make cans sought to buy dollars at a little-used official rate of 42,000 rials; authorities asked them to use a more expensive rate. The issue has delayed shipments of material to factories. The government is mounting a campaign against price-gouging, periodically ordering shopkeepers to sell at lower prices. But some shopkeepers respond by not selling at all, believing prices will eventually rise again as the sanctions bite. Iran, a big oil producer with a diverse economy, has shown its farming, manufacturing and distribution sectors can ride out long periods of war and sanctions. The Tehran Stock Exchange index has soared 83 percent this year as shares of exporting companies have rocketed. Urban real estate prices have also risen as Iranians plough their savings into property rather than keeping them in depreciating rials. The rial’s plunge, which in the unofficial market has taken it to around 145,000 against the dollar from 42,890 at the end of 2017, according to currency tracking website bonbast.com, may even have strengthened the financial system in one way. Banks and pension funds have been struggling with massive debts. Emadi said the rial’s slide, to as low as 190,000 in late September, had given the government huge windfall profits on its dollar holdings; authorities appear to have injected some of those profits into insolvent banks to shore them up, he said. But while official data for the last few months has not yet been released, Emadi said he believed the economy was already in a recession that could deepen in coming months. The International Monetary Fund predicted this week that the economy would shrink 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, before recovering slowly. That would make the slump less deep than the recession of 2012, when the economy shrank over 7 percent, and not nearly as damaging as the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988, when it shrank by about a quarter. The IMF also forecast the average inflation rate would jump to a peak above 34 percent next year, briefly returning to its level in 2013. How much the current recession resembles past periods of economic pain for Iran will depend on the extent to which Washington can use the sanctions to push other countries into cutting oil and non-oil trade with the Islamic Republic. U.S. officials have said the sanctions will be tougher than the steps in 2012-2015. They aim to reduce Iranian oil exports more sharply, and to disrupt exports to Iran from trading hubs such as Dubai more aggressively. “I think the return of the sanctions has had a devastating effect on their economy and I think it’s going to get worse,” Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters in late August. But Emadi said that if European nations succeeded in creating a special payments system permitting trade with Iran to continue, and if Tehran cracked down on endemic corruption, the economy might start recovering gradually a year from now. In the meantime, many Iranians may continue to struggle with surging prices and an unstable currency. Peyman Mohammadian, 28, an unemployed university graduate in the western city of Andimeshk, said he had tried to protect 5 billion rials in savings by converting them into dollars last month at a rate of 183,000. Since then, the rial has partially rebounded as authorities have sold dollars to support it and threatened currency speculators with arrest. Mohammadian said this left him in a quandary. “On one hand, I want the dollar to rise so I don’t lose my money. But on the other hand, I want it to drop below 100,000 — otherwise inflation will be so high that I won’t be able to get married for 10 years.” For a graphic on U.S. dollar versus Iranian rial in unofficial market, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2OCUtkd Editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-economy-life/rpt-tomato-squeeze-us-sanctions-begin-to-distort-irans-economy-idUKL8N1WR32L,11 Oct 2018,"Tomato paste is not the

2018-10-11,"* Rates buoyed by weather disruptions, demand and bunker costs * VLCC for USGC to N.Asia up $1 million-$2 million from week ago * U.S. crude arrivals into Asia in Nov to be lowest since March By Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Rising shipping rates have increased the costs of shipping oil from the United States to Asia and may further the restrict the flow of U.S. oil to the region later this year, multiple trade and shipping sources said on Thursday. Freight rates for tankers that carry crude oil have soared globally, buoyed by peak seasonal demand, weather disruptions and higher bunker fuel costs, the sources said. The cost of chartering a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) capable of carrying 2 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Gulf coast to South Korea and Japan rose to above $7 million this week, $1 million to $2 million higher than the previous week, according to a shipbroker. Shipping a barrel of oil from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port in the Gulf of Mexico on a VLCC to the Southeast Asian refining centre of Singapore costs $3.26 as of Oct. 10, up from $1.78 a month ago, according to data on Refinitiv Eikon. TD-LPP-SIN “The freight is really expensive these days making every crude grade more expensive,” said an oil buyer in North Asia, who is currently comparing economics for crude arriving in January to decide which grades they will buy. A Singapore-based trader said U.S. crude prices will have to weaken relative to crude from other countries before resuming strong flows to Asia. U.S crude arrivals to Asia are expected to fall in November to 19 million barrels, the lowest since March, as buyers baulked at higher prices, according to the sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon. Chinese refiners have also limited their U.S. crude purchases amid concerns that Beijing could impose import duties on U.S. oil as part of its trade war with the United States. Unipec, the trading arm of Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec , resumed U.S. oil liftings to China in September with shipments loaded onto the VLCC New Courage. The ship is scheduled to arrive in eastern China on Nov. 21, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed. Other Chinese buyers have refrained from purchasing U.S. oil while sourcing crude from other regions. “With freights where they are, we are likely to see shorter haul movement into Europe,” said Virendra Chauhan, an analyst at Energy Aspects. The drop in U.S. oil flows to Asia could further pressure U.S. spot crude prices as producers grapple with limited pipeline capacity to drain excess supplies, the sources said. It could also drive up U.S. exports to Europe and displace North Sea and Mediterranean crude grades, they added. Reporting by Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by

2018-10-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC’s Secretary-General on Thursday criticized a report calling for radical action to fight climate change, saying the idea that renewable energy was the world’s only future was misguided and that a “bombardment” of green advocacy could be harmful. A U.N. panel this week called for unprecedented changes in how the world consumes energy and a dramatic rise in the use of renewable power to contain global warming and protect the planet from heatwaves, floods and rising sea levels. “We have significant concerns with some of their conclusions, not to talk about their solutions going forward,”  Mohammad Barkindo of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries told an Oil & Money conference in London. The past 18 years have been the warmest on record since the 1850s when measurements began, according to U.N. scientists who attribute the temperature rises and extreme weather mainly to greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. “It is not about choosing one energy source against another, as it is being suggested by some of our colleagues in the scientific community. In some quarters we hear stories that suggest renewables are our only energy future. This, with all true respect to our friends, is clearly misguided,” he said. The U.N. report said renewable energy would need to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Barkindo said a “bombardment of advocacy” for alternative energy sources was impacting sources of financing and investment in the hydrocarbon industry with potentially dangerous consequences for society and the global economy. To contain the rise in global temperatures at 1.5C, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels. It said emissions should be “net zero” by mid-century. “Oil is not toxic at the end of the day, emissions are toxic,” Barkindo said, adding that technologies to reduce and ultimately eliminate emissions from fossil fuels should be the focus of attention. OPEC raised its forecast for growth in global oil demand last month. It now sees 2020 oil consumption reaching 101.9 million barrels per day (bpd), up 1.2 million bpd from last year’s report. Longer-term, oil demand is expected to increase by 14.5 million bpd to 111.7 million bpd by 2040.

2018-10-11,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - European stocks slumped to a more than an 18-month low on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst losses in eight months triggered a surge of global selling that knocked over Asia too. Losses in London, Paris and Milan were already climbing towards 2 percent in early trading, although the selloff wasn’t quite as dramatic as the overnight session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asian shares not including Japan ended down 3.6 percent, having struck its lowest level since March 2017. China’s main indexes had slumped over 5 percent. It meant MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index was having its worst day since early 2016, after Wall Street’s swoon had given the 47-country world index equivalent its worst day since February. “Equity markets are locked in a sharp sell-off, with concern around how far yields will rise, warnings from the IMF about financial stability risks and continued trade tension all driving uncertainty,” summed up analysts at ANZ. The sell-off, which came as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said stock market valuations have been “extremely high”, erased hundreds of billions of dollars of global wealth . Japan’s Nikkei ended down 3.9 percent, its steepest daily drop since March. The broader TOPIX lost around $207 billion in market value, falling 3.5 percent. Shanghai’s drop was its most severe since February 2016 and left it at its lowest level since late 2014. Shares in Taiwan were even harder hit, losing 6.3 percent. Seoul’s Kospi index dropped 3.8 percent. “I think what happened was that we were a maximum elevation of risk appetite and maximum valuation of (U.S.) large caps and tech, so when you have that situation you are always vulnerable,” said UBP macro and FX strategist Koon Chow. Europe’s traders retreated to the safety of German and other higher-rated government bonds. Italian bonds aren’t on that list, and they saw more selling before a key set of auctions, amid ongoing concern about the country’s financial health. “It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. “For sure it creates a more challenging environment for today’s (Italian) auctions.” Sinking global shares have raised the stakes for U.S. inflation figures due later on Thursday. High inflation would only stoke speculation of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. On Wall Street, the S&P500’s sharpest one-day fall since February wiped out around $850 billion of wealth as technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday with down 3.29 percent, the Nasdaq Composite 4.08 percent and the Dow 2.2 percent. The bloodletting attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. “I think the Fed has gone crazy”. Hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers triggered the sell- off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared with bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits. “The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook,” said Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.” The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets, putting particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States. China’s central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9377 at 0602 GMT. China’s move has forced other emerging-market currencies to weaken to stay competitive and drawn the ire of the United States, which sees it as an unfair devaluation. “The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,” said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s global head of G10 FX strategy. “Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital and a loss of control.” The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favoured currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses. The euro was at $1.1550, up from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen, a retreat from last week’s 114.54 peak. That left the dollar at 95.263 against a basket of currencies. In commodity markets, gold struggled to get any safety bid and edged down to $1,192.77. Oil prices skidded in line with U.S. equity markets, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which shut down some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output. Brent crude fell 1.6 percent to $81.75 a barrel. U.S. crude dropped 1.5 percent to $72.07 .

2018-10-11,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The owner of the Fukushima nuclear plant, destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami more than seven years ago, said water treated at the site still contains radioactive materials that for years it has insisted had been removed.  The admission by Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) could ruin its chances of releasing the water into the ocean, a move the nuclear regulator says is safe but which local fishermen oppose. Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics more than five years ago, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declaring that Fukushima was “under control” in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee. The nearly one million tonnes of stored water at the wrecked plant, enough to fill about 500 Olympic swimming pools, still contained detectable levels of potentially harmful radioactive particles, Tepco told a government committee on Oct. 1. Tepco (9501.T) apologised to the committee under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is looking into ways to dispose of the water. A spokesman at Tepco confirmed the findings and the apology. A 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered meltdowns at three of the Fukushima Daiichi plant’s six reactors, spewing radiation into the air, soil and ocean and forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned. It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier. Hundreds of deaths have been attributed to the chaos of evacuations during the crisis and to the hardship and trauma refugees have experienced since then, but the government only last month acknowledged for the first time that one worker at the plant had died from radiation exposure. Documents on the government committee’s website show that of 890,000 tonnes of water held at Fukushima, 750,000 tonnes, or 84 percent, contain higher concentrations of radioactive materials than legal limits allow. In 65,000 tonnes of treated water, the levels of radioactive materials are more than 100 times government safety levels. Radioactive readings of one of those isotopes, strontium-90, considered dangerous to human health, were detected at 600,000 becquerels per litre in some tanks, 20,000 times the legal limit. Tepco has for years insisted that its purification processes remove strontium and 61 other radioactive elements from the contaminated water but leaves tritium, a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water.  Tritium is regularly released after dilution in normally operating nuclear plants. “We will filter the water in the tanks one more time to bring the levels to below regulatory limits before release into the ocean if a decision is made to do so,” the Tepco spokesman said.      The water build-up has come about because Tepco must pour water over the three reactors to keep the melted uranium fuel at a safe temperature.  Groundwater flowing from the hills above the plant enters the reactor basements, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris. That gets pumped out and treated before being stored in tanks that are fast filling up. And a costly “ice wall” is failing to keep groundwater from entering the basements, a Reuters analysis of the Tepco data showed earlier this year. The groundwater seepage has delayed Tepco’s clean-up and may undermine the entire decommissioning process. Nearby residents, particularly fishermen, oppose ocean releases of the treated water because they fear it will keep consumers from buying Fukushima products.  Many countries, including South Korea and China, still have restrictions on produce from Fukushima and neighbouring areas.

2018-10-11,"FRANKFURT, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A surcharge levied on German consumers to support renewable power will likely fall by 4.2 percent in 2019, helping relieve end customers’ bills, renewable energy lobby group BEE said on Thursday. The surcharge under the renewable energy act (EEG) could amount to 6.51 euro cents ($7.52 cents) per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2019 after 6.792 cents applied in 2018, BEE said in a statement. It cited higher prices for mandatory European carbon emissions permits that have rallied this year after EU reforms to CO2 trading, which have driven wholesale power prices higher. This allows renewables producers to achieve higher revenue and retrieve lower subsidies.

2018-10-11,"(Reuters) - Diversified Gas & Oil Plc (DGOC.L) said on Thursday it acquired privately held natural gas producer Core Appalachia for $183 million, expanding its presence in the Appalachian Basin. The assets were acquired from TCFII Core LLC and include 5,000 producing wells in Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia, with production of about 11,200 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, of which 90 percent is gas. London-listed Diversified Gas, which has a market value of about $730 million, said the deal would increase its overall net output by about 19 percent to about 71,000 boe a day and reserves by 25 percent to 493 million boe. The deal, which marks Diversified Gas & Oil’s fourth acquisition in the Appalachian Basin this year, comprises a cash payment of $130 million and the issuance of 35 million new shares of 1 pence at an issue price of 1.15 pound-a-share, the company said. Diversified Gas & Oil said the acquired wells are located close to the oil and gas producing assets it bought in July for about $575 million from EQT. “We expect to deliver both immediate and near-term synergies by combining these assets, resulting in higher revenues and lower operating expenses which will support our exceptional EBITDA margins across the portfolio and drive dividend payouts higher,” Chief Executive Officer Rusty Hutson said. “We have strategically diversified our business beyond upstream, and now control the vast network of gathering assets in Kentucky and West Virginia providing an additional revenue stream as we transport gas for other operators,” Hutson added. In June, the company had announced plans to buy oil and gas producing assets in the Appalachian Basin for about $575 million in a reverse takeover.

The company isolated and depressurized a 36-inch pipeline, which carries gas to the Pacific Northwest, after it ruptured on Tuesday evening causing gas to ignite. An adjacent 30-inch pipeline was also depressurized for safety. The Canadian regulator, National Energy Board (NEB), approved on Wednesday night the restart of the 30-inch line after a comprehensive integrity assessment, Enbridge said. The company has begun a process that will last several hours to return the line to service and plans to gradually bring the pressure up to about 80 percent of normal operating capacity. Once this is safely completed, some of the capacity would be restored, Enbridge said. Royal Dutch Shell had said it was “proactively shutting units down” at its Puget Sound refinery in Washington state due to the incident and Phillips 66 said it was adjusting operations at its Ferndale refinery, also in Washington state. FortisBC, British Columbia’s energy utility, declared force majeure on Wednesday on several of its rate schedules which informed shippers their delivery of gas was being curtailed. The company estimates about 70 percent of its roughly 1 million customers could lose gas supply due to the incident. FortisBC earlier asked customers to avoid non-essential use of gas and said there could be service disruptions. Puget Sound Energy, Washington state’s energy utility, issued a similar notice. Enbridge earlier said it was maintaining a 1 km (0.6 mile) evacuation zone around the site and was working with regulators on investigating the cause of the incident. NEB said it had sent a team to the site and was working with the company and other affected parties on the emergency response and investigation. The rupture occurred near the city of Prince George in British Columbia’s northeast. About 100 people were evacuated from their homes in a nearby Aboriginal community on Tuesday as a precautionary measure. There were no injuries. Shares of Enbridge closed down 2.3 percent at $42.61 on the Toronto Stock Exchange as the broader Canadian energy index slipped 3.7 percent on falling oil prices.

2018-10-11,"FALLUJA, Iraq (Reuters) - An army officer was killed and three soldiers were captured in western Iraq after militants attacked their vehicle, security sources said on Thursday. The attack took place late on Wednesday in the town of Akaz, five kilometres (three miles) from the Qaim district of  Anbar province. The unit was delivering food to other troops, the sources told Reuters. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but Islamic State militants are active in the area. Usually militants kill soldiers and take officers captive whom they view as higher value targets, the sources said, but the reverse happened on Wednesday night. At least eight people were killed and 12 wounded in a suicide car-bomb attack on a security checkpoint in the same area last August. Iraq declared victory over Islamic State last December, dislodging the group from all the territory it held after its self-proclaimed caliphate, which also encompassed part of Syria, collapsed earlier in 2017. Security forces retook Qaim, which lies 300 km (185 miles) west of Baghdad in the Sunni province of Anbar, on the border with Syria, in November. It was one of the last remaining territories in Iraq held by Islamic State. The group’s fighters have since then waged a campaign of killings and abductions.

2018-10-11,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Ministers from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives attacked on Thursday a proposal by the Social Democrats to fine carmakers who fail to offer diesel hardware retrofits, opening a new battle front in their fragile coalition government. The government outlined plans earlier this month to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes in an attempt to avert driving bans in major cities such as Berlin and Hamburg. But the co-governing center-left Social Democrats (SPD) want to go a step further and fine carmakers that fail to fix polluting diesel-engined vehicles. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a member of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of her Bavarian CSU allies, both rejected the idea, saying it was probably illegal. “Fines are justified under German law when someone has breached his legal obligations. But I have doubts whether this path is even feasible under constitutional law,” Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio. Scheuer, in an interview with daily newspaper Bild, rejected accusations that the conservatives were too cozy with Germany’s auto sector, which employs over a million people and whose exports generate a large chunk of the country’s output. “I’m not the spokesman of the car industry,” Scheuer said, calling on the companies to rebuild lost trust. “I cannot pass a law that forces old diesel cars off the streets because they are on the road totally legally,” Scheuer added. Pollution from diesel cars has come under intense scrutiny after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 admitted to using illegal software to cheat emissions tests, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines. Carsten Schneider, a senior figure in the center-left SPD’s parliamentary group, said on Wednesday that carmakers could be fined up to 5,000 euros ($5,7600) per vehicle if they did not carry out remedial work on older diesel cars. He had said he had doubts whether Scheuer was treating the issue with the necessary urgency and said he should “not behave as though he was the country’s chief car salesman but rather like someone who represents the interests of those who have bought diesel cars.” The row comes after the coalition nearly fell apart twice in the past months due to disputes about immigration and the far right.

2018-10-11,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Datong, a major coal-producing city in northern China’s Shanxi province, will establish “no-coal zones” in urban districts as part of its efforts to curb pollution, the provincial government said on Thursday. The Shanxi government said the restrictions would cover 102 square kilometers (39 square miles) and would include bans on the storage, sale and direct combustion of all kinds of coal. Coal-fired power and central heating systems will still be permitted. It said 16,200 households in Datong would switch to cleaner gas heating this winter and that it had already demolished 3,812 coal-fired boilers.   Datong was one of China’s major coal producing regions for decades, but many of its collieries are now depleted. Overmining has contaminated the city’s soil and underground water tables, as well as causing devastating subsidence. That has left large parts of its old mining districts unfit for farming or construction. The city was also ranked as one of the country’s worst performers when it came to meeting water quality standards in the first-half of this year.  Shanxi, which produces nearly a billion tonnes of coal a year, has been forced to relocate more than 650,000 people from unsafe former mining districts at risk of collapse.  The province is one of China’s major pollution control zones over the 2018-2020 period and it is under pressure to keep coal consumption levels unchanged from 2015-2020.    Neighboring Hebei, which has been on the frontline of China’s war on pollution since 2014, established similar “no-coal zones” in several districts in the smog prone cities of Langfang and Baoding last year.      Hebei was ordered by the central government to cut coal consumption by 40 million tonnes over the 2013-2017 period as part of its commitments to boost air quality.  However, the province struggled to find the natural gas supplies required to replace coal heating systems for thousands of rural households last winter, forcing the government to slow the conversion process. According to a report submitted to parliament earlier this year, all households in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, as well as the neighboring provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, will have converted from coal to natural gas heating by 2020. The report said 4.7 million households throughout northern China had already made the switch over the 2012-2017 period.

2018-10-11,"OSLO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Flex LNG, controlled by Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, has raised $300 million in a private placement of shares to help pay for five new vessels costing $918 million, it said on Thursday. Fredriksen’s companies typically add high-yield bond issues and bank loans at a later time to pay the cost not covered by share sales. When the vessels are delivered from the yards of South Korea’s Daewoo (DSME) and Hyundai (HHI) in 2020 and 2021, Flex LNG will have a fleet of 13 ships, Flex said. Fredriksen himself bought shares for $100 million, cutting his overall stake in the firm to 44.6 percent following the placement from 49.9 percent.

2018-10-11,"PANAMA CITY, Fla., Oct 11 (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael, the third-most powerful ever to strike the U.S. mainland, battered the Florida’s Gulf coast with roof-shredding winds, raging surf and torrential rains before it was downgraded to a tropical storm as it headed through Georgia. Michael, whose rapid intensification as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico caught many by surprise, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Panama City in Florida’s Panhandle region, with top sustained winds reaching 155 miles per hour (249 kph). The fiercest storm to hit Florida in 80 years came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, the biggest storm on record to strike the Florida Panhandle. Its sustained winds were just 2 mph (3.2 kph) shy of an extremely rare Category 5. The storm’s intensity waned steadily as it pushed inland and curled northeasterly into Georgia. It was downgraded to a tropical storm, with top sustained winds diminishing to 60 miles per hour, early on Thursday. The governors of North and South Carolina urged residents to brace for more heavy rain and storm-force winds as Michael plows northward up the Atlantic seaboard. The Carolinas are still reeling from severe flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence less than a month ago. The National Hurricane Center said Michael would pass through the Carolinas on Thursday, dumping as much as 8 inches of rain in some areas. Up to a foot (30 cm) of rain was forecast in Florida. Gadsden County sheriff’s spokeswoman Anglie Hightower said a “male subject” was killed by a tree toppling onto his house in Greensboro, Florida, near the state capital, Tallahassee, in the first report of a fatality from the hurricane. Severe flooding, heavily damaged buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines appeared widespread in coastal areas near the storm’s landfall. Television news footage during the day showed many homes submerged in floodwaters up to their roofs in Mexico Beach, where the fate of about 280 residents who authorities said defied evacuation orders was unknown. Numerous buildings in Panama City were demolished, partially collapsed or without roofs amid deserted streets littered with debris, twisted, fallen tree trunks and dangling wires. Authorities said the full extent of devastation would not be known until after daybreak on Thursday. In the meantime, curfews were imposed across much of the region. Bill Manning, a 63-year-old grocery clerk, fled his camper van in Panama City for safer quarters in a hotel only to see the electricity there go out. “My God, it’s scary. I didn’t expect all this,” he said. Without power, the city was plunged into darkness at nightfall and its flooded streets were mostly silent and devoid of people or traffic. By Wednesday night, more than 403,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, utility companies said. Twenty miles south of Mexico Beach, floodwaters were more than 7-1/2 feet (2.3 meters) deep near Apalachicola, a town of about 2,300 residents, hurricane center chief Ken Graham said. Wind damage was also evident. “There are so many downed power lines and trees that it’s almost impossible to get through the city,” Apalachicola Mayor Van Johnson said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday an estimated 500,000 Florida residents had been ordered or urged to seek higher ground before the storm in 20 counties spanning a 200-mile (320-km) stretch of shoreline. But Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross said on Wednesday as many as 320,000 people on Florida’s Gulf Coast had disregarded evacuation notices. An estimated 6,000 evacuees took cover in emergency shelters, most of them in Florida, and that number was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by week’s end, Kieserman said. Bo Patterson, the mayor of Port St. Joe, just south of Mexico Beach, rode out the storm in his house seven blocks from the beach, describing the scene outside as “very, very scary.” He was one of about 2,500 of the town’s 3,500 residents who ended up staying put, many of them caught off guard by the storm’s rapid escalation as it approached. “This happened so quickly,” he said. FEMA head Brock Long acknowledged that early evacuation efforts in the area were slow in comparison to how quickly the hurricane intensified. Michael grew from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane over the course of about 40 hours. “Satellite images of Michael’s evolution on Tuesday night were, in a word, jaw-dropping,” wrote Bob Henson, a meteorologist with weather site Weather Underground. With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, the measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael ranked as the third-strongest storm on record to make landfall in the continental United States. Only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys were more intense. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm recovery, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel, Governor Rick Scott said. The Pentagon said it had pre-positioned more than 2,200 active-duty military personnel, along with helicopters, high-water vehicles and swift-water boats for deployment as needed. Even before landfall, the hurricane disrupted energy operations in the Gulf, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly a third as offshore platforms were evacuated ahead of the storm’s arrival.

2018-10-11,"* Nikkei sheds 4.2 pct, Asia ex-Japan at lowest since March 2017 * IMF’s Lagarde says market valuations extremely high * High bond yields, Sino-US trade tensions weigh * Trump calls Fed “crazy” for raising interest rates * Yen and euro in demand as safe harbours, dollar mixed By Wayne Cole and Andrew Galbraith SYDNEY/SHANGHAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Share markets in Asia plunged to a 19-month low on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst losses in eight months led to broader risk aversion, a rise in market volatility gauges and concerns over overvalued stock markets in an environment of rapidly rising dollar yields. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 3.8 percent around 0500 GMT, and earlier touched its lowest level since March 2017. Markets in Europe are seen as unlikely to stem the bleeding, with financial spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE to open 1.4 percent lower at 7,047, Frankfurt’s DAX to open down 1.8 percent at 11,501 and Paris’ CAC to open down 2.1 percent at 5,096. The sell-off, which came as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said stock market valuations have been “extremely high”, erased hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth around the region. “Equity markets are locked in a sharp sell-off, with concern around how far yields will rise, warnings from the IMF about financial stability risks and continued trade tension all driving uncertainty,” summed up analysts at ANZ. Japan’s Nikkei ended down 3.9 percent its steepest daily drop since March, while the broader TOPIX lost around $207 billion in market value, falling 3.5 percent. Shanghai shares dropped 4.9 percent, on track for their worst day since February 2016, to their lowest level since late 2014, while China blue chips slid 4.4 percent. Shares in Taiwan were among the region’s worst-hit, with the broader index losing 6.3 percent. Seoul’s Kospi index was down 3.8 percent. “We can’t see where the bottom point will be,” said Chien Bor-yi, an analyst at Taipei-based Cathay Futures Consultant. “Further short-term equity pain may well be unavoidable in South Korea as foreigners are selling, but bond market is holding up,” said Peter Park, head of securities management at South Korea’s IBK Insurance. Sinking global shares have raised the stakes for U.S. inflation figures due later on Thursday as a high outcome would only stoke speculation of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. “We’re all just watching the Fed. We’re all watching the U.S. economy, we’re worrying about an inflation spike or a wages spike that will come through,” said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research at ING in Singapore. But he said that he expected the data to show inflation peaking rather than moving sharply higher, which “could restore a little bit of calm.” On Wall Street, the S&P500’s sharpest one-day fall since February wiped out around $850 billion of wealth as technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday with a loss of 3.29 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 4.08 percent, while the Dow shed 2.2 percent. The blood letting was bad enough to attract the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. “I think the Fed has gone crazy.” It was hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers that triggered the sudden sell off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits. “The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook,” said Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.” The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets, putting particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States. On Thursday, the president of the World Bank said he is very concerned about trade tensions and warned of a “clear” global economic slowdown if tariff threats escalate. China has suspended approvals for an overseas investment product in Shanghai and has asked license holders such as JPMorgan Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments to be “low profile” in marketing it, as concerns rise in Beijing over possible outflow pressures. China’s central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the psychological 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9377 at 0602 GMT. The onshore yuan was trading at 6.9305 per dollar at 0606 GMT, 65 pips weaker than the onshore close of 6.9240 Wednesday. China’s move has forced other emerging market currencies to weaken to stay competitive, and drawn the ire of the United States which sees it as an unfair devaluation. “The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,” said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s global head of G10 FX strategy. “Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.” There was also a danger for the U.S. if Beijing had to intervene heavily to support the yuan as it could lead to China selling U.S. Treasuries, he added. The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favoured currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses. The euro was at $1.1550, up from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen, a telling retreat from last week’s 114.54 peak. That left the dollar at 95.263 against a basket of currencies. In commodity markets, gold struggled to get any safety bid and edged down to $1,192.77. Oil prices skidded in line with U.S. equity markets, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which closed some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output. Brent crude fell 1.6 percent to $81.75 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 1.5 percent to $72.07. Additional reporting by Jeanny Kao in TAIPEI and Cynthia Kim

2018-10-11,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in 80 years and the third-most powerful ever to strike the U.S. mainland, battered the state’s Gulf coast with roof-shredding winds, raging surf and torrential rains before turning its diminishing fury on Georgia.

2018-10-11,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Tomato paste is not the most obvious economic indicator, but in Iran, where it is a staple that some people have started panic-buying, it says a lot about the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions. While Iran makes its own paste from an abundant crop of locally grown tomatoes, sanctions reimposed by U.S. President Donald Trump since August have played havoc with supply. A 70 percent slide in the rial this year has prompted a scramble for foreign currency that has made exports much more valuable in local terms than selling produce at home. Some shops are limiting purchases of tomato paste, which is used in many Persian dishes, and some lines have sold out as people buy up existing stock. The government has responded by banning tomato exports, one of a raft of interventions to try to limit economic instability that has fueled public protests and criticism of the government this year. But the tomato policy is not working. An industry representative said tomatoes were being smuggled abroad. “We have heard that trucks full of tomatoes are still leaving the country, especially to Iraq,” Mohammad Mir-Razavi, head of the Syndicate of Canning Industry, said by telephone. “They put boxes of greenhouse tomatoes on top and hide normal tomatoes at the bottom,” he said, referring to an exemption for hot-house grown tomatoes that left a loophole. It is one of many ways in which the sanctions are hurting ordinary Iranians while benefiting those with access to hard currency. Washington reintroduced steps against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after the U.S. withdrawal from a deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Trump said the deal was not strict enough. With U.S. curbs on Iran’s oil exports set to come into force next month, some Iranians fear their country is entering an economic slump that may prove worse than the period from 2012 to 2015, when it last faced major sanctions. “There is an emerging consensus that the economy will go through a period of austerity similar to that recorded during the Iran-Iraq war,” said Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at London’s Betamatrix consultancy. Jumps in prices are occurring in a range of goods — particularly imports such as mobile telephones and other consumer electronics, but also some staples. A bottle of milk, 15,000 rials last year, now sells for 36,000. An 800-gramme (28-ounce) can of tomato paste was selling in Tehran stores for around 60,000 rials in March; it is now 180,000 rials, or $1.24 at the unofficial rate, prompting a scramble by households to stock up. The price of tomatoes has increased more than five-fold compared to last year. Signs on the shelves of some stores limit each customer to two cans. Iranian online shopping site Digikala lists the top nine tomato paste items as out of stock, and the rest as “coming soon”. In supermarkets in Najaf in neighboring Iraq, meanwhile, supplies of Iranian tomato paste are plentiful. Adding to the pressure is a fourfold rise in the price of cans, Mir-Razavi said. Traders importing material to make cans sought to buy dollars at a little-used official rate of 42,000 rials; authorities asked them to use a more expensive rate. The issue has delayed shipments of material to factories. The government is mounting a campaign against price-gouging, periodically ordering shopkeepers to sell at lower prices. But some shopkeepers respond by not selling at all, believing prices will eventually rise again as the sanctions bite. U.S. dollar versus Iranian rial in unofficial market - tmsnrt.rs/2OCUtkd Iran, a big oil producer with a diverse economy, has shown its farming, manufacturing and distribution sectors can ride out long periods of war and sanctions. The Tehran Stock Exchange index has soared 83 percent this year as shares of exporting companies have rocketed. Urban real estate prices have also risen as Iranians plow their savings into property rather than keeping them in depreciating rials. The rial’s plunge, which in the unofficial market has taken it to around 145,000 against the dollar from 42,890 at the end of 2017, according to currency tracking website bonbast.com, may even have strengthened the financial system in one way. Banks and pension funds have been struggling with massive debts. Emadi said the rial’s slide, to as low as 190,000 in late September, had given the government huge windfall profits on its dollar holdings; authorities appear to have injected some of those profits into insolvent banks to shore them up, he said. But while official data for the last few months has not yet been released, Emadi said he believed the economy was already in a recession that could deepen in coming months. The International Monetary Fund predicted this week that the economy would shrink 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, before recovering slowly.  That would make the slump less deep than the recession of 2012, when the economy shrank over 7 percent, and not nearly as damaging as the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988, when it shrank by about a quarter. The IMF also forecast the average inflation rate would jump to a peak above 34 percent next year, briefly returning to its level in 2013. How much the current recession resembles past periods of economic pain for Iran will depend on the extent to which Washington can use the sanctions to push other countries into cutting oil and non-oil trade with the Islamic Republic. U.S. officials have said the sanctions will be tougher than the steps in 2012-2015. They aim to reduce Iranian oil exports more sharply, and to disrupt exports to Iran from trading hubs such as Dubai more aggressively. “I think the return of the sanctions has had a devastating effect on their economy and I think it’s going to get worse,” Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton told Reuters in late August. But Emadi said that if European nations succeeded in  creating a special payments system permitting trade with Iran to continue, and if Tehran cracked down on endemic corruption, the economy might start recovering gradually a year from now. In the meantime, many Iranians may continue to struggle with surging prices and an unstable currency. Peyman Mohammadian, 28, an unemployed university graduate in the western city of Andimeshk, said he had tried to protect 5 billion rials in savings by converting them into dollars last month at a rate of 183,000.  Since then, the rial has partially rebounded as authorities have sold dollars to support it and threatened currency speculators with arrest. Mohammadian said this left him in a quandary. “On one hand, I want the dollar to rise so I don’t lose my money. But on the other hand, I want it to drop below 100,000 — otherwise inflation will be so high that I won’t be able to get married for 10 years.” Editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-economy-life/tomato-squeeze-us-sanctions-begin-to-distort-irans-economy-idUKL8N1WK12Q,11 Oct 2018,"Tomato paste is not the

2018-10-11,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Indonesia wants to export more coal in order to earn U.S. dollars to shore up its faltering currency, but the problem is buyers don’t seem to be hearing the message. Indonesia’s coal exports dropped to 24.8 million tonnes in September, down 12.4 percent from August’s 28.3 million tonnes and 10 percent from 27.6 million tonnes in the same month last year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. If the drop isn’t worrying enough, it comes even as the price of lower-grade Indonesian coal is at its widest discount to higher-quality Australian thermal coal. Indonesia is planning to increase its 2018 output of coal to around 507 million tonnes, up from a previous target of 485 million tonnes. The aim is to convert the additional U.S. dollars from sales of the polluting fuel into rupiah, which has dropped about 12 percent so far this year against the U.S. currency. In theory, importers should be keen to ramp up purchases of Indonesian coal, as the massive discount to Australian cargoes more than compensates for the lower energy value. The price of thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, was $112.25 a tonne in the week ended Oct. 5. Low-rank Indonesian coal, with an energy content of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg), was at $38.88 a tonne at the end of the same week, according to Argus. This represents a discount of $73.37 a tonne - the widest on record, exceeding the $61.07 recorded in November 2016, according to the Argus data. Even Indonesian coal with a similar energy content to Newcastle is trading at a fairly wide discount, with the Indonesian government’s reference price, known as the HBA, set at $100.89 a tonne for October. (Graphic: reut.rs/2PtQYK6) The HBA is a composite price made up equally of the Platts Kalimantan 5,900 kcal/kg assessments, the Argus-Indonesia Coal Index for 6,500 kcal/kg, Newcastle Export Index of 6,322 kcal/kg and the globalCOAL Newcastle grade of 6,000 kcal/kg. In effect, the HBA index sets the price for much of Indonesia’s thermal coal exports, and its discount to Newcastle should provide support for exports from the Southeast Asian nation. Indonesia, the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal used in power stations, has two major customers, China and India, the planet’s two largest coal importers. Chinese buyers mainly use Indonesian coal as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, trading off a loss in energy value for lower sulphur and ash. Indonesia’s exports to China are up strongly in the first nine months of the year, reaching 89.7 million tonnes, 18.8 percent above the level for the same period last year, according to the ship-tracking data. However, much of this strength was in the first quarter of 2018, and September marked a third month of declining imports from Indonesia. China imported 7.5 million tonnes from Indonesia in September, down sharply from August’s 9.7 million tonnes, making it the weakest month so far this year. The news on India’s imports isn’t quite as bad for Indonesian exporters, with September’s 7.1 million tonnes down slightly from August’s 7.4 million tonnes. However, for the first nine months of the year, India’s imports from Indonesia have been relatively flat, dropping fractionally to 57.8 million tonnes from 58.2 million in the same period in 2017. What may be worrying for Indonesian coal exporters is that their rivals seem to be gaining on them in India, while they stand still. India bought 12.5 million tonnes of coal from the United States in the January-September period, up 49 percent on the 8.4 million tonnes imported in the same period last year. From South Africa, India imported 25.9 million tonnes in the first nine months of 2018, up 16 percent from 22.4 million tonnes in the same period a year ago. Although the overwhelming majority of Australia’s coal exports to India are coking coal used in steel-making, it’s worth noting that these are also up in the first nine months of 2018, climbing to 34.7 million tonnes compared to 30.4 million tonnes in the same period last year. What the numbers are showing is that Indonesia is likely to struggle to ramp up exports of its mainly low-rank thermal coal, as there doesn’t seem to be appetite among buyers, even though the discount to higher-grade fuel is as wide as it has ever been.

The global plunge erased hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. The head of the International Monetary Fund said stock market valuations have been “extremely high”. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan plummeted 3.9 percent to its lowest since March 2017. Japan’s Nikkei fell 4.4 percent, the steepest daily drop since March, while the broader TOPIX lost around $230 billion in market value. Shanghai shares dropped 4.3 percent, on track for their worst day since February 2016, to their lowest level since late 2014, while China blue chips slid 4 percent. Shares in Taiwan were among the region’s worst-hit, with the broader index losing 6.2 percent. “We can’t see where the bottom point will be,” said Chien Bor-yi, an analyst at Taipei-based Cathay Futures Consultant. On Wall Street, the S&P500’s sharpest one-day fall since February wiped out around $850 billion of wealth as technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand. The S&P 500 ended Wednesday with a loss of 3.29 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 4.08 percent, while the Dow shed 2.2 percent. The blood letting was bad enough to attract the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. “I think the Fed has gone crazy.” It was hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers that triggered the sudden sell off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits. The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets, putting particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States. On Thursday, the president of the World Bank said he is very concerned about trade tensions and warned of a “clear” global economic slowdown if tariff threats escalate. China has suspended approvals for an overseas investment product in Shanghai and has asked license holders such as JPMorgan Asset Management and Aberdeen Standard Investments to be “low profile” in marketing it, as concerns rise in Beijing over possible outflow pressures. China’s central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the psychological 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9388 at 0342 GMT. The onshore yuan was trading at 6.9309 per dollar at 0350 GMT, 69 pips weaker than the onshore close of 6.9240 Wednesday. China’s move has forced other emerging market currencies to weaken to stay competitive, and drawn the ire of the United States which sees it as an unfair devaluation. “The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,” said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s global head of G10 FX strategy. “Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital, and a loss of control.” There was also a danger for the U.S. if Beijing had to intervene heavily to support the yuan. “China buying yuan and selling dollars would likely entail some selling of U.S. Treasuries at a point where the market is showing some vulnerability, and could be very vulnerable to signs of China liquidation,” added Ruskin. The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favoured currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses. The euro pushed up to $1.1565 and away from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen , down 0.1 percent and a telling retreat from last week’s 114.54 peak. That left the dollar at 95.207 against a basket of currencies. In commodity markets, gold struggled to get any safety bid and edged down to $1,193.40. Oil prices skidded in line with U.S. equity markets, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which closed some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output. Brent crude fell 1.9 percent to $81.51 a barrel, while  U.S. crude dropped 1.7 percent to $71.93. On Thursday, the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, warned that the global economy is “probably not strong enough” and that with global public debt an all-time high, emerging markets were at risk of capital outflows.

2018-10-11,"TOKYO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil dropped on Thursday to extend big losses from the previous session as global stock markets suffered a rout, with crude prices also taking a hit from a weekly industry report showing U.S. crude inventories had risen more than expected. Supply worries also eased as Hurricane Michael likely spared oil assets from significant damage as it smashed into Florida, even as it caused injuries and widespread destruction. Brent crude futures were down 66 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $82.43 a barrel by 0024 GMT. The global oil benchmark closed 2.2 percent lower on Wednesday after falling to a nearly two-week low. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 57 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $72.60 after dropping 2.4 percent in the previous session. Stocks on major world markets slid to a three-month low on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P500 stock index falling more than 3 percent, its biggest one-day fall since February. Technology shares tumbled on fears of slowing demand and concerns about U.S.-China tensions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 3 percent in early trading on Thursday. “Ugly, very very ugly,” Greg McKenna an independent market strategist based near Sydney said in a morning note, referring to declines in global markets. U.S. crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week, while gasoline inventories increased and distillate stocks drew, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday. Crude inventories climbed by 9.7 million barrels in the week to Oct. 5 to 410.7 million, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.6 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 2.2 million barrels, API said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due to release official government inventory data Thursday at 11 a.m. EDT. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, producers have cut daily oil production by roughly 42 percent due to the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. The cuts represent 718,877 barrels per day of oil production. While production has been cut because of the hurricane, “down time is expected to be brief and Gulf of Mexico output now accounts for a comparatively small portion of total U.S. production,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. U.S. oil output is expected to rise 1.39 million bpd to a record 10.74 million bpd, the EIA said in its monthly forecast on Wednesday. Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick

2018-10-11,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Corporations around the world should work together to reduce carbon emissions and stem climate change rather than wait for government mandates, the chief executive of U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday. Pressure is rising on companies, especially in the energy sector, to slash their greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent climate change. Oxy, which has for years been a vocal supporter of efforts to reduce carbon emissions, is the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oilfield.  “We as corporations, we have to do our part. There are enough companies committed to making it happen,” Vicki Hollub said in an interview on the sidelines of the Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co Energy Disruption Conference in Houston. “It needs to be a worldwide approach.” Oxy rival Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday it would donate $1 million to a political action committee’s lobbying campaign to promote a U.S. tax on carbon emissions. The donation is designed to help sway public opinion around climate change legislation. A carbon tax would shift the financial burden of climate change mitigation efforts from corporations to consumers. “I think it goes beyond making a donation to some organization,” said Hollub. “It really needs to have the collaboration of all the parties.” Houston-based Oxy believes it is too soon to support a carbon tax and that corporations should work with regulators and environmentalists to study the best approach, Hollub said. “We’re not really prepared right to say it needs to be a tax,” said Hollub, who became CEO in 2016. Oxy’s production prowess in the Permian stems from its use of a technique that harnesses carbon dioxide produced from power plants, forcing it back into aging oilfields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. It is a process that Oxy has historically used in conventional oilfields, but is studying how to use in shale wells, Hollub said. Still, oil producers remain controversial in the fight against rising temperatures. A report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released on Monday said renewable energy would need to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050 to help stem climate change, compared with about 25 percent now. The Paris Climate Accord’s goal of capping global temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is “important to us,” Hollub said.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris agreement was “the right thing for the country,” Hollub said, adding that Oxy and other corporations should still focus on cutting emissions. “And we’re committed to doing our part,” she said. “We shouldn’t have to be told to do it.” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Diane Craft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/occidental-ceo-climatechange/update-1-u-s-oil-ceo-says-corporations-should-work-to-stem-climate-change-idUKL2N1WQ2B0,11 Oct 2018,"Corporations around the world

2018-10-11,"KOCHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Joby Pathrose, a farmer living a kilometre away from the usually languid Periyar river in southern India, was woken in the night by the sound of rushing waters. Hours later his plantations and everything he owned were completely submerged. “There was absolutely no warning from the government side,” said Pathrose, describing the devastating flooding that hit his village of Okkal, in Kerala state, on Aug. 15. Pathrose says local authorities had advised his fields were safe, despite the incessant rains that battered Kerala at the peak of the monsoon. More than 5 million people in Kerala were affected and over 200 were killed amid torrential rain and floods in August. The flooding, dubbed the worst to hit the southern state in nearly a century, caused billions of dollars of damage to fields, homes and other infrastructure. As the rain intensified in mid-August state authorities were forced to release water from 35 dams to manage rising waters in reservoirs, many of which are used to generate hydroelectricity. Pathrose and others living near the Periyar say the sudden opening of dam gates without proper warnings to those living downstream was a big factor in the devastation. More than half a dozen experts who Reuters consulted were divided on the extent to which dam water spills contributed to the flooding, but almost all, including India’s Central Water Commission (CWC), said reservoirs levels were too high ahead of the disaster. “Because of this carelessness the disaster proportions were multiplied,” said Himanshu Thakkar, co-ordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), a non-governmental body that advocates for better water management practices. The release of dam water, sharply criticised by some water management experts, has put a focus on reservoir operations and the need for better flood mapping and warning systems in India.  State government officials say the severity of the flooding was due to a once-in-a-century storm that could not reasonably have been prepared for, and that the spilling of dam water had little impact.  Reuters has learned the two largest reservoirs in Kerala - Idukki and Idamalayar - have been operating for years without any emergency action plans - a basic requirement for major dams worldwide. The reservoirs also lack “rule curves”, another key safety protocol that dictates the level of water that can safely be maintained behind a dam at any point given seasonal factors. These protocols, while recommended by the CWC, are not yet mandated by law. CWC says it is merely an advisory body and it hopes a new dam safety bill, under federal consideration, will make dam operators more accountable.  Reuters has also analysed historical data that shows both reservoirs were at more than 90 percent of their full capacity on Aug. 2, or more than double their 10-year historical averages for that time of the year. Dam management experts who spoke to Reuters said such levels were dangerously high for the middle of India’s monsoon season. “One of the key advantages of a dam is it can help moderate floods,” said SANDRP’s Thakkar, an engineering graduate from the elite Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mumbai. “That didn’t happen as Kerala’s dams were already full by end-July. Dams aren’t supposed to be full before the end of the monsoons.” India’s monsoon season runs from June through September, and southern states such as Kerala also typically receive heavy rain in the months of October and November as monsoon winds reverse. The data also shows that if the water levels in Idukki and Idamalayar had been slowly lowered to closer to their historical averages in the two weeks before the worst flooding began they would have been able to absorb all the rain that fell during the mid-August storm. “The release could have started earlier so that by Aug. 9 there would have been left-over capacities in the reservoirs to store the water,” said Biswajit Mukhopadhyay, director of water resources at U.S-based engineering firm IEA, who analysed some of the publicly available data at the request of Reuters.  N.S. Pillai, chairman of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB), a state-run body that manages most of Kerala’s big dams, said that was a “highly hypothetical and imaginary conclusion”. Heavy rain had not been forecast and blaming the dams for the flooding was “not justifiable”, he said. Still, dozens of flood victims interviewed by Reuters, who live in villages dotting the banks of Kerala’s biggest river, the ‎244 km (152 mile) Periyar, say they faced no floods despite torrential rain in late July and early August. All of them said waters only rose overnight on Aug. 15. That was when more intense rainfall forced KSEB to rapidly ramp-up releases of water from Idukki and Idamalayar reservoirs, which feed into the Periyar.  Water management experts note state authorities and the KSEB issued an alert on Idukki’s high water levels on July 31, when the reservoir was 92 percent full, but only began a slow release of water on Aug. 9, when levels were at 98 percent. Data shows Idamalayar spills began only when it exceeded its full capacity on Aug. 9. James Wilson, who works for the Kerala government as special officer on a inter-state water advisory committee, said blaming KSEB was unfair, as Kerala’s dams only have the capacity to store less than a tenth of the state’s annual rainfall, and even less in years of extreme rainfall. “However you prepare you have a problem with these type of events,” said Wilson, adding Kerala’s steep hills and relatively short river lengths give officials little time to react to freak rainfall.  CWC also said the rain in Kerala would have led to flooding regardless of whether water had been spilled from the dams.  “The release from reservoirs had only a minor role in flood augmentation,” said CWC in a report seen by Reuters. The report noted however, that most of the dams were already “at or very close to” full reservoir levels just before the most intense rain, and it called for a review of water storage norms at all major reservoirs in Kerala. It also shows nearly half the outflows into the Periyar between the peak flood days of Aug. 15 to Aug. 17 were from within the catchment areas of big dams. While opposition parties in Kerala have demanded a judicial probe into the release of dam water, state officials have blamed the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for poor forecasts and the release of water into Idukki reservoir from Mullaperiyar - a dam managed by next-door Tamil Nadu state - for exacerbating the flooding. In court filings, Tamil Nadu said the water released from the Mullaperiyar dam only constituted a small part of the spill from the much bigger Idukki reservoir. The IMD has also responded, saying it “issued all necessary severe weather warnings”. KSEB’s Pillai said forecasts failed to predict the intensity of the rain. “If reliable forecasting is done in respect of very heavy and extremely heavy rainfall, we can manage dam operations very efficiently,” said Pillai, warning that more conservative water storage would lower KSEB’s power generation ability. “If somebody strongly believes these dams should be used for flood control, I can only differ with them,” he said. Nayan Sharma, an expert on river engineering and a former professor at IIT Roorkee, says hydroelectric dams incentivize operators to stockpile water as turbines are most efficient at full reservoir levels. In January, CWC published guidelines for preparing operating manuals for dams. It even cited examples of plans to be followed to prevent the need for “heavy peak flood releases in panic”. This came after a 2017 report from India’s Comptroller and Auditor General, the government spending watchdog, criticised the lack of dam operating manuals and emergency action plans (EAPs) for reservoirs in many states. Kerala’s revenue secretary and head of disaster management, P.H. Kurien, told Reuters he has twice written to KSEB requesting EAPs and has yet to receive them. KSEB’s Pillai said EAPs and dam operation manuals were still being prepared. CWC said it was working with Kerala’s government to speed this up. The Kerala Chief Minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Authorities in towns visited by Reuters, meanwhile, say that evacuation warnings were given. “We made repeated microphone announcements about the opening of dam gates and asked people to move to safe places,” said N.R. Jayaraj, deputy superintendent of police in Aluva, a town on the Periyar’s banks that was badly hit by the floods. Many people interviewed by Reuters who live close to the Periyar said they got no warnings at all, while those that did said the information provided was inadequate.   “We were told the dam gates would be opened and we’d have to be alert, but no one was warned to expect this much water,” said K.C.

2018-10-11,"(Repeats earlier story with no change to text) * European biofuel producers clamouring for used cooking oil * Comes as EU pushes to phase out fresh vegetable oils in fuel * Has unleashed wave of demand for waste oils from Asia * Industry expected to grow rapidly in next few years By Emily Chow KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Once surreptitiously dumped down drains in the dead of night, Asia’s used cooking oil is fast becoming one of the most sought-after commodities in Europe - as a feedstock for biodiesel. Aggressive green energy targets in the European Union that were bolstered further this year are pushing fuel makers to churn out biodiesel containing recycled cooking oils and fats, phasing out the use of fresh vegetable oils in the process by 2030. That has unleashed a wave of demand for used oil from places such as China and Southeast Asia, where cooking oils are widely used to prepare everything from stir-fries to piping hot samosas. Amizuri Abdullah, who picks up used oil from restaurants, fast food outlets and food factories for Malaysian waste oil collection firm FatHopes Energy, said his job had been getting markedly busier. “When I first joined the company a year ago, there were about 15 or 16 stops to make in a day. Now there can be as many as 25, and more people are asking about it,” said Amizuri, who wears bright blue protective gloves to pump used oil into a tank on the back of his truck on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. The oil is unloaded at a collection centre where it is filtered to remove food scraps like chicken bones and skin, before being processed to reduce contamination. It is then transferred into tankers for export to Europe. FatHopes Chief Executive Vinesh Sinha said the company’s exports of waste-based feedstock to European oil majors had grown 40 percent in the last three years, forecasting a threefold increase in Europe’s demand for such feedstock by 2030. Used cooking oil makes up a good chunk of what the company collects from thousands of sites across Southeast Asia, but it also buys coffee grinds, animal fats and palm oil mill waste. “My clients are struggling to find feedstock in anticipation of the EU policy,” he said. Asia’s used cooking oil industry was estimated to be worth around $500 million a couple of years ago, but analysts said more recent estimates were not available due to the rapid growth in the number of new collectors and traders. Justin Yuan, chief executive of the used cooking oil division at Chinese consulting company STIN Group, said shipments from China would likely hit 300,000 tonnes this year, up from 200,000 tonnes in 2017. He said most cargoes go to Europe and that volumes were set to keep surging in coming years. “More overseas biodiesel plants will source used cooking oil in China. With soaring demand from home and abroad, it will put great pressure on used cooking oil supplies,” Yuan said. “The competition will be fiercer.” Indeed, waste oil demand is already outstripping supply around Asia, with traders estimating that the premium it fetches over crude palm oil prices has doubled from around two years ago to stand at about 10-15 percent. Used cooking oil is traded at prices pegged to crude palm oil, typically trading at a premium due to its greener credentials. Traders said it currently cost around $600-700 a tonne on average. That appetite is also good news for the thousands of restaurants and other businesses where the used oil is collected, which typically earn around 40 U.S. cents per kilo of the commodity. Analysts said that in the past many restaurants and food manufacturers poured old oil down the drain when the time came to replace it, often breaking rules designed to protect sewage systems that are very difficult to enforce. FAT-FINDING MISSION Today, collectors are competing to lock up supplies from around the region to feed expanding biofuel operations in Europe. In June, the European Union agreed to phase out crude vegetable oils usage in transport fuel from 2030 as part of a broader plan to increase the share of renewables in the bloc’s energy production. “The industry here (in Asia) is about whether you have the capacity to get more oil. Competition is very fierce now, so the margins we have are little,” said Rick Ng, business advisor for Singaporean waste oil collector Go Green Recycle Oil. In May, French oil major Total said waste material would account for 30-40 percent of feedstock supplies at its new 650,000 tonnes capacity biofuel refinery in southern France. Britain-based biofuel supplier Greenergy in July acquired an idle vegetable oil processing plant in Amsterdam to turn waste oil into biodiesel. Greenergy, Europe’s largest producer of biofuels made from waste, in September also acquired Singapore-based used cooking oil exporter Rexon Energy to help secure raw material supplies. Meanwhile, Finnish biofuel producer Neste told Reuters by email that it was planning to double its waste-based refining capacity in Singapore to 2 million tonnes. All that means that Amizuri back at FatHopes Energy in Kuala Lumpur could be set to get busier. “I think there is going to be more used cooking oil collected as awareness that it can be recycled rises. I think this industry is going to grow,” he said. “Instead of throwing it out, collect and sell it. There is value there.” Reporting by Emily Chow in KUALA LUMPUR; Additional reporting
