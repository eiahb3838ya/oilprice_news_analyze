2018-07-24,"By Carolina Mandl and Alexandra Alper RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA has chosen to enter exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oilfields to a group backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, two people familiar with the matter said. Brazilian energy firm Ouro Preto Óleo e Gás, backed by EIG, made the top bid for the so-called Pampo and Enchova clusters, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, beating out Trident Energy, a Warburg Pincus-backed firm, the sources said. The deal could mark EIG’s debut in the oil production business in Latin America’s top producer. It also makes strategic sense for the private equity firm, which earlier this year bought out Brazilian logistics company Prumo Logistica, operator of the nearby port of Acu. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will provide debt financing for the bid, whose structure and value were not immediately clear. But sources familiar with the tender, first reported by Reuters in June, said it could fetch around $1 billion.  Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  World class geology and dwindling reserves mean the world’s top oil majors have invested billions of dollars to take stakes in Brazil’s prolific deep water oilfields in recent months. But smaller oil companies are often better than large ones at cutting costs and some have honed expertise in squeezing more oil out of mature fields. EIG will follow in the footsteps of First Reserve Corporation and Riverstone Holdings, private equity firms invested in Brazil’s Barra Energia. Ouro Preto, created in 2010, is led by former OGX president Rodolfo Landim and has stakes in several basins throughout Brazil, but none in Campos.  A sale of the mature field clusters would also make financial sense for Petrobras, the world’s most indebted oil company, as it seeks to offload $21 billion in assets from 2017 to 2018.

2018-07-24,"(Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) (CNI.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings as the railroad moved higher volumes of commodities including grains and fertilizers at better pricing. Canada’s largest railroad expects to move higher volumes in the second half of 2018, as it expects strong demand through 2019, and will improve capacity by bringing new workers and locomotives into service.  The capacity gives Montreal-based CN more leeway to take on crude-by-rail contracts, provided it does not disrupt service of commodities like grain, said Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest, who now heads the company on a permanent basis. “In the second half, we will have more capacity, therefore we will also be able to execute a bigger book of business of crude,” Ruest told analysts. CN Rail and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) are investing in rail infrastructure to ease capacity constraints following a surge in demand from producers of grains and other commodities. Oil producers are eying railroads as production has exceeded pipeline capacity. CN said it now expected adjusted earnings of C$5.30 to C$5.45 per share, compared with C$5.10 to C$5.25 per share estimated previously. CN also added another C$100 million ($76.02 million) to its capital budget, taking its total spending to C$3.5 billion for 2018, as it looks to invest in new rail cars. CN expects capital expenditures to remain similar in 2019 compared with this year. The introduction of tariffs on items like lumber and aluminum have not impacted CN’s business, Ruest said. “So far the impact has not been material in two of the three commodities where there is a duty,” he said. “The volume is actually increasing on the cross-border activities.”    Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 5.8 percent, while rail freight revenue per carload increased 3.9 percent, the company said in a statement. CN Rail said operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, increased to 58.2 percent from 57.5 percent a year earlier. Net income rose to C$1.31 billion ($995.82 million), or C$1.77 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from C$1.03 billion, or C$1.36 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned C$1.51 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of C$1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-07-24,"(Adds Canadian National Railway CEO comment in paragraph 11) By Laharee Chatterjee and Nivedita Bhattacharjee July 24 (Reuters) - Canadian oil sands company Cenovus Energy investors will scrutinize quarterly earnings this week for details on Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix’s debt-cutting efforts and crude-for-rail contract negotiations to help resolve pipeline jams. After last year’s unpopular acquisition of ConocoPhillips’ assets, Pourbaix, who inherited a company last October with C$9.51 billion in long-term debt, is giving himself until 2019 to turn Cenovus around and bring that figure down. He also took charge of a company with low staff morale and rising investor angst. He told Reuters in May his target is to reduce Cenovus’ balance sheet to two times EBITDA. Cenovus’ leverage was 2.8 times as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its latest filing. “Once the deleveraging is complete, we will consider balancing returning cash to shareholders with investing in growth projects,” he said. Douglas Kee, chief investment officer at Leon Frazer & Associates, said Cenovus is not expected to increase dividends until later in 2019. He sees a rise of 10 to 15 percent at best. In the first quarter, Cenovus declared a dividend of 5 cents per share representing an annualized yield of about 2 percent. Investors wiped out about a fifth of the Calgary-based company’s market value when it bought ConocoPhillips’ oil sands assets for C$17 billion last year. Shares are now up about 51.4 percent after plunging to a record low in February. Analysts on average expect Cenovus to report a second-quarter profit of 3 Canadian cents on revenue of C$5.28 billion on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It reported  revenue of C$4.04 billion and earnings of C$2.37 cents per share in the year-ago period. But its turnaround plans have been complicated by pipeline bottlenecks that are choking oil flow from Canada. A supply crunch of heavy oil from Venezuela has increased demand for Canadian oil sands, but Pourbaix told Reuters that opportunity has been challenged by the pipeline crunch. Transport bottlenecks, the result of pipelines running at full capacity, have deepened the discount for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude and Cenovus’ differentials per barrel jumped 67 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. Pourbaix, who has been negotiating with rail companies about increasing locomotive hauling capacity for oil, said for rail to be competitive costs have to be closer to $10 or $12 a barrel than around $20 currently to get to the U.S. Gulf Coast. He said in May that he expects significant volumes of oil to move via rail out of Alberta over the third and fourth quarters and into the new year, but he declined to give a number. Canadian National Railway Co expects to move more crude shipments by rail in the back half of 2018, Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said on Tuesday. Pourbaix has also trimmed the company’s middle and upper management and initiated changes to improve employee morale, including “coffee chats” with employees. The changes seem to have softened investors and two headhunters in Canada said there were fewer Cenovus employees looking for job changes. “His message that capital allocation is more important and he is cutting costs, cutting jobs, willing to sell more assets I think that has certainly helped,” Laura Lau, portfolio manager at Brompton Group said. $1 = 1.3150 Canadian dollars

2018-07-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday as the market shifted focus to the possibility of increased Chinese demand, drawing attention away from oversupply worries and trade tensions between China and the United States. Brent crude LCOc1 settled 38 cents higher at $73.44 a barrel, after it reached a session high of $74. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 settled up 63 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to settle at $68.52. Earlier in the day, WTI reached a high of $69.05.  Reports that China will increase infrastructure spending helped lessen fears that U.S.-China trade tensions will reduce the country’s demand for oil, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  “That’s going to be very bullish for oil demand,” Flynn said. “Infrastructure spending from China in the past had really jacked up oil demand, and I think that’s adding some outside support for prices.” After an 8 percent decline from multi-year highs, buyers returned to the market, said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The supply-and-demand picture will remain favorable unless there are significant production increases from Russia and Saudi Arabia, McGillian said, because strong global growth has led to notable reductions in crude inventories. U.S. crude stocks fell last week by 3.2 million barrels, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The larger-than-expected draw caused futures to rise in post-settlement trade, with U.S. crude at $68.73 a barrel. [API/S] Inventories were forecast for a 2.3 million-barrel draw last week, according to a Reuters poll. Stockpiles at Cushing were expected to fall for the 10th consecutive week, traders said. [EIA/S] The commitments from Russia and Saudi Arabia to increase production, along with easing supply disruptions in Libya and decreases in global refiner demand continue to weigh on prices, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. Sentiment has been driven by fears that supply could be disrupted by confrontation in the Middle East or that Washington’s trade dispute with major trading partners could dampen global growth. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, which pumps 3.75 million barrels per day, has come under increasing U.S. pressure, with the administration of President Donald Trump pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil beginning in November. Saudi Arabia and other large producers are ramping up output to offset likely losses as the November deadline approaches. Meanwhile, U.S. crude inventories at the U.S. crude futures delivery hub at Cushing, Oklahoma rose in the four days to Friday, according to data supplier Genscape, traders said.

2018-07-24,"MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) potentially worth between $2 to $3 billion and which may happen by the end of the year, financial market sources told Reuters. One of the three financial market sources familiar with Sibur plans said that the company is looking at the possibility of an IPO in Moscow and London and may raise between $2 to $3 billion. Another of the three sources said that the company was looking to raise “a couple of billion dollars” from the deal. Asked about a potential IPO, Sibur said in a written reply to Reuters that it is considering different “strategic options” how to finance its growth. Two of the three sources said that JP Morgan and Russia’s Gazprombank are among possible arrangers of the deal. Gazprombank and JP Morgan did not immediately reply to Reuters’ requests for a comment. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur. His business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. There was no final decision whether only existing shares would be involved or Sibur would issue new shares for the IPO as well, the sources said. Sibur is currently constructing a petrochemical complex in western Siberia known as ZapSibNefteKhim, which will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, part of a play by Russia to capture more of the value from the oil it produces. Its another project, a gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion. Sibur is looking for Asian partners to share the risks for the latter.

2018-07-24,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) is exploring a sale of its pipeline assets, hoping to fetch more than $5 billion and free up capital to invest in exploration and production as oil prices rebound, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Occidental’s decision to shed the assets is the latest example of an oil company balking at the capital expenditure required to maintain U.S. pipelines, which have been plagued by bottlenecks and require construction of new networks.  Hess Corp (HES.N) and Oasis Petroleum Inc (OAS.N) are among the companies that have sold or spun off pipelines in the past year, looking to take advantage of high valuations for these assets, which have been buoyed by the capacity constrains.  Inability to transport enough oil out of the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, combined with increasing appetite for U.S. oil exports, could help Occidental sell its pipelines for top dollar, according to the sources. Occidental is working with investment bankers on an auction for the pipeline assets, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Occidental representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Occidental’s midstream assets include a major U.S. crude pipeline, a stake in a gas pipeline in the Middle East, a crude export terminal in Texas, and the Centurion Pipeline, a 2,900 mile line carrying crude from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. A year ago, Occidental tried to find a buyer for its 50 percent stake in its Ingleside Energy Center, a crude oil storage and export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. That sale process was not completed, and Occidental is including the facility in its package of midstream assets, one of the sources said.

2018-07-24,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Sixteen senators quit Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s ruling party on Tuesday and the country’s third most senior politician said he might follow suit, in a blow to the leader who seeks re-election next year. Fourteen of the 16 lawmakers left the All Progressives Congress (APC) to join the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), a letter read on the Senate floor stated. Another two senators later left the ruling party while parliament was in session.  Senate President Bukola Saraki, the number three political leader in Africa’s biggest economy, told Reuters in an interview a few hours later that the chances of him also leaving the APC were “very, very high”.  In a statement, a Buhari spokesman said no harm would be done to the party by the departures and the APC had “done its utmost to stop the defections”, without providing details. Buhari expressed “total willingness to work with all members of the National Assembly, irrespective of their political party, for the benefit of the nation,” the statement said. The fissures threaten to split support for Buhari within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of the presidential poll scheduled for February 2019 that will decide who runs Africa’s top oil producer. The defections, and the suggestion that there may be more to come, have taken place just weeks after a faction within the party said it no longer backed Buhari.  Fighting within the APC coalition, which united to unseat Buhari’s predecessor rather than because of ideological unity, has mounted for years in a struggle for power and influence between those loyal to the head of state and others who say they have been targeted in a witch-hunt by the presidency.  Divisions emerged publicly in the weeks following the APC’s conference in June where new party leaders were elected. Others saw their hopes of greater powers within the party dashed just months before the presidential and legislative elections. The PDP, which was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari took office in 2015, said in a tweet that 32 lawmakers in the lower House of Representatives had also joined from the APC. The defections may also make it harder for Buhari to enact his legislative agenda for the remainder of his first term.  Saraki, speaking to Reuters, said he was considering his next move. “I will spend the next few days consulting with my colleagues who have defected and also my other colleagues from my state and make my announcement very soon,” he said.  He ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the support of the opposition even though he is an APC member. He was not his party’s preferred candidate and the manner of his elevation to the office in 2015 led to strains in his relationship with Buhari.   Since then he has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since becoming Senate president, though none has led to convictions.  Asked about the raft of defections, Saraki said: “I must commend them for their courage because it took a lot for them to be able to do that in the face of this level of intimidation and harassment.” The Senate president and his supporters say he has been targeted by political opponents, most recently on Tuesday morning when he said his movements, and those of his deputy, were halted by police. Images of the alleged incident were circulated on social media.  Police denied taking that action. “The force wishes to categorically state that there was no authorised deployment of police personnel to besiege the residence of the Senate president or his deputy as reported in the media,” a police spokesman said.  He said the allegations would be investigated. Amid an increasingly febrile political backdrop, lawmakers in June issued a series of demands to Buhari including a call for an end to the “systematic harassment and humiliation by the executive of perceived political opponents”.  The president’s supporters have previously rejected the accusations levelled against the former military ruler.  “I am committed to listening to very legitimate grievances and engaging all those who are aggrieved that we can see through their grievances,” Adams Oshiomhole, the APC’s national chairman, told reporters in Abuja after Tuesday’s defections.  However, he said it was best for those motivated solely by personal interest to “return to where they belong”.  Buhari said in April that he would seek another term. His candidacy depends on party approval, though that is usually considered to be a formality for the incumbent.  Nigeria’s main opposition parties earlier this month agreed to form an alliance to field a joint candidate to contest the election.

2018-07-24,"CAIRO, Egypt, July 24 (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Tuesday opened three new power stations built at a total cost of 6 billion euros ($7 billion) as part of the Arab country’s development drive. Acute power shortages in the years immediately following Egypt’s 2011 uprising led to frequent summer blackouts and cuts to industrial output, but the new projects initiated in 2015 are part of an 8 billion euro deal to supply gas and wind power plants to boost electricity generation by 50 percent. Attending the unveiling of the gas-powered station in the administrative capital, a new city being built as the future government seat east of Cairo, Sisi praised Egypt’s ability to meet the electricity needs of the country’s population of nearly 100 million. “Today is a day of hope,” Sisi said. “We have come a long way in one of the most important elements of building and development in the state.” The 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant was one of two built in a joint venture between Siemens and Egypt’s Orascom Construction, Orascom said in a statement, adding that the second project at Burrulus, in the Nile Delta, had generation capacity of 9,600 MW. Sisi also unveiled a third gas-powered power station in Beni Suef, 110 kms (68 miles) south of Cairo. That plant also has capacity of 4,800 MW, sufficient to cover the needs of 15 million people, according to the state-run al-Ahram newspaper. Sisi also opened one of the world’s largest wind farms, built at a cost of 12 billion Egyptian pounds ($673 million). State media said the Gebel el-Zeit station, located in the Red Sea province, has capacity of 580 MW. Egypt aims to meet 20 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2022 and up to 40 percent by 2035. Renewable energy currently covers only about 3 percent of Egypt’s needs.

2018-07-24,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said on Tuesday it has killed high-value leaders from the group who were planning attacks targeting Saudi Arabia, the United States and Sweden. On April 24, a coalition air strike killed Syrian-based Islamic State member Munawwar al-Mutayari in Operation Inherent Resolve, the coalition said in a statement. He had been planning attacks on Saudi Arabia. Soufiane Makouh, a Belgian foreign fighter who travelled to Syria to plan attacks against the United States and its interests, was killed by an air strike on June 2. The coalition said that on June 12 an air strike killed  Simak, identified as an Islamic State intelligence officer linked to a cell plotting attacks in Sweden. Reuters could not independently verify these planned attacks. “With its conventional forces under heavy pressure in Syria, Daesh is desperately seeking to remain relevant through operations that threaten all the nations of the world,” Brigadier General Brian Eifler, director of Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a statement.  Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. Islamic State, which once declared that it would create a caliphate, has suffered heavy losses in the Middle East but is still seen as a security threat. Months after Iraq declared victory over Islamic State, its fighters are making a comeback with a scatter-gun campaign of kidnap and killing.  Numerous attempts to track down and kill Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have failed, and his fighters are still active in Arab states. In Syria, Islamic State still holds some territory but has suffered militarily. In Egypt, it is concentrated in the sparsely populated northern Sinai desert. It holds no territory but conducts hit-and-run attacks. Islamic State has tried to rebuild in Libya through mobile units in the desert and sleeper cells in northern cities.

2018-07-24,"BOGOTA, July 24 (Reuters) - Colombia is preparing changes to its bidding process for oil areas in an effort to increase investment and find new reserves, the head of the oil regulator said, after repeated cancellations of its latest oil round. The changes, including contracts adjusted to international crude price fluctuations and the chance for companies to propose exploration on land not yet on offer, will help attract spending and nearly double reserves to at least 10 years of consumption, Orlando Velandia of the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) said. “We’re looking to improve conditions for the country, to achieve competitiveness and motivate companies to make proposals about areas,” Velandia said in an interview on Monday. The ANH in April postponed the deadline to receive offers for 15 onshore areas at its Sinu-San Jacinto auction until the second half of the year. It was the sixth time the round was delayed. Colombia is the third Latin American country hosting oil auctions this year, after Mexico and Brazil. Its bidding round comes after a four-year pause when low oil prices stopped many Latin American countries from offering acreage. Colombia has been awarding blocks to the highest bidder every two to three years, but bidding in the new system will privilege the first company that requests access to additional areas, Velandia said, likely improving the offers of other bidders. “Once we evaluate the areas and they’re added to the map, companies can make offers in a continual competitive process,” Velandia said. Companies would no longer be required to outline planned investments or compensate the government if spending falls short, he added. Colombia could offer at least 20 onshore and offshore Caribbean blocks with the changes, Velandia said. Companies having problems with social protests or delays in environmental licensing could be offered alternative areas, he said. Protests, along with pipeline bombings, are a major headache. State-run Ecopetrol lost some $100 million earlier this year because of blockades. The country has 1.78 billion barrels of reserves, equivalent to about 5.7 years of consumption. Colombia produces about 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, half for export. The proposed changes must be approved by the ANH’s directive counsel, which includes the ministers of energy and finance. Changes not approved before Aug. 7 will go to the government of President-elect Ivan Duque, who has promised tax cuts, investment in Ecopetrol’s refineries and a crackdown on attacks by rebel groups.

2018-07-24,"NAIROBI, July 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - African and South Asian nations could miss national targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions unless rich countries stop using them as dumping grounds for millions of polluting old cars, a study has warned. The report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the United States, Japan and European Union countries had for years been exporting old, used cars - or clunkers - to nations such as Nigeria and Bangladesh. The second-hand vehicles, which should have been scrapped under domestic regulations, are instead being used by poorer nations where they are contributing to carbon emissions, said CSE, a New Delhi-based think-tank. Weak environmental regulations in poorer economies and stronger emissions regulations in exporting countries are among the factors “inciting this unregulated global trade in clunkers,” said Anumita Roychowdhury of CSE on Monday. “If this continues unchecked, without the exporting countries sharing the responsibility of addressing this problem, the poorer countries will not be able to meet their clean air and climate mitigation goals,” she said during a press conference on Facebook Live. There are around two billion vehicles globally, of which 2 percent - or 40 million - are deemed unworthy for road use in developed nations annually, according to the report. Many of them end up in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and Ethiopia. Ninety percent of Nigeria’s 3.5 million cars are imported second-hand vehicles, according to data from the management consultancy firm Deloitte. These old, ill-maintained and often malfunctioning vehicles become energy guzzlers and emit high levels of heat-trapping gases, said the CSE. Even though the level of emissions in less developed nations is lower than the world average, clunkers are a rapidly rising source of pollution, added the report. If left uncontrolled, clunkers could jeopardise climate goals set by poorer nations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international pact to slow down global warming. The cars are also contributing to high levels of air pollution in cities like Dhaka and Lagos, increasing the risk of lung diseases, respiratory illnesses and cancer, it added. Car manufacturers should be responsible for taking back the vehicles, recycling or disposing of them, while authorities in higher-income countries should put in place export regulations. Strong exit rules are needed to verify, inspect, certify and codify vehicles before export, and all vehicles with compromised emissions and safety features need to be barred from export, the study said. Many lower-income nations are taking steps to control the sector - from reducing their dependency on used car imports by promoting their own automobile manufacturing sector to raising import duties on big, fuel-guzzling vehicles. But experts from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said many lower-income countries still lacked a comprehensive set of policies to keep a check on imported clunkers. “Our observation is that countries that lack policies and incentives to attract cleaner vehicles are importing inefficient vehicles that emit greenhouse gases above the global averages,” said Jane Akumu from UNEP’s Air Quality and Mobility Unit.

2018-07-24,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in southern Laos are missing and many are feared dead a day after a hydropower dam under construction broke, killing several as it swept away homes in flash flooding, state media reported on Tuesday. More than 6,600 people are homeless, the Lao News Agency reported. It showed pictures of villagers wading through muddy floodwater carrying belongings. Others boarded rickety wooden boats or stood on the roofs of partially submerged houses.  Officials have brought boats to evacuate people in San Sai district of Attapeu province, where the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy hydropower dam is located, as water levels rise after the collapse, ABC Laos news reported. “The disaster has claimed several lives, left hundreds of people missing and more than 1,300 families (6,600 people) homeless,” it reported. The South Korean company that has a stake in the project said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers near the site. “We are running an emergency team and planning to help evacuate and rescue residents in villages near the dam,” a SK Engineering & Construction spokesman told Reuters by telephone. The $1 billion (£761.1 million) project was to build two dams with five auxiliary dams used to hold water beyond what is held by the main dams. Another official of SK Engineering & Construction said the company ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon as it became clear that the dam could collapse. Later, the company said in a statement the upper part of the supply dam was lost by torrential rains on July 22 but its repair work did not go smoothly due to the rains and more portions of the dam were fractured and overflowed in the following day. The South Korean foreign ministry said in a text message to reporters that 50 workers of the company and three from Korea Western Power Co. who were stationed at the construction site had been evacuated. The dam collapsed at 8:00 p.m. local time (1300 GMT) on Monday, releasing 5 billion cubic metres of water and several hundred people are missing after homes were swept away, the Lao News Agency said. It said several people had died. A video posted by the ABC Laos news on its Facebook page showed villagers stopping to watch fast-flowing water from the side of a riverbank.  Another showed a distraught women getting into a wooden boat with her baby, saying that she had to wait to be rescued after the floodwater came and her mother was still trapped in a tree.  The prime minister of the Communist-run Southeast Asian nation, Thongloun Sisoulith, has suspended government meetings and led Cabinet members to monitor rescue and relief efforts in one of the affected areas, the state agency reported. GRAPHIC: Map locating the collapsed dam in Laos - tmsnrt.rs/2JLQY4F One of Asia’s poorest and most secretive countries, Laos is landlocked, but aims to become the “battery of Asia” by selling power to neighbours through a series of hydropower dams. Lao experienced one of its worst natural disasters in 2013 when five major monsoon storms hit in a period of three months, according to the ReliefWeb humanitarian information portal. It said that approximately 347,000 people were affected by severe flooding in that disaster. Environmental rights groups have for years raised concerns about Laos’ hydropower ambitions, including worries over the impact of dams on the Mekong River, its flora and fauna and the rural communities and local economies that depend on it. The collapsed dam was expected to start commercial operations by 2019 and export 90 percent of its power to Thailand under a Power Purchase Agreement between the Xe-Pian-Xe Namnoy Power Company (PNPC) and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). The remaining 10 percent of power would be sold to the local grid under an agreement between the PNPC and the Electricite du Laos. PNPC was established in 2012 by SK Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (SK E&C), Korea Western Power Co. Ltd. (KOWEPO), Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Pcl, Thailand’s largest private power producer, and Lao Holding State Enterprise (LHSE).  Ratchburi Electricity Generating Holding Company said in a statement the dam, which it referred to as ‘Saddle Dam D’, was eight metres (26 feet) wide, 770 metres (2,526 feet) long and 16 metres (52 feet) high.  The dam “was fractured and the water had leaked to the downstream area and down to the Xe-Pian River which is about five kilometres from the dam,” said Kijja Sripatthangkura, chief executive officer of Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Company. International Rivers, a U.S.-based group that works to protect rivers and the rights of communities dependent on them, said the accident exposed “major risks” associated with some dam designs that cannot cope with extreme weather conditions. “Unpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Laos and the region due to climate change,” the group told Reuters in an e-mail. “This also shows the inadequacy of warning systems for the dam construction and operations. The warning appeared to come very late and was ineffective in ensuring people had advance notice to ensure their safety and that of their families.” Reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Ju-min Park; Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/laos-accident-dam/update-5-hundreds-missing-in-laos-after-collapse-of-dam-under-construction-idUKL4N1UK379,24 Jul 2018,"* Heavy rain, flooding fractured dam -construction firm

2018-07-24,"PRETORIA (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised $14.7 billion of investment on Tuesday during a state visit to South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa is on a mission to kick-start economic growth after a decade of stagnation. The rand ZAR=D3 firmed more than one percent after Ramaphosa announced China's investment pledge, which takes the amount overseas economies have committed to invest in South Africa to $35 billion since the start of the month. Those commitments will help ease worries about the health of the South African economy, which has performed poorly despite investor optimism when Ramaphosa replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma in February. “We have agreed that we must work as partners to improve the lives of our peoples by elevating our business, commercial and trade ties,” Ramaphosa told a joint news conference with Xi. Xi said China would take “active measures” to expand imports from Africa’s most industrialized economy. Ramaphosa will host Xi and the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India at a summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies in Johannesburg later this week, where he will be looking to secure further investment pledges. Among agreements signed on Tuesday, Chinese banks lent a combined $2.8 billion to struggling South African state power utility Eskom and logistics company Transnet. Ramaphosa has focused on revitalizing Eskom, which received an injection of $2.5 billion from China Development Bank and reported a $171 million full-year loss on Monday. Transnet, one of a handful of state firms accused of irregularities in the awarding of state contracts under former President Jacob Zuma, received $300 million from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS). Zuma denies wrongdoing. South Africa’s Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said other investments planned by China included an expansion of electronics firm Hisense’s local operations (600060.SS) and a metallurgical complex in Limpopo province. “We are looking to promote investment-led trade,” Davies said. “The same is what we are looking for from our BRICS partners.

2018-07-24,"July 24 (Reuters) - Canadian oil sands company Cenovus Energy investors will scrutinize quarterly earnings this week for details on Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix’s debt-cutting efforts and crude-for-rail contract negotiations to help resolve pipeline jams. After last year's unpopular acquisitihere of ConocoPhillips' assets, Pourbaix, who inherited a company last October with     C$9.51 billion in long-term debt, is giving himself until 2019 to turn Cenovus around and bring that figure down. He also took charge of a company with low staff morale and rising investor angst. He told Reuters in May his target is to reduce Cenovus's balance sheet to 2 times EBITDA. Cenovus' leverage was 2.8 times as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its latest filing here “Once the deleveraging is complete, we will consider balancing returning cash to shareholders with investing in growth projects,” he said in the interview with Reuters. Douglas Kee, chief investment officer at Leon Frazer & Associates, said Cenovus is not expected to increase dividends until later in 2019. He sees a rise of 10 to 15 percent at best. In the first quarter, Cenovus declared a dividend of 5 cents per share representing an annualized yield of about 2 percent. Investors wiped out about a fifth of the Calgary-based company's market value here when it bought Conocophillips' oil sands assets for C$17 billion last year. Shares are now up about 51.4 percent after plunging to a record low in February. Analysts on average expect Cenovus to report a second-quarter profit of 3 Canadian cents on revenue of C$5.28 billion on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It reported  revenue of C$4.04 billion and earnings of C$2.37 cents per share in the year-ago period. But its turnaround plans have been complicated by pipeline bottlenecks that are choking oil flow from Canada. A supply crunch of heavy oil from Venezuela has increased demand for Canadian oil sands, but Pourbaix told Reuters that opportunity has been challenged by the pipeline crunch. Transport bottlenecks, the result of pipelines running at full capacity, have deepened the discount for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude and Cenovus’ differentials per barrel jumped 67 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. Pourbaix, who has been negotiating with rail companies about increasing locomotive hauling capacity for oil, said for rail to be competitive costs have to be closer to $10 or $12 a barrel than around $20 currently to get to the U.S. GulfCoast. He said in May that he expects significant volumes of oil to move via rail out of Alberta over the third and fourth quarters and into the new year, but he declined to give a number. Pourbaix has also trimmed the company’s middle and upper management and initiated changes to improve employee morale, including “coffee chats” with employees. The changes seem to have softened investors and two headhunters in Canada said there are fewer Cenovus employees looking for job changes. “His message that capital allocation is more important and he is cutting costs, cutting jobs, willing to sell more assets I think that has certainly helped,” Laura Lau, portfolio manager at Brompton Group said.

2018-07-24,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The longest drought in decades is drying out rivers in the usually wet Netherlands, hitting cargo traffic and threatening a shortage of bulk supplies ranging from hops for beer brewers to cement for the construction sector. The summer of 2018 looks set to overtake 1976 as the driest one on record in the Netherlands, with almost no rain for two months and currently not expected until well into August.  An enduring heat wave is expected to take temperatures to above 35 degrees Celsius later this week, and the Dutch national weather institute issued a warning for “extreme weather” on Tuesday, urging people to take precautions. Water in important rivers such as the Rhine and Ijssel, which depend on rain and snow, has fallen below critical levels, severely limiting cargo traffic, as ships can only be used for a fraction of their normal capacity to keep them afloat. “Many large ships can now only take half to a third of their normal loads,” Joost Sitskoorn of Evofenedex, the Dutch association for logistical companies, told Reuters. “A lot more ships are needed to meet demand. Overcapacity helped counter this problem for a while, but the supply is starting to dry up.”  This could lead to shortages in a range of goods, with building materials, cattle feed and barley and hop for beer brewers first in line, Sitskoorn said. Roughly a third of all goods transported in the Netherlands move over water, with the sector carrying a total load of 365.7 billion kg last year, mostly to and from elsewhere in Europe. Over half of the freight is in the form of bulk goods, such as iron ore, sand, gravel and cement, which are impossible to shift to the road for transport, as it takes some 30 trucks to replace only one small cargo ship. “I really fear for a situation in which the current low water levels persist,” said Pim van Baaren, director of the Van Nieuwpoort Group, a large supplier of building materials in the Netherlands. “We can manage for now, but mainly because many builders are away for the holidays.”  Transport costs have already risen by 30 percent, Van Baaren said, while the demand for the limited amount of ships available is rapidly driving up prices. The long, hot summer caused new obstacles on Tuesday when Amsterdam closed two important shipping routes through its canals, as it could not sufficiently cool its iron bridges to open them for ships. This caught several shippers off guard, as they were suddenly cut off from their customers. “We had to reroute a ship filled with cement for an important customer from the south of Amsterdam to the north, and they had to shut their factory in the south as we couldn’t reach them,” Van Baaren said.

2018-07-24,"(Adds details, background) ISTANBUL, July 24 (Reuters) - Turkey has told American officials it opposes U.S. sanctions on Iran and is not obliged to implement them, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday. President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran and ordered U.S. sanctions on Tehran, while a senior State Department official said Washington has told allies to cut imports of Iranian oil by November Turkey has criticised Trump’s move to withdraw from the nuclear pact and has publicly resisted the U.S. call to cut oil imports from Iran. “We do not have to adhere to the sanctions imposed on a country by another country. We don’t find the sanctions right either,” Cavusoglu told a news conference in Azerbaijan. “We held meetings with the United States in Ankara and told them openly: Turkey gets oil and gas from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia and Iraq. If I don’t buy from Iran now, where am I supposed to meet that need from?” Cavusoglu said. Last week U.S. Treasury and State Department officials met Turkish counterparts in Ankara to discuss sanctions on Iran. Ankara said authorities were working to prevent Turkey being hurt by the measures. Turkey depends on imports for almost all of its energy needs. In the first four months of this year, Turkey bought more than 3 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran, almost 55 percent of its total crude supplies, according to data from the Turkish energy watchdog (EPDK). Ties between Ankara and Washington, NATO allies, have been strained over a host of issues including several legal cases. A Turkish court last week ruled to keep American pastor Andrew Brunson in jail, in a case that has deepened existing rifts and jeopardised the procurement of Lockheed Martin F-35 jets by Turkey. The U.S. Senate passed a bill last month including a measure that prohibits Turkey from buying the jets because of Brunson’s imprisonment and Turkey’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 air defence system, which are incompatible with NATO systems. Cavusoglu, however, said there were no issues with the procurement of the jets and the United States could not exclude Turkey from the project. “The United States needs to understand that it is not possible to get a result from Turkey through sanctions. They will see results if they approach Turkey with dialogue and respect,” he said. “We will not bow down to such pressures, sanctions or threats. Everyone will get used to the new Turkey.” (Reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Tuvan Gumrukcu Editing by Humeyra Pamuk and Dominic Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iran-turkey/update-1-turkey-told-u-s-it-opposes-sanctions-on-iran-foreign-minister-idUKL5N1UK5UQ,24 Jul 2018,"Turkey has told American

2018-07-24,"By Carolina Mandl and Alexandra Alper RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA has chosen to enter exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oilfields to a group backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, two people familiar with the matter said. Brazilian energy firm Ouro Preto Óleo e Gás, backed by EIG, made the top bid for the so-called Pampo and Enchova clusters, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, beating out Trident Energy, a Warburg Pincus-backed firm, the sources said. The deal could mark EIG’s debut in the oil production business in Latin America’s top producer. It also makes strategic sense for the private equity firm, which earlier this year bought out Brazilian logistics company Prumo Logistica, operator of the nearby port of Acu. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) will provide debt financing for the bid, whose structure and value were not immediately clear. But sources familiar with the tender, first reported by Reuters in June, said it could fetch around $1 billion.  Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  World class geology and dwindling reserves mean the world’s top oil majors have invested billions of dollars to take stakes in Brazil’s prolific deep water oilfields in recent months. But smaller oil companies are often better than large ones at cutting costs and some have honed expertise in squeezing more oil out of mature fields. EIG will follow in the footsteps of First Reserve Corporation and Riverstone Holdings, private equity firms invested in Brazil’s Barra Energia. Ouro Preto, created in 2010, is led by former OGX president Rodolfo Landim and has stakes in several basins throughout Brazil, but none in Campos.  A sale of the mature field clusters would also make financial sense for Petrobras, the world’s most indebted oil company, as it seeks to offload $21 billion in assets from 2017 to 2018. According to Petrobras, the Enchova cluster, which includes the Marimba, Enchova, Bonito, Enchova Oeste Bicudo and Pirauna fields, has 32 wells producing 25,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With 27 wells, the Badejo, Pampo, Linguado and Trilha fields of the Pampo cluster produce 13,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Petrobras is selling the rights to the fields until 2025. Both Enchova and Pampo began producing in the 1980s.

2018-07-24,"(Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) (CNI.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings as the railroad moved higher volumes of commodities including grains and fertilizers at better pricing. Canada’s largest railroad expects to move higher volumes in the second half of 2018, as it expects strong demand through 2019, and will improve capacity by bringing new workers and locomotives into service.  The capacity gives Montreal-based CN more leeway to take on crude-by-rail contracts, provided it does not disrupt service of commodities like grain, said Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest, who now heads the company on a permanent basis. “In the second half, we will have more capacity, therefore we will also be able to execute a bigger book of business of crude,” Ruest told analysts. CN Rail and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) are investing in rail infrastructure to ease capacity constraints following a surge in demand from producers of grains and other commodities. Oil producers are eying railroads as production has exceeded pipeline capacity. CN said it now expected adjusted earnings of C$5.30 to C$5.45 per share, compared with C$5.10 to C$5.25 per share estimated previously. CN also added another C$100 million ($76.02 million) to its capital budget, taking its total spending to C$3.5 billion for 2018, as it looks to invest in new rail cars. CN expects capital expenditures to remain similar in 2019 compared with this year. The introduction of tariffs on items like lumber and aluminum have not impacted CN’s business, Ruest said. “So far the impact has not been material in two of the three commodities where there is a duty,” he said. “The volume is actually increasing on the cross-border activities.”    Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 5.8 percent, while rail freight revenue per carload increased 3.9 percent, the company said in a statement. CN Rail said operating ratio, which measures operating costs as a percentage of revenue, increased to 58.2 percent from 57.5 percent a year earlier. Net income rose to C$1.31 billion ($995.82 million), or C$1.77 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30 from C$1.03 billion, or C$1.36 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned C$1.51 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of C$1.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

It reported  revenue of C$4.04 billion and earnings of C$2.37 cents per share in the year-ago period. But its turnaround plans have been complicated by pipeline bottlenecks that are choking oil flow from Canada. A supply crunch of heavy oil from Venezuela has increased demand for Canadian oil sands, but Pourbaix told Reuters that opportunity has been challenged by the pipeline crunch. Transport bottlenecks, the result of pipelines running at full capacity, have deepened the discount for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude and Cenovus’ differentials per barrel jumped 67 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. Pourbaix, who has been negotiating with rail companies about increasing locomotive hauling capacity for oil, said for rail to be competitive costs have to be closer to $10 or $12 a barrel than around $20 currently to get to the U.S. Gulf Coast. He said in May that he expects significant volumes of oil to move via rail out of Alberta over the third and fourth quarters and into the new year, but he declined to give a number. Canadian National Railway Co expects to move more crude shipments by rail in the back half of 2018, Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Ruest said on Tuesday. Pourbaix has also trimmed the company’s middle and upper management and initiated changes to improve employee morale, including “coffee chats” with employees. The changes seem to have softened investors and two headhunters in Canada said there were fewer Cenovus employees looking for job changes. “His message that capital allocation is more important and he is cutting costs, cutting jobs, willing to sell more assets I think that has certainly helped,” Laura Lau, portfolio manager at Brompton Group said. $1 = 1.3150 Canadian dollars

2018-07-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday as the market shifted focus to the possibility of increased Chinese demand, drawing attention away from oversupply worries and trade tensions between China and the United States. Brent crude LCOc1 settled 38 cents higher at $73.44 a barrel, after it reached a session high of $74. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 settled up 63 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to settle at $68.52. Earlier in the day, WTI reached a high of $69.05.  Reports that China will increase infrastructure spending helped lessen fears that U.S.-China trade tensions will reduce the country’s demand for oil, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  “That’s going to be very bullish for oil demand,” Flynn said. “Infrastructure spending from China in the past had really jacked up oil demand, and I think that’s adding some outside support for prices.” After an 8 percent decline from multi-year highs, buyers returned to the market, said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. The supply-and-demand picture will remain favorable unless there are significant production increases from Russia and Saudi Arabia, McGillian said, because strong global growth has led to notable reductions in crude inventories. U.S. crude stocks fell last week by 3.2 million barrels, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The larger-than-expected draw caused futures to rise in post-settlement trade, with U.S. crude at $68.73 a barrel. [API/S] Inventories were forecast for a 2.3 million-barrel draw last week, according to a Reuters poll. Stockpiles at Cushing were expected to fall for the 10th consecutive week, traders said. [EIA/S] The commitments from Russia and Saudi Arabia to increase production, along with easing supply disruptions in Libya and decreases in global refiner demand continue to weigh on prices, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. Sentiment has been driven by fears that supply could be disrupted by confrontation in the Middle East or that Washington’s trade dispute with major trading partners could dampen global growth. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, which pumps 3.75 million barrels per day, has come under increasing U.S. pressure, with the administration of President Donald Trump pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil beginning in November. Saudi Arabia and other large producers are ramping up output to offset likely losses as the November deadline approaches. Meanwhile, U.S. crude inventories at the U.S. crude futures delivery hub at Cushing, Oklahoma rose in the four days to Friday, according to data supplier Genscape, traders said.

2018-07-24,"MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) potentially worth between $2 to $3 billion and which may happen by the end of the year, financial market sources told Reuters. One of the three financial market sources familiar with Sibur plans said that the company is looking at the possibility of an IPO in Moscow and London and may raise between $2 to $3 billion. Another of the three sources said that the company was looking to raise “a couple of billion dollars” from the deal. Asked about a potential IPO, Sibur said in a written reply to Reuters that it is considering different “strategic options” how to finance its growth. Two of the three sources said that JP Morgan and Russia’s Gazprombank are among possible arrangers of the deal. Gazprombank and JP Morgan did not immediately reply to Reuters’ requests for a comment. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur. His business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. There was no final decision whether only existing shares would be involved or Sibur would issue new shares for the IPO as well, the sources said. Sibur is currently constructing a petrochemical complex in western Siberia known as ZapSibNefteKhim, which will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, part of a play by Russia to capture more of the value from the oil it produces. Its another project, a gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion. Sibur is looking for Asian partners to share the risks for the latter.

2018-07-24,"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) is exploring a sale of its pipeline assets, hoping to fetch more than $5 billion and free up capital to invest in exploration and production as oil prices rebound, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Occidental’s decision to shed the assets is the latest example of an oil company balking at the capital expenditure required to maintain U.S. pipelines, which have been plagued by bottlenecks and require construction of new networks.  Hess Corp (HES.N) and Oasis Petroleum Inc (OAS.N) are among the companies that have sold or spun off pipelines in the past year, looking to take advantage of high valuations for these assets, which have been buoyed by the capacity constrains.  Inability to transport enough oil out of the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, combined with increasing appetite for U.S. oil exports, could help Occidental sell its pipelines for top dollar, according to the sources. Occidental is working with investment bankers on an auction for the pipeline assets, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Occidental representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Occidental’s midstream assets include a major U.S. crude pipeline, a stake in a gas pipeline in the Middle East, a crude export terminal in Texas, and the Centurion Pipeline, a 2,900 mile line carrying crude from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. A year ago, Occidental tried to find a buyer for its 50 percent stake in its Ingleside Energy Center, a crude oil storage and export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. That sale process was not completed, and Occidental is including the facility in its package of midstream assets, one of the sources said.

2018-07-24,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Sixteen senators quit Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s ruling party on Tuesday and the country’s third most senior politician said he might follow suit, in a blow to the leader who seeks re-election next year. Fourteen of the 16 lawmakers left the All Progressives Congress (APC) to join the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), a letter read on the Senate floor stated. Another two senators later left the ruling party while parliament was in session.  Senate President Bukola Saraki, the number three political leader in Africa’s biggest economy, told Reuters in an interview a few hours later that the chances of him also leaving the APC were “very, very high”.  In a statement, a Buhari spokesman said no harm would be done to the party by the departures and the APC had “done its utmost to stop the defections”, without providing details. Buhari expressed “total willingness to work with all members of the National Assembly, irrespective of their political party, for the benefit of the nation,” the statement said. The fissures threaten to split support for Buhari within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of the presidential poll scheduled for February 2019 that will decide who runs Africa’s top oil producer. The defections, and the suggestion that there may be more to come, have taken place just weeks after a faction within the party said it no longer backed Buhari.  Fighting within the APC coalition, which united to unseat Buhari’s predecessor rather than because of ideological unity, has mounted for years in a struggle for power and influence between those loyal to the head of state and others who say they have been targeted in a witch-hunt by the presidency.  Divisions emerged publicly in the weeks following the APC’s conference in June where new party leaders were elected. Others saw their hopes of greater powers within the party dashed just months before the presidential and legislative elections. The PDP, which was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari took office in 2015, said in a tweet that 32 lawmakers in the lower House of Representatives had also joined from the APC. The defections may also make it harder for Buhari to enact his legislative agenda for the remainder of his first term.  Saraki, speaking to Reuters, said he was considering his next move. “I will spend the next few days consulting with my colleagues who have defected and also my other colleagues from my state and make my announcement very soon,” he said.  He ran unopposed for the post of Senate president, mainly with the support of the opposition even though he is an APC member. He was not his party’s preferred candidate and the manner of his elevation to the office in 2015 led to strains in his relationship with Buhari.   Since then he has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since becoming Senate president, though none has led to convictions.  Asked about the raft of defections, Saraki said: “I must commend them for their courage because it took a lot for them to be able to do that in the face of this level of intimidation and harassment.” The Senate president and his supporters say he has been targeted by political opponents, most recently on Tuesday morning when he said his movements, and those of his deputy, were halted by police. Images of the alleged incident were circulated on social media.  Police denied taking that action. “The force wishes to categorically state that there was no authorised deployment of police personnel to besiege the residence of the Senate president or his deputy as reported in the media,” a police spokesman said.  He said the allegations would be investigated. Amid an increasingly febrile political backdrop, lawmakers in June issued a series of demands to Buhari including a call for an end to the “systematic harassment and humiliation by the executive of perceived political opponents”.  The president’s supporters have previously rejected the accusations levelled against the former military ruler.  “I am committed to listening to very legitimate grievances and engaging all those who are aggrieved that we can see through their grievances,” Adams Oshiomhole, the APC’s national chairman, told reporters in Abuja after Tuesday’s defections.  However, he said it was best for those motivated solely by personal interest to “return to where they belong”.  Buhari said in April that he would seek another term. His candidacy depends on party approval, though that is usually considered to be a formality for the incumbent.  Nigeria’s main opposition parties earlier this month agreed to form an alliance to field a joint candidate to contest the election.

2018-07-24,"CAIRO, Egypt, July 24 (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Tuesday opened three new power stations built at a total cost of 6 billion euros ($7 billion) as part of the Arab country’s development drive. Acute power shortages in the years immediately following Egypt’s 2011 uprising led to frequent summer blackouts and cuts to industrial output, but the new projects initiated in 2015 are part of an 8 billion euro deal to supply gas and wind power plants to boost electricity generation by 50 percent. Attending the unveiling of the gas-powered station in the administrative capital, a new city being built as the future government seat east of Cairo, Sisi praised Egypt’s ability to meet the electricity needs of the country’s population of nearly 100 million. “Today is a day of hope,” Sisi said. “We have come a long way in one of the most important elements of building and development in the state.” The 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant was one of two built in a joint venture between Siemens and Egypt’s Orascom Construction, Orascom said in a statement, adding that the second project at Burrulus, in the Nile Delta, had generation capacity of 9,600 MW. Sisi also unveiled a third gas-powered power station in Beni Suef, 110 kms (68 miles) south of Cairo. That plant also has capacity of 4,800 MW, sufficient to cover the needs of 15 million people, according to the state-run al-Ahram newspaper. Sisi also opened one of the world’s largest wind farms, built at a cost of 12 billion Egyptian pounds ($673 million). State media said the Gebel el-Zeit station, located in the Red Sea province, has capacity of 580 MW. Egypt aims to meet 20 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2022 and up to 40 percent by 2035. Renewable energy currently covers only about 3 percent of Egypt’s needs.

2018-07-24,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said on Tuesday it has killed high-value leaders from the group who were planning attacks targeting Saudi Arabia, the United States and Sweden. On April 24, a coalition air strike killed Syrian-based Islamic State member Munawwar al-Mutayari in Operation Inherent Resolve, the coalition said in a statement. He had been planning attacks on Saudi Arabia. Soufiane Makouh, a Belgian foreign fighter who travelled to Syria to plan attacks against the United States and its interests, was killed by an air strike on June 2. The coalition said that on June 12 an air strike killed  Simak, identified as an Islamic State intelligence officer linked to a cell plotting attacks in Sweden. Reuters could not independently verify these planned attacks. “With its conventional forces under heavy pressure in Syria, Daesh is desperately seeking to remain relevant through operations that threaten all the nations of the world,” Brigadier General Brian Eifler, director of Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a statement.  Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. Islamic State, which once declared that it would create a caliphate, has suffered heavy losses in the Middle East but is still seen as a security threat. Months after Iraq declared victory over Islamic State, its fighters are making a comeback with a scatter-gun campaign of kidnap and killing.  Numerous attempts to track down and kill Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have failed, and his fighters are still active in Arab states. In Syria, Islamic State still holds some territory but has suffered militarily. In Egypt, it is concentrated in the sparsely populated northern Sinai desert. It holds no territory but conducts hit-and-run attacks. Islamic State has tried to rebuild in Libya through mobile units in the desert and sleeper cells in northern cities.

2018-07-24,"BOGOTA, July 24 (Reuters) - Colombia is preparing changes to its bidding process for oil areas in an effort to increase investment and find new reserves, the head of the oil regulator said, after repeated cancellations of its latest oil round. The changes, including contracts adjusted to international crude price fluctuations and the chance for companies to propose exploration on land not yet on offer, will help attract spending and nearly double reserves to at least 10 years of consumption, Orlando Velandia of the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) said. “We’re looking to improve conditions for the country, to achieve competitiveness and motivate companies to make proposals about areas,” Velandia said in an interview on Monday. The ANH in April postponed the deadline to receive offers for 15 onshore areas at its Sinu-San Jacinto auction until the second half of the year. It was the sixth time the round was delayed. Colombia is the third Latin American country hosting oil auctions this year, after Mexico and Brazil. Its bidding round comes after a four-year pause when low oil prices stopped many Latin American countries from offering acreage. Colombia has been awarding blocks to the highest bidder every two to three years, but bidding in the new system will privilege the first company that requests access to additional areas, Velandia said, likely improving the offers of other bidders. “Once we evaluate the areas and they’re added to the map, companies can make offers in a continual competitive process,” Velandia said. Companies would no longer be required to outline planned investments or compensate the government if spending falls short, he added. Colombia could offer at least 20 onshore and offshore Caribbean blocks with the changes, Velandia said. Companies having problems with social protests or delays in environmental licensing could be offered alternative areas, he said. Protests, along with pipeline bombings, are a major headache. State-run Ecopetrol lost some $100 million earlier this year because of blockades. The country has 1.78 billion barrels of reserves, equivalent to about 5.7 years of consumption. Colombia produces about 860,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, half for export. The proposed changes must be approved by the ANH’s directive counsel, which includes the ministers of energy and finance. Changes not approved before Aug. 7 will go to the government of President-elect Ivan Duque, who has promised tax cuts, investment in Ecopetrol’s refineries and a crackdown on attacks by rebel groups.

2018-07-24,"NAIROBI, July 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - African and South Asian nations could miss national targets to curb greenhouse gas emissions unless rich countries stop using them as dumping grounds for millions of polluting old cars, a study has warned. The report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the United States, Japan and European Union countries had for years been exporting old, used cars - or clunkers - to nations such as Nigeria and Bangladesh. The second-hand vehicles, which should have been scrapped under domestic regulations, are instead being used by poorer nations where they are contributing to carbon emissions, said CSE, a New Delhi-based think-tank. Weak environmental regulations in poorer economies and stronger emissions regulations in exporting countries are among the factors “inciting this unregulated global trade in clunkers,” said Anumita Roychowdhury of CSE on Monday. “If this continues unchecked, without the exporting countries sharing the responsibility of addressing this problem, the poorer countries will not be able to meet their clean air and climate mitigation goals,” she said during a press conference on Facebook Live. There are around two billion vehicles globally, of which 2 percent - or 40 million - are deemed unworthy for road use in developed nations annually, according to the report. Many of them end up in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and Ethiopia. Ninety percent of Nigeria’s 3.5 million cars are imported second-hand vehicles, according to data from the management consultancy firm Deloitte. These old, ill-maintained and often malfunctioning vehicles become energy guzzlers and emit high levels of heat-trapping gases, said the CSE. Even though the level of emissions in less developed nations is lower than the world average, clunkers are a rapidly rising source of pollution, added the report. If left uncontrolled, clunkers could jeopardise climate goals set by poorer nations on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as part of an international pact to slow down global warming. The cars are also contributing to high levels of air pollution in cities like Dhaka and Lagos, increasing the risk of lung diseases, respiratory illnesses and cancer, it added. Car manufacturers should be responsible for taking back the vehicles, recycling or disposing of them, while authorities in higher-income countries should put in place export regulations. Strong exit rules are needed to verify, inspect, certify and codify vehicles before export, and all vehicles with compromised emissions and safety features need to be barred from export, the study said. Many lower-income nations are taking steps to control the sector - from reducing their dependency on used car imports by promoting their own automobile manufacturing sector to raising import duties on big, fuel-guzzling vehicles. But experts from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said many lower-income countries still lacked a comprehensive set of policies to keep a check on imported clunkers. “Our observation is that countries that lack policies and incentives to attract cleaner vehicles are importing inefficient vehicles that emit greenhouse gases above the global averages,” said Jane Akumu from UNEP’s Air Quality and Mobility Unit.

2018-07-24,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in southern Laos are missing and many are feared dead a day after a hydropower dam under construction broke, killing several as it swept away homes in flash flooding, state media reported on Tuesday. More than 6,600 people are homeless, the Lao News Agency reported. It showed pictures of villagers wading through muddy floodwater carrying belongings. Others boarded rickety wooden boats or stood on the roofs of partially submerged houses.  Officials have brought boats to evacuate people in San Sai district of Attapeu province, where the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy hydropower dam is located, as water levels rise after the collapse, ABC Laos news reported. “The disaster has claimed several lives, left hundreds of people missing and more than 1,300 families (6,600 people) homeless,” it reported. The South Korean company that has a stake in the project said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers near the site. “We are running an emergency team and planning to help evacuate and rescue residents in villages near the dam,” a SK Engineering & Construction spokesman told Reuters by telephone. The $1 billion (£761.1 million) project was to build two dams with five auxiliary dams used to hold water beyond what is held by the main dams. Another official of SK Engineering & Construction said the company ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon as it became clear that the dam could collapse. Later, the company said in a statement the upper part of the supply dam was lost by torrential rains on July 22 but its repair work did not go smoothly due to the rains and more portions of the dam were fractured and overflowed in the following day. The South Korean foreign ministry said in a text message to reporters that 50 workers of the company and three from Korea Western Power Co. who were stationed at the construction site had been evacuated. The dam collapsed at 8:00 p.m. local time (1300 GMT) on Monday, releasing 5 billion cubic metres of water and several hundred people are missing after homes were swept away, the Lao News Agency said. It said several people had died. A video posted by the ABC Laos news on its Facebook page showed villagers stopping to watch fast-flowing water from the side of a riverbank.  Another showed a distraught women getting into a wooden boat with her baby, saying that she had to wait to be rescued after the floodwater came and her mother was still trapped in a tree.  The prime minister of the Communist-run Southeast Asian nation, Thongloun Sisoulith, has suspended government meetings and led Cabinet members to monitor rescue and relief efforts in one of the affected areas, the state agency reported. GRAPHIC: Map locating the collapsed dam in Laos - tmsnrt.rs/2JLQY4F One of Asia’s poorest and most secretive countries, Laos is landlocked, but aims to become the “battery of Asia” by selling power to neighbours through a series of hydropower dams. Lao experienced one of its worst natural disasters in 2013 when five major monsoon storms hit in a period of three months, according to the ReliefWeb humanitarian information portal. It said that approximately 347,000 people were affected by severe flooding in that disaster. Environmental rights groups have for years raised concerns about Laos’ hydropower ambitions, including worries over the impact of dams on the Mekong River, its flora and fauna and the rural communities and local economies that depend on it. The collapsed dam was expected to start commercial operations by 2019 and export 90 percent of its power to Thailand under a Power Purchase Agreement between the Xe-Pian-Xe Namnoy Power Company (PNPC) and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). The remaining 10 percent of power would be sold to the local grid under an agreement between the PNPC and the Electricite du Laos. PNPC was established in 2012 by SK Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (SK E&C), Korea Western Power Co. Ltd. (KOWEPO), Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Pcl, Thailand’s largest private power producer, and Lao Holding State Enterprise (LHSE).  Ratchburi Electricity Generating Holding Company said in a statement the dam, which it referred to as ‘Saddle Dam D’, was eight metres (26 feet) wide, 770 metres (2,526 feet) long and 16 metres (52 feet) high.  The dam “was fractured and the water had leaked to the downstream area and down to the Xe-Pian River which is about five kilometres from the dam,” said Kijja Sripatthangkura, chief executive officer of Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Company. International Rivers, a U.S.-based group that works to protect rivers and the rights of communities dependent on them, said the accident exposed “major risks” associated with some dam designs that cannot cope with extreme weather conditions. “Unpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent in Laos and the region due to climate change,” the group told Reuters in an e-mail. “This also shows the inadequacy of warning systems for the dam construction and operations. The warning appeared to come very late and was ineffective in ensuring people had advance notice to ensure their safety and that of their families.” Reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Ju-min Park; Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/laos-accident-dam/update-5-hundreds-missing-in-laos-after-collapse-of-dam-under-construction-idUKL4N1UK379,24 Jul 2018,"* Heavy rain, flooding fractured dam -construction firm

2018-07-24,"PRETORIA (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping promised $14.7 billion of investment on Tuesday during a state visit to South Africa, where President Cyril Ramaphosa is on a mission to kick-start economic growth after a decade of stagnation. The rand ZAR=D3 firmed more than one percent after Ramaphosa announced China's investment pledge, which takes the amount overseas economies have committed to invest in South Africa to $35 billion since the start of the month. Those commitments will help ease worries about the health of the South African economy, which has performed poorly despite investor optimism when Ramaphosa replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma in February. “We have agreed that we must work as partners to improve the lives of our peoples by elevating our business, commercial and trade ties,” Ramaphosa told a joint news conference with Xi. Xi said China would take “active measures” to expand imports from Africa’s most industrialized economy. Ramaphosa will host Xi and the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India at a summit of the BRICS group of emerging economies in Johannesburg later this week, where he will be looking to secure further investment pledges. Among agreements signed on Tuesday, Chinese banks lent a combined $2.8 billion to struggling South African state power utility Eskom and logistics company Transnet. Ramaphosa has focused on revitalizing Eskom, which received an injection of $2.5 billion from China Development Bank and reported a $171 million full-year loss on Monday. Transnet, one of a handful of state firms accused of irregularities in the awarding of state contracts under former President Jacob Zuma, received $300 million from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS). Zuma denies wrongdoing. South Africa’s Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said other investments planned by China included an expansion of electronics firm Hisense’s local operations (600060.SS) and a metallurgical complex in Limpopo province. “We are looking to promote investment-led trade,” Davies said. “The same is what we are looking for from our BRICS partners. More investment and less outright pushing of products into a market.” Editing by James Macharia",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-china/update-2-chinas-xi-pledges-14-7-bln-investment-on-south-africa-visit-idUKL5N1UK3SJ,24 Jul 2018,"* Investments will help Ramaphosa's turnaround plan

2018-07-24,"July 24 (Reuters) - Canadian oil sands company Cenovus Energy investors will scrutinize quarterly earnings this week for details on Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix’s debt-cutting efforts and crude-for-rail contract negotiations to help resolve pipeline jams. After last year's unpopular acquisitihere of ConocoPhillips' assets, Pourbaix, who inherited a company last October with     C$9.51 billion in long-term debt, is giving himself until 2019 to turn Cenovus around and bring that figure down. He also took charge of a company with low staff morale and rising investor angst. He told Reuters in May his target is to reduce Cenovus's balance sheet to 2 times EBITDA. Cenovus' leverage was 2.8 times as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its latest filing here “Once the deleveraging is complete, we will consider balancing returning cash to shareholders with investing in growth projects,” he said in the interview with Reuters. Douglas Kee, chief investment officer at Leon Frazer & Associates, said Cenovus is not expected to increase dividends until later in 2019. He sees a rise of 10 to 15 percent at best. In the first quarter, Cenovus declared a dividend of 5 cents per share representing an annualized yield of about 2 percent. Investors wiped out about a fifth of the Calgary-based company's market value here when it bought Conocophillips' oil sands assets for C$17 billion last year. Shares are now up about 51.4 percent after plunging to a record low in February. Analysts on average expect Cenovus to report a second-quarter profit of 3 Canadian cents on revenue of C$5.28 billion on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It reported  revenue of C$4.04 billion and earnings of C$2.37 cents per share in the year-ago period. But its turnaround plans have been complicated by pipeline bottlenecks that are choking oil flow from Canada. A supply crunch of heavy oil from Venezuela has increased demand for Canadian oil sands, but Pourbaix told Reuters that opportunity has been challenged by the pipeline crunch. Transport bottlenecks, the result of pipelines running at full capacity, have deepened the discount for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude and Cenovus’ differentials per barrel jumped 67 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. Pourbaix, who has been negotiating with rail companies about increasing locomotive hauling capacity for oil, said for rail to be competitive costs have to be closer to $10 or $12 a barrel than around $20 currently to get to the U.S. GulfCoast. He said in May that he expects significant volumes of oil to move via rail out of Alberta over the third and fourth quarters and into the new year, but he declined to give a number. Pourbaix has also trimmed the company’s middle and upper management and initiated changes to improve employee morale, including “coffee chats” with employees. The changes seem to have softened investors and two headhunters in Canada said there are fewer Cenovus employees looking for job changes. “His message that capital allocation is more important and he is cutting costs, cutting jobs, willing to sell more assets I think that has certainly helped,” Laura Lau, portfolio manager at Brompton Group said.

2018-07-24,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The longest drought in decades is drying out rivers in the usually wet Netherlands, hitting cargo traffic and threatening a shortage of bulk supplies ranging from hops for beer brewers to cement for the construction sector. The summer of 2018 looks set to overtake 1976 as the driest one on record in the Netherlands, with almost no rain for two months and currently not expected until well into August.  An enduring heat wave is expected to take temperatures to above 35 degrees Celsius later this week, and the Dutch national weather institute issued a warning for “extreme weather” on Tuesday, urging people to take precautions. Water in important rivers such as the Rhine and Ijssel, which depend on rain and snow, has fallen below critical levels, severely limiting cargo traffic, as ships can only be used for a fraction of their normal capacity to keep them afloat. “Many large ships can now only take half to a third of their normal loads,” Joost Sitskoorn of Evofenedex, the Dutch association for logistical companies, told Reuters. “A lot more ships are needed to meet demand. Overcapacity helped counter this problem for a while, but the supply is starting to dry up.”  This could lead to shortages in a range of goods, with building materials, cattle feed and barley and hop for beer brewers first in line, Sitskoorn said. Roughly a third of all goods transported in the Netherlands move over water, with the sector carrying a total load of 365.7 billion kg last year, mostly to and from elsewhere in Europe. Over half of the freight is in the form of bulk goods, such as iron ore, sand, gravel and cement, which are impossible to shift to the road for transport, as it takes some 30 trucks to replace only one small cargo ship. “I really fear for a situation in which the current low water levels persist,” said Pim van Baaren, director of the Van Nieuwpoort Group, a large supplier of building materials in the Netherlands. “We can manage for now, but mainly because many builders are away for the holidays.”  Transport costs have already risen by 30 percent, Van Baaren said, while the demand for the limited amount of ships available is rapidly driving up prices. The long, hot summer caused new obstacles on Tuesday when Amsterdam closed two important shipping routes through its canals, as it could not sufficiently cool its iron bridges to open them for ships. This caught several shippers off guard, as they were suddenly cut off from their customers. “We had to reroute a ship filled with cement for an important customer from the south of Amsterdam to the north, and they had to shut their factory in the south as we couldn’t reach them,” Van Baaren said.

2018-07-24,"(Adds details, background) ISTANBUL, July 24 (Reuters) - Turkey has told American officials it opposes U.S. sanctions on Iran and is not obliged to implement them, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday. President Donald Trump has pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran and ordered U.S. sanctions on Tehran, while a senior State Department official said Washington has told allies to cut imports of Iranian oil by November Turkey has criticised Trump’s move to withdraw from the nuclear pact and has publicly resisted the U.S. call to cut oil imports from Iran. “We do not have to adhere to the sanctions imposed on a country by another country. We don’t find the sanctions right either,” Cavusoglu told a news conference in Azerbaijan. “We held meetings with the United States in Ankara and told them openly: Turkey gets oil and gas from Azerbaijan, Iran, Russia and Iraq. If I don’t buy from Iran now, where am I supposed to meet that need from?” Cavusoglu said. Last week U.S. Treasury and State Department officials met Turkish counterparts in Ankara to discuss sanctions on Iran. Ankara said authorities were working to prevent Turkey being hurt by the measures. Turkey depends on imports for almost all of its energy needs. In the first four months of this year, Turkey bought more than 3 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran, almost 55 percent of its total crude supplies, according to data from the Turkish energy watchdog (EPDK). Ties between Ankara and Washington, NATO allies, have been strained over a host of issues including several legal cases. A Turkish court last week ruled to keep American pastor Andrew Brunson in jail, in a case that has deepened existing rifts and jeopardised the procurement of Lockheed Martin F-35 jets by Turkey. The U.S. Senate passed a bill last month including a measure that prohibits Turkey from buying the jets because of Brunson’s imprisonment and Turkey’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 air defence system, which are incompatible with NATO systems. Cavusoglu, however, said there were no issues with the procurement of the jets and the United States could not exclude Turkey from the project. “The United States needs to understand that it is not possible to get a result from Turkey through sanctions. They will see results if they approach Turkey with dialogue and respect,” he said. “We will not bow down to such pressures, sanctions or threats. Everyone will get used to the new Turkey.” (Reporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Tuvan Gumrukcu Editing by Humeyra Pamuk and Dominic Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iran-turkey/update-1-turkey-told-u-s-it-opposes-sanctions-on-iran-foreign-minister-idUKL5N1UK5UQ,24 Jul 2018,"Turkey has told American

2018-07-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shale gas developer Cuadrilla on Tuesday became the first operator in Britain to receive final consent from the government to frack an onshore horizontal exploration well, paving the way for commercial production. The government said it had granted approval for so-called hydraulic fracturing to take place at Cuadrilla’s Preston New Road site in northwest England. “I have carefully considered Cuadrilla’s application and I am content that hydraulic fracturing consent should be granted in this instance,” Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said in a statement. Hydraulic fracturing consent was introduced in 2015 as an additional step to the government’s regulatory and permitting regime and ensures all necessary environmental, health and safety permits have been obtained. Fracking involves perforating wells and fracturing rocks by injecting liquids, sands and chemicals to suck in oil and gas. Cuadrilla welcomed the government’s decision. “We now look forward to submitting a fracture consent application to (the government) for our second exploration well and moving on to fracture the shale rock and flow the natural gas which we believe will make a major contribution to reducing the UK’s gas imports and improving our environment and economy,” Cuadrilla Chief Executive Francis Egan said in a statement. Following fracking of the first two horizontal wells, Cuadrilla will run an initial flow test of the gas produced from both for about six months, the firm added. Weaning Britain off energy imports is one of the driving forces behind government support for fracking. In May, the government announced plans to speed up planning applications to support development of the country’s shale gas industry. Some of the proposed measures include approving  planning applications at a national rather than local level. The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could contain 1,329 trillion cubic feet of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years. However, it is impossible to know exactly how much shale gas might be underground - and more importantly, how much can be extracted - until fracking has started in earnest. Environmental groups continue to be strongly opposed to fracking, concerned about the potential seismic activity, water contamination and other unknowables.  The Scottish government has in effect banned fracking by ordering local authorities to reject planning applications from companies seeking to do shale gas exploration, after a public consultation found overwhelming opposition to it. Several other European countries have banned it. Other companies are vying to start fracking onshore in Britain. Third Energy, 95 percent owned by Barclays (BARC.L), is waiting for approval from the government to begin test fracking at its Kirby Misperton site in Yorkshire, northern England.

2018-07-24,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Gasoline prices in North Korea have nearly halved since late March, market data analyzed by Reuters shows, adding weight to suspicions that fuel is finding its way into the isolated economy from China and elsewhere despite U.N. sanctions. The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution in December to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.  But as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has moved to improve relations with the United States, China and South Korea, concerns have grown that the policy of “maximum pressure” through sanctions and isolation, is losing steam. Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to work toward denuclearization at their summit in Singapore on June 12. Experts say any fuel aid in breach of sanctions could erode the diplomatic progress. China said on Tuesday it strictly abided by U.N. sanctions, but indicated it may have resumed some fuel shipments to North Korea in the second quarter of this year. Gasoline was sold by private dealers in the North Korean capital Pyongyang at about $1.24 per kg as of Tuesday, down 33 percent from $1.86 per kg on June 5 and 44 percent from this year’s peak of $2.22 per kg on March 27, according to Reuters analysis of data compiled by the Daily NK website. Diesel prices are at $0.85 per kg, down about 17 percent from March. The website is run by North Korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with multiple traders in the North after cross-checks to corroborate their information, offering a rare glimpse into the livelihoods of ordinary North Koreans. In North Korea, gas is sold via informal channels such as street stalls and informal markets and by weight rather than by volume, as it is in South Korea, the United States and elsewhere, so North Koreans prefer to quote “per kg” rates, said Kang Mi-jin, who works at Daily NK. A 200 liter barrel of petrol holds around 180 kg. U.S. prices stand at around 75 cents per liter or $2.839 per gallon. “My assessment is that there was a greater inflow (of fuel supplies) from abroad, especially China since Kim’s trips there,” said Kang, who speaks regularly to sources inside North Korea. Kim first visited China to meet President Xi Jinping in March, and they held two more summits, in May and June. The latest fuel data comes amid mounting suspicion in Washington that North Korea may be using the recent diplomatic thaw to get a lifeline from China.  North Korea gets most of its fuel from China, its biggest trading partner, and some from Russia. Washington and Seoul officials have said the North imports some 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products and 2 million barrels of crude oil each year.  Last year’s U.N. resolution capped refined imports at 500,000 barrels a year. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Tuesday that China has consistently and strictly abided by U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea.  China had exported 7,432 tonnes of refined oil products to North Korea in the first six months of this year, out of a total of 60,000 tonnes a year stipulated by the U.N. sanctions. China had reported its exports to the Security Council’s sanctions committee in a timely manner, Geng added. “The relevant situation is totally open and transparent,” he said, without elaborating. Since official Chinese customs data showed no gasoline and diesel exports to North Korea from January to March, Geng’s comments suggested China resumed some shipments some time after Kim and Xi’s first meeting. Overall, China’s trade with North Korea in the first half of this year tumbled 56 percent on the back of the tightening sanctions, customs data showed on Monday. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of “illegally smuggling petroleum products into the country at a level that far exceeds quotas” established by the UN. “Illegal ship-to-ship transfers are the most prominent means by which this is happening. Every UN member state must step up enforcement,” he wrote on Twitter, without naming any country. China and Russia delayed a U.S. push last week for a UN Security Council panel to order a halt to refined petroleum exports to North Korea, asking for more detail on a U.S. accusation that Pyongyang breached sanctions, diplomats said. The United States provided a list to the committee earlier this month of 89 illicit North Korean transactions and a few select photos, seen by Reuters. Seoul’s foreign ministry said last week that the authorities were investigating two ships with Panama and Sierra Leone flags suspected to have illegally transferred North Korean coal into South Korea via Russia.  North Korean rice prices have also been stable since a spike last September, when the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions. Rice has hovered around $0.62 per kg throughout this year.  Stable fuel and rice prices suggest no immediate signs of major suffering in North Korea despite South Korea’s recent estimates the impoverished state’s economy contracted at its sharpest rate in two decades last year.  South Korea’s central bank said North Korea’s gross domestic product shrank 3.5 percent last year, marking the biggest decline since 1997, citing international sanctions and drought. While other defectors reported some suffering in remote rural regions, Daily NK’s Kang said fuel demand has been steady in North Korea, and overall living conditions have improved in line with a booming unofficial market economy.  The unofficial markets, known as jangmadang, have grown to account for about 60 percent of the economy, according to the Institute for Korean Integration of Society. “I’ve seen signs the economy was slowly improving over the past five years, and in last year things are still developing but perhaps not as fast as before,” a Western consultant who makes regular trips to North Korea told Reuters.  Kim, who vowed not to let the people “tighten their belt again” in his first-ever public speech in 2012, announced in April a shift in focus from nuclear programs to the economy. Analysts say that will be difficult while sanctions remain in place. “I don’t think there is an outcry in the markets now, but there could be one toward the end of this year,” said Kim Byeong-yeon, a North Korea economy specialist at the Seoul National University.

2018-07-24,"* Sonatrach in talks with BP, Shell, Vitol and others * Oil price drop after 2014, rising fuel bill behind move * Boston Consulting Group advising on strategy - sources By Ron Bousso, Julia Payne and Lamine Chikhi LONDON/ALGIERS, July 24 (Reuters) - Sonatrach is in talks with oil majors and trading firms to start a trading joint venture after the Algerian state energy company reached a deal this year to buy its first overseas refinery, its chief executive told Reuters. A decision on forming the venture had been expected at the end of July but could be delayed by a month, two sources said. “The foreign firm will have small shares in the trade joint venture,” Sonatrach CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour told Reuters in Algiers. Potential partners, which have held talks with Sonatrach in recent weeks, include BP, Total, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Repsol and Vitol , the world’s biggest independent oil trader, the sources said. Vitol, BP and Shell declined to comment. Total, Chevron and Repsol did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sonatrach’s expansion into refining and trading reflects a shift among national oil companies that for decades focussed on producing oil and gas, while leaving marketing to third parties. Sonatrach’s move to form a venture is one of several steps aimed at easing the burden of its hefty fuel import bill that tripled year-on-year in 2017 to a record $2.5 billion. It signed a contract this year with Vitol to receive products in exchange for crude, the first such deal in decades, and said in May it had agreed to buy ExxonMobil’s 175,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy. One of the aims of Sonatrach’s new venture would be to supply crude to the Italian refinery and help manage the sale of oil products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to Algeria and other markets, the sources said. Traders said the refinery mainly processes sour crude grades now and would need adjustment to take light, sweet oil from Algeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that produces a little more than 1 million bpd. Boston Consulting Group was advising Sonatrach on its long-term strategy, the sources said. A spokeswoman for BCG declined to comment. Since Kaddour’s appointment in 2017, the CEO has sought to resolve disputes with foreign oil firms, such as a deal reached in February with Italy’s Saipem to end a row over four gas projects. He has also worked to cut new commercial deals, such as signing an agreement to build a petrochemical plant with Total and working on plans with ExxonMobil for possible shale oil production in Algeria. Other Middle East producers have already sought to build up trading divisions to boost income after oil prices plunged, from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016. Benchmark Brent futures are now trading at about $73 a barrel. Saudi Aramco’s trading arm announced that it was expanding business into non-Saudi crudes and would open European and Asian offices. Iraq’s state oil firm started a venture with the trading arm of Russia’s Lukoil last year and Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC said in April it was setting up a trading arm. Kuwait Petroleum Corp (IPO-KUWP.KW), another state-owned firm, has also studied setting up a trading venture. Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar and Shadia Nasralla in

Wall Street was set for a short climb when it reopens, with Google-parent Alphabet, part of the so-called FAANG stocks, expected to jump almost 5 percent after a better-than-expected quarterly revenue jump. Metals prices were also sharply higher thanks to the stimulus signals in Beijing, while global bonds were still sluggish following speculation that the Bank of Japan may soon trim its massive stimulus. The euro had nosed higher on solid German manufacturing data and though the dollar was having a largely quiet day there were plenty of jarring moves in emerging markets to raise the pulse rate. Turkey’s lira slid more than 3 percent along with its main stock market after its central bank opted to keep interest rates on hold despite double-digit inflation that would best be tackled via a big rate hike. China’s offshore yuan meanwhile had hit a one-year low and Beijing’s government bond yields had jumped after the cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions. “The big story is that the Chinese currency continues to slide,” said Societe Generale FX strategist Alvin Tan. “It is clear the government is moving towards policies that are supporting growth,” he adding, saying the trend was likely to bring a reaction from the United States in time. For now though the focus in the U.S. remains the banner corporate earnings season. To date, 82 percent of the 90 S&P 500 companies that have posted results had topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts estimate of profit growth have risen to about 22 percent for the second quarter, up from 20.7 percent at the start of the month. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 percent, as European bourses continued to shuffle higher. Tech stocks were set to get a boost from Alphabet, the parent of Google, which was up 4.6 percent in premarket trading  a record high, valuing the group at around $900 billion. Other FAANG stocks also rose. Facebook climbed 1.9 percent, while Amazon gained 1.4 percent. Twitter gained 0.9 percent. European stocks were also up, partly thanks to some upbeat results from UBS, autos firm PSA and chipmaker AMS, higher metals prices and renewed signs of strength in Germany’s powerful manufacturing sector. But they were also just riding in the slipstream of Asia’s and Wall Street’s overnight gains. Shanghai blue chips had closed up 1.5 percent at a one-month high and Japan’s Nikkei had added 0.5 percent, even though a disappointing reading on factory activity suggested the threat of a trade war was starting to bite. Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to scaling back its monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally. Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett. “The 10-basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1 basis point,” she said. “It reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.” As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered around their highest in five weeks at 2.95 percent, and were again nearing the 3 percent mark. Germany’s government bond yields rose to a five-week high of 0.416 percent. Most other euro zone yields were higher by 1-3 basis points. “Global stocks, Asian stocks in particular have seen a boost from (potential) policy-easing measures in China, and this helps the general risk sentiment and adds to some of the headwinds to bond markets,” said Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann. Part of the shift in yields was caused by talk that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth, due on Friday, would top current forecasts of 4.1 percent. Dealers noted some media reports that President Donald Trump was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds, given the widely-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualised 4.5 percent. Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate increases from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely moved at 94.56 compared with a low of 94.207 on Monday. It bought 111.19 yen, against Monday’s trough of 110.75. The euro stalled to $1.1695, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight. Turkey’s lira was still down 3 percent after the inaction from its central bank was seen as a missed chance to get some much-needed credibility. In commodity markets, oil prices were a shade firmer as the focus flicked between oversupply worries and escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. U.S. crude added 24 cents to $68.12. Brent edged up 10 cents to $73.17 a barrel. Spot gold was barely budged at $1,224 an ounce. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Abhinav

2018-07-24,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft’s (ROSN.MM) $1.4 billion lawsuit against the ExxonMobil-led (XOM.N) Sakhalin-1 consortium relates to a row over how oil should be shared between the Sakhalin-1 concession and an adjacent Rosneft field, court papers show. By bringing the legal action, Rosneft is taking on one of its closest foreign partners: Rosneft and ExxonMobil have multiple joint projects. But Rosneft and its powerful boss Igor Sechin have a track record of assertively fighting their corner in commercial disputes.  Rosneft filed the suit in the Sakhalin district arbitration court in Russia’s far east, accusing the consortium of unjust enrichment, an allegation the consortium denied. Rosneft did not disclose the exact nature of the dispute. According to court documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, the court asked Rosneft to present documents related to an agreement over the “cross-flows” of oil from the Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft. The Northern Chayvo field is adjacent to the concession area controlled by the Sakhalin-1 consortium. It is commonplace in the oil industry for extraction activities on one concession to influence oil flows on a neighbouring permit, because the oil lies in rock formations that straddle two or more permits. “Since oil cross-flows can be determined by an examination, most disagreements between companies of this nature are resolved out of court by negotiation,” Aton, a Russian brokerage, said in a research note. Asked whether the suit concerned a dispute over “cross-flows” between the Sakhalin and Rosneft permits, a Rosneft spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Sakhalin-1 is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and India’s ONGC (ONGC.NS) control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent. Production at Sakhalin-1 stands at around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). Northern Chayvo was forecast by Rosneft to produce 30,000 bpd at its peak when it was launched in September 2014. Rosneft has said the field’s production fell by 42 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to around 21,000 bpd. Rosneft’s suit against the Sakhalin-1 project seeks to recover funds gained by parties between July 10, 2015, and May 31, 2018, through “unjust enrichment and interest gained by using other people’s money”, according to court documents. It was not clear from the court documents whether the dispute over “cross-flows” was central to Rosneft’s suit against the Sakhalin consortium, or just part of it.  There is other evidence that the issue has been on Rosneft’s radar.  According to the Russian state procurement database, Rosneft in November 2017 commissioned energy auditing firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton to conduct an audit of “cross-flows” of oil and gas condensate between Northern Chayvo and the oilfield developed by the Sakhalin-1 consortium. INTER-CORPORATE CONFLICTS Rosneft, presided over by Sechin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is no stranger to inter-corporate conflicts.  In a recent case, it won 100 billion roubles in a legal settlement with industrial conglomerate AFK Sistema (AFKS.MM) over a mid-sized oil company which Rosneft acquired from the firm. Sergei Saveliev, a partner at law firm Saveliev, Batanov & Partners, which specialises in corporate conflicts, said disputes over “cross-flows” happened quite often in the oil and gas industry. “Oil flows from one block to another, one side is taking the other’s oil. Usually this is regulated through certain agreements, using some metrics,” he said. “In this case, either there has been no agreement, or they couldn’t agree on the metrics.” An industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rosneft may be using the case as a bargaining chip to extract a concession from Exxon on one of their joint projects. “Maybe they need some concessions. Rosneft has always perceived Exxon as a partner. They had joint projects in the United States and Canada, they want to enter Mozambique ... they have plans for a liquefied natural gas plant in the far east (of Russia),” the source said. Exxon Neftegaz, the Sakhalin-1 operator, said it was “aware of the court action, rejects the claims and will take action to defend the rights of the Sakhalin-1 consortium”. A Sodeco spokesman declined to comment. ONGC Videsh Ltd’s managing director N.K. Verma declined to comment.

The Saudi index shed 0.5 percent, as companies such as Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co and National Industrialization Company weighed on the index. Saudi Kayan published its second-quarter financial results on Sunday, showing a net profit of 878.7 million riyals ($234.30 million), up from 242 million riyals during the same period a year earlier. The results were well above average analysts’ expectations of 470 million riyals. The company, a subsidiary of petrochemical giant SABIC, jumped after the results publication and was up 6.2 percent on Monday. Another petrochemical, National Industrialization Company (Tasnee), dropped 3.3 percent on Tuesday, despite posting an increase in second-quarter net profit on Monday, to 295.8 million riyals from 93.6 million riyals a year earlier. Saudi banks such as Saudi British Bank (SABB) and Arab National Bank were up. SABB, which gained 1.5 percent, proposed a cash dividend of 0.96 riyals per share for the first half of the year. Arab National Bank was up 0.3 percent after announcing on Tuesday a second-quarter profit increase to 919.1 million riyals, from 849 million riyals last year. In a research note, Arqaam Capital said Arab National Bank stocks were attractive because of “stronger visibility on earnings, improving corporate appetite, and room to optimise funding base”. In Dubai, where the index shed 0.2 percent, trading volume was concentrated on Drake and Scull International (DSI) . The company has been lagging because of concerns about its financial position, business outlook and the outcome of an investigation by United Arab Emirates authorities into financial violations by previous management.

2018-07-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Brent crude futures prices are trading in contango for the first time in 10 months, as traders anticipate an increase in crude availability during the remainder of 2018. The Brent calendar spread for the first six months slumped into a contango of 43 cents per barrel on Monday, from a backwardation of $3.50 as recently as April 26. Brent futures are trading in contango for the four contracts closest to delivery, from September 2018 through January 2019. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2JP7ykb) Hedge funds and other money managers have sold a large number of long positions in recent weeks, depressing the front-end of the curve. Portfolio managers tend to hold a majority of their positions in contracts close to expiry because that’s where the liquidity is normally greatest. Just as position-building by the hedge funds spurred the rise in spot prices and calendar spreads in the second half of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, liquidation is now accelerating the correction. More fundamentally, traders have reacted to pledges of increased output and exports from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have responded to pressure from the United States to counter rising prices by increasing their production. Extra barrels have been loaded in June and July, with more promised in August, ensuring increased availability in the second half of the year. Fears about slower consumption growth as a result of a strengthening dollar and the intensifying trade conflict between the United States and China are also weighing on oil prices. Because the oil market is forward-looking, concerns about the strength of consumption growth later in 2018 and 2019 are being discounted back to lower oil prices in the near-term. Spot prices and calendar spreads both exhibit cyclical behaviour at all scales from very short-term (seconds, minutes and days) to longer time horizons (months, quarters and years). In addition to the principal boom-bust cycle in the oil industry, the time series shows smaller epicycles operating at every scale. The recent softening of both spot prices and calendar spreads marks the turning of an epicycle underway since mid-2017. The Brent calendar spread surged from $2.15 contango on June 30, 2017, to $3.50 backwardation on April 26, 2018, before easing down to 43 cents contango on July 23. Over the same period, hedge fund net long positions in Brent soared from 200 million barrels at the end of June 2017 to peak at 612 million barrels in April 2018 and have now been reduced to 353 million. The recent softening in spot prices and spreads arguably marks the ending of another epicycle that dates even further back to the start of the cyclical upswing in 2015/2016. During the recoveries after the last two oil market slumps, dating from 1998 and 2009, spot prices rose for 21 and 26 months respectively before reaching their first major peak, and spreads rose for 21 and 34 months. In the current expansion, spot prices have risen for around 28 months, reaching their first major peak in May 2018, while spreads have widened for around 39 months, peaking in April 2018. The current expansion is already relatively mature by most measures and has reabsorbed most if not all the slack inherited from the 2014/15 slump. Rising prices have started to force a series of mid-cycle adjustments, including a rapid increase in output from U.S. shale firms and OPEC. The higher prices will likely cause a slowdown in consumption growth, though this may not be evident for some months, given the longer delays in the collection and publication of demand-side data. Fuel prices in many fast-growing emerging markets are hitting record levels, passing previous peaks in 2007-2008 and 2011-2014, as a result of a stronger dollar and the reduction of subsidies. Experience suggests the ending of an epicycle need not mark the overall peak of the oil market cycle. But whether the current softening in spot prices and spreads turns out to be a temporary pause before the market starts tightening again or a cyclical peak depends critically on what happens with the global economy. There is now almost no cyclical slack in the oil market, with stocks and spare capacity low. If consumption growth remains brisk it will eventually drive spot prices and spreads higher again to enforce rebalancing. But macroeconomic distortions and imbalances are starting to accumulate around the world, in a reprise of the end of previous cycles. Business cycle expansions in the United States and around the rest of the world are relatively mature. Economies are running out of cyclical slack and inflationary pressures are rising. Interest rates are rising and the U.S. dollar is appreciating against almost all other major currencies. The United States is still experiencing a strong cyclical expansion, but the combination of tax cuts and rising interest rates is causing significant currency appreciation, threatening to worsen the trade deficit. Most other advanced economies have shown signs of slowing growth during the first half of 2018, and international trade volumes have started to grow more slowly. Emerging markets are threatened once again by a combination of rising interest rates, a strengthening dollar and escalating oil prices – a cocktail that has proved dangerous in the past. None of these distortions is easy to resolve; in the past, they have often preceded a macroeconomic slowdown, with a resulting slowdown in oil consumption growth. If the United States tries to deal with its growing trade deficit by successfully pushing to weaken the dollar, it is likely to send nominal oil prices surging and reawaken concerns about inflation. If, on the other hand, the dollar appreciates further, the resulting increase in local fuel costs will hit consumers in the other advanced economies and emerging markets hard, putting downward pressure on crude prices.

2018-07-24,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China steel output vs. price: reut.rs/2LhmJE7 By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 24 (Reuters) - China’s vast steel sector is currently a study in contrasts, with record output despite ongoing production curbs, and high prices even though there is mounting concern about the demand outlook. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile the seemingly contradictory signals being sent by China’s steel industry, which accounts for about half of the world’s total production. China produced 80.2 million tonnes of crude steel in June, slightly below May’s record 81.13 million tonnes, according to official data released last week. However, June’s daily output was a record 2.67 million tonnes, the third month in a row that daily production has scaled new highs. The sharp increase this year in steel output has come despite increasing moves to restrict production in order to curb pollution. The top steel-making city of Tangshen ordered steel mills to shut sintering plants for five days from July 13 to 18, the latest in a line of measures aimed at reducing air pollution. What is clear is that pollution-related production curbs are having no overall impact on steel output. Steel mills outside the northeast region, where the bulk of the curbs have been enacted, have been able to ramp up production, resulting in a geographical shift of output. Producers have also been maximising the efficiency of their blast furnaces by using higher grades of iron ore, allowing them to make more steel without a corresponding increase in emissions. The question becomes how much longer can this situation persist? Can steel output keep rising in the face of ongoing pollution control measures, which are in place in three major steel producing regions. Despite the closure of older and less efficient furnaces, and the likelihood this will continue in the coming years, China still has ample spare capacity, and is able to make more than 1 billion tonnes of steel annually. Production in the first six months of this year was 451.2 million tonnes, putting China on target to produce a record of more than 900 million tonnes in 2018. Steel mills are being encouraged to produce as much as possible by strong margins and the expectation that stricter curbs will be imposed this winter than those that were enforced during the past winter. Steel rebar futures in Shanghai rose above 4,000 yuan ($587) a tonne during Tuesday’s trading, the first time they reached this level since September last year. At this price, most Chinese steel mills will be making profits in the region of 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan a tonne, which would be the strongest margins the industry has enjoyed in several years. With output robust, the question becomes what is happening to all the steel being produced. It’s not being added to visible inventories, with stocks tracked by consultancy Shanghai Steelhome SH-TOT-RBARINV falling consistently since March, dropping to 4.22 million tonnes in the week to July 23. This is down from the recent peak of 9.78 million tonnes in the week to March 16, and inventories are currently at their lowest since late January. The steel isn’t being exported either, with shipments of products in the first six months dropping 13.2 percent from the same period in 2017 to 35.4 million tonnes, according to customs data. Domestic demand has been driven by construction and manufacturing growth, but overall economic growth of 6.7 percent, as reported for the second quarter, isn’t so strong as to justify the sharp increase in steel output in recent months. It’s likely that at some point in the second half steel output will decline, either as the market becomes oversupplied or as pollution restrictions mount, or even a combination of both. The rising trade tensions between the United States and China may also crimp steel demand to some extent, but this is still an unquantifiable risk.

2018-07-24,"PARIS, July 24 (Reuters) - Strong oil prices and a spike in demand has allowed Avril’s biodiesel plants to run at full capacity since June but Argentine imports could force the European Union’s largest biodiesel maker to return to part-time work, its CEO said on Tuesday. Europe’s biodiesel industry has been struggling since the EU reduced duties on imports from Argentina last year after Buenos Aires mounted a successful challenge at the World Trade Organisation. Avril implemented a six-month plan to reduce production at its oilseed processing unit Saipol in March, blaming huge Argentine biodiesel imports for exacerbating poor market conditions. “We will renew the part-time work for another six months because even though there is some progress, Argentine biodiesel is still coming massively into Europe every month,” Avril Chief Executive Jean-Philippe Puig told Reuters. European producers are hoping that the European Commission will implement new taxes on biodiesel imports in September following renewed allegations that Argentina unfairly subsidised its biofuel sector. “For the moment we are running at full capacity but how long this will last, I have no idea,” Puig said. Saipol found sufficient demand to run at full capacity for another two months, he said. Oil prices have surged in recent months, mainly supported by U.S. sanctions on Iran increasing fears of tight supplies. Higher oil prices improve margins for biofuel makers. Prices have also been supported by buyers starting to cover their biodiesel needs for next year in anticipation of higher prices following a new EU tax. Industry sources said earlier this month that the threat of tariffs already halted Argentine biofuel sales to the EU, adding that imposing a tax would leave 85 percent of the country’s biofuel exports without a viable market. Avril produced of 1.4 million tonnes of biodiesel in 2017, from a capacity of 1.8 million. Production was expected to fall this year due to the reduced output implemented in March but the recent pick-up should allow it to make up for most of the shortfall, Puig said. The increase in biodiesel demand was also linked to growing diesel consumption and rising blending mandates in some EU countries, Puig also said. (Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide.

2018-07-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tighter rules on shipping emissions around China’s coastlines from the start of next year is a clear sign the world’s No. 2 economy will strive for 100 percent compliance when the global sulfur emissions cap starts in 2020, consultants Wood Mackenzie said on Tuesday. On July 9, China’s Ministry of Transport announced it would extend its emission control areas (ECAs) to include the country’s entire coastline from 2019.  China’s ECAs limit the sulfur content of fuel ships can burn while operating in the ECAs to 0.5 percent. “China’s stricter policies for marine fuel specifications will undoubtedly play an important part in meeting the International Maritime Organization (IMO) global sulfur cap,” said Wood Mackenzie consultant Yujiao Lei.  In a global effort to combat air pollution from the shipping industry, the IMO ruled it will cut the sulfur content of the fuel that ships can burn to 0.5 percent by January 2020, from 3.5 percent currently. But questions around how the IMO will implement the rules and ensure compliance have given rise to uncertainty since they were announced in 2016.     Yet China’s role in the world’s shipping market for commodities and containers, as well as the large number of international and domestic vessels calling at its ports, “the new regulations could be significant,” said Wood Mackenzie consultant Yujiao Lei. For shippers, however, the impact of the new ECAs is expected to be limited over the near term.  “China’s ECA extension in 2019 will have minimal impact (for sea zones) since a majority of marine traffic is currently concentrated in the existing ECAs,” said Lei.  Also, China’s ECAs only reach 12 nautical miles out to sea, and ships generally tend to slow down as they near the coast, so fuel consumption in these areas is minimal, said Lei. There will be more upside for diesel demand from China’s coastal areas later in 2020, when the IMO global sulfur cap takes effect, said Lei. China’s ECA extensions come amid government efforts to turn some of its major ports in to marine refueling, or bunkering, hubs by setting up free-trade zones in Zhoushan and Hainan.  “By generating this demand, the Chinese government is not only creating a bunkering industry but also providing a solution for its refining industry’s diesel surplus,” said Lei.    These ambitions could come at the expense of Singapore, the world’s largest marine refueling hub. “Additional marine fuel demand in China to meet IMO regulations will also put the country very close to Singapore in terms of total marine fuel demand,” said Lei.  “We expect 90,000 barrels per day (around 5 million tonnes) of bunker demand to shift from Singapore to China in 2020 for international shipping,” said Lei.

2018-07-24,"(Reuters) - Iran will react with equal countermeasures if Washington tries to block its oil exports, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday, while the Islamic Republic’s armed forces chief said U.S. threats would draw an “unimaginable and regrettable” reaction. U.S. officials are stepping up diplomatic efforts to pressure countries to stop importing Iranian oil. “If America wants to take a serious step in this direction it will definitely be met with a reaction and equal countermeasures from Iran,” foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday backed President Hassan Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran might block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped.  Already fraught relations between Tehran and Washington have worsened in recent days. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said on Tuesday that Iran wants peace but will defend its interests in the Gulf. “As the dominant power in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, (Iran) has been the guarantor of the security of shipping and the global economy in this vital waterway and has the strength to take action against any scheme in this region,” Bagheri said. On Monday, Iran dismissed an angry warning from President Donald Trump that it risked dire consequences “the like of which few throughout history have suffered before” if it made threats against the United States. Bagheri said that U.S. threats against Iran will draw a “strong, unimaginable and regrettable” response from Tehran, according to the IRNA news agency. “As our president correctly pointed out, the enemies, particularly America, whose centres of interest are within reach of the visible and hidden defence forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, should not play with the lion’s tail,” Bagheri said in a statement, according to IRNA. “Because they will receive a strong, unimaginable and regrettable response of great magnitude in the region and the world.” Separately, Iran’s parliamentary speaker on Tuesday described Trump’s comments as “the words of a troublemaker”. “The United States is experiencing disorder and wildness in its diplomatic relations,” Ali Larijani was quoted as saying by IRNA. Iran has faced the threat of U.S. sanctions since Trump decided in May to withdraw the United States from a 2015 agreement between world powers and Iran over its disputed nuclear programme.

2018-07-24,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - A drought and heat wave in Europe this summer could cause a shortage of potatoes big enough for industrial production of French fries, a German industry group warned on Tuesday. Potato crop yields might be cut by at least 25 percent, the group said. Large size potatoes needed by food processors for production of French fries are even now looking rare. “The continuing dryness and heat means the potato harvest in Germany and Europe will be considerably lower and poorer than last year,” said the German Association of the Fruit, Vegetable and Potato Processing Industry BOGK. “The result is that a significant tightening of raw material supplies and a reduction in quality is foreseen,” the association said. “The result could be supply problems for the popular potato-processing products such as French fries.” The rain urgently needed by potato crops is not forecast, and the picture is worsening week by week, the association said. Drought has also caused major damage to Germany’s grains harvest. Low water after dry weather also means ships on the Rhine and Danube rivers are unable to sail fully loaded.

2018-07-24,"MOSCOW, July 24 (Reuters) - Russian oil major Rosneft’s $1.4 billion lawsuit against the ExxonMobil-led Sakhalin-1 consortium relates to a row over how oil should be shared between the Sakhalin-1 concession and an adjacent Rosneft field, court papers show. Rosneft filed the suit in the Sakhalin district arbitration court in Russia’s far east, accusing the consortium of unjust enrichment, an allegation the consortium denied. Rosneft did not disclose the exact nature of the dispute. According to court documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday, the court asked Rosneft to present documents related to an agreement over the “cross-flows” of oil from the Northern Chayvo oilfield, controlled by Rosneft. The Northern Chayvo field is adjacent to the concession area controlled by the Sakhalin-1 consortium. It is commonplace in the oil industry for extraction activities on one concession to influence oil flows on a neighbouring permit, because the oil lies in rock formations that straddle two or more permits. “Since oil cross-flows can be determined by an examination, most disagreements between companies of this nature are resolved out of court by negotiation,” Aton, a Russian brokerage, said in a research note. Asked whether the suit concerned a dispute over “cross-flows” between the Sakhalin and Rosneft permits, a Rosneft spokeswoman said the company had no comment. Sakhalin-1 is operated by Exxon Neftegaz Ltd, through which ExxonMobil owns 30 percent in the project. Rosneft and India’s ONGC control 20 percent each. Japanese consortium Sodeco owns 30 percent. Production at Sakhalin-1 stands at around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). Northern Chayvo was forecast by Rosneft to produce 30,000 bpd at its peak when it was launched in September 2014. Rosneft has said the field’s production fell by 42 percent in the first quarter of 2018 to around 21,000 bpd. Rosneft’s suit against the Sakhalin-1 project seeks to recover funds gained by parties between July 10, 2015, and May 31, 2018, through “unjust enrichment and interest gained by using other people’s money”, according to court documents. It was not clear from the court documents whether the dispute over “cross-flows” was central to Rosneft’s suit against the Sakhalin consortium, or just part of it. There is other evidence that the issue has been on Rosneft’s radar. According to the Russian state procurement database, Rosneft in November 2017 commissioned energy auditing firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton to conduct an audit of “cross-flows” of oil and gas condensate between Northern Chayvo and the oilfield developed by the Sakhalin-1 consortium. Rosneft has confirmed it lodged the suit. Exxon Neftegaz, the Sakhalin-1 operator, said it was “aware of the court action, rejects the claims and will take action to defend the rights of the Sakhalin-1 consortium”. A Sodeco spokesman declined to comment, saying Exxon is representing the Sakhalin-1 project. ONGC was not immediately available for comment. Japanese trade and industry minister Hiroshige Seko told a news conference on Tuesday that his ministry will collect details on the lawsuit and closely look at negotiations between the parties involved. A ministry official said the lawsuit would not affect Japan’s purchases of Russian oil, which accounted for about 6 percent of the country’s oil imports in 2017.

2018-07-24,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, is offering incentives to developers of a new 100 percent palm oil-based “green diesel”, which the net oil importer hopes can replace costly fuel imports within three years, the country’s industry minister said. Biodiesel for land transportation in Indonesia currently consists of a 20 percent bio component that is mixed with petroleum diesel. That component is expected to be raised to 30 percent in 2020. In Indonesia, the bio portion of biodiesel is made with fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from palm oil, but efforts to increase FAME concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from regulators as well as the automotive and oil industries. While biodiesel can cut fuel costs and reduce emissions, higher blends of FAME require special handling and equipment as the fuel has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gasket materials, and it can solidify at cold temperatures. But according to Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesia has found a new way to produce biodiesel that is not based on FAME that can avoid these problems.  “We already have a prototype and in three years we will be ready to produce it,” Hartarto told Reuters in an interview last week. “Green diesel” made completely from palm oil has “the same specifications as petrol” and is compliant with the Euro IV emissions standard, said Hartarto, who chairs the country’s second-biggest political party, Golkar. A biorefinery owned by Elevance Renewable Sciences and Wilmar International is currently producing “green diesel” in a pilot project, and has been given a corporate tax discount to develop full-scale output, Hartarto said. Modifications to engines and machinery “wouldn’t be needed because its specifications are the same as (B20) biodiesel,” he added. “It’s actually better than conventional fuel.” According to Lila Harsyah Bakhtiar, an official at the industry ministry, green diesel is made using hydrotreated vegetable oil, a technology that is expensive to develop but which could avoid disruptions to automakers who were “angry” over repeated changes to the FAME-based biodiesel mix. Elevance and Wilmar did not reply to requests for comments. According to its website, Elevance uses a patented process at its refinery in Gresik, East Java, to produce 180,000 tonnes of modified triglyceride, unsaturated methyl esters and olefins per year. Indonesia’s biodiesel program was already reducing Indonesia’s fuel import demand by $21 million per day, Hartarto said, adding that green diesel can “help (improve) our trade balance, and strengthen the rupiah while creating jobs.” Southeast Asia’s largest economy is among the region’s most vulnerable to external factors due to its sizeable current account deficit and its large fuel imports. Because of that, the rupiah has been among the hardest hit this year as investors have sold emerging market assets. Indonesia has been pushing increases in domestic palm oil consumption to cushion a possible slowdown in export demand. The European Union last month agreed to phase out the use of palm oil in transport fuels from 2030 because of deforestation concerns. Indonesia’s auto industries lobby group GAIKINDO has previously said increasing biodiesel blends can increase fuel consumption and may lead to engines overheating. Hartarto asserted that green diesel generated 90 percent fewer emissions than conventional fossil fuels. However, a 2015 study funded by the European Commission found that among vegetable oils, palm and soybean oils generated the highest indirect greenhouse gas emissions because of deforestation and the drainage of peatlands associated with their cultivation. Indonesia is expected to consume 3.2 million to 3.3 million kilolitres of FAME this year, below an earlier target of 3.5 million kilolitres, according to the Indonesia Estate Crop Fund.  The Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association expects unblended biodiesel exports to reach 800,000 kilolitres this year.

2018-07-24,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp expects to report its best quarter since 2013, based on Reuters calculations on a company forecast, boosted by a “favorable” downstream refining business and resurgent crude oil prices.  The state oil major and China’s top refiner, usually known as Sinopec, said in a statement it expects first-half net profit to rise by 50 percent from 27.1 billion yuan ($3.98 billion) in the same period a year ago. That would be 40.65 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculations and the highest on records back to 2013. On a quarterly basis, that would be 21.9 billion yuan, the highest for Sinopec since the third quarter 2013, records show. “The global crude oil prices increased year-on-year in H1, and company’s upstream business improved substantially,” the company said in the statement, adding that it has seen favorable mid- and downstream business results.  Oil topped $80 a barrel in May for the first time since 2014, boosted by OPEC-led output cuts and falling Venezuelan and Libyan output, as well as by an imminent drop in Iranian exports as U.S. sanctions return.  The bumper results also come as state oil refiners have exported record volumes of diesel and gasoline, grabbing a bigger share of the market as smaller independent refiners struggle with tough new taxes, a government-led environmental crackdown and crippling costs from the higher crude oil.  Sinopec, offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd and China’s largest oil producer PetroChina will publish their final first-half results in August.

2018-07-24,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt said on Saturday it was raising the price of natural gas for home and commercial use by up to 75 percent, the latest move in an IMF-backed austerity programme that has left many Egyptians struggling to make ends meet. The increases follow hikes to fuel, electricity and public transport prices that are part of a $12 billion IMF loan programme signed in 2016 that aims to lure back investors and lift the economy battered by political turmoil since 2011. The government statement published in the Official Gazette said that, effective Aug. 1, the price for consuming up to 30 cubic metres of gas had been set at 0.175 Egyptian pounds ($0.0098) per cubic metre, up from 0.100 pounds. The price for consuming between 30 and 60 cubic metres was set at 0.250 pounds, up from 0.175 pounds, while consumption of more than 60 cubic metres was set at 0.300 pounds from 0.225 pounds. The statement did not specify the timeframes over which the consumption levels apply. But officials said they covered the usual billing period, which is monthly in Egypt. Price hikes under the three-year IMF programme helped drive up Egypt’s annual urban consumer inflation rate to 14.4 percent in June. Analysts said the impact of cutting energy subsidies was feeding through to the broader economy faster than expected.

2018-07-24,"* Gasoline prices in Pyongyang show sharp decline since March * Defector sees increased Chinese supplies after summits * Pompeo accused North of smuggling petrol above U.N. quotas By Hyonhee Shin SEOUL, July 24 (Reuters) - Gasoline prices in North Korea have nearly halved since late March, market data analysed by Reuters shows, adding weight to suspicions that fuel is finding its way into the isolated economy from China and elsewhere despite U.N. sanctions. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution in December to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes. But as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has moved to improve relations with the United States, China and South Korea, concerns have grown that the policy of “maximum pressure” through sanctions and isolation, is losing steam. Gasoline was sold by private dealers in the capital Pyongyang at about $1.24 per kg as of Tuesday, down 33 percent from $1.86 per kg on June 5 and 44 percent from this year’s peak of $2.22 per kg on March 27, according to Reuters analysis of data compiled by the Daily NK website. Diesel prices are at $0.85 per kg, down about 17 percent from March. The website is run by North Korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with traders in the North. “My assessment is that there was a greater inflow (of fuel supplies) from abroad, especially China since Kim’s trips there,” said Kang Mi-jin, who works at Daily NK and speaks regularly to sources inside North Korea. Kim first visited China to meet President Xi Jinping in March, and they held two more summits, in May and June. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused North Korea of “illegally smuggling petroleum products into the country at a level that far exceeds quotas” established by the United Nations. “Illegal ship-to-ship transfers are the most prominent means by which this is happening. Every UN member state must step up enforcement,” he wrote on Twitter, without naming any country. North Korea gets most of its fuel from China, its biggest trading partner, and some from Russia. Washington and Seoul officials have said the North imports some 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products and two million barrels of crude oil each year. Last year’s U.N. resolution capped refined imports at 500,000 barrels a year. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters on Tuesday China has consistently and strictly abided by U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea. China had only exported 7,432 tonnes of refined oil products to North Korea in the first six months of this year, out of a total of 60,000 tonnes a year stipulated by the U.N. sanctions. China had reported its exports to the Security Council’s sanctions committee in a timely manner, Geng added. “The relevant situation is totally open and transparent,” he said, without elaborating. Overall, China’s trade with North Korea in the first half of this year tumbled 56 percent on the back of the tightening sanctions, customs data showed on Monday. North Korean rice prices have also been stable since a spike last September, when the U.N. Security Council imposed new sanctions. Rice has hovered around $0.62 per kg throughout this year. Stable fuel and rice prices suggest no immediate signs of major suffering in North Korea despite South Korea’s recent estimates the impoverished state’s economy contracted at its sharpest rate in two decades last year. South Korea’s central bank said North Korea’s gross domestic product shrank 3.5 percent last year, marking the biggest decline since 1997, citing international sanctions and drought. While other defectors reported some suffering in remote rural regions, Kang said fuel demand has been steady in North Korea, and overall living conditions have improved in line with a booming unofficial market economy. The unofficial markets, known as jangmadang, have grown to account for about 60 percent of the economy, according to the Institute for Korean Integration of Society. “I’ve seen signs the economy was slowly improving over the past five years, and in last year things are still developing but perhaps not as fast as before,” a Western consultant who makes regular trips to North Korea told Reuters. Kim, who vowed not to let the people “tighten their belt again” in his first-ever public speech in 2012, announced in April a shift in focus from nuclear programmes to the economy. Analysts say that will be difficult while sanctions remain in place. “I don’t think there is an outcry in the markets now, but there could be one towards the end of this year,” said Kim Byeong-yeon, a North Korea economy specialist at the Seoul National University.
