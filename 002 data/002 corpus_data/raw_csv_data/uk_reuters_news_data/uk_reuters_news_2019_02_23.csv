2019-02-23,"BERLIN (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday that Germany should ease its strict arms export rules for countries outside the European Union to strengthen the defence industry. France has complained that joint arms manufacturing projects are being stalled by Berlin’s refusal to authorise future arms export licences to Saudi Arabia, a major buyer. Germany said in November it would reject future arms export licences to Riyadh over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It has not formally banned previously approved deals but has urged industry to refrain from such shipments for now. “It is useless to produce weapons through improved cooperation between France and Germany if we are unable to export them,” Le Maire told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. “If you want to be competitive and efficient, we need to be able to export to countries outside Europe,” Le Maire said. The minister said France also had relatively strict rules for arms exports. “Our hope is that we will come to an agreement with Germany in this crucial point,” Le Maire said. Germany and France are working on a joint proposal for arms export guidelines to non-European countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in January the EU must deepen cooperation in defence and in particular weapons systems development, warning Germans that they may need to make compromises on strict export controls.

2019-02-23,"ABUJA/MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria began counting votes in Saturday’s closely-fought presidential election although the electoral commission extended voting in some places where polling stations opened late or ballot machines malfunctioned. President Muhammadu Buhari and his main challenger, businessman Atiku Abubakar, both said they were confident of victory when casting their ballots in an election which was already delayed by a week due to logistical problems. The vote in Africa’s biggest economic power is too close to call, with the outcome hinging on which man voters trust most to revamp an economy still struggling from a 2016 recession.  Buhari, a former military ruler who is seeking a second elected term faces Atiku, a former vice president who has pledged to expand the role of the private sector in Africa’s most populous nation and top oil producer.  They lead a field of more than 70 candidates in an election which was postponed last Saturday just hours before it was due to begin. On Saturday, voting had been completed in some areas and the counting of ballots was taking place, Reuters witnesses said. “The Independent National Electoral Commission is generally satisfied with the process and the procedures for the conduct of these present elections,” INEC official Festus Okoye told reporters in the capital, Abuja.  But he said there had been challenges related to the delayed start of voting in some polling stations and INEC had extended hours in the places affected. Voting officially began at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and was due to close at 2 p.m. Okoye said 68 percent of polling units had opened by 10 a.m. Okoye said INEC was investigating reports of attempts to steal electoral material in Lagos state and the southeastern state of Anambra, as well as violence in the oil-rich southern state of Rivers.  Problems related to malfunctioning voter card machines were mostly resolved, he added.     GRAPHIC: Nigeria presidential election - tmsnrt.rs/2E6qkDO In the northeast, where Islamist insurgents have waged a decade-long war, blasts were heard in Maiduguri, state capital of Borno state, shortly before polls were due to open. In neighbouring Yobe state, residents in the town of Geidam fled an attack around the same time. A group called Islamic State West Africa Province, an off-shoot of Boko Haram, claimed it had carried out an attack in Maiduguri. Boko Haram had warned people not to vote. Army spokesman Colonel Sagir Musa earlier said there had not been any attack on Maiduguri, but there had been an exercise by the military. He called the Geidam attack “futile” and said there were no casualties. Buhari, who voted in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina, said: “I will congratulate myself, I’m going to be the winner,” when asked by reporters if he would congratulate his rival, should Atiku win. Atiku cast his ballot in the eastern Adamawa state. “I am impressed by the turnout of the people,” he told reporters.  “I look forward to a successful transition.” Some of the country’s 72.8 million eligible voters were frustrated by delays.  Kingsley Moghalu, a presidential candidate for the Young Progressives Party, said he had only managed to vote at noon in the southeastern state of Anambra. He said polls opened two hours late and machines were not working. “If as a presidential candidate my polling unit can be treated in this manner, I can imagine what a lot of Nigerians are going through in many parts of the country,” he said. Other voters echoed his concerns. “I’ve been to 10 polling units today. I’ve been redirected many times,” said Victor Kanoba, a voter in Lagos. John Tomaszewski, an observer with the joint U.S. National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute delegation, said delays had been expected given the challenge of getting materials to the polling stations in time. “Logistics weren’t properly managed despite the postponement of the polls,” said Idayat Hassan, director of Abuja-based think-tank Centre for Democracy and Development. However, in Lagos’ business district Victoria Island, Reginald Anthony, 45, who runs a transport business, said: “We are seeing a transparent election, everything is open for everyone to see”. After voting in the northern Kano state, Hadisa Hayatu, a 38-year old housewife, said: “I voted for Buhari because he has assured us that he is going to build on what he has done on security and other issues.” An Atiku supporter in Kano, stylist Laurie Isaac, 27, said: “We need change. I need more work. I need my salary to increase.”  Reporting by Paul Carsten, Seun Sanni, Aaron Ross, Abraham Achirga, Adewale Kolawole, Afolabi Sotunde, Ardo Hazzad, Didi Akinyelure, Garba Muhammed, Mike Oboh, Nneka Chile, Ola Lanre, Percy Dabang, Camillus Eboh, Christian Merenini, Tife Owolabi, and Ulf Laessing in Tunis; Writing by James Macharia and Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Toby Chopra and Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nigeria-election/update-5-nigerias-president-and-main-rival-confident-as-polls-close-idUKL5N20I06P,23 Feb 2019,"* GRAPHIC-Nigeria presidential election: https://tmsnrt.rs/2E6qkDO

2019-02-23,"* Northwest Nigeria has highest number of voters * Buhari secured 90 percent of vote in regional hub Kano in 2015 * Buhari’s main opponent Atiku likely to eat into Kano stronghold By Aaron Ross KANO,  Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sunday Nicholas voted for Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria’s 2015 presidential election, but the 32-year-old factory worker in the northern city of Kano was casting his ballot on Saturday for the president’s challenger, Atiku Abubakar. “Most of the (workers) cannot feed their families,” Nicholas said as he queued in a dusty schoolyard to vote. People are suffering, he said. “There is no improvement.” If Buhari is turfed out of office when the results are tallied this week a major cause is likely to be defections by voters in the northwest, once Buhari’s most important electoral stronghold, where anger over a feeble economy and disaffection from local bigwigs has loosened his grip. A quarter of Nigeria’s nearly 73 million eligible voters are in the northwest, the country’s most densely-populated region. Buhari received nearly 90 percent of Kano state’s vote in 2015, running up a 1.7 million vote edge that accounted for more than half of his final margin of victory over then-president Goodluck Jonathan. But he faces stiffer headwinds this time around. Many voters are dissatisfied with an economy still sputtering after a 2016 recession. And his main opponent Atiku is also a northern Muslim rather than a southern Christian like Jonathan. Atiku stands to benefit from the support of influential local powerbrokers who have rallied behind the opposition candidate after falling out with Buhari and his allies. The most important among them, Rabiu Kwankwaso, is a senator, two-time governor of Kano State and so-called “godfather”, a term for local Nigerian kingmakers who draw their influence from elaborate patronage networks. The 62-year-old Kwankwaso has a loyal core of supporters known as “Kwankwasiyya” who are readily identifiable by their woven red caps. He quit Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last year amid a wave of defections to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). In a sign of Kano’s newfound battleground status, Kwankwasiyya members on their way to a rally outside Kano city clashed with APC members on Thursday, leading to several injuries and torched vehicles. Each side blamed the other. PDP officials say Atiku could net as much as 40 or even 50 percent of the vote in Kano State. APC supporters dismiss that, although they concede that Atiku will make some inroads. “It will not be like what happened in 2015,” said Baballe Hayatu, 40, an actor in the local film industry, who was waiting to vote for Buhari. “There was this security challenge so everyone was desperate in 2015,” he said, referring to surging violence by militant group Boko Haram at the time that fed widespread rejection of Jonathan. But even if his four years in office have taken some of the lustre off Buhari, he remains popular in Kano, perceived by many as an incorruptible foe of the rampant graft that has plagued Nigerian politics for decades. “He’s an honest man. He’s a correct leader,” said Zainab Habib Haruna, 32, a teacher.

2019-02-23,"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South Africa’s largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), launched its manifesto for May’s general elections on Saturday with pledges to create jobs and set up an anti-corruption unit. The DA faces a resurgent ruling African National Congress (ANC) under new President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has also vowed to root out graft and boost growth in Africa’s most industrialised economy.. The ANC has comfortably won every parliamentary election since it swept to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994 and the DA has made ruling South Africa a long-term ambition. Still, corruption is perceived as a weakness for the ANC after years of rule by former President Jacob Zuma, who was removed from the presidency last year by the ANC after years of corruption probes. He denies any wrongdoing. “The South Africa I want to build will have no place for corruption and corrupt politicians,” DA leader Mmusi Maimane told supporters at the party’s manifesto launch in Johannesburg. He said his party would have “zero tolerance for corruption” and wanted to see corrupt politicians spend 15 years in jail. The DA, which has roots among white liberals from the anti-apartheid era, elected its first black leader in 2015 to widen its appeal among voters, and improved its national credentials by winning control of three major cities in 2016. Maimane also outlined manifesto pledges to create jobs by offering tax incentives to encourage new business and maximise the manufacturing, agriculture and tourism sectors to build the economy. “If we can put a job in every home we can transform our society,” said Maimane The unemployment rate, which is at more than 27 percent, is a politically sensitive issue in South Africa especially ahead of national elections this year.

2019-02-23,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday it had many options to neutralise the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on its oil exports, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, adding that Tehran’s regional influence could not be curbed as demanded by Washington.  “Apart from closing Strait of Hormuz, we have other options to stop oil flow if threatened,” Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani told Tasnim. “Iran has plans in place that will neutralise the illegal U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports,” Shamkhani said. “We have many ways to sell our oil.”  Tensions between Iran and the United States increased after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers last May, and then reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.  The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by Trump to force Iran to further curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero. But, fearing a price spike, it granted  waivers to eight Iranian oil buyers when the sanctions on oil imports started last November.   Iranian officials have threatened to disrupt oil shipments from the Gulf countries if Washington tries to strangle Tehran’s oil exports. Carrying one-third of the world’s seaborne oil every day, the Strait of Hormuz links Middle East crude producers to key markets in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America and beyond. “There are multiple ways to make that (blockage of Hormuz) happen. We hope we would not be forced to use them,” Shamkhani said.  Iran — the dominant Shi’ite Muslim power which is in a rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the United States’ other Sunni Arab allies — has been President Bashar al-Assad’s most supportive ally against insurgents throughout the nearly eight-year Syrian civil war. “We have achieved 90 percent of Iran’s goals in Syria,” said Shamkhani, a close ally of Iran’s top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “There will be important developments in promoting deterrence capability of the resistance front in Syria,” said Shamkhani when asked about Israel’s “possible future attacks” in Syria, according to Tasnim.  Iran often refers to regional countries and forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a “resistance axis”.  Israel, increasingly concerned that its enemy Iran may establish a long-term military presence in neighbouring Syria, says it has carried out over 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years. Defying Israeli threats that they might be targeted if they do not leave the country, Iran says it will continue to provide military advisers to Syria for as long as necessary in support of Assad’s forces.  “Iran is capable of confronting any military threat ... Trump and Israel are well aware of Iran’s military might,” Shamkhani said. “They know that they cannot enter a war with Iran. That is why they publicly threaten Iran.” Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Toby Chopra",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-sanctions-shamkhani/update-2-iran-says-it-has-many-options-to-neutralise-illegal-u-s-sanctions-tasnim-idUKL5N20I0BM,23 Feb 2019,"Iran said on Saturday it had many

2019-02-23,"CUCUTA, Colombia, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition and activists prepared on Saturday to confront troops stationed along the country’s borders to block their plan to bring in food and medicine that authorities are calling a veiled U.S.-backed invasion. Opposition volunteers in neighboring Brazil and Colombia plan to arrive at the border to help carry humanitarian aid to a sick and hungry population suffering from an economic meltdown under President Nicolas Maduro. While the need for basic food and medicines is real, the effort is also meant to embarrass military officers who continue to support Maduro’s increasingly isolated government. Juan Guaido, recognized by most Western nations as the country’s legitimate head of state, defied court orders not to leave Venezuela by arriving on Friday in the Colombian border city of Cucuta, where aid from the U.S. and Colombian governments is stockpiled in warehouses. Guaido, 35, head of the opposition-run Congress, has provided few details on the transport plan. Trucks are expected to be driven by Venezuelan volunteers and some opposition figures have suggested forming human chains. “Today the obstacles that the dictatorship created will tomorrow be rivers of unity of peace,” Guaido said in a news conference on Friday in Cucuta, where he was received by Colombian President Ivan Duque. Venezuelan soldiers may bar the way. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in a tweet late on Friday that Venezuela’s government shut the Tachira border that connects it with Cucuta temporarily “due to a series of illegal threats” by Colombia. One of three bridges linking Cucuta to Venezuela has been blocked with shipping containers, while the other two have been shuttered to vehicle traffic for years. Maduro has also shut the Brazilian border and the maritime border with nearby Dutch Caribbean islands. He blames the country’s dire situation on U.S. sanctions that have blocked the country from obtaining financing and have hobbled the OPEC nation’s oil industry. Rodriguez says the aid is poisoned. Concerns about the potential for violence flared on Friday when the Venezuelan army opened fire in an village near the Brazilian border after indigenous leaders attempted to prevent them from advancing, killing a woman and her husband. “I don’t plan to leave my house over the weekend, especially after what happened near Brazil,” said Paulina Sanchez, a 68-year-old grandmother who lives just 300 meters (yards) from the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge, one of the crossings through which aid may pass. “This could turn into a powder keg.” Nearly 200,000 people attended a festive benefit concert in Cucuta on Friday featuring Latin pop stars, including Luis Fonsi of “Despacito” fame, many of whom called on Maduro to step down. A rival concert held by the ruling Socialist Party on the Venezuelan side was sparsely attended. Guaido in January invoked articles of the constitution to assume interim presidency and denounced Maduro as a usurper, arguing his 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

2019-02-23,"KUMARAKAPAY, Venezuela/CUCUTA, Colombia (Reuters) - Venezuelan soldiers opened fire on indigenous people near the border with Brazil on Friday, killing two, as President Nicolas Maduro sought to block U.S.-backed efforts to bring aid into his economically devastated nation.    The United States, which is among dozens of nations to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, has been stockpiling aid in the Colombian frontier town of Cucuta to ship across the border this weekend. With tensions running high after Guaido invoked the constitution to declare an interim presidency last month, Maduro has denied there is a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela despite widespread shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation. He says the opposition efforts are a U.S.-backed “cheap show”. The socialist president, who took power in 2013 and was re-elected in an election last year widely viewed as fraudulent, has declared Venezuela’s southern border with Brazil closed ahead of the opposition’s plan to bring in the aid on Saturday.    Late on Friday the government shuttered the Tachira frontier that connects with Cucuta.  Some political analysts say the looming showdown is less about solving Venezuela’s needs and more about testing the military’s loyalty to Maduro by daring it to turn the aid away. With inflation running at more than 2 million percent a year and currency controls restricting imports of basic goods, a growing share of the country’s roughly 30 million people is suffering from malnutrition. Guaido showed up late on Friday at a fundraising concert in Cucuta backed by British billionaire Richard Branson that was estimated to have attracted nearly 200,000 people. His appearance, arm-in-arm with Colombian President Ivan Duque, was an open challenge to Maduro given that the pro-government Supreme Court has banned him from international travel on grounds he is under investigation for allegedly helping foreign countries to interfere in internal matters.  Friday’s violence broke out in the village of Kumarakapay in southern Venezuela after an indigenous community stopped a military convoy heading towards the border with Brazil that they believed was attempting to block aid, according to community leaders Richard Fernandez and Ricardo Delgado. Soldiers later entered the village and opened fire, killing a couple and injuring several others, they said. A regional official confirmed that two people were killed. “I stood up to them to back the humanitarian aid,” Fernandez told Reuters. “And they came charging at us. They shot innocent people who were in their homes, working.” Seven of the 15 injured were rushed by ambulance to a hospital in the Brazilian frontier city of Boa Vista, a spokesman for the state governor’s office said. Diosdado Cabello, one of the most prominent figures in Maduro’s Socialist Party, accused the civilians involved in the clash of being “violent groups” directed by the opposition. Venezuelan security forces have executed dozens and detained hundreds of others since protests broke out in January against Maduro’s swearing-in, according to civil rights groups. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza in New York on Friday and “urged the Venezuelan authorities not to use lethal force against demonstrators,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Asked about the deaths, Arreaza told reporters the armed forces would never take disproportionate action against its own people: “Our armed forces are known for their humanism.” The U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, who joined regional leaders and diplomats in Cucuta to show support for the opposition, called the killings “a crime and a disgrace”. “What do we do if the government of Maduro, the former government of Maduro, does not fall tomorrow?” Elliott Abrams said after meeting the presidents of Paraguay and Chile and the secretary-general of the Organization of American States. “We continue trying to bring humanitarian aid to the people of Venezuela.” China, which along with Russia backs Maduro, warned that humanitarian aid should not be forced across the border because doing so could lead to violence. The bloodshed contrasted with a joyful mood at Branson’s “Venezuela Aid Live”, where Venezuelan and Colombian attendees, some crying, waved flags and chanted “freedom” under a baking sun. “Is it too much to ask for freedom after 20 years of ignominy, of a populist Marxist dictatorship?” Venezuelan singer Jose Luis “El Puma” Rodríguez asked. “To the Venezuelans there, don’t give up: the blood that has been spilled was not in vain”. Earlier in the day, Branson held a news conference near a never-used border bridge that Venezuelan authorities have blocked with shipping containers. “What we’re hoping is that the authorities in Venezuela will see this wonderful, peaceful concert ... and that the soldiers will do that right thing,” Branson said. As well as the foreign aid stockpiled in Cucuta, Guaido has vowed to bring in aid on Saturday from the Brazilian town of Boa Vista and the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao. “The people of Venezuela are not begging, they’re resisting a dictatorship, the onslaught of oppression,” Guaido told a news conference in Cucuta after the concert. “Tomorrow ... everyone will be on the streets demanding the entry of humanitarian aid, thanking the world for this unprecedented coalition.” Brazil said on Friday it had 200 tonnes of food and medicine ready for Venezuela but only one truck had arrived to pick it up before the border was closed. Venezuela’s borders are porous, however, and supporters could attempt to bring in aid outside the official entry points. Guaido’s move to assume the interim presidency and international backing has galvanized Venezuela’s opposition, which has vowed to keep protesting until Maduro steps down. Major protests in 2014 and 2017 waned in the face of crackdowns. Some government critics are concerned it will take more than pressure to force Maduro to step down. “The truth is that not even 10 concerts will make damned Maduro leave office,” said Darwin Rendon, one of the 3.4 million Venezuelans to have emigrated since 2015 to find work. He sends what little he earns selling cigarettes to his family in Caracas. “This regime is difficult to remove.” Reporting by Carlos Suniaga and William Urdaneta in Kumarakapay, Venezuela; Nelson Bocanegra and Steven Grattan in Cucuta, Colombia; Julia Symmes Cobb and Helen Murphy in Bogota; Brian Ellsworth, Vivian Sequera, Corina Pons and Sarah Marsh in Caracas; Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Writing by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Bill Trott, Paul Simao and Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics/wrapup-6-as-tensions-over-aid-rise-venezuelan-troops-fire-on-villagers-kill-two-idUKL1N20H0L1,23 Feb 2019,"KUMARAKAPAY, Venezuela/CUCUTA, Colombia, Feb 22 (Reuters) -

2019-02-23,"(Adds details about Bolton, comments on expatriate Venezuelans) By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. government could announce new sanctions to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro as early as next week unless his military defies orders to block convoys of humanitarian aid planned for this weekend, a senior administration official said on Friday. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other leaders in the Western Hemisphere will meet in Bogota on Monday. Depending on what happens on Venezuela’s borders over the weekend, the leaders could dramatically boost aid pledges to the country - or take new steps to crack down, the official told reporters. “If there is any type of violence, or if there is any type of negative reaction from the hierarchy of the Venezuela armed forces, there may also be measures that are announced by the vice president and other countries in regards to closing even further the international financial circle,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a sign of the importance of the issue to the White House, President Donald Trump’s top national security adviser John Bolton canceled a weekend trip to South Korea to talk to allies ahead of a summit next week on North Korea’s nuclear talks. Bolton wanted to monitor the unfolding developments in Venezuela, his spokesman Garrett Marquis said. Pence will lead the U.S. delegation to the meeting of the Lima Group regional bloc, and so far has an “open script” for what he will propose, the official said. “He has the carrots, but he’s also ready with the sticks for those that promote or execute violence,” the official said. “That will be announced not only by the United States, but by the rest of the region’s democracies.” The United States has stockpiled aid on Colombia’s border with Venezuela at the request of opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom Washington and other dozens of other Western governments have recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate president since Maduro held elections last year decried as fraudulent. Despite shortages of food and medicine, Maduro has denied there is a crisis in the country, and says the aid is aimed at undermining his government. He has ordered some of the country’s borders closed to keep the aid from entering. Tensions are running high and there has been some violence. Soldiers killed two people and injured 15 near the border with Brazil on Friday, witnesses said. The Trump administration last month slapped sanctions on state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela PDVSA.UL, known as PDVSA, to cut Maduro off from his government’s main source of revenues. The administration official declined to comment on future sanctions, but said the United States and other allies are looking at ways to expel family members of Venezuelan military officials who are living outside the country - including some in south Florida. “They’re going to face a situation where they and their families are going to have to go back to Venezuela,” he said. The U.S. official described the aid convoys as a key test for the Venezuelan military as its leaders weigh whether to obey Maduro or Guaido, who has asked the military to let it pass. “It’s really the first order he gives to them as their commander in chief,” the U.S. official added.

2019-02-23,"* President Buhari, opposition’s Atiku leading contenders * Nigeria is Africa’s biggest economy, top oil producer * GRAPHIC-Nigeria presidential election: tmsnrt.rs/2E6qkDO By James Macharia ABUJA, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s hold on power faces a strong challenge on Saturday in a delayed election that hinges on the fate of the economy, Africa’s biggest. The presidential vote in the continent’s top oil producer and most populous nation is too close to call between Buhari and the main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president who leads a field of more than 70 challengers. The election, due to be held a week ago, was postponed around five hours before polling stations were set to open and there are concerns that the delay may hurt turnout. The electoral commission blamed logistical factors for the delay and denied political pressure was behind the decision. Presidential elections in 2011 and 2015 were also delayed over logistics and security concerns but Buhari on Friday urged Nigerians “to go out and vote”, promising that there would be adequate security for the ballot. The Boko Haram militant group and its offshoot, Islamic State in West Africa Province, have carried out deadly sporadic raids in the northeastern Borno state. Boko Haram has warned people not to vote. But the showdown between Buhari and Atiku hinges on revamping an economy struggling to recover from its first recession in 25 years, which it slipped into in 2016 as crude prices crashed and militants attacked energy facilities in the Niger Delta. Crude sales make up 90 percent of foreign exchange earnings. “Instability is a rising concern but a weak economy is being felt in all sectors and country-wide so we believe it will be the preeminent voter concern,” said Benedict Craven, analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. Buhari’s critics say his much-touted focus on rooting out corruption may be offset by his handling of the economy. Despite the president’s campaign against graft, there have not been any significant convictions in his first term. Nearly a quarter of the workforce is unemployed, much higher than when Buhari, a former military ruler who was later elected president, took over in 2015. The cost of living has also risen rapidly, with inflation of 11.37 percent in January - just short of a seven-month high reached the previous month. Buhari, 76, has said the economy has put the recession behind it and is back on a path of steady growth. To his supporters, Atiku, 72, is an accomplished businessman with the credentials needed to boost growth, create jobs and attract foreign investors back to Nigeria. Atiku has promised to expand the role of the private sector in a nation of nearly 200 million people, saying that if elected he would aim to double the size of the economy to $900 billion by 2025. He has for years been dogged by corruption accusations, which he denies. Critics say Atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most Nigerians. Buhari is the flagbearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) while Atiku spearheads the main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP). tmsnrt.rs/2E6qkDO The pair are both Muslims from the north of the country. The south has favoured the PDP in the past, while the north is Buhari’s stronghold. The number of eligible voters stands at 72.8 million people. To be declared winner, the candidate with the most votes must have at least one quarter of the vote in two thirds of Nigeria’s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a runoff.
