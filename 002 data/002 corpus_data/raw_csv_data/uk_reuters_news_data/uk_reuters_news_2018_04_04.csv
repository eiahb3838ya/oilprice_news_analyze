2018-04-04,"RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia’s air defence had intercepted a missile that the armed Houthi movement said it fired at storage tanks belonging to Saudi Aramco oil company. Debris fell on residential areas when the missile, launched towards the southwestern Saudi Arabian port of Jizan, was destroyed around 2130 (1830 GMT) but there were no reported casualties or damage, coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Aramco said on Twitter that all its facilities in Jizan were safe and operating normally. Tensions have risen in recent days after the Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, launched a series of missile strikes on Saudi Arabia which the coalition said were intercepted. Falling debris killed one person in Riyadh, the first death in the Saudi capital from the Yemen war. Saudi Arabia accuses arch-rival Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the fighting.

2018-04-04,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese importers expecting cargoes of U.S. commodities from beef to propane said they hope to sell the goods to South Korea or Japan after Beijing’s decision to slap extra tariffs on a swathe of items from agricultural products to chemicals.  Beijing on Wednesday hit back against the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, retaliating with a list of similar duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, whiskey and chemicals. The speed of China’s move stunned financial markets. Traders of soybeans, of which China is the largest importer, said they were bracing for mass cancellations of purchases, even though the United States is the country’s second-largest supplier. Prices of soybeans shipped from ports in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, the most direct route to Asia, dropped by $10 to $12 per ton on Wednesday, U.S. soybean traders said. Buyers of propane used for making ethylene and propylene are looking to swap U.S. shipments for Middle Eastern barrels with buyers in South Korea and Japan. “Even though we are committed to U.S. supplies, we could swap them for Middle East cargoes with Korean or Japanese buyers by paying them $10 per ton extra freight cost,” said a manager with an east China-based chemical plant that buys U.S. propane, and who gave only his surname, Zhong.  China bought 3.56 million tonnes of U.S. propane last year worth some $2 billion, or 19 percent of its total imports.  The 25-percent additional tariffs will likely hit U.S.-based exporters such as Enterprise Product Partners (PSX.N) and Phillips 66 (EPD.N), and give a boost to rivals in the Middle East like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. “The market will be thrown into some initial chaos and the freight market will also be affected. Diversions and swaps mean the demand for tankers will be lower, as U.S. voyages are shorter to northeast Asia and also shorter from the Middle East to China,” said a senior dealer with Jovo Energy.  The tariffs on beef were not expected to have much impact on the Chinese market, which had only resumed imports from the U.S. last year after a 14-year hiatus. China bought just 2,200 tonnes of U.S. beef in 2017, worth $14.7 million, according to Chinese customs, less than 1 percent of total imports.  But the move could increase supplies of coveted high-end items like short ribs to other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, pressuring prices currently at record levels, said one expert who declined to be named.

2018-04-04,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States voiced willingness on Wednesday to negotiate a resolution to an escalating trade fight with China after Beijing retaliated against proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods by targeting key American imports, but the Chinese ambassador to Washington said it “takes two to tango.” Just 11 hours after President Donald Trump’s administration proposed 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese industrial, technology, transport and medical products, China shot back with a list of similar duties on major American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. Beijing’s swift and forceful response raised the prospect of a quickly spiralling dispute between the world’s two economic superpowers that could harm the global economy. While Trump posted defiant messages on Twitter, his administration signalled possible wiggle room. Asked whether the U.S. tariffs announced on Tuesday may never go into effect and may be a negotiating tactic, Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told reporters: “Yes, it’s possible. It’s part of the process.” He called the announcements by the two countries mere opening proposals. Kudlow later told Fox News Channel: “I don’t think it’s a trade war. I think there is going to be intense negotiations on both sides.” “I think we’re going to come to agreements,” he said, adding that “I believe that the Chinese will back down and will play ball.” Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, held an hour-long meeting at the U.S. State Department in Washington with acting Secretary of State John Sullivan. “Negotiation would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango. We will see what the U.S. will do,” the ambassador said afterward. The trade actions will not be carried out immediately, so there may be room for manoeuvre. Publication of Washington’s list on Tuesday started a period of public comment and consultation expected to last around two months. The effective date of China’s moves depends on when the U.S. action takes effect. If the two countries are unable to settle the dispute, a full-scale trade war could destabilise U.S.-Chinese commercial ties, an important component of the global economy. China’s action rattled U.S. farmers, while shares in U.S. exporters of everything from planes to tractors were volatile. After dropping at the outset of trading, Wall Street’s three major indexes staged a comeback to close about 1 percent higher as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from the trade fight. [MKTS/GLOB] White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said U.S. implementation of the tariffs would depend on China’s behaviour. “It’s going to be a couple months before tariffs on either side would go into effect and be implemented and we’re hopeful that China will do the right thing,” she told reporters. “I would anticipate that if there are no changes to the behaviour of China and they don’t stop the unfair trade practices, then we would move forward,” Sanders said.     Trump, who contends his predecessors served the United States badly in trade matters, wrote on Twitter: “We are not in a trade war with China that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.” While Washington targeted products that benefit from Chinese industrial policy - including its “Made in China 2025” initiative to replace advanced technology imports with domestic products in strategic industries such as advanced IT and robotics - Beijing appeared to offer a response intended to inflict political damage. Washington’s list was filled with many obscure industrial items, but China’s struck at signature U.S. exports, including soybeans, frozen beef, cotton and other agricultural commodities produced in states from Iowa to Texas that voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. The list extends to tobacco and whiskey, both produced in states including Kentucky, home of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, like Trump a Republican. Trump said last month that “trade wars are good, and easy to win,” but key fellow Republicans expressed unease over the latest developments. McConnell said he was nervous about the “growing trend in the administration to levy tariffs” that could become a “slippery slope,” while Senator Chuck Grassley, whose home state of Iowa is a major agricultural producer, said: “Farmers and ranchers shouldn’t be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire country.” The possibility of an escalating U.S.-China trade war will result in “a bumpy ride” for the U.S. economy, said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. China said its list of 25 percent additional tariffs on U.S. goods covered 106 items with a trade value matching the $50 billion targeted on Washington’s list.  U.S.-made goods that appear to face added tariffs in China include Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) electric cars, Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) Lincoln auto models, Gulfstream jets made by General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) and Brown-Forman Corp’s (BFb.N) Jack Daniel’s whiskey. Information technology products, from cellphones to personal computers, largely escaped the latest salvo of U.S.-China trade measures despite accounting for a significant portion of bilateral trade. China ran a $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States in 2017. Trump has demanded that the China cut the trade gap by $100 billion. The U.S. move was aimed at forcing Beijing to address what Washington says is deeply entrenched theft of U.S. intellectual property and forced technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese competitors, charges Chinese officials deny. The U.S. tariff list followed China’s imposition of tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. fruits, nuts, pork and wine to protest U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs imposed last month by Trump.

2018-04-04,"UARINI, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian jaguars, imperiled by hunters, ranchers and destruction of their habitat, have learned to survive at least one menace — flooding in the Amazon. They take to the trees! Although they can be six feet long and 200 pounds, the largest South American cats nimbly navigate treetops where they stay from April to July when the rainforest floor is under meters-deep water. “It shows that even as a large animal, the jaguar can withstand the flooding — feeding, breeding and raising its young in the treetops for three to four months,” says Emiliano Ramalho, the lead researcher for Project Iauarete, which is administered by the Instituto Mamirauá. “This had never been documented before we began researching the jaguars here.”  The Iauaretê Project monitors jaguars in Mamirauá, studies their relationship with local residents and undertakes conservation for the species, which lives deep in the rainforest. Documenting jaguar behaviour during the rainy season is rare, with their long-term stays in the treetops first recorded by the researchers in 2013 after nine years of monitoring in the region. But from 2016 to 2018 in several visits to the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve, 600 kilometres (373 miles) west of Amazonas state capital Manaus, we photographed jaguars perched high on branches. Called “painted jaguars” in Brazil because of their intricately spotted fur, jaguars are difficult to see in the dense jungle canopy.  Researchers discovered their behaviour after nearly a decade of studying them from floating bases, braving the same conditions that put flood waters at the doorsteps of more than 10,000 people living in the Mamirauá reserve.  On one expedition last month, researchers with headlamps tracked down and tranquilized a black male jaguar at night, placed his limp body on a blue tarp and wrapped his head in a towel as they fitted him with a black tracking collar, measured his teeth and checked his vitals. So many jaguars have been fitted with trackers that  researchers can now pinpoint them by holding up pronged radio receivers as they pilot small boats through the flooded forest. Ramalho says that understanding this behaviour is further  evidence supporting the need to preserve the Amazon floodplain. The Iauaretê Project has teamed up with the Uakari Lodge in the reserve, which is operated by an association of local residents, to offer ecotourism trips that take advantage of the trackers to allow tourists to catch a glimpse of the animals. The goal is to raise awareness for conservation and generate income for residents. A trip to see jaguars living in trees costs 10,000 reais ($3,000) per person. Ecotourism fosters better relations between jaguars and residents, who are sometimes fearful or angry because jaguars can eat livestock and pets. Local resident Railgler dos Santos, a field assistant on the project, says seeing the intense black eyes of a jaguar staring out from the jungle has stayed with him. “There’s definitely a connection there, having the fortune of seeing the animal face to face,” he said.

2018-04-04,"LIMA (Reuters) - Pedro Pablo Kuczynski’s critics call it his last act. Hours before the former Wall Street banker resigned Peru’s presidency in scandal last month, Kuczynski signed five oil contracts granting London-based Tullow Oil (TLW.L) exploration and drilling rights off Peru’s northern coast. Lawmakers have vowed to investigate and try to repeal the contracts. They say there should have been a public auction, an environmental study and consultations with fishermen, biologists and coastal residents about sites that lie in an important fisheries area rich in biodiversity. Critics are unconvinced by Peru’s oil promoting agency, Perupetro, which said the contracts followed months of negotiations and should be celebrated for the $200 million investment they will bring to a country where bidding rounds are often cancelled due to lack of interest. “It’s not normal for a president, just before resigning, to sign five decrees giving away our resources,” said Congresswoman Karla Schaefer with the conservative party Popular Force. “Given Mr. Kuczynski’s background, it raises a lot of questions.” Kuczynski’s less than two years in office featured clashes with Popular Force lawmakers who depicted him as an unscrupulous lobbyist. He resigned after being implicated in an alleged vote-buying scheme to prevent possible impeachment over payments his consulting firm received from Odebrecht, a company at the centre of a massive graft scandal. Kuczynski denies wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate with public prosecutors investigating him. Kuczynski’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment about Tullow Oil. The company has been cautiously reviving its search for new oil and gas resources after emerging from one of the longest downturns in the sector’s history with a $3.5 billion debt pile. For foreign investors in one of Latin America’s most stable economies, the latest controversy brought reminders of a how a more than yearlong graft scandal involving Odebrecht has heightened scrutiny of government contracts and fuelled political feuds in Peru. Tullow said it started direct negotiations with Perupetro as allowed by Peruvian law in November. “Both the terms and conditions of our contracts and the process for approving them are similar to those signed with other oil companies in 2017,” it said in a statement. But leftist lawmaker Hernando Cevallos said Peru’s new president, Martin Vizcarra, should rescind the contracts. “This area is the source of 40 percent of our fishing,” Cevallos said. Vizcarra’s office declined to comment. Yuri Hooker, a marine biologist who researches undersea life in Peru, said three of Tullow’s oil concessions contain high levels of biodiversity. “This whole area is one of the most important breeding places in the Pacific for whales and dolphins, as well as fish and invertebrate species on the verge of extinction,” said Hooker. The former head of Perupetro, Francisco Garcia, said Tullow will have to secure environmental approvals before drilling, and denied anything irregular about the contracts. A minor oil producer, Peru has struggled to lure investments to its prospects as bigger players in the region such as Mexico have grown more competitive by cutting red tape. “Now all we’re doing is driving companies away,” Garcia said, adding that he resigned last month because most of his time was spent responding to lawmakers.

2018-04-04,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm DNO increased its stake in Faroe Petroleum to 25.4 percent on Wednesday, after announcing earlier in the day that it had bought a 15.4 percent holding in the British company. DNO bought the initial stake from Israel’s Delek Group and said after the market close that it would offer to buy up to 10 percent of Faroe’s shares from other shareholders, although it does not plan a full takeover. Britain’s takeover code dictates that a firm publishing a “no intention to bid statement” must refrain for at least six months from crossing the 30 percent ownership threshold, at which an obligation to make a mandatory offer is triggered. The Norwegian firm returned to the North Sea last year after years of expansion in the Middle East, with the aim of growing via acquisitions and other investment. “DNO now has decided to build a long-term strategic shareholding in Faroe Petroleum and to support Faroe Petroleum management’s growth-focused North Sea strategy,” it said. Faroe earlier in the day announced it had made significant discoveries in its Hades and Iris exploration prospects offshore Norway. A source close to Faroe said the company expected DNO to seek to appoint at least one new member to the Faroe board. The Norwegian firm was not immediately available for comment. Faroe’s shares closed 12.2 percent higher at 1.178 pounds on Wednesday, having hit a four-year high of 1.204 pounds during trading hours. To buy the 25.4 percent stake, DNO paid a 19 percent premium to the shares’ closing price on Tuesday. “The Faroe Board considers that the GBP 1.25 per share price at which DNO purchased the Faroe shares from Delek substantially undervalues the company and its prospects,” Faroe said in an earlier statement. Following DNO’s share purchase and the North Sea discoveries, investment bank BMO Capital Markets raised its share price target for Faroe to 1.50 pounds from 1.25 pounds and repeated an outperform recommendation. DNO shares closed down 1.6 percent.

2018-04-04,"MANAMA (Reuters) - A new discovery off the coast of Bahrain is estimated to contain at least 80 billion barrels of tight oil, the kingdom’s biggest ever find, its oil minister said on Wednesday. Bahrain said on Sunday it had discovered extensive tight oil and deep gas resources off the west coast of the kingdom. Independent appraisals by U.S.-based oil consultants DeGolyer and MacNaughton and oilfield services company Halliburton (HAL.N) had confirmed Bahrain’s find of “highly significant quantities of oil in place ... with tight oil amounting to at least 80 billion barrels, and deep gas reserves in the region of 10-20 trillion cubic feet,” Oil Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al-Khalifa said. Tight oil is a form of light crude oil held in shale deep below the earth’s surface that is extracted with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, using deep horizontal wells. “Agreement has been reached with Halliburton to commence drilling on two further appraisal wells in 2018, to further evaluate reservoir potential, optimise completions, and initiate long-term production,” Sheikh Mohammed told a news conference in Manama.   He said he was not sure yet how much of the estimated 80 billion barrels was recoverable, but the kingdom aims to attract foreign oil and gas firms to develop the resources. “The newly discovered resource, which officials expect to be ‘on production’ within five years, is expected to provide significant and long-term positive benefits to the kingdom’s economy – both directly and indirectly through downstream activities in related industries,” Bahrain’s National Communication Centre said in a statement. Sadad al-Husseini, a former senior executive at Saudi Aramco and now an energy consultant, said the discovery was positive news for Bahrain, but more data gathering, evaluation and well testing needed to follow to determine whether there are any future commercial opportunities in the resources.  “Converting resource estimates to reserves is an intense and costly process and not all the resources may ultimately be upgraded to reserves,” he said.  “The additional drilling and data gathering will serve to improve the accuracy and reliability of the estimate.” Bahrain, which is rated junk by all three major credit rating agencies, revealed the oil discovery just a few days after yields on its international bonds spiked as investors became more concerned about its rising public debt levels. Officials did not give a specific figure on Wednesday for expected production levels from the new field, but the daily Al Ayam quoted the head of the financial and economic committee in parliament, Abdulrahman Bu Ali, as saying output was expected to be 200,000 barrels per day. The small non-OPEC Gulf oil producer, with around 124.6 million barrels of proven reserves, gets it oil revenues from two fields: the onshore Bahrain field, and the offshore Abu Safah field, which is shared jointly with Saudi Arabia. The Bahrain field, produced around 50,000 bpd in 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia split annual revenues from the 300,000 bpd Abu Safah offshore field where production is overseen by Saudi Aramco.  The Bahraini government earned $4.3 billion in oil and gas revenue last year and ran a budget deficit of $2.7 billion.

2018-04-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled slightly lower on Wednesday, as a surprise draw in U.S. crude stockpiles triggered a rebound from session lows hit after China proposed a broad range of tariffs on U.S. exports that fed fears of a trade war. Both Brent and U.S. crude slid to two-week lows after China, the world’s largest importer of raw materials, hit back at the Trump administration’s plan to levy tariffs on $50 billion (35.5 billion pounds) of its goods, proposing duties on a broad range of U.S. imports. Brent hit a session low of $66.69 and U.S. crude slumped as low as $62.06. “I have high confidence that it will stagnate economic growth,” said Michael McAllister, exploration and production equity analyst at MUFG in New York. “It would be negative for pricing,” he added. But by the end of the session, Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost just 10 cents to settle at $68.02 a barrel, a 0.15 percent loss. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 14 cents to settle at $63.37 a barrel, off 0.22 percent. Prices pared losses after the Energy Information Administration released data showing U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell by 4.6 million barrels in the latest week. Analysts had expected an increase of 246,000 barrels. The drop in inventories came as refinery crude runs USOICR=ECI rose by 141,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates USOIRU=ECI rose by 0.7 percentage point. Prices were also helped by a turnaround in the U.S. stock market. Oil prices have recently closely tracked equities.  “Supported by a 4.617 million barrel weekly crude oil draw across the U.S., a solid upturn in equities encouraged buyers in WTI,” said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst and commodity futures broker at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “Yet, a 3.666 million barrel build at the Cushing, OK storage hub provided enough weight for a negative settlement.” A deal by OPEC and non-OPEC producers to get rid of excess supply has also supported prices. OPEC oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output, a Reuters survey found, sending compliance with a supply-cutting deal to another record.

2018-04-04,"RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - An attack on a Saudi tanker by Yemen’s Houthis will not hit oil supplies, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Wednesday, after the Iran-allied group said it had targeted a warship in response to an air strike that killed civilians. The Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition which includes other Sunni Muslim states says the Houthis attacked the oil tanker off Yemen’s main port of Hodeidah on Tuesday. The Houthis, however, say they targeted a coalition warship in response to an air strike on Hodeidah on Monday that killed at least a dozen civilians, including seven children. “The terrorist attack ... will not affect economic activity or stall oil supplies,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Twitter.  Saudi oil industry sources told Reuters that oil operations and shipments were proceeding as normal and that security around facilities inside the kingdom had not been raised further. “It was a minor attack. There was no impact, but the question is will it continue?” one of the sources said. The European Union’s naval force said the oil tanker was the vessel Abqaiq. Shipping data showed it was Saudi-flagged, carrying more than 2 million barrels of crude oil and destined for Ain Sukhna in Egypt. The tanker, whose owner Saudi shipping group Bahri did not immediately respond to a request for comment, was in international waters when it came under attack at around 1330 local time (1030 GMT), the coalition has said. Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told reporters on Wednesday the coalition had responded to the attack by bombing a facility for making and storing bomb-laden boats and coastal defence missiles. He said a weekend fire at Hodeidah port was sparked by another missile that misfired when the Houthis tried to launch it at a coalition ship. The blaze, which destroyed aid supplies, was blamed by port workers on an electrical short circuit.  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, have launched missiles at Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in the past few days. Saudi authorities said they had intercepted the missiles, although debris had killed one person. In April 2017, Saudi forces said they had foiled an attempt to blow up an Aramco fuel terminal in southern Saudi Arabia using a high-speed boat laden with explosives, alleging the Houthis were behind the attempt. The Saudi-led alliance has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting the Houthis, often hitting civilian areas, although it denies doing so intentionally. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the capital Sanaa and other parts of Yemen. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation.

2018-04-04,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Any move to negotiate with Israel would be an “unforgivable mistake”, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday, after Saudi Arabia’s crown prince said Israelis were entitled to live peacefully on their own land. Saudi Arabia - birthplace of Islam and site of its holiest shrines - does not officially recognise Israel, but Mohammed bin Salman’s comments, quoted in the U.S. magazine The Atlantic, are a further sign of an apparent thawing in bilateral ties. They come as mainly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia faces off against Shi’ite Iran in a regional power struggle. Tehran and Riyadh back opposing sides in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon. “Movement toward negotiation with the cheating, lying and oppressive regime (of Israel) is a big, unforgivable mistake that will push back the victory of the people of Palestine,” Khamenei said in a statement posted on his official website. The statement, which did not explicitly name Saudi Arabia, said it was the duty of all Muslims to support Palestinian resistance movements and it pledged continued Iranian backing for the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. After the crown prince’s comments, his father King Salman reiterated Saudi Arabia’s support for a Palestinian state. Riyadh has long maintained that normalising ties with Israel hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war - territory Palestinians seek for a future state. However, Saudi Arabia opened its air space for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel last month, which an Israeli official hailed as historic following two years of efforts. In November, an Israeli cabinet member disclosed covert contacts with Saudi Arabia, a rare acknowledgment of long-rumoured secret dealings which Riyadh still denies. Khamenei issued Wednesday’s statement in reply to a letter he recently received from Hamas chief Ismail Haniya which  criticised the support of Arab governments in the region for the United States.  Hamas, which is sworn to Israel’s destruction, dominates the small coastal strip of Gaza, where this week at least 17 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces. In his statement, Khamenei called on the people of Muslim countries to defeat Israel. “With an intense and planned struggle they should force the enemy to retreat toward the point of demise,” he said.

2018-04-04,"OSLO, April 4 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm DNO, which early on Wednesday bought a 15.4 percent stake in Faroe Petroleum, said after market close that it aims to further raise its holdings in the  British company to around 25 percent. DNO, which bought the initial stake from Israel’s Delek Group, will offer to buy up to 10 percent of Faroe’s shares from other owners by Thursday morning, although it does not plan a full takeover, it added. Britain’s takeover code dictates that a firm publishing a “no intention to bid statement” must refrain for at least six months from crossing the 30 percent ownership threshold, at which an obligation to make a mandatory offer is triggered. The Norwegian firm last year returned to the North Sea after years of expansion in the Middle East, with the aim of growing via acquisitions and other investment. “DNO now has decided to build a long term strategic shareholding in Faroe Petroleum and to support Faroe Petroleum management’s growth focused North Sea strategy,” it said. Faroe earlier in the day announced it had made significant discoveries in its Hades and Iris exploration prospects offshore Norway. A source close to Faroe said the company expected DNO to seek to appoint at least one new member to the Faroe board. The Norwegian firm was not immediately available for comment. Faroe’s shares closed 12.2 percent higher on Wednesday, having hit a four-year high.

2018-04-04,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Ruling Fidesz leads polls with stable base, fractured opposition * Fidesz will certainly stay largest party, polls show * But many Hungarians want change * Tactical voting may support strongest challengers By Marton Dunai BUDAPEST, April 4 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban leads the polls by a mile, his opposition is a bickering patchwork of smaller parties that won’t coordinate and he dominates the public agenda through his firm grip on the media. Yet there is still a chance - a slim chance - that he could lose his majority on Sunday. That’s because a growing number of voters - guided by widely publicised independent and party-sponsored surveys available online - may be set to discard ideology and party allegiances to vote for the candidates who are most likely to win. “Voters might actually do what these parties fail to do, which is vote for the candidate who has the best chance,” Csaba Toth, strategic director of local thinktank Republikon Institue. With a stable base of around two million voters - a quarter of the total - Orban will in all likelihood win a third consecutive term on April 8, his fourth overall, making him by far the longest serving premier in Hungary’s post-Communist history. But polls show voters are increasingly willing to vote tactically. On Wednesday Citibank gave a 10-15 percent chance that Fidesz would fail to get a parliamentary majority, injecting an unexpected note of uncertainty into an election long seen as a sure thing. Orban’s record is mixed: he has fixed the economy but unwound democratic freedoms, and while his opposition to migration has earned him success at home, it has sown distrust among his partners in the European Union. According to a March poll by thinktank Zavecz Research, as many as 46 percent of Hungarians voters want to see a change in government, against 40 percent who want Orban to stay. The remainder said they weren’t sure. “The forces who want a change in government ... have become ready to cooperate,” respected independent analyst Gabor Torok told the news web site 24.hu in February. “The prime minister has forged very strong ties with his voters, but in the meantime he completely alienated voters who want a government change.” The key to Orban’s success has been positioning his party in the centre against a fractured opposition of six parties, including leftists and the former far-right Jobbik, in an electoral system that tends to favour the winner. The potential for opposition success was shown in February in a municipal by-election in the Fidesz stronghold of Hodmezovasarhely, when the opposition parties fielded one candidate and won. Opposition voters want their parties to repeat the strategy nationally, withdrawing weaker candidates to leave a single challenger in each district, a survey from Median showed this week. Few opposition candidates have obliged, although on Wednesday the Socialists and a small liberal party, Egyutt, stepped aside in several districts, including the hotly contested Budapest district that includes parliament and the Buda Castle, leaving one leftist candidate and one for Jobbik. Zavecz Research published data on Wednesday showing that almost a third of Jobbik supporters polled in March were willing to support leftist candidates, up from 19 percent in February. Leftist voters were even more enthusiastic: 43 percent of them said they would vote for Jobbik if need be, up from 26 percent. Even if Fidesz is beaten, it will remain the largest and strongest party, said Republikon Institue’s Toth. Various polls in March showed Fidesz support in the 27-to-41 percent range, versus between 25 to 41 percent for all the opposition put together. One million voters would not comment. “Forcing Fidesz into a minority... is possible to do even under the present scenario,” Toth said. “If you actually want to emerge either in the left or Jobbik as bigger than Fidesz, that (requires) coordination. But that’s not a likely scenario today.” Hungarian voters will mark two ballots on Sunday: a list of individuals running for 106 seats from local districts and parties on the so-called national list, allocating 93 seats. The district elections are decided first past the post, favouring the largest party, which also skews the national list because the winner is able to pass to his or her party in the national list those excess votes that he or she did not need. In 2014, Fidesz won 96 of the districts and 45 percent of the votes on the national list, ending up with a two-thirds majority in parliament. The splintering of the opposition is on display in places like Miskolc, a former industrial city in the northeast where Fidesz, Jobbik and leftist parties came within five percentage points of each other in 2014. Fidesz won that contest. Today, polls suggest Fidesz and Jobbik are neck-and-neck in Miskolc and if voters opt for the strongest candidate instead of their favourite, Jobbik could win. “I really don’t care who wins as long as it’s not Fidesz,” said Margit Orehovszki, a local pensioner, as she headed for a Jobbik street forum. “I think Jobbik has a better chance, although I like the Socialists too.” Several surveys compiled by activist groups and pollsters using various methodologies, including one sponsored by Jobbik, have yielded lists of the strongest candidates in the most closely contested districts. The results, available on a website called “Orban Must Go”, are generally similar. Adam Sanyo, a 29-year-old data analyst, has built a web site called Tactical Voting that directs voters to opposition candidates he has identified as most likely to win, using data from the 2014 election and polls in the run-up to Sunday. His sparsely furnished living room is dominated by a large electoral map and a bank of screens. Post-it notes signify districts where the opposition has a chance. Budapest is nearly all pink, indicating as many as 18 potential leftist victories; the countryside has more than a dozen yellow Jobbik stickers. A high turnout is likely to benefit the opposition more than Fidesz, said Gabor Toka, who led the research effort of Country for All, launched a year ago by prominent activist Marton Gulyas to identify the strongest candidates in 25 districts. “In eastern Hungary especially, there has been a seismic shift,” Toka said. “Fidesz is no longer in the centre of the political spectrum. Which means that even if Jobbik and the leftists attack one another, their voters are ready to cooperate against Fidesz.” The groups hope to reach 1.5 million people in a targeted social media ad campaign in the days leading up to Sunday. “We know the districts where this can make a difference,” said organiser Katalin Igaz. “We need to reach people who may possibly entertain tactical voting, mobilise them and point them to the strongest candidate.” Their advice is that voters split their vote: support the strongest candidate locally and their party nationally. “If parties won’t agree on anything then civilians like me must press them or at least show who stands to win in every district,” Sanyo said.

2018-04-04,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) has entered into an agreement to buy 75 Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX narrowbody jets, worth $8.8 billion (£6.2 billion), to meet passenger demand which has shown no sign of abating after years of growth. Jet Airways, in a filing to the stock exchange late on Tuesday, did not say whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. The jets would be worth $8.8 billion at list prices, though airlines typically receive significant discounts from manufacturers. Shares of Jet Airways rose as much as 3.2 percent in Wednesday morning trade, and were trading up 1.4 percent at 0610 GMT. The wider Mumbai market .BSESN was up 0.25 percent.  The latest agreement comes as Indian airlines rush to expand fleets to meet ever-increasing demand for domestic as well as international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (AIR.PA). Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy. Domestic passenger traffic increased 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier for the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, showed data from the International Air Transport Association. Jet Airways Chief Executive Vinay Dube last month told reporters the airline was hoping to close the latest deal by the end of March. The airline finalised a separate deal to buy 75 other Boeing 737 MAX aircraft last year.

2018-04-04,"FRANKFURT/MADRID (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) sought on Wednesday to end a row with Spanish utility Iberdrola (IBE.MC) over the running of Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC), the world’s second-largest wind turbine maker. Iberdrola is unhappy with Siemens’ influence over Siemens Gamesa following a merger last year which left it with 8.1 percent and Siemens with 59 percent of the combined firm. The conflict came to a head at Siemens Gamesa’s annual general meeting last month when several motions by Iberdrola, which was previously Gamesa’s top shareholder, were dismissed. “Iberdrola is both a very valued customer and an important shareholder of Siemens Gamesa. We’re long term partners in many ways,” Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said after meeting Iberdrola CEO Ignacio Galan on Wednesday. Kaeser said Siemens and Iberdrola had an ongoing and open dialogue, while Iberdrola declined to comment. However, a source with knowledge of the meeting said the Spanish group was not satisfied and that it would continue to push for more transparency at Siemens Gamesa. Wind turbine manufacturers are facing relentless pricing pressure as governments slash subsidies for renewables to force them into competition with conventional energy sources. Shares in Siemens Gamesa have lost 38 percent since the merger became effective last year, compared with a 25-percent decline at Danish sector-leader Vestas (VWS.CO). “It’s understandable that some shareholders weren’t happy - nor were we,” Kaeser said, adding that Siemens will nevertheless remain a committed long-term shareholder in Siemens Gamesa.

2018-04-04,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Wall Street falls on China tariffs but pares losses * Dollar weakens vs yen, Swiss franc on trade tensions * Oil skids on trade war fear, bounces on U.S. inventory By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened and global stock markets fell on Wednesday after China retaliated in an escalating trade war with the United States, unnerving investors who were reluctant to take positions in anything but the safest of assets. Oil dropped to a two-week low as the speed with which Beijing responded - 11 hours - to U.S. measures raised the prospect of a quickly spiraling trade war that could hurt the global economy and dent crude demand. Gold hit a one-week high as the dollar dipped against the yen and Swiss franc, while prices of U.S. Treasury securities and German bunds gained on safe-haven buying. Boeing and Caterpillar led a slide in big U.S. manufacturers and technology companies that bore the brunt of the deepening U.S.-China trade spat, while Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX index fell more than its large European counterparts. But stocks on Wall Street and in Europe pulled back from more than 1 percent declines, paring a chunk of their losses with the FTSE in London closing higher. “The market is overreacting to this trade news,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “These tariffs won’t be implemented for a little while. It gives both sides time to negotiate, which I think is the strategy for both the U.S. and China.” China’s retaliation came after trading hours for Japan’s Nikkei, which added 0.2 percent in thin volume, while Chinese blue chips ended down 0.2 percent. MSCI’s all-country world index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.45 percent, cutting about half earlier losses. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 0.43 percent. The FTSE index closed up 0.05 percent, while the DAX closed down 0.39 percent and France’s CAC 40 index fell 0.18 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 145.05 points, or 0.6 percent, to 23,888.31. The S&P 500 lost 8.86 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,605.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.37 points, or 0.09 percent, to 6,934.92. Shares of Boeing, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, tumbled 2.6 percent. Caterpillar fell 1.67 percent. China and the United States are likely to hold prolonged negotiations on trade and lead investors to recognize equity fundamentals remain strong as the results of first-quarter corporate earnings will show in coming weeks, Arone said. “My view is this is more trade poker than it is trade policy,” he said. The dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.2 percent to $1.2293. The Japanese yen firmed 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 106.58 per dollar. Crude bounced off session lows after U.S. data showed a weekly decline in crude stocks, instead of the increase analysts had expected. U.S. crude was down 42 cents to $63.09 per barrel and Brent slid 41 cents to $67.71. Borrowing costs nudged lower in Europe even as the first March reading on euro zone inflation, important data for markets as the European Central Bank looks to wind down its massive monetary stimulus, came in firm at 1.4 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last were little changed in price to yield 2.7826 percent. Germany’s 10-year bund rose in price to yield 0.499 percent.

2018-04-04,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s state oil company Pertamina said on Wednesday a cracked underwater pipeline was the cause of an oil spill off the coast of a port city on Borneo island that has prompted a major clean-up operation in the area. Authorities rushed to contain the spill off Balikpapan, which started on Saturday and sparked a fire that killed four people at the weekend. TV footage has shown officials scooping up buckets of oil from the sea and dumping them in pits on shore. “The pipe was found ... in a broken condition. There were external factors that caused that,” said Togar MP, general manager of Pertamina’s refinery in Balikpapan. “We are still calculating the volume of the leak and losses,” he said at a news conference in Balikpapan, adding the leak was of crude oil. It was not immediately clear if the pipeline had been repaired. A government official in Jakarta said it was unclear what had caused the leak. “It could be that the pipeline is rusty or an anchor hit it,” said Djoko Siswanto, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry. The state energy firm said on Sunday initial tests showed the oil was marine oil used in boats. Balikpapan city, a major mining and energy hub, declared a state of emergency on Monday, warning residents to stay away from the coast because the area was prone to fires.

2018-04-04,"(Adds details, context) MOSCOW, April 4 (Reuters) - Oil production at the giant Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan fell to 210,000-211,000 barrels per day (bpd) in late March-early April, the Kazakh energy ministry said on Wednesday. Output fell from normal levels of 310,000 bpd but the ministry told Reuters that production would return to those levels from April 17. It said the drop was due to repair and maintenance works and the suspension of gas injection, a process which helps boost pressure and hence output from the offshore field in the Caspian. Kashagan is operated by Eni, Total, Shell , ExxonMobil, Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz , China’s CNPC and Japan’s Inpex. One of the biggest oil discoveries in recent history, its development has been plagued by technical issues, delays and cost overruns. The field finally began stable commercial production in late 2016, 11 years behind the original schedule.

2018-04-04,"* India to discuss development plan next week * Iran limits India’s role to just production of gas By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, April 4 (Reuters) - India is set to offer a $3-4 billion development plan for the Farzad B gas field to Iran next week after Tehran reduced the scope of the project, two sources familiar with the matter said. Relations between the two countries, which have long held deep trade ties, were strained last year after Iran sought other investors for the field and media reports suggested Tehran would award it to Russia’s Gazprom. In retaliation, India directed its state refiners to cut oil imports from Iran. At a meeting in New Delhi in February, Iran reduced the scope of the development plan for the Farzad B field and asked India to submit a revised proposal, said the two sources, who did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. New Delhi and Tehran have been trying to narrow differences over Farzad B development rights since its discovery by Indian firms led by ONGC Videsh, the foreign investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corp, in 2008. Indian companies were hoping to get rights to develop the asset as the South Asian nation was one of the handful of nations that continued to deal with Iran during years of sanctions against the country over its nuclear programme. The new terms confine Indian companies to just production of gas and development of the field, said the two sources. Although a formal offer is yet to be made, sources said, the new bid would be between $3 billion and $4 billion and would not include gas processing and development of downstream projects. “As the negotiations are still ongoing, we would not like to comment at this stage,” ONGC Videsh said in response to a Reuters’ email seeking comments. At the request of Iran, Indian companies last year submitted a $11-billion development proposal that covered the development of upstream activities and downstream infrastructure. The field is estimated to hold 22 trillion cubic feet (tcf)of reserves, of which 16 tcf are deemed recoverable. India and Iran will discuss the revised development plan for the field next week, during Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh’s visit to New Delhi. To strengthen its ties with India, Iran has offered a higher freight discount on oil sales, besides agreeing to consider India’s demand for a stake in a producing field, sources told Reuters last month. In return, India has agreed to boost oil imports from Iran, India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last month after a meeting with Zanganeh in Delhi.

2018-04-04,"SHANGHAI, April 4 (Reuters) - As trade tensions rise between the United States and China, a small but vocal online community is calling for a boycott of U.S. products, fanning fears that American brands could see a backlash similar to that faced by South Korea last year. China on Wednesday hit back at the Trump administration’s plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, retaliating with a list of duties on key U.S. imports with similar value including soybeans, planes, cars, whiskey and chemicals. “Counterattack in trade war” was the third most-read topic on China’s Weibo microblogging platform on Wednesday, viewed about 230 million times, while an editorial published the same day in the state-backed English-language tabloid Global Times warning the United States against an entering a trade war drew roughly 7,000 comments. “The sons and daughters of China should unite and boycott U.S. products, modern war is conducted by the people,” said one Weibo user with the handle “Deanliu1314”. A commenter on the Global Times article said, “if they resist Chinese products, the United States won’t be able to find an alternative. But if we boycott all U.S. products, China-made products can easily fill the gap”. Products online commenters called for boycotting included Boeing  planes, Apple products, U.S. soybeans and even American graduate schools, with others saying that they could repeat what Chinese shoppers had done to South Korea. “I resolutely support all trade measures China is taking against the United States,” said another user who said he would boycott U.S. and South Korean products. “It starts with me.” However, there was no evidence yet of an organised campaign to stoke anti-U.S. behaviour, or that consumers were yet shunning U.S. goods in any numbers. Trade and business exchanges between South Korea and China turned chilly last year after South Korea deployed the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system despite vehement objections from Beijing. The THAAD disagreement prompted an undeclared Chinese boycott of products ranging from South Korean cosmetics to cars, and was estimated to have knocked about 0.4 percentage points off South Korea’s expected economic growth in 2017. The highest profile corporate casualty was South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, which saw its plans for mega shopping complexes indefinitely suspended and nearly all of its Lotte Mart stores in China shut for much of the year over alleged fire safety issues. Ben Cavender, an analyst at Shanghai-based China Market Research Group, said U.S. businesses in China such as Starbucks were more firmly entrenched in the country, making them less likely to receive similar treatment. “A lot of the brands are employing Chinese workers, essentially they’re Chinese companies in their own right,” he said. However, he warned that everyday consumption goods could nonetheless be hit. “You can see consumers saying we’re not going to buy a Ford , or a GM product, and we’re going to buy a European product or a Chinese product instead,” he said. Jim Boyce, a Beijing-based wine consultant who writes the blog Grapewallofchina, said while there were concerns that the duties would make U.S. wine less cost-competitive, the greater worry was over the image the trade war would generate for U.S. goods. On Monday, China imposed extra tariffs on imports of American goods including wine, in response to U.S. duties on steel and aluminium imports. “Are we going to see people in China worried about drinking American wine because of politics? That’s the bigger problem,” he said. Christopher Beros, trade director for China and the Pacific Rim at the California Wine Institute, which represented roughly 1,000 California wineries, said the issue was making him nervous. “We do see collective thinking from time to time, and if someone gets stigmatised in a way, that’s always a concern.” (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Additional Reporting by SHANGHAI Newsroom Editing by Tony Munroe and Alex Richardson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-backlash/trade-tensions-stoke-worries-of-anti-u-s-backlash-in-china-idUKL5N1RH1B1,04 Apr 2018,"As trade tensions rise between

2018-04-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output, a Reuters survey found, sending compliance with a supply-cutting deal to another record. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.19 million barrels per day last month, the survey found, down 90,000 bpd from February. The March total is the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys. OPEC is reducing output by about 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to get rid of excess supply. The pact started in January 2017 and runs until the end of 2018. Adherence by producers in the deal rose to 159 percent of agreed cuts from 154 percent in February, the survey found. There was no sign that other producers had boosted output to cash in on higher prices or to compensate for the Venezuelan decline. Oil has topped $71 a barrel LCOc1 this year for the first time since 2014, and was trading above $67 on Wednesday. Still, OPEC says supply restraints should be maintained to ensure the end of a glut that had built up since 2014. In March, the biggest decrease in supply came from Angola, which exported 48 cargoes, two fewer than in the same month of 2017. Natural declines at some fields are weighing on output. Production in Libya, which remains unstable due to unrest, slipped because of stoppages at two fields, El Feel and El Sharara, setting back 2018’s partial recovery in output. And production fell further in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of an economic crisis. Output dropped to 1.56 million bpd in March, the survey found, a new long-term low. Output in OPEC’s largest producer, Saudi Arabia, dropped by 40,000 bpd from February’s revised level, even further below the kingdom’s target. OPEC’s No. 2 producer, Iraq, pumped more. Exports from the south, the outlet for most of the country’s crude, rose despite maintenance at a loading terminal. Exports declined from the north but domestic crude use increased. Among others with higher output, the biggest rise came from the United Arab Emirates, where production had dropped in February due to maintenance. Even so, the UAE is still pumping below its OPEC target and showing higher compliance than in 2017. Output climbed in Qatar, after a dip in February that sources attributed to maintenance. Nigeria also pumped at a higher level, extending a run of more stable supply from Africa’s top exporter. Nigeria and Libya were originally exempt from cutting supply because their output had been curbed by conflict and unrest. For 2018, both told OPEC that output would not exceed 2017 levels. OPEC has an implied production target for 2018 of 32.73  million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and taking into account changes of membership since, plus Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output. According to the survey, OPEC pumped about 540,000 bpd below this implied target in March, not least because of the involuntary decline in Venezuela. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-04-04,"PARIS (Reuters) - Ten rights groups urged French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday to use a visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to press him to end a blockade of Yemeni ports and work for a diplomatic solution to the conflict there. Pressure is mounting on Macron to scale back military support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million.  With Prince Mohammed arriving in France on Sunday for a three-day visit, lawmakers and rights groups want Macron to suspend weapons sales to the two countries, which are among its biggest purchasers. “The bombing of civilians in Yemen must stop and we call on all sides in the conflict to stop them immediately,” Anne Hery of Handicap International said.  “Ahead of the visit of Crown Prince Mohammed, President Macron has a choice: protect civilians or sell weapons.” Some European countries, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition. But France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit. However, Paris has grown increasingly concerned by a worsening humanitarian situation and in December Macron called for a “complete lifting” of a Saudi blockade on Yemen. The alliance, which includes other Sunni Muslim states, has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting Houthi fighters and has often hit civilian areas, although it denies ever doing so intentionally. “France has to have a larger discussion not just about the sale of arms, but the blockade of this country. That strategy hasn’t worked,” Jonathan Cunliffe, Director of Middle East operations for Action Against Hunger, told reporters. Prince Mohammed’s visit comes at a delicate moment in French-Saudi relations. Ex-president Francois Hollande nurtured closer ties with Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab states, in particular Saudi Arabia, as Paris took a tough stance on Iran during nuclear negotiations. Hollande awarded former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef France’s highest honour the Legion d’Honneur in 2016.  However, the 32-year-old new crown prince has in past months emphasised closer ties with U.S. President Donald Trump just as Macron has sought to improve relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s Shi’ite rival for regional influence. “Prince Salman deserves neither the Legion d’Honneur nor the red carpet, he deserves sanctions,” said Benedicte Jeannerod, director of Human Rights Watch in France.

2018-04-04,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Options open interest by month: tmsnrt.rs/2q9NoKP * Call options by strike: tmsnrt.rs/2q2M6RC By Andy Home LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Is that it for the zinc price or does the market have one last hurrah before the bull cycle turns? London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc for three-month delivery hit a 10-year high of $3,595.50 per tonne on Feb. 15, the culmination of a gradual but relentless tightening of the supply chain that had been playing out over several years. Since then zinc has been dragged lower in the broader risk-off pull-back in the industrial metals space and is currently trading either side of the $3,250-per tonne level. Analysts, such as Max Layton of Citi, believe there is still the potential for one last leg higher to $3,800-4,000 per tonne. But time is running out. “The zinc price in the next three to six months is the best we’re going to see for the next three to five years,” he told last month’s Metal Bulletin Zinc Conference in London. The LME options market seems to agree, judging by the concentration of bull positioning over the next three months. Thereafter, open interest drops off sharply until December, when bearish views predominate. The consensus, it seems, is for zinc’s bull cycle to peak sooner rather than later before a multi-year down cycle. But zinc confounded the bulls several times on the way up. Might it equally confound the bears on the way down? Graphic on LME zinc options open interest, calls and puts, through December: tmsnrt.rs/2q9NoKP Graphic on LME zinc call options by major month and major strike: tmsnrt.rs/2q2M6RC The landscape of options positioning in the zinc market can’t tell us where the price is going, but it does give a fair idea of where the market thinks the price might be going. And in the short term the market still seems to be collectively bullish. The number of call options, which confer the right to buy, dwarfs the amount of put options, which confer the right to sell, in April, May and June. The April options expire today but as of last night’s close there were 9,006 lots (225,150 tonnes) of call option open interest versus just 4,503 lots of put open interest. The upside skew is even more extreme in June with 18,349 tonnes of open interest on calls versus 4,301 lots on puts. The June market positioning is clustered on three main strike prices, namely $3,500 (7,902 lots), $3,700 (8,200 lots) and $4,000 (1,628 lots). The very highest strike price open is $4,400, with 40 lots sitting there on each of the front three months. After June, however, options open interest falls off a cliff up to December, which tends to be a liquid month for options positioning in any given year. And although there are 4 lots of wildly optimistic call options open on the $5,000 strike in December, upside interest is eclipsed by downside put option positioning. The market, in other words, appears to agree with the view of Citi’s Layton and other analysts. If there’s going to be one last bull hurrah, it’s going to happen by July, after which options open interest and bull exuberance both plummet. This narrative of one last price peak is predicated on a building supply response to recent high prices. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) expects some 880,000 tonnes of additional mine supply to enter the market this year, according to Joao Jorge, the Group’s director of market research, speaking at the same London conference. The ILZSG is forecasting mine production growth to accelerate from 3.6 percent in 2017 to 6.0 percent this year. The mine surge will result from a combination of restarts, such as that announced by Glencore last December and new mines such as Vedanta’s Gamsberg project in South Africa. The single biggest addition to global supply, however, will come from the Century zinc mine in Australia. Century closed in 2015 but New Century Resources aims to produce zinc concentrates from the old tailings at the mine site. The company is guiding towards a restart of activity in the third quarter of this year with a one-year ramp-up to full capacity of 264,000 tonnes per year of contained metal. That’s around half of what Century was capable of producing in its heyday. Century, it’s worth remembering, repeatedly dashed bulls’ hopes in the long build-up to this year’s high prices by staying open much longer than expected. The very fact it is coming back at all is astonishing, but will new Century, like old Century, spring more surprises on the unwary, this time by taking longer to ramp up than expected? If you’re looking to the concentrates part of the market for an answer, you’re in for a disappointment. This year’s benchmark treatment charges for the processing of concentrates into metal should provide some insight into the state of play in the raw materials segment of the supply chain. But after two fruitless rounds of meetings smelters and miners are still far apart on how much new supply to expect and how quickly to expect it. Uncertainty around these changing supply dynamics this year is going to remain a key unknown for many months. A more immediate threat to the zinc consensus might come from visible stocks. LME inventory has fallen from almost 900,000 tonnes in 2012 to a current 209,500 tonnes, just about all of it in the U.S. port of New Orleans. The occasional “arrival” of more zinc in LME warehouses in the city, such as the 79,000 tonnes that were warranted in a single day on March 2, has unsettled the market. There’s nothing new to this New Orleans zinc roundabout but with visible stocks so low, what’s happening to “invisible” stocks sitting in off-market storage takes on added significance. Quite evidently, if more zinc miraculously turns up in the Big Easy, it puts at risk the potential for that widely-anticipated bull charge to new 10-year highs. There again, with only 143,225 tonnes of LME stocks available, the London price is going to remain highly sensitive to further cancellations and drawdowns. Maybe that’s what the bull with the December calls on the $5,000 strike price is hoping for. No-one else is, though.

2018-04-04,"* Sierra Gorda to produce 15-20 percent less this year * Centerra has no plans to restart moly mines at the moment * But Centerra is updating restart plans the mines By Pratima Desai LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Healthy demand for molybdenum rich stainless steel, especially from the oil and gas industry, plus sluggish supply growth are expected to keep the price of this minor metal riding high. Molybdenum MLY-OXIDE-LON prices at nearly $13 a lb are at their highest since 2014, having more than doubled since Dec. 2015. Often a byproduct of copper smelting, molybdenum’s powerful anti-corrosive properties are vital for equipment used in the oil and gas sectors. A rally in crude oil prices to around $70 a barrel from below $30 a barrel in Jan. 2016, has revived exploration and growth plans and molydenum demand. “Molybdenum is used in exploration, drilling, production and refining,” said CRU Group consultant George Heppel, adding that high prices were needed to encourage primary production from top producer China. “The trend over the next 5 years is one of very low supply growth from by-product sources. In the early-2020s, we will need to see primary mines reopened to keep the market balanced.” Analysts estimate around 60 percent of global molybdenum supply comes as a byproduct of copper smelting, with most of the remainder coming from primary sources. CRU forecasts molybdenum demand at 577 million lbs this year, of which 16 percent will come from oil and gas. That is below the historic pre-2014 average of 20 percent, but still a notable increase over recent years. “The oil price crash back in 2014 removed about 15 million lbs of moly demand,” Heppel said. “Demand now looks healthy.” Crude’s slide started in 2014 when Saudi Arabia turned on the oil taps to defend market share, while molybdenum prices crashed two-thirds to below $5 a lb between August 2014 and November 2015. Wood Mackenzie expects global oil and gas exploration spending to fall this year. But this slide masks a modest uptick in drilling activity as lower rig rates and a focused approach on well-charted basins allow firms to do more with their money. The consultancy sees U.S. onshore producers, focusing primarily on shale gas, ramping up annual activity from $64 billion in 2017 to $90 billion in 2020. “We’re seeing a pick up in tubular goods used in the North American shale gas market,” said David Merriman, a senior analyst at metals consultancy Roskill. “There’s a strong correlation between moly demand and active drill counts.” Molybdenum is also used to make superalloys for aerospace and lighter, higher strength steels for cars. Demand in both industries is also picking up. “There isn’t really a shortage at the moment, but supply could become a problem,” a molybdenum trader said. Top producers include Chile, where state-owned Codelco’s IPO-CIU.L 28,700 tonnes of moly output last year compares with 30,600 tonnes in 2016. The lower production is due to the lower molybdenum grade in its Chuquicamata mine, a Codelco spokesperson said. The Sierra Gorda mine in Chile, in which Polish copper miner KGHM has a 55 percent stake, produced nearly 36 million pounds in 2017. A KGHM spokesperson said output this year will be 15-20 percent lower because of lower ore grades. “In China, it’s to do with cutting pollution, but with prices where they are Chinese producers may rethink shutdowns,” the molybdenum trader said. Higher prices could also incentivise the restart of the Thomson Creek mine in Idaho owned by Centerra , which also has a majority stake in Endako in British Columbia. These two mines produced more than 29 million lbs of moly in 2014, since which time both have been on care & maintenance. “There are no plans to restart the mines at this point in time,” a spokesperson for Centerra said. “But we are updating our restart plans, to see how long it would take, how much it would cost, what personnel we would need and timings.” Reporting by Pratima Desai Additional reporting by Fabian Cambero Editing by Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/metals-molybdenum/revitalised-demand-growth-to-buttress-molybdenum-prices-idUKL8N1RD0AN,04 Apr 2018,"Healthy demand for molybdenum

U.S. shares rose on Tuesday on the view that President Donald Trump’s Twitter attacks on retailer Amazon would not translate into actual policy. Yet trade worries were never far away. Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of annual imports from China, covering about 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products. China responded with penalties on $50 billion of U.S. goods ranging from soybeans, cars and chemicals to whisky, cigars and tobacco with its Vice Finance Minister stressing the country had never given in to external pressure. The moves triggered further heavy selling in global stock markets and commodities, with U.S. stock futures sliding 1.4 percent, soybean futures plunging 4.5 percent and the dollar and China’s yuan both hit. In Europe, London’s FTSE, Paris’s CAC40 and the export-heavy German DAX fell between 0.6 percent and 1.2 percent. “The market should be focused on it because it’s (U.S. protectionist measures are) bad news,” fund manager Ashmore’s head of research, Jan Dehn, said. Trump denied on Wednesday that the United States was in a trade war with China. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s head Angel Gurria said the U.S. exports $150 billion of goods a year to China whereas China exports $500 billion to the U.S., meaning China’s tariffs were therefore not proportional. The swing in risk sentiment put the pep back into bonds, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt down three basis points at 2.75 percent. Borrowing costs also nudged lower in Europe even as the first March reading on euro zone inflation, important data for markets as the European Central Bank looks to wind down its massive monetary stimulus, came in firm at 1.4 percent. Benchmark Bund yields slipped back under 0.50 percent , just off 2-1/2 month lows hit last week. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had spent most of its session dithering either side of flat before ending 0.3 percent lower. China’s retaliation came after trading hours for Japan’s Nikkei, which added 0.2 percent in thin volumes and Chinese blue chips ended down 0.2 percent. South Korea saw the big move, dropping 1.4 percent. Emerging market stocks, which have proved resilient to trade tensions, tumbled 1.6 percent and turned negative on the year. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were also pointing to New York opening between 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent down. Boeing shares fell 7.2 percent in pre-market trading. China’s duties on major U.S. imports included aircraft. The dollar dropped to 106.14 yen, after edging up from a low of 105.70 on Tuesday. The euro hovered at $1.2287 , after easing from a high of $1.2335 overnight, while the dollar index was 0.2 percent lower at 90. “It is not our view to expect risk aversion to sustainably rise, even though nervousness is indeed high,” Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri said in the Reuters Global Markets Forum. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar both held firm after hitting a nearly five-month and five-week highs respectively in recent days on growing optimism about the prospect of a NAFTA trade deal. Investors also seemed to be keeping their nerve on the global economic outlook after a host of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) showed some slowing, but from lofty levels in many regions. Activity in Japan’s service sector also grew at its slowest pace in 17 months last month, British shop prices dropped at the fastest pace for more than a year while Australian February building approvals fell 6.2 percent. “If global PMIs slow and avoid overheating concerns, that is good for risk appetite. If they slow for ‘the wrong reasons’ like trade protectionism, that is much more worrying,” Deutsche Bank global strategist Alan Ruskin said. “The March data is at the most a very early warning shot for policymakers not to get too complacent on global growth resilience,” he said. Trade wars were a particular concern for developing Asia, where South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Indonesia, and India reported a slowing in factory activity. In commodity markets, gold jumped 0.85 percent to $1,343 an ounce, recovering some of Tuesday’s losses.

2018-04-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Italian energy group Edison (EDNn.MI), part of French utility EDF (EDF.PA), is preparing the sale of its oil and gas unit, the latest power producer to abandon fossil fuels to focus on its retail business, four industry sources said.  Edison has selected investment banks Rothschild (ROTH.PA) and Perella Weinberg to organise an auction for the exploration and production division, which could be valued at $2 billion (1.43 billion pounds) to $3 billion, one of the sources said. The company has been looking to increase the size of its domestic electricity and gas retail business, betting on the market opening up to more competition, with retail energy customers increasingly able to chose their supplier. Edison and EDF declined to comment. Rothschild declined to comment. Perella Weinberg did not respond to a request for comment.  Edison, 99.48 percent owned by EDF, is the third biggest power producer in Italy after market leader Enel (ENEI.MI) and Eni (ENI.MI). It is also the third biggest gas wholesaler with a 6 percent share, compared with market leader Eni’s 83 percent. EDF took control of Edison in 2012. Edison’s oil and gas production has grown sharply over the past decade, with activities focused in Italy, the British and Norwegian North Sea, Egypt, Israel, Algeria, Croatia and the Falkland Islands. Its Egyptian assets, which include the Abu Qir concession and more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent in reserves, are considered one of the most attractive parts of the portfolio, according to the sources. Edison tried selling its North Sea oil and gas business last year but was unable to find a buyer, according to bankers involved in the process. The company’s gas production rose to over 2 billion cubic metres in 2017 from around 1.9 billion cubic metres a year earlier while oil production declined slightly to around 4 billion barrels from 4.14 billion barrels in 2016, according to its annual 2017 figures. The company said in 2017 it would stop investing in the upstream business and focus on the distribution of oil and gas. It has also said in the past that it would create a new company to manage its upstream business.  Over the past few years, Europe’s power sector has been hit by weak energy demand amid sluggish economic growth, low wholesale power prices and a surge in demand for cleaner renewable energy which is replacing gas and coal-fired power plants and disrupting business models for utilities. Traditional European utilities, which entered oil and gas production in the past seeking a hedge against fluctuating costs of hydrocarbons, have been forced to rethink their strategies. France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) sold its exploration and production business to private equity-backed Neptune Energy for 4.7 billion euros ($5.77 billion) last year, while German utility RWE (RWEG.DE) divested its oil and gas production unit DEA in 2015.

2018-04-04,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's BRI initiative: tmsnrt.rs/2njAVmw By Clyde Russell HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters) - China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is one of those rare things that virtually everybody seems to have heard about, but equally, very few people can actually claim to have a detailed understanding of what it means. This dichotomy was in evidence at the Belt and Road conference, hosted by Mines and Money, in Hong Kong on Tuesday, with views ranging from the BRI will be the driver of a new super-cycle for commodities to that it’s more of a marketing slogan aimed at boosting the image and influence of the government in Beijing. On the side of thinking of the BRI as a sort of a Marshall plan for Asia, Africa and even Europe are a set of impressive sounding numbers, which dwarf the scale of the U.S. initiative that helped to rebuild Europe after World War II. The heart of the BRI is effectively building vast numbers of infrastructure and energy projects across at least 70 countries that are home to a total of 65 percent of the world’s population and some 40 percent of its economic output. The centrepiece of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s economic programme also involves developing the mines and oil and gas fields necessary to supply the raw materials for this vast undertaking. For its supporters, the BRI is the vehicle by which less developed countries will supercharge their growth and lift their populations out of poverty. Asian countries need to spend $1.7 trillion annually on infrastructure in the coming years, more than double the current investment rate, Rani Jarkas, chairman of the advisory firm Cedrus Group, told the Hong Kong event. It’s these sort of numbers that are getting commodity investors and producers excited, as that level of spending will require huge amounts of iron ore for steel, coal for making cement, and metals such as copper and zinc. But just as the big picture sounds very encouraging, scratching below the rhetoric reveals that the BRI may not be quite as big a deal as many expect. One of the questions I have posed at several conferences and events where the BRI is a focus is to ask the audience to think of their top five BRI projects, what they know about them and how much they will add to commodity demand. This causes most people to stumble, and bear in mind that the attendees at these events are drawn from the resource sector, either as producers, traders, buyers or financiers. What becomes apparent is that the BRI is currently more of a high-level political initiative that China is using as a diplomatic tool to expand its influence, especially in central, south and southeast Asia as well as Africa. There doesn’t appear to be a coordinated strategy for building the land transport corridors linking China to Europe through Asia, or for the maritime projects that take in Africa as well. What emerges is that Chinese companies, both the large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and smaller companies are using the BRI initiative as a vehicle when seeking investment opportunities. These opportunities still seem more focused on meeting the needs of the Chinese companies, rather than as part of a policy-driven effort to develop the BRI target countries. The flagship vehicle of the BRI, the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), started operations from its Beijing headquarters at the start of 2016, so it’s somewhat unrealistic to expect it to already be a major factor driving BRI investment. It has approved $4.26 billion in loans so far, according to data on its website, and although that’s somewhat more than small change, it’s also a far cry from the trillions of dollars in investment that those backers of the BRI say will be delivered. It also appears the case that virtually any Chinese foreign investment, with the exception of property, is being classified as related to the BRI. This helps make it look like the BRI is something significant, rather than a collection of unrelated projects being undertaken by separate companies with little or no coordination. However, just because the BRI seems somewhat haphazard right now, doesn’t mean it will remain that way. “It may be the great project of this century, it may be nothing. But you have to be involved no matter what,” is how one investor put it at the conference. For commodity producers the takeaway is that the Chinese are increasingly interested in developing resources that they believe will meet domestic needs, and those of the BRI. These include battery metals such as cobalt, lithium and nickel, but also copper and iron ore. The answer to whether the BRI is indeed the start of a new super-cycle for commodities will become apparent if Beijing can successfully change the process from a slogan to a coordinated, multilateral initiative that produces actual results.

2018-04-04,"* New development structure for field after Shell pulls out * Political tensions have delayed offshore project * Palestinians hope to become energy exporter By Nidal al-Mughrabi GAZA, April 4 (Reuters) - The Palestinians are seeking to sell a 45 percent stake in a gas field off Gaza to help to develop the project, its main stakeholder, the Palestine Investment Fund, said on Wednesday after Royal Dutch Shell announced it had pulled out. Gaza Marine, about 30 km (20 miles) off the Gaza coast, has long been seen as an opportunity for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority to join the Mediterranean gas bonanza, providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid. But Palestinian political disputes and conflict with Israel, as well as economic factors, have delayed plans to develop the field, and Shell had struggled to find a buyer for its 55 percent stake in the field, which it took over as part of its acquisition of BG Group in 2016. Shell said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) to divest its interest in Gaza Marine. The PIF, a sovereign wealth fund, said that under a new structure agreed with the Palestinian Authority, the PIF and its investment partner, CC Oil and Gas Ltd, would each hold 27.5 percent of development rights, and a future foreign operator would have 45 percent. The PIF said the new structure would give momentum to “one of Palestine’s most vital, strategic assets”, fuel power plants in Gaza and the city of Jenin in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and enable the Palestinians to become an energy exporter. Gaza Marine is estimated to hold over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the equivalent of Spain’s consumption in 2016. But plans to develop it were put off several times over the past decade. Discovered at the end of the century, it lies between two rapidly expanding gas hubs in Egypt and Israel, both of which have attracted huge investments in recent years. Attempts to develop the field were put on hold repeatedly after Hamas, which Western countries and Israel have designated as a terrorist group, took control over the Gaza Strip in 2007. Israel then put an economic blockade on Gaza, raising questions about the financing of the project and the sharing of future profits among the Palestinians. Israel has, however, said in the past it supports the field’s development. Additional reporting by Ron Bousso

2018-04-04,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The United States and China have fired the opening shots in a trade war that may be hard to stop. Washington has published a target list of 1,300 items imported from China worth an estimated $50 billion that would be hit with an extra tariff of 25 percent (“Notice of determination”, USTR, April 3). Beijing has responded with a target list of 106 items imported from the United States worth a similar amount that would be hit by the same ad valorem tariff (“China retaliates for U.S. tariffs”, Reuters, April 4). The United States has appeared eager to impose tariffs to create leverage and force China into concessions on the bilateral trade deficit, intellectual property protection and forced technology transfer. President Donald Trump has insisted trade wars are winnable and pushed his officials to increase the scope of the target list. For its part, China has appeared anxious to avert a trade conflict but threatened a proportionate response to any unilateral U.S. action. Both sides have been careful to leave time for further negotiations in an effort to prevent the tariffs from taking effect. Most investors still seem convinced a last-minute deal can be reached without damaging the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has a track record of announcing aggressive and headline-grabbing trade policies and then diluting or abandoning them in the face of stiff opposition and in exchange for comparatively minor concessions. Trade wars, however, are like real wars in that they are easy to start, but, once underway, the course is unpredictable and they can be difficult to halt. As a result, trade war between the United States and China must be seen as one of the biggest risks to the global economy and commodity prices in 2018 and 2019. Neither Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping can afford to be seen to lose a trade conflict or make many concessions without securing something in return. Trump made trade a central plank of his presidential campaign in 2016 and faces tough mid-term congressional elections in just seven months. Fair trade and dealing with China’s perceived abuses is an important issue for the U.S. president’s core supporters and has qualified backing from some elements of the U.S. business community. In China, Xi has just been re-elected as Communist Party chief and had the constitution changed to allow him to extend his tenure as president based largely on his promise of strong leadership. Like a real war, the trade measures announced by both sides are largely for domestic political consumption and designed to play to a nationalist audience. Behind the scenes, both sides are trying to negotiate a settlement, and have been leaking some details to the media in an effort to calm concerns about the economic impact. There are plenty of possible options to settle the dispute. The problem is that any compromise must allow both sides to save face. And that will be much harder now that tariffs have been announced. Both sides are likely to come under business and economic pressure to de-escalate, avoiding a major disruption of global trade and with it the increased likelihood of a recession. But with the domestic political credibility of the leaders of both countries now on the line, just as in a real war, the scope for a mutually face-saving climb-down has narrowed. The trade conflict is really just one aspect of the increasing strategic competition between the United States and China. The United States wants to maintain its military, diplomatic and economic superiority over all other countries while China is determined not to accept second place and to achieve parity. The problem has been termed the Thucydides Trap, after the conflict in ancient Greece between Sparta (the incumbent superpower) and Athens (the rising superpower) that led to the Peloponnesian War. The problem of how to manage the rising power of China and its challenge to the superiority of the United States has been evident for two decades (I remember discussing it frequently with colleagues in the late 1990s). China has appeared anxious to avoid the problem, and the government-run Xinhua news agency has published numerous articles on averting the Thucydides Trap in recent years. The issue has been extensively discussed by officials, including the president and foreign minister, as well as in opinion commentaries (“China voice: Ten reasons China, U.S. can avoid Thucydides Trap”, Xinhua, 2017). Even with this level of awareness, however, the two countries have already blundered into the Thucydides Trap on trade. The list of areas where the two powers are in increasingly pointed strategic competition now covers trade, overseas investment, advanced technology, naval and military armaments. Intensifying diplomatic competition also covers multiple regions including the South China Sea, Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, the Korean peninsula, Africa and Latin America. There are compelling economic reasons for the United States and China to avoid imposing extensive tariffs on bilateral trade, but both sides face tricky domestic political constraints. It is possible to envisage a grand bargain that can resolve many if not all of the outstanding differences between the two countries on business issues. There is still time for negotiations and opportunities for a mutually face-saving deal, though the uncertainty in the meantime is likely to be extremely damaging. And just as real wars are often the result of unpredictable and unplanned escalation, trade wars can also spiral out of control.

Investors also seemed to be keeping their nerve on the global economic outlook after a host of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) showed some slowing, but from lofty levels in many regions. Activity in Japan’s service sector also grew at its slowest pace in 17 months last month, British shop prices dropped at the fastest pace in more than a year while Australian February building approvals fell 6.2 percent. “If global PMIs slow and avoid overheating concerns, that is good for risk appetite. If they slow for “the wrong reasons” like trade protectionism, that is much more worrying,” said Deutsche Bank global strategist Alan Ruskin. “The March data is at the most a very early warning shot for policymakers not to get too complacent on global growth resilience,” he added. Trade wars were a particular concern for developing Asia, where South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Indonesia, and India reported a slowing in factory activity.

2018-04-04,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The world’s largest wind turbine maker Vestas (VWS.CO) is tapping into experience from the car battery industry to try to address the challenge of using erratic wind and solar energy to meet a growing share of power demand. Energy storage is becoming increasingly important as production of renewable energy rises, because the wind might not blow or the sun shine during the peak hours when most consumers turns on their lights and appliances. In order to bring down cost of renewable energy and help grid operators balance intermittent output, Vestas last year said it would work to combine wind, solar and battery storage technology. As part of this, it invested 10 million euros ($12 million) in battery manufacturer Northvolt, which aims to build Europe’s biggest battery cell plant with the backing of investors such as Volkswagen-owned (VOWG_p.DE) truckmaker Scania. “We can piggyback on all the research they do with batteries for cars and get an excellent industry battery at the same time,” Vestas chairman Bert Nordberg told Reuters. Vestas is partnering with Sweden’s Northvolt, headed by former Tesla executive Peter Carlsson, to develop a lithium-ion battery for power plants of the future.  Battery costs have traditionally been high, but the technology is becoming increasingly viable as automakers such as BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Volkswagen and Volvo Car Group (0175.HK) ramp up electric car production. Nordberg said the investment into Northvolt meant Vestas could demand development and research into the kind of battery storage it is interested in, and would also be able to place people there. Vestas is also working with bigger players such as U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA.O), whose batteries it plans to use in the world’s first utility-scale project for this technology to store power from both wind and solar sources. “The output from solar and wind is very intermittent and we need to even that out,” Nordberg said. Nordberg is part of a Swedish trio, which also includes CEO Anders Runevad and finance chief Marika Frederiksson, that has turned Vestas around and, helped by cost cutting, lifted the company’s operating margin to industry leading levels. Vestas will continue to make acquisitions within storage and hybrid energy solutions, he said, but declined to say how much  it might spend or which targets it was considering.  “The idea is that we should be a technology company, we are not trying to move into buying and selling wind parks,” he said.

2018-04-04,"OSLO (Reuters) - Scientists in developing nations plan to step up research into dimming sunshine to curb climate change, hoping to judge if a man-made chemical sunshade would be less risky than a harmful rise in global temperatures. Research into “solar geo-engineering”, which would mimic big volcanic eruptions that can cool the Earth by masking the sun with a veil of ash, is now dominated by rich nations and universities such as Harvard and Oxford. Twelve scholars, from countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica and Thailand, wrote in the journal Nature on Wednesday that the poor were most vulnerable to global warming and should be more involved. “Developing countries must lead on solar geo-engineering research,” they wrote in a commentary. “The overall idea (of solar geo-engineering) is pretty crazy but it is gradually taking root in the world of research,” lead author Atiq Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, told Reuters by telephone. The solar geo-engineering studies may be helped by a new $400,000 research project, the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative (SRMGI), which is issuing a first call for scientists to apply for finance this week. The SRMGI is financed by the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation backed by Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife, Cari Tuna, the scientists wrote. The fund could help scientists in developing nations study regional impacts of solar geo-engineering such as on droughts, floods or monsoons, said Andy Parker, a co-author and project director of the SRMGI. Rahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether geo-engineering would work. Among proposed ideas, planes might spray clouds of reflective sulfur particles high in the Earth’s atmosphere. “The technique is controversial, and rightly so. It is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful,” they wrote.  A U.N. panel of climate experts, in a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in October, is skeptical about solar geo-engineering, saying it may be “economically, socially and institutionally infeasible.” Among risks, the draft obtained by Reuters says it might disrupt weather patterns, could be hard to stop once started, and might discourage countries from making a promised switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. Still, Rahman said most developed nations had “abysmally failed” so far in their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making radical options to limit warming more attractive. The world is set for a warming of three degrees Celsius (5.7 Fahrenheit) or more above pre-industrial times, he said, far above a goal of keeping a rise in temperatures “well below” 2C (3.6F) under the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations.

2018-04-04,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's BRI initiative: tmsnrt.rs/2njAVmw By Clyde Russell HONG KONG, April 4 (Reuters) - China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is one of those rare things that virtually everybody seems to have heard about, but equally, very few people can actually claim to have a detailed understanding of what it means. This dichotomy was in evidence at the Belt and Road conference, hosted by Mines and Money, in Hong Kong on Tuesday, with views ranging from the BRI will be the driver of a new super-cycle for commodities to that it’s more of a marketing slogan aimed at boosting the image and influence of the government in Beijing. On the side of thinking of the BRI as a sort of a Marshall plan for Asia, Africa and even Europe are a set of impressive sounding numbers, which dwarf the scale of the U.S. initiative that helped to rebuild Europe after World War II. The heart of the BRI is effectively building vast numbers of infrastructure and energy projects across at least 70 countries that are home to a total of 65 percent of the world’s population and some 40 percent of its economic output. The centrepiece of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s economic programme also involves developing the mines and oil and gas fields necessary to supply the raw materials for this vast undertaking. For its supporters, the BRI is the vehicle by which less developed countries will supercharge their growth and lift their populations out of poverty. Asian countries need to spend $1.7 trillion annually on infrastructure in the coming years, more than double the current investment rate, Rani Jarkas, chairman of the advisory firm Cedrus Group, told the Hong Kong event. It’s these sort of numbers that are getting commodity investors and producers excited, as that level of spending will require huge amounts of iron ore for steel, coal for making cement, and metals such as copper and zinc. But just as the big picture sounds very encouraging, scratching below the rhetoric reveals that the BRI may not be quite as big a deal as many expect. One of the questions I have posed at several conferences and events where the BRI is a focus is to ask the audience to think of their top five BRI projects, what they know about them and how much they will add to commodity demand. This causes most people to stumble, and bear in mind that the attendees at these events are drawn from the resource sector, either as producers, traders, buyers or financiers. What becomes apparent is that the BRI is currently more of a high-level political initiative that China is using as a diplomatic tool to expand its influence, especially in central, south and southeast Asia as well as Africa. There doesn’t appear to be a coordinated strategy for building the land transport corridors linking China to Europe through Asia, or for the maritime projects that take in Africa as well. What emerges is that Chinese companies, both the large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and smaller companies are using the BRI initiative as a vehicle when seeking investment opportunities. These opportunities still seem more focused on meeting the needs of the Chinese companies, rather than as part of a policy-driven effort to develop the BRI target countries. The flagship vehicle of the BRI, the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), started operations from its Beijing headquarters at the start of 2016, so it’s somewhat unrealistic to expect it to already be a major factor driving BRI investment. It has approved $4.26 billion in loans so far, according to data on its website, and although that’s somewhat more than small change, it’s also a far cry from the trillions of dollars in investment that those backers of the BRI say will be delivered. It also appears the case that virtually any Chinese foreign investment, with the exception of property, is being classified as related to the BRI. This helps make it look like the BRI is something significant, rather than a collection of unrelated projects being undertaken by separate companies with little or no coordination. However, just because the BRI seems somewhat haphazard right now, doesn’t mean it will remain that way. “It may be the great project of this century, it may be nothing. But you have to be involved no matter what,” is how one investor put it at the conference. For commodity producers the takeaway is that the Chinese are increasingly interested in developing resources that they believe will meet domestic needs, and those of the BRI. These include battery metals such as cobalt, lithium and nickel, but also copper and iron ore. The answer to whether the BRI is indeed the start of a new super-cycle for commodities will become apparent if Beijing can successfully change the process from a slogan to a coordinated, multilateral initiative that produces actual results.

2018-04-04,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s biggest energy producer, AGL Energy Ltd, came under pressure from the country’s Prime Minister on Wednesday to sell or keep running its coal-fired Liddell Power Station, after Alinta Energy expressed interest in a purchase.   AGL had planned to shut the plant, which started operations in 1971, in 2022 as part of a phased exit from coal. But as Australia’s electricity supply business has become a hot political issue, following a string of blackouts and price spikes, the company has come under intense pressure from the national government to sell it instead. With Alinta, AGL’s Hong Kong-owned rival, interested in extending Liddell’s operating life as a potential power-supply shortfall looms, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he spoke to AGL Chairman Graeme Hunt overnight. “I said to him: Look, it’s in the public interest, it’s in the community’s interest (and) obviously I think it’s in AGL’s interest to be seen to be a responsible player in the electricity market,” Turnbull told reporters in the Queensland city of Rockhampton on Wednesday. Turnbull said AGL should “either keep this plant going for another four or five years or sell it to somebody who’s prepared to do so”.  AGL, which bought Liddell and another coal plant for A$1.5 billion ($1.2 billion) four years ago, said it was approached by Alinta overnight to start talks, but no formal bid has been made.  A formal offer will be considered “to meet our obligations to customers and shareholders,” AGL said in an emailed statement.     Alinta’s interest comes after privately-owned Delta Electricity sad it would consider bidding for Liddell. Blackouts have hit major industrial users including miners BHP and Rio Tinto while price spikes have stung households, spurring politicians into action. Australia’s conservative government has also scrapped some subsidies for renewable projects. This week a breakaway group of lawmakers called on Canberra to provide more financial support for new coal-fired plants.  Alinta Managing Director Jeff Dimery said in a radio interview on Wednesday that the government had asked his company, which is owned by Hong Kong’s Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Ltd, to consider buying Liddell. “While it is an aging facility and we would need to do due diligence, we think it could survive a little longer,” he said in a subsequent statement. AGL previously rejected a sale because it needs Liddell, located north of Sydney, to maintain supplies to its own customers ahead of the closure.     “It is an incredibly valuable asset to AGL as a location, as a position on the grid,” Gero Farruggio, managing director of Sustainable Energy Research Analytics, told Reuters. AGL “would own all the infrastructure around it to develop something else,” he said. AGL shares ended the day flat, while the broader market finished 0.2 percent higher.

2018-04-04,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar’s top bank QNB QNBK.QA is helping the country’s authorities with data and expertise to probe if Qatar’s neighbors manipulated its markets, including credit default swaps (CDS), during a political standoff last year, its CEO told Reuters. Qatar’s central bank said in December it had launched a legal investigation into attempts by countries opposed to it to harm the Qatari economy by manipulating the currency, securities and derivatives markets.     Qatar National Bank (QNB) Chief Executive Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari said in an interview there had been unusual moves in Qatari CDS late last year.     “The behavior was abnormal ... the way it was moving very fast, this is not normal behavior. The dust around the crisis settled after two months, but the CDS continued to go up for no reason,” he said, estimating the Qatari CDS market at $21 billion. Al-Kuwari said QNB was cooperating with the central bank in its investigation and had been “supplying them with any information or data they asked us to supply them with.” QNB, the Middle East’s largest lender by assets, is 50 percent owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed an economic boycott on Qatar last June, accusing it of backing terrorism, which it denies. The boycott led to the withdrawal of billions of dollars of deposits from Qatari banks. Last month, Qatar’s central bank asked U.S. regulators to investigate the U.S. unit of the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates, accusing it of “bogus” foreign exchange deals designed to harm its economy as part of a blockade by Gulf neighbors. First Abu Dhabi Bank FAB.AD, parent of the U.S. subsidiary, NBAD Americas, denied it had tried to manipulate the Qatari riyal. The request for a U.S. investigation deepened the diplomatic crisis between Qatar, a major gas exporter, and its Gulf neighbors. Asked if there was concern about further attempts to manipulate Qatar’s economy, al-Kuwari said: “This is a major offence. People will have to think about the consequences. And especially now with the legal case on the table, I assume people will think twice before going further into these actions.” Al-Kuwari said that despite a substantial withdrawal of deposits at the start of the Gulf crisis in the middle of last year, deposits at QNB grew 13 percent for the whole of 2017.     He said the trend will likely be sustained in the first quarter across the entire Qatari banking sector thanks to higher oil and gas prices and renewed confidence in the economy.     Al-Kuwari said QNB had repaid a cash injection it received from Qatar’s central bank at the peak of the crisis last year.      He did not give the amount but said it represented a fair share among Qatari banks. He said the overall injection amounted to around $20 billion for the whole of the banking sector, half of which is controlled by QNB.     Qatar was able to beat the crisis partly thanks to a big cash buffer of $350 billion in central bank reserves and assets at the Qatar Investment Authority, which include stakes in major companies including Glencore (GLEN.L) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE).

The U.S. market had taken heart overnight from bets that President Donald Trump’s Twitter attacks on Amazon would not translate to actual policy. Yet trade worries were never far away. Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of annual imports from China, covering around 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products. China’s commerce ministry immediately warned it was preparing countermeasures of equal intensity, which could be announced as early as Wednesday. “The largest concern remains whether this trade tension could further escalate, but history suggests negotiation is likely to follow,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “That would provide some much needed short term relief to investors and allow them to focus back on economic and corporate fundamentals, which are still in decent shape.” For now, caution was the watchword and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan spent most of the session dithering either side of flat, and was last off 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.2 percent in thin volumes, while South Korea slipped 1.4 percent. Chinese blue chips went their own way, as they do so often, and rose 0.3 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 also dipped 0.3 percent while the FTSE fell 0.2 percent. Wall Street had rallied on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season and the S&P 500 pushed above a key support level. The Dow ended up 1.65 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent and the Nasdaq 1.04 percent. Amazon.com shares bounced 1.5 percent on reports the White House would not take action even as Trump continued his attacks on the online retailer. The swing in risk sentiment sucked some strength out of bonds, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt up five basis points overnight at 2.78 percent. The dollar steadied at 106.53 yen, after edging up from a low of 105.70 on Tuesday. The euro hovered at $1.2279 , after easing from a top of $1.2335 overnight, while the dollar index was a fraction lower at 90.089.

2018-04-04,"HANOI, April 4 (Reuters) - Vietnam plans to raise taxes on fuels starting in July to reduce pollution and pay off public debt, the finance ministry said on Wednesday, though analysts caution the levy could increase inflation and hurt businesses in the country. Vietnam will raise the environment tax on gasoline by 33.3 percent to 4,000 dong ($0.1754) per litre , the Ministry of Finance said on its website. Taxes on diesel fuel, coal and lubricants would also increase though the ministry did not indicate by how much. “The planned tax hike is part of a move to restructure the state budget with an aim to ensure the safety and stability of the national finance system,” Deputy Finance Minister Vu Thi Mai said in the statement. The tax hike is also part of Vietnam’s strategy to limit products that cause pollution, the ministry said. As Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economy, Vietnam is facing a pollution problem. The capital, Hanoi, enjoyed little more than one month of clean air last year, according to a January report by the Green Innovation and Development Centre. The government must also keep its public debt below 65 percent of its gross domestic product and the new tax will be used to pay down that debt. There are concerns, however, that the higher tax will raise costs for businesses and consumers. “This would definitely hit businesses as they would have to face higher input costs, leaving them less competitive,” said Hanoi-based economist Cao Si Kiem, a former governor of the State Bank of Vietnam. The statement also said the tax increase would compensate for the decline in import and export tax revenues as Vietnam integrates further into the global market. The country has signed around a dozen free trade agreements that will remove or reduce taxes on several imports. If approved by the government, the tax increase would raise inflation by 0.11 to 0.15 percentage points in 2018, Mai said. Vietnam has set an inflation target of 4 percent for this year. “The tax hike will result in higher input costs for enterprises, with those operating in the transport and logistics industry being hurt first,” said Can Van Luc, and economist with the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam. “But it’s necessary to combat environmental pollution for sustainable growth in Vietnam”.

2018-04-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration heralded the government’s sale last month of U.S. drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico as a bellwether.  If that is the case, a Reuters analysis of the sale’s results shows reason to worry about demand in future offshore auctions. The sale brought in $124.8 million, as just 1 percent of the 77 million acres (31.2 million hectares) offered found bidders. Reuters examined the acreage offered and leased, and nearly all the purchases show big drillers stuck closest to existing infrastructure, shunning the most far-flung areas.  While U.S. crude oil production reached a record last year at more than 10 million barrels a day, most new development is in onshore shale regions. The U.S. Interior Department has said it wants to open all U.S. coasts for drilling, including the Atlantic and Pacific. But the Gulf result indicates limited interest even in already-developed areas, never mind unexplored coasts. The March auction included 9,088 deepwater blocks, each comprising roughly nine square miles. Only 105 of these blocks received bids and all but three of these were close to existing infrastructure and leases.  “It kind of looks like they’re just shoring up their existing prospects right now,” said John Filostrat, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the division of Interior that manages the auctions. Filostrat said the administration is still optimistic about future auctions and believes more auctions are needed to show the current trends. For a graphic on Gulf of Mexico auction, click here However, money for exploration is increasingly flocking to other regions, particularly Latin America, where energy reforms have attracted billions of dollars in investment from companies historically known as Gulf heavyweights. A January auction by Mexico brought in more than four times the bids as the U.S. sale. Of the 105 new U.S. leases in water depths of more than 656 feet (200 meters), 85 were immediately contiguous with existing leased acreage or production platforms, and another 17 were within about two miles of existing leases or infrastructure, according to the Reuters analysis.  Among the areas where companies submitted bids were Mississippi Canyon and Green Canyon, two of the most densely leased plays in the Gulf, about 100 miles (160 km) off the Louisiana coast. Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the high bidder on two Mississippi Canyon blocks.  Overall, Shell picked up 16 Gulf blocks including 6 adjacent to its deepwater developments known as Kakias and Stones, and 10 clustered around other actively leased areas. It told Reuters that it wanted to “acquire blocks that could potentially support future development using our existing hubs.” BP Plc’s most notable bids were 19 blocks in DeSoto Canyon, contiguous to a known gas field, about 100 miles from the Louisiana coast. “BP is strategic with its bids, and we use the opportunity to expand and strengthen our plays,” a company spokesman told Reuters. Only three blocks leased were more than a few miles from existing acreage. Those blocks were snapped up by Chevron, which declined comment.  Bidding on parcels close to known assets increases the likelihood of finds that can be produced affordably, cutting infrastructure and supply costs.  “There’s still interest, but it is in areas where there was already existing knowledge of the resource base, or existing development activity or existing production,” said Michael Cohen, director of commodity research at Barclays.  “Spending a lot of money to prospect is probably not going to be looked upon with favor by investors,” he said. Major oil companies remain lukewarm about pushing the boundaries of available frontiers, desiring longer leases and lower royalty rates.  Deepwater offshore blocks currently require an 18.75 percent payment to the U.S. government, compared with 12.5 percent for shallower areas and onshore drilling. An Interior Department panel in February recommended lowering those rates. “It is something to look for in the August sale, possibly,” said BOEM’s Filostrat.  Companies have also expressed a desire for longer leases to more effectively drill in unexplored areas further from the coasts. Six deepwater regions more than 200 miles off the Louisiana coast received no bids at all. The water here is generally about two miles deep. The locale makes both drilling and transporting oil to shore especially costly.  The high cost of building underwater pipelines is another deterrent. Deepwater projects like Chevron’s Jack and St. Malo fields, more than 200 miles from the coast, required a pipeline connecting them to existing Gulf infrastructure closer to shore, approved in 2010, during a boom when U.S. crude traded at about $90 a barrel. Oil prices have rebounded from 2016’s lows at less than $30 a barrel, but the industry is still “in a bit of a wait and see mode,” said William Turner, a senior research analyst in Houston for Wood Mackenzie.

2018-04-04,"HONG KONG(Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd (600115.SS) (0670.HK) said a brewing trade war between China and the United States could prompt it to adjust capacity and frequency on associated routes in the expectation that it may impact passenger travel and cargo. China’s second largest carrier by passenger numbers said it had set up a group to study the issue. The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese products while China has put tariffs on U.S fruit and nuts. Chief Executive Ma Xulun said at a news conference on Wednesday that the trade war could have a “certain impact” on passenger and cargo business. “We will make some adjustment to our fleet if passenger numbers fall on China-U.S. routes, for example by switching the Boeing 777 to the Airbus 330-200. If the impact is more severe, we may make adjustments to airline frequency,” said Chief Marketing Officer Dong Bo. The airline, which last week reported its highest annual profit in more than 20 years, also said it was looking forward to the launch of China’s crude futures contracts and would consider buying when the appropriate timing and opportunity arises. Yuan-denominated oil futures <0#ISC:> were launched last month, becoming China’s first commodity derivative open to foreign investors. They are also the culmination of a decade-long push by the Shanghai Futures Exchange to give the world’s largest energy consumer more power in pricing crude sold to Asia. Unlike many of their overseas peers, Chinese airlines do not hedge fuel buys after they suffered heavy losses in 2008. This helped when oil prices plunged in mid-2014 but has since left them vulnerable as prices rise.

Safe-haven bonds, gold and the yen had run into selling as Wall Street benefited from bets that President Donald Trump’s Twitter attacks on Amazon would not translate to actual policy. Yet trade worries weren’t far away. Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration announced 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of annual imports from China, covering around 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products. China’s commerce ministry immediately warned it was preparing countermeasures of equal intensity. “The largest concern remains whether this trade tension could further escalate, but history suggests negotiation is likely to follow,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “That would provide some much needed short term relief to investors and allow them to focus back on economic and corporate fundamentals, which are still in decent shape.” For now, caution was the watchword and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was wavering either side of flat. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.1 percent in thin volumes, while South Korea eased 0.2 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 also dipped 0.2 percent. Wall Street had rallied on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season and the S&P 500 pushed above a key support level. The Dow ended up 1.65 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.26 percent and the Nasdaq 1.04 percent. Amazon.com shares bounced 1.5 percent on reports the White House would not take action even as Trump continued his attacks on the online retailer. The swing in risk sentiment sucked some strength out of bonds, with yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt up five basis points overnight to 2.78 percent. The Japanese yen also edged back, with the dollar rising to 106.50 from a low of 105.70 on Tuesday. The euro hovered at $1.2275, after easing from a top of $1.2335 overnight, while the dollar index was a fraction lower at 90.109. The Canadian dollar held firm after hitting a nearly five-week high as investors grew more optimistic about the prospect of a NAFTA trade deal. Investors also seemed to be keeping their nerve on the global economic outlook after a host of manufacturing surveys (PMIs) showed some slowing, but from lofty levels in many regions. “If global PMIs slow and avoid overheating concerns, that is good for risk appetite. If they slow for “the wrong reasons” like trade protectionism, that is much more worrying,” said Deutsche Bank global strategist Alan Ruskin. “The March data is at the most a very early warning shot for policymakers not to get too complacent on global growth resilience,” he added. Trade wars were a particular concern for developing Asia where South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, China, Indonesia, and India reported a slowing in factory activity.

2018-04-04,"(Repeats April 3 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Jf5hzq By John Kemp LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have turned bullish again towards oil prices, casting aside the caution that prevailed during much of February and March. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 85 million barrels in the week to March 27. Portfolio managers have increased their net long position in Brent, NYMEX and ICE West Texas Intermediate crude, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil by a total of 180 million barrels over the two most recent weeks. Net long positions stood at 1.396 billion barrels, not far below the record 1.484 billion barrels set nine weeks ago on Jan. 23 (tmsnrt.rs/2Jf5hzq). Fund managers’ long positions outnumber their short ones by a record ratio of 12.5:1, according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. On most measures, portfolio managers’ positioning in crude and refined products looks increasingly stretched and lopsided. Large concentrations of positions such as this, on either side of the market, have typically preceded a sharp reversal in prices since the start of 2015. With so many long positions already established and few short positions left to cover, there may not be much more buying to support prices if the holders of existing longs try to realise some of their profits. But the same risk factors have been evident for the last three months and so far prices have been steady with little day-to-day volatility. Most hedge fund managers seem convinced the next major move in prices is more likely to be on the upside. OPEC has signalled its willingness to continue supporting prices by indicating it will extend output curbs through the end of 2018. Venezuela’s output continues to fall as a result of internal unrest and mismanagement, while Iran’s exports are threatened by the possible reimposition of U.S. sanctions. U.S. shale output is rising rapidly but the rig count has levelled off in recent weeks, which some analysts have seen as a sign of increased capital discipline that should moderate further gains in production. At the same time, synchronised global growth and moderate oil prices are fuelling brisk growth in consumption, which is forecast to increase by more than 1.5 million barrels per day for the fourth year running. The biggest source of uncertainty is now on the demand side, where the macroeconomic cycle is rapidly maturing, interest rates are rising, and increasing protectionism is clouding the outlook. While the oil industry’s recovery seems to be mid-cycle, the macroeconomic backdrop appears to be much later in the cycle, with an increasing risk of a slowdown arriving by 2019 or 2020. For now, though, almost all hedge fund managers expect cyclical momentum to carry oil prices higher in the short to medium term.

2018-04-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency has exempted one of the nation’s largest oil refining companies, Andeavor ANDV.N, from complying with U.S. biofuels regulations - a waiver historically reserved for tiny operations in danger of going belly up, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The exemption, which applies to the three smallest of Andeavor’s ten refineries, marks the first evidence of the EPA freeing a highly profitable multi-billion dollar company from the costly mandates of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The law requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into gasoline or purchase credits from those who do such blending. The decision, which has not been previously reported, raises the question of whether other big and profitable oil firms with small refineries - such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) - also have or could receive the waivers, which are granted by the EPA in secret.  Such waivers were designed for refineries producing less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate that they suffer a “disproportionate economic hardship” from the costs of RFS compliance. Andeavor posted net profits of about $1.5 billion last year. The EPA exemption, granted about a month ago, could reduce Andeavor’s regulatory costs by more than $50 million this year, based on the number of biofuels credits that two brokers say the refiner recently sold into the market, along with previous disclosures by firms that own refineries of a similar size. Biofuels credit prices tied to ethanol dropped by 6 cents, to 38 cents each, after Reuters reported Andeavor’s exemption, traders said. Andeavor shares jumped by more than 1 percent on the news, hitting a session high of $102.78. Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, reacted to the report by calling the exemption an “outrageous abuse” of the law. “Providing a small refiner waiver to a company like Andeavor is laughable and abandons the commitment of President Trump to protect the RFS,” he said in a statement. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican who represents Iowa - the nation’s largest corn-growing state - and a staunch defender of the biofuels program, raised questions over the legality of the exemption. Giving Andeavor “a free pass when other companies are required to follow the law of the land isn’t just unfair, it may be illegal,” Grassley said late Tuesday in a statement to Reuters. “It would also amount to a massive government handout to a big corporation that made billions in profits just last year.” The exemption releases the firm of its obligation to provide the EPA with biofuels credits proving compliance at the three refineries - two located in North Dakota and one in Utah - for the year 2016, which would have come due this year, the sources said. Andeavor is also asking EPA for a waiver for its 2017 obligations for the same refineries, but has not yet received a decision, the sources said. Andeavor spokeswoman Destin Singleton declined to comment. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately comment in response to Reuters inquiries on Monday and Tuesday. As a matter of policy, the agency refuses to release any information on the waivers, or to name their recipients, citing concerns over disclosing private business information. The EPA denied a Freedom of Information Act request from Reuters seeking information on companies receiving the waivers. Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Phillips 66 also own refineries small enough to meet the barrel-per-day standard, as does billionaire investor and Trump ally Carl Icahn - whose efforts last year to overhaul the biofuels program drew scrutiny from federal investigators.  Icahn, majority owner of refiner CVR Energy (CVI.N), had served as an advisor to Trump on regulatory issues during his push to reform biofuels regulations early last year, but he resigned amid allegations that the role gave him a conflict of interest. Spokespeople for all four companies declined to comment on whether they had applied for or received any exemptions. The lucrative waivers are typically only reported if a publicly-traded firm considers them to be material to their financial or operational performance, in which case they must disclose the information through Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The RFS has long been a lightning rod of conflict between the corn lobby, which supports the policy as an engine for demand, and refiners who say it costs them a fortune. The White House has sought to broker a deal between two of its key political constituencies in a series of meetings, but the effort has failed to yield policy changes acceptable to both sides. Ethanol industry advocates argue exemptions for refiners undermine the intent of the law, originally designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependence on foreign oil and boost farm economies. While the EPA’s motives in providing hardship waivers are unclear, the exemptions are one of the tools at the administration’s disposal to ease financial pressure on refiners without undertaking a reform of the RFS policy. EPA chief Scott Pruitt, appointed by Trump, has repeatedly said the RFS is too costly to oil refiners and should be overhauled. But Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, told an agriculture conference in February that Trump “stands with corn farmers, biofuels farmers and the RFS,” according to a recording heard by Reuters. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to a question about whether the administration was expanding the use of the RFS waivers to help refiners. Bowman, of the EPA, also did not comment on the question. Andeavor’s waiver follows a successful lawsuit by another refiner, Sinclair Oil, last year challenging the strict standard the EPA has used under past administrations for determining financial hardship. “The EPA’s interpretation takes the statutory language too far,” wrote Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. “A ‘hardship’ is something that makes one’s life hard or difficult - not just something that makes continued existence impossible.” The lawsuit - along with a perception that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic to refiners - has sparked a big increase in applications from refining firms for he exemptions this year. More than 30 refineries have sought the waivers, according to sources familiar with the matter. In a typical year, the EPA would receive about 12 to 15 requests for hardship exemptions and would grant about half of them, a former official familiar with the program told Reuters. Andeavor sold some 100 million of those credits to its competitors in recent weeks, according to two brokers in the biofuels credit market. The company otherwise would have needed to provide those credits to the EPA to prove compliance with the RFS. Those credits would be worth about $58 million based on a Reuters calculation of average renewable fuel RIN prices this year. In the past, other companies have said the exemptions they were granted saved them tens of millions of dollars, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  Last year, for example, HollyFrontier disclosed a reduction of almost $58 million in its costs of credits for two refineries for 2016. Refiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance.

2018-04-04,"(Adds quotes from Pruitt newspaper interview, paragraphs 4-6) WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump expressed support on Tuesday for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, as U.S. lawmakers including two fellow Republicans called for Pruitt’s resignation after reports he paid far below market rates to live in a condo owned by a lobbyist. Trump, in an appearance with Baltic leaders at the White House, answered a question about whether he still supported Pruitt by saying: “I hope he’s going to be great.” The White House is reviewing the Environmental Protection Agency chief’s activities after reports about his link to the lobbyist, who deals with issues overseen by the agency, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Pruitt defended his actions in an interview on Tuesday with the Washington Examiner, denying the owner had any clients with business before the EPA and insisting the EPA general counsel believed that $50 a day, or about $1,500 per month, for a room was reasonable. Apartments in the neighborhood generally cost more. Pruitt said those critical of his housing and air travel costs were really out to stop the administration’s efforts to cut regulations, which he said had saved billions, including $1 billion in reduced EPA regulations, the Examiner reported. “Do I think that’s something that folks don’t like? Absolutely. And do I think they’ll use any means to (stop) it? Absolutely. And it’s frustrating,” Pruitt was quoted as saying. Several lawmakers called for Pruitt’s resignation on Tuesday, including Republican Representatives Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The EPA inspector general was already investigating Pruitt’s frequent use of first-class flights and installation of a $43,000 secure phone booth to conduct confidential calls. Pruitt’s “corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the Administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers. It’s time for him to resign or for @POTUS to dismiss him,” Curbelo, a moderate Republican, said on Twitter. Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who opposes slashing environmental regulations, asked the EPA’s inspector general to investigate the condo issue. EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox defended Pruitt’s record, from pushing to leave the Paris climate pact to working to repeal the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era program to cut greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-burning electricity plants. Trump called Pruitt on Monday night with a reassuring message, an administration official said on Tuesday. “Scott, keep your head up. Keep fighting. We’ve got your back,” Trump told Pruitt, the official told Reuters. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly phoned Pruitt on Tuesday morning to reinforce the message, the official said. A White House official, asked for comment, said only that the two calls had taken place and would not elaborate. Trump has been retooling his Cabinet, ousting both David Shulkin as secretary of the Veterans Administration and Rex Tillerson as secretary of state last month.

2018-04-04,"OSLO, April 4 (Reuters) - Scientists in developing nations plan to step up research into dimming sunshine to curb climate change, hoping to judge if a man-made chemical sunshade would be less risky than a harmful rise in global temperatures. Research into “solar geo-engineering”, which would mimic big volcanic eruptions that can cool the Earth by masking the sun with a veil of ash, is now dominated by rich nations and universities such as Harvard and Oxford. Twelve scholars, from countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Jamaica and Thailand, wrote in the journal Nature on Wednesday that the poor were most vulnerable to global warming and should be more involved. “Developing countries must lead on solar geo-engineering research,” they wrote in a commentary. “The overall idea (of solar geo-engineering) is pretty crazy but it is gradually taking root in the world of research,” lead author Atiq Rahman, head of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, told Reuters by telephone. The solar geo-engineering studies would be helped by a new$400,000 fund from the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation backed by Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife, Cari Tuna, they wrote. The fund could help scientists in developing nations study regional impacts of solar geo-engineering such as on droughts, floods or monsoons, said Andy Parker, a co-author and project director of the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative. Rahman said the academics were not taking sides about whether geo-engineering would work. Among proposed ideas, planes might spray clouds of reflective sulphur particles high in the Earth’s atmosphere. “The technique is controversial, and rightly so. It is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful,” they wrote. A U.N. panel of climate experts, in a leaked draft of a report about global warming due for publication in October, is sceptical about solar geo-engineering, saying it may be “economically, socially and institutionally infeasible.” Among risks, the draft obtained by Reuters says it might disrupt weather patterns, could be hard to stop once started, and might discourage countries from making a promised switch from fossil fuels to cleaner energies. Still, Rahman said most developed nations had “abysmally failed” so far in their pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, making radical options to limit warming more attractive. The world is set for a warming of three degrees Celsius (5.7 Fahrenheit) or more above pre-industrial times, he said, far above a goal of keeping a rise in temperatures “well below” 2C (3.6F) under the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations.

2018-04-04,"(Adds CEO statement) April 3 (Reuters) - Anglo American Plc said on Tuesday it would halt production and transport of iron ore for 90 days from its Minas-Rio mine in Brazil to inspect a pipeline that has leaked twice, complying with authorities’ demands for the review. Anglo froze operations at the mine in Minas Gerias state after the leak was discovered on March 29 in a pipeline which carries iron ore in slurry to an export terminal in coastal Rio de Janeiro. The incident came just weeks after another leak in a different section of the same pipeline prompted Anglo to suspend operations at the mine from March 12-27, raising fresh questions about mining oversight in Brazil. Ruben Fernandes, Anglo’s chief in Brazil, said the company estimated the total cost of repair, including environmental and social costs, to be about 60 million reais ($17.96 million), excluding lost revenue from exports. “Obviously, the loss of revenue will be more than that because we will stop shipments for the next few months,” he said at an event in Sao Paulo without offering a figure. Fernandes said Anglo was already negotiating with customers to reschedule shipments since iron ore stocks were running low.
