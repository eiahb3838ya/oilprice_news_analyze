2018-08-31,"(Adds executive quote, company background) By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shanghai Zhida Hailan Energy Co Ltd, a private energy trader set up in May last year, is one of the companies that delivered crude oil against the Shanghai September futures contract on Friday, a company spokesman told Reuters. The Shanghai firm’s participation in the delivery is a sign that the nascent oil contract could potentially attract more private participation. It was the first physical settlement of the contract that China hopes to grow into a global benchmark that can take on established markets like Brent. The Shanghai-based company delivered 100,000 barrels of Iraqi oil Basra Light into storage in Zhanjiang, the only private firm among the five companies that delivered a total of 601,000 barrels of crude oil through the exchange. The other four companies that made deliveries are all state-run, including Chinaoil, Unipec, CNPC Fuel Oil, Zhenhua Oil. The September-delivery crude contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) expired on Friday. The INE contract is the first yuan-denominated oil contract and is aimed at building a regional benchmark to reflect China’s purchasing and pricing power in the crude market. China is the world’s biggest oil importer. “As China is set to deregulate its energy markets further, it offers immense opportunities for the private companies to be engaged in the value chain,” said an industry executive familiar with the Shanghai company’s strategy. Zhida Hailan, a joint venture between Shanghai Zhida Holding Group and Shanghai Hailan Energy Corp, procures and trades road-paving bitumen, said the executive, who declined to be named as he’s not authorised to speak to the press. The firm also trades bitumen and fuel oil contracts at the Shanghai exchange, he added. Zhida Holding Group, which controls 55 percent of the trading firm, is engaged in highway building and information technology, according to the company website. Chen Yang, Zhida Hailan’s spokesman, confirmed the company’s delivery into the crude oil contract, adding that the company sees the Shanghai oil contract as an opportunity to break into the energy trading business.

2018-08-31,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks which lost out on big payouts for the work on the shelved listing of oil giant Aramco are lining up for a raft of other projects as Saudi Arabia pursues reforms.   Banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) worked for months to prepare what would have been the biggest ever stock market debut. But the plan to sell 5 percent of the company for a targeted $100 billion (76.88 billion pounds) was pulled. The bankers were paid retainer fees but were expecting around $200 million would be shared among all the banks involved when the deal was done.   Now, they are pinning their hopes on other projects from a privatisation programme that is part of Riyadh’s economic reform plan to loosen its reliance on oil. Without the funds from the Aramco sale, the government is looking to raise money in other ways, creating new opportunities for the banks, bankers say.   Teams from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley that worked on the IPO, have been shifted to advise on Aramco’ planned acquisition of up to $70 billion in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE, three people familiar with the details of the transaction told Reuters.  HSBC (HSBA.L), which was also an adviser on the Aramco IPO, is expected to play a role in putting together the debt to fund that purchase, they said. One of the sources said the issue could exceed the 2016 sovereign bond issue of $17.5 billion, which was a record for the kingdom. Aramco said earlier this month it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire the stake in SABIC but has not said how it will finance the deal. Spokespeople for JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC declined to comment on their role in the Sabic deal. None of those banks have confirmed they were involved in the Aramco IPO. Other deals are expected to be forthcoming. “The PIF (sovereign wealth fund) has had to reconsider its budget in the last three months, after finding out that they wouldn’t be getting $100 billion from the Aramco IPO right away,” said a banker in Saudi Arabia. “So there’s been a flurry of activity as they look to raise cash in other ways. A lot of these are smaller deals, $1 billion here and there, but all geared towards financing their commitments for big infrastructure projects without slowing down their timelines.”  The banker did not give details of the other deals. PIF officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. After Reuters reported last week that the Aramco deal had been shelved, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government was committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future. The bankers are nevertheless wary after the Aramco experience. It highlighted the hurdles of doing business in a country governed by an absolute monarchy where public protest and political parties are banned. It also added to uncertainty after scores of top royals, ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an anti-corruption campaign last November. The preparation for the listing was launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman two years ago and some bankers had flown to the kingdom hundreds of times to work in the Dhahran camp, a gated compound for the oil group’s residents.  A different source said Aramco had demanded it deal only with the very top bankers. Another person familiar with the Aramco deal said he had made more than 20 trips to Dhahran over 18 months but with little to show for it. He said his team would “give the same presentation each time without getting much feedback.” Bankers also say the fees are modest in comparison to those paid by other countries.    “The deal flow is huge but there’s a worry that the fees coming from these projects are low,” said a Gulf-based banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity.  “Saudi Arabia is lower than Hong Kong and Dubai when it comes to fees,” he said. “It’s all substandard.” Typical fees for banks doing IPOs in more developed markets are around 1 percent of the overall deal while estimates from bankers and analysts for an Aramco IPO was 0.2 percent. The 35 banks who worked on Chinese internet giant Alibaba’s $21.8 billion float, led by six main underwriters, pocketed an estimated $300 million among them, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Still, the rewards from a privatisation that analysts expect to generate ($9 billion to $11 billion) by 2020 are too big for bankers to ignore. HSBC is already advising Saudi International Petrochemical Company on a potential merger with Sahara Petrochemical, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley, according to disclosures from March.    U.S. bank Citigroup (C.N) obtained a licence to conduct capital markets business in Saudi Arabia last year after an absence of almost 13 years. Moelis is preparing to apply for an advisory licence in Saudi Arabia and U.S. boutique investment bank Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017. The government is also trying to make it easier to do deals, changing the law to allow alternatives to traditional debt finance. “There are plenty of deals to be made from bigger players looking to consolidate their market position and buy out competitors,” said Mohammed Fahmi, the Dubai-based co-Head of EFG Hermes Investment Banking. “Good stories will continue to see a following.”  Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva in London and Katie Paul in Dubai; editing by John O'Donnell and Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-deals/bruised-bankers-seek-consolation-prizes-after-shelved-aramco-ipo-idUKL3N1VI2YN,31 Aug 2018,"* Bankers disappointed after months preparing Aramco IPO

2018-08-31,"* Gas to flow through Nord Stream 2 by end 2019 * Half investments done, pipes are being laid * European partners say remain committed By Olesya Astakhova and Vera Eckert MOSCOW/FRANKFURT, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline to transport Russian gas to Germany is progressing on schedule, its operator said on Friday, with European investors still committed to the project despite criticism from the United States and the threat of sanctions. In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe. Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project. The pipeline will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, where its gas giant Gazprom has faced past disruptions. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine, a key Russian gas export route, over gas prices and transit fees have resulted in a number of supply stoppages to Europe in the past decade. “The project is progressing according to schedule,” Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-based project’s operating company, told Reuters in the emailed statement. Gas is due to start flowing at the end of 2019 to bypass routes through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from a current 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is taking on half the planned costs of some 9.5 billion euros ($11.10 billion). The rest is divided between five European energy companies - Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Engie and Austria’s OMV. By the end of June 4.8 billion euros had already been invested in the 1,200-km long project, and pipelaying in the Baltic Sea started in July. “Uniper will remain one of the financing partners of this project and we are - as before - fully committed to the project,” Uniper’s chief financial officer Christopher Delbrueck said in a statement this week. “We will continue to adhere to our contractual obligations to Nord Stream 2.” Austria’s OMV has spent 465 million euros on the project so far, it said in a written reply to a Reuters request. That represents half of the around 950 million euros each Western company pledged to commit in financing. “We are monitoring the situation very closely.... We trust, and our experience showed us so far, that U.S. sanctions are not being done to harm European companies,” OMV said. Gazprom and its European partners say the Nord Stream 2 project is aimed at ensuring energy security in the region as gas production falls in Europe and as Gazprom remains in conflict with Ukraine. Shell declined to comment and Engie did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. A Wintershall spokesman said that the company was “following developments” in the United States closely, declining additional comments. $1 = 0.8559 euros

2018-08-31,"Oil analysts cut their price forecasts for 2018 for the first time in almost a year in August, given growing concern over the impact on crude demand from escalating trade tensions, although falling supply, particularly from Iran, would likely limit losses, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. A survey of 45 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude to average $72.71 a barrel in 2018, 16 cents lower than the $72.87 projected in the previous month’s poll and above the $71.96 average so far this year. The price was forecast to average $72.58 in 2019. U.S. crude futures were forecast to average $67.13 a barrel in 2018, compared with $67.32 forecast last month and an average of $66.40 until now. “The eventual loss of Iranian barrels is likely to match, if not exceed, the amount seen during the multi-lateral round of sanctions in 2012-2015,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas. Supply is also at risk in countries like Venezuela, Libya and Angola, he said. “These supply side factors presents strong upside for oil prices.”  U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector will come into force on Nov. 4, although the country’s crude oil and condensate exports are already expected to have fallen to a 16-month low in August. The United States wants to force buyers of Iranian oil to cut their imports from OPEC’s third-largest producer to nothing, after an international nuclear deal between the two nations was dissolved. However, there is a concern among analysts that global trade disputes could undermine economic growth, which in turn may mean Asian importers’ demand for crude oil declines. The United States is embroiled in an ever-escalating trade war with multiple countries, especially China. “Trade tensions could slow oil demand growth in Asia, likewise possible contagion of the Turkey crisis; slower demand growth would make it easier to replace Iranian barrels,” said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Analysts said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would continue to adjust its crude supply to ensure the global oil market remained in balance. Saudi Arabia will be a strong contender to fill in the supply deficit caused by Iran sanctions and tensions elsewhere in the coming months, a majority of industry experts said. “At the moment the market is looking balanced over the fourth-quarter, assuming Iranian supply falls by around 500,000 barrels per day. The obvious upside risk is if Iranian losses are greater than this, as this would push the market into deficit over the final quarter,” said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson.

2018-08-31,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s consumption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is set to fall as the country’s nuclear reactors restart, with output from atomic power set for its highest since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster.  Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) will restart the 870-megawatt (MW) No. 4 reactor at its Takahama station later on Friday, a spokesman told Reuters.  The Kansai restart followed Kyushu Electric Power (9508.T) bringing back the 890-MW No. 2 reactor at its Sendai plant on Wednesday. Kyushu now has four reactors running. Each returning reactor will cut demand for LNG by as much as 1 million tonnes a year, said Kosho Tamura, a gas analyst at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. The return of Japan’s nuclear capacity should lead to lower imports of fossil fuels, especially LNG. While that is a positive for Japan’s utilities, especially as LNG prices are near four-year highs in Asia, the loss of Japanese demand could undermine the demand outlook for the global market. Japan is the world’s biggest buyer of LNG. “It’s a good thing that the power utilities in western Japan have restarted nuclear plants, which is leading to the cuts in fossil fuel costs, primarily LNG, through the continued operations of nuclear plants,” said Tomoko Murakami, manager of the nuclear energy group at the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). Kansai is Japan’s second-largest utility by sales and was the most reliant on nuclear power before the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, when a nuclear power plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami. Before the disaster, Japan had the world’s third-largest reactor fleet which provided about one-third of its electricity. But the plants were shut down for relicensing after Fukushima highlighted regulatory failings. Kansai will have three units operating and expects to have another reactor at Takahama restarted in November after shutting it down earlier this month for maintenance and refuelling, its spokesman said.  Those three units will save about $1.5 billion (1.15 billion pounds) in fuel costs each year they are running, the Kansai spokesman said, declining to comment on what fuels it would substitute.  Operating Kyushu’s nuclear units will save the company about $2.2 billion in annual costs based on current LNG prices, its spokeswoman said.     With two more reactors likely to restart by the end of the year, when Japan enters its peak demand period, as much as 9 million tonnes of LNG demand could be replaced by nuclear operations.  Japan’s electric power utilities burn less LNG as reactors return - reut.rs/2LHbLXO The country’s use of LNG in power generation has been declining this year as more reactors return. In June, LNG imports fell to the lowest monthly amount since May 2016 and for the year through to July are down 2.4 percent. The Fukushima disaster sparked the country’s worst energy crisis in the post-war period, forcing it to import record amounts of LNG and driving prices to record highs. Utilities also turned to cheaper coal imports.

2018-08-31,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for the first time in three weeks, energy services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday, while the rig count inched up this month as drilling steadied over the last three months. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 31, bringing the total count to 862, the General Electric Co unit said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The oil rig count rose by one in August after gaining three rigs in July and losing one in June. U.S. crude futures were on track to post their second straight weekly gain on concerns about an expected fall in supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and Venezuela’s declining output. For the month, prices were set to rise about 1.7 percent. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 759 rigs were active. Energy companies have been ramping up production in tandem with OPEC’s efforts over the past year-and-a-half to cut global output. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.42 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading at $70 for the balance of 2018 and $67 for calendar 2019. In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. A total of 1,048  oil and gas rigs are currently in service. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,015. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Texas oil production fell in June from a year earlier for the first time in 16 months, according to figures released on Thursday by the state’s energy regulator, a fresh sign that a lack of pipeline space in the nation’s largest shale field may be curbing production. U.S. crude oil production in 2018 is expected to rise 1.31 million barrels per day (bpd) to 10.68 million bpd, lower than last month’s forecast of growth of 1.44 million bpd to 10.79 million, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said earlier this month.

2018-08-31,"TORONTO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Alberta government on Friday lowered its 2018-2019 budget deficit projection by C$1 billion ($765 million) as higher oil prices boosted revenue for the Canadian energy-producing province. The 2018-19 deficit outlook fell to C$7.8 billion, compared with C$8.8 billion projected in March, the government said in a statement. The 2018-19 fiscal year ends on March 31. Revenue is forecast to reach C$49.1 billion ($37.91 billion), 2.5 percent higher than the budget projection made in March. Borrowing estimates also fell, due in part to the smaller deficit. Alberta, home to some of Canada’s biggest oil and gas companies, was hit hard by the selloff in oil prices that began in 2014, triggering a major industry downturn. In the last few years, global energy players have been pulling back from Canada, while oil producers have cut costs and laid off employees. But Alberta’s energy-dependent economy has benefited from a recent rebound in oil prices, which has translated into improved financial results from the energy producers. The province raised its real GDP forecast for 2019 to 2.7 percent, from 2.5 percent earlier. “I am pleased with these results. Jobs are up. The economy is growing. And the deficit is down,” Finance Minister Joe Ceci said in a statement. The forecasts come a day after a Canadian court overturned approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. The court said in a ruling that Ottawa failed to adequately consider aboriginal concerns. That court decision does not affect the government’s finances for the 2018-19 fiscal year, but is a negative for Alberta’s economy, the Alberta government said.

2018-08-31,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqi protesters stoned and tried to break into the provincial government headquarters in the southern oil hub of Basra on Friday to press demands for better public services and an end to pervasive corruption. Some protesters also set fire to tyres outside the building and there were minor clashes with riot police who fired tear gas to try to quell the protest. No serious injuries were reported. By 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) protesters had destroyed part of the concrete wall surrounding the headquarters and were hurling petrol bombs through the gap towards the building, while chanting anti-government slogans. Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim heartland, over widespread electricity outages during the blistering hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and entrenched graft. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended the electricity minister last month and said earlier this week that his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra, Iraq’s second biggest city. Public anger is rising at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests. Friday’s protests were particularly concerned with the high level of salt in Basra’s drinking water that residents say makes it undrinkable.  The city’s infrastructure is crumbling from years of neglect and under-investment, generating widespread bitterness as locals contrast their impoverishment with the oil wealth the province provides for federal government coffers.

2018-08-31,"BASRA, Iraq, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqi protesters stoned and tried to break into the provincial government headquarters in the southern oil hub of Basra on Friday to press demands for better public services and an end to pervasive corruption. Some protesters also set fire to tyres outside the building and there were minor clashes with riot police who fired tear gas to try to quell the protest. No serious injuries were reported. Protests have swept cities in the long neglected south, Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim heartland, over widespread electricity outages during the blistering hot Iraqi summer, a lack of jobs and proper government services, and entrenched graft. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi suspended the electricity minister last month and said earlier this week that his government had begun punishing those responsible for poor services in Basra, Iraq’s second biggest city. Public anger is rising at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests. Friday’s protests were particularly concerned with the high level of salt in Basra’s drinking water that residents say makes it undrinkable. The city’s infrastructure is crumbling from years of neglect and under-investment, generating widespread bitterness as locals contrast their impoverishment with the oil wealth the province provides for federal government coffers.

2018-08-31,"MOSCOW/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline to transport Russian gas to Germany is progressing on schedule, its operator said on Friday, with European investors still committed to the project despite criticism from the United States and the threat of sanctions.  In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe. Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project. The pipeline will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, where its gas giant Gazprom has faced past disruptions. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine, a key Russian gas export route, over gas prices and transit fees have resulted in a number of supply stoppages to Europe in the past decade.  “The project is progressing according to schedule,” Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-based project’s operating company, told Reuters in an emailed statement. Gas is due to start flowing at the end of 2019 to bypass routes through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from a current 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is taking on half of the planned costs of 9.5 billion euros (8.52 billion pounds).  The rest is divided between five European energy companies - Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Anglo- Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI).  By the end of June, 4.8 billion euros had already been invested in the 1,200-kilometre (746 miles) pipeline project, and pipelaying in the Baltic Sea started in July.  “Uniper will remain one of the financing partners of this project and we are - as before - fully committed to the project,” Uniper’s Chief Financial Officer Christopher Delbrueck said in a statement this week. “We will continue to adhere to our contractual obligations to Nord Stream 2.” Austria’s OMV has spent 465 million euros on the project so far, it said in a written reply to a Reuters request. That represents half of the around 950 million euros each Western company pledged to commit in financing.  “We are monitoring the situation very closely... We trust, and our experience showed us so far, that U.S. sanctions are not being done to harm European companies,” OMV said. Gazprom and its European partners say the Nord Stream 2 project is aimed at ensuring energy security in the region as gas production falls in Europe and as Gazprom remains in conflict with Ukraine. Shell declined to comment. Engie said in a written reply to a Reuters request that it has already invested between 400 million and 450 million euros in the project, out of 950 million euros it will invest in total.  “At this stage, Engie is not considering speeding up its investment in the project,” Engie said.  A Wintershall spokesman said that the company was “following developments” in the United States closely, declining to comment further.

2018-08-31,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Friday it was taking a pause in using some of its debt tools but the gas giant said it had not suspended its loans programme and still had access to private loans. Gazprom suspended its external borrowing programme this year because of a deepening legal dispute with Ukraine’s Naftogaz over gas supplies, banking sources said this month. A London court in June froze the firm’s assets in Britain at the request of Naftogaz. Gazprom’s original plan had been to borrow 417 billion roubles (5.07 billion pounds) externally this year. “We are seeing some increase in risks on the money market related to money transfers via the Great Britain territory ... We took a pause in some tools,” Alexander Ivannikov, the head of company’s financial department, told a conference call for investors and analysts.     He also said a British court will hold hearings on Sept. 4-5 regarding moves by Naftogaz to freeze Gazprom’s assets. Ivannikov did not rule out the possibility of raising dividends on 2018 results, however he said it would be more realistic to expect that after 2020 once the current investment cycle is over.

2018-08-31,"TORONTO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Canada’s Tahoe Resources Inc said on Friday it had temporarily suspended mining operations at its La Arena gold mine in Peru after protesters trespassed on its property and demanded payment for environmental impacts of mining on their community. Tahoe said it filed charges of illegal trespass against leaders of the protest, which included 80 to 100 people from the community of La Ramada, some three kilometers (1.86 miles) from the mine. The protest followed recent meetings between the company and some La Ramada residents who say they want compensation for unspecified damage caused by dust and vibrations from blasting at the mine, Tahoe said in a statement. The company said ongoing monitoring shows that mine blasting complies with the law and environmental quality standards. The Vancouver-based gold and silver miner, which also has operations in Guatemala and Canada, did not say when mining would resume, but that it was working to a resolution. Leaching activities at La Arena are continuing as normal, the company said. Earlier this week, Tahoe said some 600 cubic meters of cyanide and gold bearing solution may have leaked from the mine site into a neighboring creek. The spill was caused by an apparent theft attempt, the company said. After five holes were cut into a pipeline carrying the solution, bags of carbon were inserted to absorb the gold, but one blocked the pipeline and solution leaked, it said. Last week, Tahoe said that 12 unarmed security contract workers at its Guatemalan were abducted and held for hours on Friday before being released.

2018-08-31,"* Global stocks fall as Trump threatens new tariffs * Emerging currencies set for 5th straight month down against USD (Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Global stocks were poised on Friday to end August much as they began the month - under the dark cloud of a potentially worsening trade war. A closely watched barometer of global equities fell for a second day as a report that U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to step up a trade war with Beijing dampened risk appetite and erased some gains from a rally this week. Trump is ready to impose tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The White House declined to comment. Trump in an interview with Bloomberg also threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if “they don’t shape up,” a move that would further undermine one of the foundations of the modern global trading system. “It’s very hard to see a decisive resuscitation of risk appetite until these tensions are resolved,” said Paul O’Connor, head of the multi-asset team at Janus Henderson Investors. “We have learned to under-react to some of the individual headlines because if you try to extrapolate from any of them you could find yourself in big trouble.” The MSCI All-Country World Index, which measures stocks in 47 countries, shed 0.10 percent for the day, but was set for a 0.6 percent gain for the month. The modest rise masked a growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The S&P 500, which includes large U.S. companies, is up 3 percent for the month, while the MSCI Emerging Markets index is down about the same. On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.53 points, or 0.11 percent, to 26,016.45, the S&P 500 gained 4.18 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,905.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.70 points, or 0.37 percent, to 8,118.06. Trade anxieties boosted both the dollar, seen as a short-term winner if the United States spends less on imports, and the safe-haven yen. The dollar index rose 0.15 percent while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.07 percent versus the greenback. The Mexican peso gained 0.29 percent versus the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar fell 0.47 percent. Each country is party to the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States. While Mexico has negotiated a deal with the United States on Monday, U.S. and Canadian officials were making a final push to iron out differences ahead of a Friday deadline set by Trump. Canadian officials expressed concern that a deal will not be concluded on Friday, Canada’s Globe and Mail reported, citing a source familiar with situation. Emerging market currencies showed needed signs of stability even as they were set to post their fifth straight month of losses in dollar terms. The index of those countries’ currencies rose 0.06 percent on Friday. Currencies in two particularly troubled economies, Turkey and Argentina , strengthened against the dollar. The Turkish government said it will lower the level of withholding tax on lira bank deposits, while raising it on foreign currency deposits. Meanwhile, in Argentina, investors expect further government spending cuts to be announced on Monday. In Asia, the Indonesian rupiah fell to a nearly three-year low and approached levels not seen since the 1990s Asian financial crisis even as the country’s central bank said it was “decisively” intervening to support the currency.

2018-08-31,"* Global stocks fall as Trump threatens new tariffs * Argentina’s peso in freefall despite surprise rate hike By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Asian shares came under renewed pressure on Friday after reports U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to step up a trade war with Beijing and ready to impose more tariffs on Chinese imports. Many emerging market currencies were also frail after Argentina’s peso sank on Thursday despite the central bank’s interest rate hike. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.2 percent in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent. U.S. S&P500 e-mini futures fell 0.17 percent. On Thursday, the S&P 500 lost 0.44 percent from Wednesday’s record close of 2,914. Pouring cold water on the rally in global shares, which started in the middle of the month, were hostile comments from Trump on trade. Bloomberg reported that Trump said he was ready to impose more tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China as soon as the public comment period on the plan ends next week. “So far, Trump has carried out what he said he would do,” said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “Even though there are some doubts the U.S. trade representative could come up with new tariffs so quickly, I suspect worries about a trade war will start to eclipse optimism based on strong U.S. economic data.” Trump also threatened in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if “they don’t shape up” — a move that would further undermine one of the foundations of the modern global trading system. In addition, he said the European Union’s proposal to eliminate auto tariffs is not good enough and called its trade policies “almost as bad as China.” The cautious mood helped lift the yen, which rose 0.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily rise in about six weeks. In early Friday trade, it changed hands at 111.04 per dollar . The euro traded flat at $1.1665, having shed 0.33 percent in the previous session. The common currency has recovered from a 13-1/2-month low of $1.1301 hit in mid-August but looks set to end the month little changed from end-July. Emerging market currencies had less luck. The peso, the world’s worst-performing currency this year due to the country’s poor economic health, fell 10 percent on the day, bringing its month-to-date losses to 27 percent. Argentina’s central bank at an emergency meeting on Thursday voted unanimously to raise its benchmark rate to 60 percent from 45 percent, however, the unexpected move failed to stabilise the peso. That knocked down the Brazilian real to near its record low touched in September 2015. It is down almost 10 percent this month. The Turkish lira, which has been hit by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s interference in monetary policy and his diplomatic spats with Washington, also slipped towards record low marked about two weeks ago. The lira stood at 6.740 per dollar in early Friday trade, having fallen 11 percent so far this week. Oil prices slipped slightly after hitting their highest levels in more than a month the previous day on growing evidence of disruptions to crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and after a fall in U.S. inventories. Brent crude oil dropped 0.3 percent to $77.51 a barrel from Thursday’s settlement at $77.77. U.S. crude stood down 0.3 percent at $70.04 a barrel.

2018-08-31,"(Repeats column with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shows signs of extending its nine-year expansion with the help of tax cuts and strong business and consumer confidence. Both the longevity of the expansion and the apparent limited slack in the labour and product markets suggest the current pace of growth is probably not sustainable in the medium term. The current cyclical expansion is 110 months old and will be the longest on record if the economy is still growing in July 2019. (tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto) While longevity alone is not a good predictor of cyclical turning points, with most financial and economic indicators close to multi-decade highs, the balance of risks is shifting. “What matters primarily ... is not the passage of calendar time but what happens over time in and to the economy in motion. It is historical and psychological time, filled with events and processes, perceptions and actions. “There is a simple corollary: knowledge of the current phase of the business cycle and its age can help but must not be used in isolation,” Victor Zarnowitz, a leading U.S. expert on business cycles, wrote in 1992. “The variability in length of business expansions and contractions is sufficiently large for the timing of cyclical turning points to be very difficult to forecast. “The age of a phase alone is not of much help in predicting its end: what matters more is the dynamics of the evolving business situation. (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting,” Zarnowitz, 1992) Zarnowitz went on to observe: “The largest errors in forecasts ... are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense they miss recessions and recoveries.” Fears about a future slowdown in the U.S. economy have grown as the U.S. Treasury curve has come closer to inverting, given the close correlation between slowdowns and inversions over several decades. Yields on U.S. Treasury paper with two years to maturity are now just 22 basis points below yields on 10-year notes, the narrowest gap since a few months before the start of the last recession in December 2007. The yield curve exhibits strongly cyclical behaviour, with a large negative gap during economic slowdowns and a smaller negative gap or even a positive one during expansions. To some extent, whether or not the curve actually inverts is arbitrary, since there is no special significance in the zero line, and the long-term average has been around 105-115 basis points. So the current gap is already in the 82nd-83rd percentile of the long-term distribution across multiple cycles since 1983, and the is economy already well into the cycle’s boom/tightening phase. It is not possible to predict either the precise timing or the depth of the next slowdown, but the narrowing yield gap indicates the distribution of risks over the next couple of years is now skewed to the downside. There are more scenarios in which something could go wrong (accelerating inflation, an emerging markets crisis, monetary policy errors, or a deterioration in corporate finances) and fewer in which everything goes right. The current yield gap is consistent with a wealth of other indicators, including purchasing surveys, consumer confidence, unemployment, retail price inflation, freight movements and the escalation in share prices. They all point to an economy approaching a cyclical peak, and then likely to move into a period of more moderate growth, if not recession, over the next 12 to 24 months. The critical question is whether the next slowdown, when it comes, proves just a pause in an otherwise sustained expansion (1994/95) or marks an end to the current cycle and start of a new one (2000/01 or 2007/08).

2018-08-31,"LESHAN, China (Reuters) - In a mountain village in southwest China’s Sichuan province, authorities have demolished seven small dam projects this year along a river to clear illegal developments in a new nature reserve. The demolition is part of a nationwide program to close hundreds of tiny and often ramshackle dams and turbines and bring order to China’s massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction. The dams sat on an unnamed tributary of the fierce and flood-prone Dadu river, which feeds into the Yangtze, Asia’s largest and longest river, where the government says the “irregular development” of thousands of small hydropower projects has wrecked the ecology. (For a series of pictures, please click here: reut.rs/2N3xvlz) But green groups say the campaign will not necessarily save the environment because it will not affect big state hydropower stations, which they say have caused the most damage. On the Zhougong river, another tributary, seventy-year-old farmer Zhang, who declined to give his full name, reckons big dams have devastated the ecology. Zhang described himself as a “hydropower migrant” after his land was inundated by state dam builders 10 years ago. He said changes in the Zhougong’s flow and temperature had devastated the local fish population, with one species favored by the Sichuan-born former leader Deng Xiaoping now wiped out. “The fish here now taste terrible, and are fit only for dogs,” he said, pointing to three silver carp he had caught after they were swept down river by flood waters from an upstream reservoir. China triggered an aggressive damming program 20 years ago as it looked for ways to develop industry and bring electricity to poor rural regions not connected to the power grid. Investors rushed in and environmentalists likened the frenzy to the construction of backyard steel smelters during the ill-fated 1958 “Great Leap Forward”, a program that aimed to industrialize China’s agrarian society but caused widespread famine as farmers made metal instead of food. Now, the government wants to reverse course and the environmentally conscious leadership must decide how much of China’s 100 gigawatts of small-scale capacity needs to close, while at the same time protecting expensive state investments. “Hydropower was a good thing at the time, but as is often the case in China, it turns into a swarm and we basically lose control,” said Chen Guojie, a hydropower expert with the China Academy of Sciences in Chengdu, central China. Sichuan underlines the case. Total hydropower reached more than 75 GW in 2017, greater than the total in most Asian countries. It was also more than double the capacity of the province’s power grid, meaning lots of wasted power. China’s official hydropower capacity was about 340 GW at the end of June and around a third of that is considered small hydropower, projects of less than 50 MW. China’s overall power capacity, including coal and nuclear plants, is 1,740 GW. In June, state auditors identified 24,100 small hydropower projects in the 11 regions along the Yangtze, and said the environmental costs of some plants were too high even though they had made “historical contributions” to development. A month later, Beijing ordered the regions to ban new construction and “rectify” illegal projects, although it remains uncertain how many will be decommissioned. “There is no unified standard, and we still aren’t clear which small-scale plants should be demolished and which ones retained,” said Yang Yong, chairman of the Hengduan Mountain Research Society, a Sichuan-based environmental group. The government says small dams have disrupted the habitats and breeding patterns of many rare species of fish, although green groups argue the damage wrought by bigger dams is more severe, with entire towns and ecosystems submerged in water, which they say increases the risk of earthquakes, landslides and even climate change. On the 30-mile (48 km) Zhougong, authorities have already demolished small projects built in nature reserves or encroaching upon new “ecological red lines” drawn up to shield a quarter of China’s territory from development. But the river houses 10 larger stations run by some of the country’s biggest firms, including Guodian, Huadian and the State Grid Corp, and the “overdevelopment” of the river was criticized by the environment ministry earlier this year.  None of the firms, or their local subsidiaries, responded to requests for comment. Central government-run utilities have long urged regulators to crack down on small poorly planned dams, which they say have eroded their own profits. Hengduan’s Yang suspects small plants are being shut down to free up grid access for bigger dams. “These small hydropower plants originally had grid agreements, and if they were legal, they could connect,” he said. “If they can’t access the grid because there are many big plants, that isn’t right.” As far as Zhang the farmer is concerned, big hydro has already squeezed the life from the Zhougong, on which people have depended for decades. “Tens of thousands of people have made their living here, but soon it won’t be possible,” he said.

2018-08-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The launch of China’s first crude futures contract in Shanghai has added a long-awaited Asian benchmark to the global oil sector, challenging the dominance of Western price-markers and threatening ramifications far beyond the energy industry.  Since their launch in March 2018, Shanghai crude futures have stolen market share from the incumbent benchmarks - Europe’s Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) - which trade oil derivatives worth trillions of dollars every year.  Volumes have also far bypassed other crude futures, such as those that the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) launched in 2007 with the goal of creating a Middle East/Asian price benchmark.  This shift in oil markets could have far-reaching implications, including in foreign exchange markets.  “It’s significant. Given the prominence of China in oil markets, we could see more use of the Shanghai contract,” said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.  He said foreign exchange markets were also “taking notice of any yuanification.”  Since launching in late March, front-month volumes in Shanghai crude futures ISCc1 have risen to trade almost 2.8 million lots of 1,000 barrels in July.  This gave the contract a market share for July of 14.4 percent, compared with 28.9 percent for Brent LCOc1 and 56.7 percent for WTI CLc1 crude futures.  “Shanghai crude has good liquidity due to its high volatility and its correlation with international oil futures. It has become a good investment for speculators,” said Zhang Huiyao, Deputy General Manager for crude oil trading at Huatai Futures in Guangzhou.  Despite this early success, operator Shanghai International Energy Exchange is playing it cool.  “China’s crude oil futures remain ... behind the mature contracts in Europe and the U.S.,” President Jiang Yan told Chinese media this month.  “For the contract to have greater impact, it requires ... greater participation by foreign companies,” he said.  Zhang Huiyao of Huatai Futures said more industrial players and pure trading companies would also help.  “We are hoping the exchange will create more derivatives contracts linked to the current crude oil futures to engage more diverse investors,” she said.  Commodity exchanges often build futures volumes by introducing related contracts, which could include buy/sell options, forward contract time spreads or, in the case of a crude contract, derivatives for refined fuel products.  (GRAPHIC: Shanghai vs WTI & Brent crude futures, tmsnrt.rs/2P2ZZJz) Given China’s status as the world’s biggest oil importer, some analysts say the rise of Shanghai crude futures as a benchmark was inevitable.  Yet there has been a more immediate reason for its fast rise: U.S. sanctions against Iran.  Washington re-imposed sanctions on Tehran in May, including its financial sector and transactions in the U.S. dollar. From November, the sanctions will also target Iranian oil exports, and Washington has put pressure on companies and governments around the globe to fall in line.  As Iran’s biggest customer and amid its trade dispute with Washington, Beijing is expected to ignore U.S. demands.  China is already shifting some of its crude futures trading activity away from the dollar and into its own yuan.  “I’m convinced China’s strategy on the trade war is it will continue to purchase crude from Iran in yuan, hedging (in) Shanghai,” Innes said, eliminating the currency risk of buying oil in the U.S. dollar.  Given Russia’s own disputes with Washington, Innes said it could also be interested in selling oil to China in the yuan.  Shanghai crude futures could eventually remake global oil markets.  Beyond an active take-up from domestic retail traders, China’s large oil firms have moved some futures positions out of Brent and into Shanghai crude, said Barry White, senior vice president for derivatives sales at U.S. financial services firm INTL FCStone.  Chinese oil refiners find the medium to sour Middle East crude underlying Shanghai futures “more in line with their imports and usage” than Brent, which is priced off North Sea crude grades that tend to be lighter in quality, White said.  The first front-month contract since the Shanghai oil futures were launched is due for delivery in September, with Chinese oil-trading majors like Unipec (600028.SS), China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] and Zhenhua Oil accounting for most of the volume.  CNPC declined to comment, while Unipec and Zhenhua Oil did not immediately respond to queries.  Western commodity merchants and banks have also been doing test trades in Shanghai crude futures, brokers and company sources said, and are planning to start playing a bigger role.  While other futures like DME’s Oman crude 1OQc1 have had some success as a benchmark for physical oil prices, their take-up by the financial industry has been limited.  China’s new benchmark could change this, potentially breaking the Brent-WTI financial duopoly that has dominated oil trading for decades, requiring international traders to get used to dealing some crude futures in yuan.  “The internationalisation of the yuan will continue to pick up the pace as mainland markets become more accessible and transparent, and the Shanghai oil contract is an excellent start to that process,” said OANDA’s Innes.

2018-08-31,"(Adds executive quote, company background) By Chen Aizhu BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shanghai Zhida Hailan Energy Co Ltd, a private energy trader set up in May last year, is one of the companies that delivered crude oil against the Shanghai September futures contract on Friday, a company spokesman told Reuters. The Shanghai firm’s participation in the delivery is a sign that the nascent oil contract could potentially attract more private participation. It was the first physical settlement of the contract that China hopes to grow into a global benchmark that can take on established markets like Brent. The Shanghai-based company delivered 100,000 barrels of Iraqi oil Basra Light into storage in Zhanjiang, the only private firm among the five companies that delivered a total of 601,000 barrels of crude oil through the exchange. The other four companies that made deliveries are all state-run, including Chinaoil, Unipec, CNPC Fuel Oil, Zhenhua Oil. The September-delivery crude contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) expired on Friday. The INE contract is the first yuan-denominated oil contract and is aimed at building a regional benchmark to reflect China’s purchasing and pricing power in the crude market. China is the world’s biggest oil importer. “As China is set to deregulate its energy markets further, it offers immense opportunities for the private companies to be engaged in the value chain,” said an industry executive familiar with the Shanghai company’s strategy. Zhida Hailan, a joint venture between Shanghai Zhida Holding Group and Shanghai Hailan Energy Corp, procures and trades road-paving bitumen, said the executive, who declined to be named as he’s not authorised to speak to the press. The firm also trades bitumen and fuel oil contracts at the Shanghai exchange, he added. Zhida Holding Group, which controls 55 percent of the trading firm, is engaged in highway building and information technology, according to the company website. Chen Yang, Zhida Hailan’s spokesman, confirmed the company’s delivery into the crude oil contract, adding that the company sees the Shanghai oil contract as an opportunity to break into the energy trading business.

2018-08-31,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Investment banks which lost out on big payouts for the work on the shelved listing of oil giant Aramco are lining up for a raft of other projects as Saudi Arabia pursues reforms.   Banks including JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) worked for months to prepare what would have been the biggest ever stock market debut. But the plan to sell 5 percent of the company for a targeted $100 billion (76.88 billion pounds) was pulled. The bankers were paid retainer fees but were expecting around $200 million would be shared among all the banks involved when the deal was done.   Now, they are pinning their hopes on other projects from a privatisation programme that is part of Riyadh’s economic reform plan to loosen its reliance on oil. Without the funds from the Aramco sale, the government is looking to raise money in other ways, creating new opportunities for the banks, bankers say.   Teams from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley that worked on the IPO, have been shifted to advise on Aramco’ planned acquisition of up to $70 billion in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE, three people familiar with the details of the transaction told Reuters.  HSBC (HSBA.L), which was also an adviser on the Aramco IPO, is expected to play a role in putting together the debt to fund that purchase, they said. One of the sources said the issue could exceed the 2016 sovereign bond issue of $17.5 billion, which was a record for the kingdom. Aramco said earlier this month it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire the stake in SABIC but has not said how it will finance the deal. Spokespeople for JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC declined to comment on their role in the Sabic deal. None of those banks have confirmed they were involved in the Aramco IPO. Other deals are expected to be forthcoming. “The PIF (sovereign wealth fund) has had to reconsider its budget in the last three months, after finding out that they wouldn’t be getting $100 billion from the Aramco IPO right away,” said a banker in Saudi Arabia. “So there’s been a flurry of activity as they look to raise cash in other ways. A lot of these are smaller deals, $1 billion here and there, but all geared towards financing their commitments for big infrastructure projects without slowing down their timelines.”  The banker did not give details of the other deals. PIF officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. After Reuters reported last week that the Aramco deal had been shelved, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government was committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future. The bankers are nevertheless wary after the Aramco experience. It highlighted the hurdles of doing business in a country governed by an absolute monarchy where public protest and political parties are banned. It also added to uncertainty after scores of top royals, ministers and businessmen were rounded up in an anti-corruption campaign last November. The preparation for the listing was launched by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman two years ago and some bankers had flown to the kingdom hundreds of times to work in the Dhahran camp, a gated compound for the oil group’s residents.  A different source said Aramco had demanded it deal only with the very top bankers. Another person familiar with the Aramco deal said he had made more than 20 trips to Dhahran over 18 months but with little to show for it. He said his team would “give the same presentation each time without getting much feedback.” Bankers also say the fees are modest in comparison to those paid by other countries.    “The deal flow is huge but there’s a worry that the fees coming from these projects are low,” said a Gulf-based banker who spoke on conditions of anonymity.  “Saudi Arabia is lower than Hong Kong and Dubai when it comes to fees,” he said. “It’s all substandard.” Typical fees for banks doing IPOs in more developed markets are around 1 percent of the overall deal while estimates from bankers and analysts for an Aramco IPO was 0.2 percent. The 35 banks who worked on Chinese internet giant Alibaba’s $21.8 billion float, led by six main underwriters, pocketed an estimated $300 million among them, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Still, the rewards from a privatisation that analysts expect to generate ($9 billion to $11 billion) by 2020 are too big for bankers to ignore. HSBC is already advising Saudi International Petrochemical Company on a potential merger with Sahara Petrochemical, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley, according to disclosures from March.    U.S. bank Citigroup (C.N) obtained a licence to conduct capital markets business in Saudi Arabia last year after an absence of almost 13 years. Moelis is preparing to apply for an advisory licence in Saudi Arabia and U.S. boutique investment bank Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017. The government is also trying to make it easier to do deals, changing the law to allow alternatives to traditional debt finance. “There are plenty of deals to be made from bigger players looking to consolidate their market position and buy out competitors,” said Mohammed Fahmi, the Dubai-based co-Head of EFG Hermes Investment Banking. “Good stories will continue to see a following.”  Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva in London and Katie Paul in Dubai; editing by John O'Donnell and Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-deals/bruised-bankers-seek-consolation-prizes-after-shelved-aramco-ipo-idUKL3N1VI2YN,31 Aug 2018,"* Bankers disappointed after months preparing Aramco IPO

2018-08-31,"* Gas to flow through Nord Stream 2 by end 2019 * Half investments done, pipes are being laid * European partners say remain committed By Olesya Astakhova and Vera Eckert MOSCOW/FRANKFURT, Aug 31 (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline to transport Russian gas to Germany is progressing on schedule, its operator said on Friday, with European investors still committed to the project despite criticism from the United States and the threat of sanctions. In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe. Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project. The pipeline will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, where its gas giant Gazprom has faced past disruptions. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine, a key Russian gas export route, over gas prices and transit fees have resulted in a number of supply stoppages to Europe in the past decade. “The project is progressing according to schedule,” Nord Stream 2 AG, the Swiss-based project’s operating company, told Reuters in the emailed statement. Gas is due to start flowing at the end of 2019 to bypass routes through Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from a current 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is taking on half the planned costs of some 9.5 billion euros ($11.10 billion). The rest is divided between five European energy companies - Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Engie and Austria’s OMV. By the end of June 4.8 billion euros had already been invested in the 1,200-km long project, and pipelaying in the Baltic Sea started in July. “Uniper will remain one of the financing partners of this project and we are - as before - fully committed to the project,” Uniper’s chief financial officer Christopher Delbrueck said in a statement this week. “We will continue to adhere to our contractual obligations to Nord Stream 2.” Austria’s OMV has spent 465 million euros on the project so far, it said in a written reply to a Reuters request. That represents half of the around 950 million euros each Western company pledged to commit in financing. “We are monitoring the situation very closely.... We trust, and our experience showed us so far, that U.S. sanctions are not being done to harm European companies,” OMV said. Gazprom and its European partners say the Nord Stream 2 project is aimed at ensuring energy security in the region as gas production falls in Europe and as Gazprom remains in conflict with Ukraine. Shell declined to comment and Engie did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. A Wintershall spokesman said that the company was “following developments” in the United States closely, declining additional comments. $1 = 0.8559 euros

2018-08-31,"Oil analysts cut their price forecasts for 2018 for the first time in almost a year in August, given growing concern over the impact on crude demand from escalating trade tensions, although falling supply, particularly from Iran, would likely limit losses, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. A survey of 45 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude to average $72.71 a barrel in 2018, 16 cents lower than the $72.87 projected in the previous month’s poll and above the $71.96 average so far this year. The price was forecast to average $72.58 in 2019. U.S. crude futures were forecast to average $67.13 a barrel in 2018, compared with $67.32 forecast last month and an average of $66.40 until now. “The eventual loss of Iranian barrels is likely to match, if not exceed, the amount seen during the multi-lateral round of sanctions in 2012-2015,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas. Supply is also at risk in countries like Venezuela, Libya and Angola, he said. “These supply side factors presents strong upside for oil prices.”  U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector will come into force on Nov. 4, although the country’s crude oil and condensate exports are already expected to have fallen to a 16-month low in August. The United States wants to force buyers of Iranian oil to cut their imports from OPEC’s third-largest producer to nothing, after an international nuclear deal between the two nations was dissolved. However, there is a concern among analysts that global trade disputes could undermine economic growth, which in turn may mean Asian importers’ demand for crude oil declines. The United States is embroiled in an ever-escalating trade war with multiple countries, especially China. “Trade tensions could slow oil demand growth in Asia, likewise possible contagion of the Turkey crisis; slower demand growth would make it easier to replace Iranian barrels,” said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank. Analysts said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would continue to adjust its crude supply to ensure the global oil market remained in balance. Saudi Arabia will be a strong contender to fill in the supply deficit caused by Iran sanctions and tensions elsewhere in the coming months, a majority of industry experts said. “At the moment the market is looking balanced over the fourth-quarter, assuming Iranian supply falls by around 500,000 barrels per day. The obvious upside risk is if Iranian losses are greater than this, as this would push the market into deficit over the final quarter,” said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson.

2018-08-31,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s consumption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is set to fall as the country’s nuclear reactors restart, with output from atomic power set for its highest since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster.  Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) will restart the 870-megawatt (MW) No. 4 reactor at its Takahama station later on Friday, a spokesman told Reuters.  The Kansai restart followed Kyushu Electric Power (9508.T) bringing back the 890-MW No. 2 reactor at its Sendai plant on Wednesday. Kyushu now has four reactors running. Each returning reactor will cut demand for LNG by as much as 1 million tonnes a year, said Kosho Tamura, a gas analyst at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. The return of Japan’s nuclear capacity should lead to lower imports of fossil fuels, especially LNG. While that is a positive for Japan’s utilities, especially as LNG prices are near four-year highs in Asia, the loss of Japanese demand could undermine the demand outlook for the global market. Japan is the world’s biggest buyer of LNG. “It’s a good thing that the power utilities in western Japan have restarted nuclear plants, which is leading to the cuts in fossil fuel costs, primarily LNG, through the continued operations of nuclear plants,” said Tomoko Murakami, manager of the nuclear energy group at the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). Kansai is Japan’s second-largest utility by sales and was the most reliant on nuclear power before the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, when a nuclear power plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami. Before the disaster, Japan had the world’s third-largest reactor fleet which provided about one-third of its electricity. But the plants were shut down for relicensing after Fukushima highlighted regulatory failings. Kansai will have three units operating and expects to have another reactor at Takahama restarted in November after shutting it down earlier this month for maintenance and refuelling, its spokesman said.  Those three units will save about $1.5 billion (1.15 billion pounds) in fuel costs each year they are running, the Kansai spokesman said, declining to comment on what fuels it would substitute.  Operating Kyushu’s nuclear units will save the company about $2.2 billion in annual costs based on current LNG prices, its spokeswoman said.     With two more reactors likely to restart by the end of the year, when Japan enters its peak demand period, as much as 9 million tonnes of LNG demand could be replaced by nuclear operations.  Japan’s electric power utilities burn less LNG as reactors return - reut.rs/2LHbLXO The country’s use of LNG in power generation has been declining this year as more reactors return. In June, LNG imports fell to the lowest monthly amount since May 2016 and for the year through to July are down 2.4 percent. The Fukushima disaster sparked the country’s worst energy crisis in the post-war period, forcing it to import record amounts of LNG and driving prices to record highs. Utilities also turned to cheaper coal imports.

2018-08-31,"* Global stocks fall as Trump threatens new tariffs * Argentina’s peso in freefall despite surprise rate hike By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Asian shares came under renewed pressure on Friday after reports U.S. President Donald Trump was preparing to step up a trade war with Beijing and ready to impose more tariffs on Chinese imports. Many emerging market currencies were also frail after Argentina’s peso sank on Thursday despite the central bank’s interest rate hike. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.2 percent in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.8 percent. U.S. S&P500 e-mini futures fell 0.17 percent. On Thursday, the S&P 500 lost 0.44 percent from Wednesday’s record close of 2,914. Pouring cold water on the rally in global shares, which started in the middle of the month, were hostile comments from Trump on trade. Bloomberg reported that Trump said he was ready to impose more tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods from China as soon as the public comment period on the plan ends next week. “So far, Trump has carried out what he said he would do,” said Ayako Sera, market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “Even though there are some doubts the U.S. trade representative could come up with new tariffs so quickly, I suspect worries about a trade war will start to eclipse optimism based on strong U.S. economic data.” Trump also threatened in an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday to withdraw from the World Trade Organization if “they don’t shape up” — a move that would further undermine one of the foundations of the modern global trading system. In addition, he said the European Union’s proposal to eliminate auto tariffs is not good enough and called its trade policies “almost as bad as China.” The cautious mood helped lift the yen, which rose 0.6 percent on Thursday, its biggest daily rise in about six weeks. In early Friday trade, it changed hands at 111.04 per dollar . The euro traded flat at $1.1665, having shed 0.33 percent in the previous session. The common currency has recovered from a 13-1/2-month low of $1.1301 hit in mid-August but looks set to end the month little changed from end-July. Emerging market currencies had less luck. The peso, the world’s worst-performing currency this year due to the country’s poor economic health, fell 10 percent on the day, bringing its month-to-date losses to 27 percent. Argentina’s central bank at an emergency meeting on Thursday voted unanimously to raise its benchmark rate to 60 percent from 45 percent, however, the unexpected move failed to stabilise the peso. That knocked down the Brazilian real to near its record low touched in September 2015. It is down almost 10 percent this month. The Turkish lira, which has been hit by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s interference in monetary policy and his diplomatic spats with Washington, also slipped towards record low marked about two weeks ago. The lira stood at 6.740 per dollar in early Friday trade, having fallen 11 percent so far this week. Oil prices slipped slightly after hitting their highest levels in more than a month the previous day on growing evidence of disruptions to crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and after a fall in U.S. inventories. Brent crude oil dropped 0.3 percent to $77.51 a barrel from Thursday’s settlement at $77.77. U.S. crude stood down 0.3 percent at $70.04 a barrel.

2018-08-31,"(Repeats column with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shows signs of extending its nine-year expansion with the help of tax cuts and strong business and consumer confidence. Both the longevity of the expansion and the apparent limited slack in the labour and product markets suggest the current pace of growth is probably not sustainable in the medium term. The current cyclical expansion is 110 months old and will be the longest on record if the economy is still growing in July 2019. (tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto) While longevity alone is not a good predictor of cyclical turning points, with most financial and economic indicators close to multi-decade highs, the balance of risks is shifting. “What matters primarily ... is not the passage of calendar time but what happens over time in and to the economy in motion. It is historical and psychological time, filled with events and processes, perceptions and actions. “There is a simple corollary: knowledge of the current phase of the business cycle and its age can help but must not be used in isolation,” Victor Zarnowitz, a leading U.S. expert on business cycles, wrote in 1992. “The variability in length of business expansions and contractions is sufficiently large for the timing of cyclical turning points to be very difficult to forecast. “The age of a phase alone is not of much help in predicting its end: what matters more is the dynamics of the evolving business situation. (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting,” Zarnowitz, 1992) Zarnowitz went on to observe: “The largest errors in forecasts ... are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense they miss recessions and recoveries.” Fears about a future slowdown in the U.S. economy have grown as the U.S. Treasury curve has come closer to inverting, given the close correlation between slowdowns and inversions over several decades. Yields on U.S. Treasury paper with two years to maturity are now just 22 basis points below yields on 10-year notes, the narrowest gap since a few months before the start of the last recession in December 2007. The yield curve exhibits strongly cyclical behaviour, with a large negative gap during economic slowdowns and a smaller negative gap or even a positive one during expansions. To some extent, whether or not the curve actually inverts is arbitrary, since there is no special significance in the zero line, and the long-term average has been around 105-115 basis points. So the current gap is already in the 82nd-83rd percentile of the long-term distribution across multiple cycles since 1983, and the is economy already well into the cycle’s boom/tightening phase. It is not possible to predict either the precise timing or the depth of the next slowdown, but the narrowing yield gap indicates the distribution of risks over the next couple of years is now skewed to the downside. There are more scenarios in which something could go wrong (accelerating inflation, an emerging markets crisis, monetary policy errors, or a deterioration in corporate finances) and fewer in which everything goes right. The current yield gap is consistent with a wealth of other indicators, including purchasing surveys, consumer confidence, unemployment, retail price inflation, freight movements and the escalation in share prices. They all point to an economy approaching a cyclical peak, and then likely to move into a period of more moderate growth, if not recession, over the next 12 to 24 months. The critical question is whether the next slowdown, when it comes, proves just a pause in an otherwise sustained expansion (1994/95) or marks an end to the current cycle and start of a new one (2000/01 or 2007/08).

2018-08-31,"LESHAN, China (Reuters) - In a mountain village in southwest China’s Sichuan province, authorities have demolished seven small dam projects this year along a river to clear illegal developments in a new nature reserve. The demolition is part of a nationwide program to close hundreds of tiny and often ramshackle dams and turbines and bring order to China’s massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction. The dams sat on an unnamed tributary of the fierce and flood-prone Dadu river, which feeds into the Yangtze, Asia’s largest and longest river, where the government says the “irregular development” of thousands of small hydropower projects has wrecked the ecology. (For a series of pictures, please click here: reut.rs/2N3xvlz) But green groups say the campaign will not necessarily save the environment because it will not affect big state hydropower stations, which they say have caused the most damage. On the Zhougong river, another tributary, seventy-year-old farmer Zhang, who declined to give his full name, reckons big dams have devastated the ecology. Zhang described himself as a “hydropower migrant” after his land was inundated by state dam builders 10 years ago. He said changes in the Zhougong’s flow and temperature had devastated the local fish population, with one species favored by the Sichuan-born former leader Deng Xiaoping now wiped out. “The fish here now taste terrible, and are fit only for dogs,” he said, pointing to three silver carp he had caught after they were swept down river by flood waters from an upstream reservoir. China triggered an aggressive damming program 20 years ago as it looked for ways to develop industry and bring electricity to poor rural regions not connected to the power grid. Investors rushed in and environmentalists likened the frenzy to the construction of backyard steel smelters during the ill-fated 1958 “Great Leap Forward”, a program that aimed to industrialize China’s agrarian society but caused widespread famine as farmers made metal instead of food. Now, the government wants to reverse course and the environmentally conscious leadership must decide how much of China’s 100 gigawatts of small-scale capacity needs to close, while at the same time protecting expensive state investments. “Hydropower was a good thing at the time, but as is often the case in China, it turns into a swarm and we basically lose control,” said Chen Guojie, a hydropower expert with the China Academy of Sciences in Chengdu, central China. Sichuan underlines the case. Total hydropower reached more than 75 GW in 2017, greater than the total in most Asian countries. It was also more than double the capacity of the province’s power grid, meaning lots of wasted power. China’s official hydropower capacity was about 340 GW at the end of June and around a third of that is considered small hydropower, projects of less than 50 MW. China’s overall power capacity, including coal and nuclear plants, is 1,740 GW. In June, state auditors identified 24,100 small hydropower projects in the 11 regions along the Yangtze, and said the environmental costs of some plants were too high even though they had made “historical contributions” to development. A month later, Beijing ordered the regions to ban new construction and “rectify” illegal projects, although it remains uncertain how many will be decommissioned. “There is no unified standard, and we still aren’t clear which small-scale plants should be demolished and which ones retained,” said Yang Yong, chairman of the Hengduan Mountain Research Society, a Sichuan-based environmental group. The government says small dams have disrupted the habitats and breeding patterns of many rare species of fish, although green groups argue the damage wrought by bigger dams is more severe, with entire towns and ecosystems submerged in water, which they say increases the risk of earthquakes, landslides and even climate change. On the 30-mile (48 km) Zhougong, authorities have already demolished small projects built in nature reserves or encroaching upon new “ecological red lines” drawn up to shield a quarter of China’s territory from development. But the river houses 10 larger stations run by some of the country’s biggest firms, including Guodian, Huadian and the State Grid Corp, and the “overdevelopment” of the river was criticized by the environment ministry earlier this year.  None of the firms, or their local subsidiaries, responded to requests for comment. Central government-run utilities have long urged regulators to crack down on small poorly planned dams, which they say have eroded their own profits. Hengduan’s Yang suspects small plants are being shut down to free up grid access for bigger dams. “These small hydropower plants originally had grid agreements, and if they were legal, they could connect,” he said. “If they can’t access the grid because there are many big plants, that isn’t right.” As far as Zhang the farmer is concerned, big hydro has already squeezed the life from the Zhougong, on which people have depended for decades. “Tens of thousands of people have made their living here, but soon it won’t be possible,” he said.

2018-08-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The launch of China’s first crude futures contract in Shanghai has added a long-awaited Asian benchmark to the global oil sector, challenging the dominance of Western price-markers and threatening ramifications far beyond the energy industry.  Since their launch in March 2018, Shanghai crude futures have stolen market share from the incumbent benchmarks - Europe’s Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) - which trade oil derivatives worth trillions of dollars every year.  Volumes have also far bypassed other crude futures, such as those that the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) launched in 2007 with the goal of creating a Middle East/Asian price benchmark.  This shift in oil markets could have far-reaching implications, including in foreign exchange markets.  “It’s significant. Given the prominence of China in oil markets, we could see more use of the Shanghai contract,” said Stephen Innes, head of Asia-Pacific trading at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.  He said foreign exchange markets were also “taking notice of any yuanification.”  Since launching in late March, front-month volumes in Shanghai crude futures ISCc1 have risen to trade almost 2.8 million lots of 1,000 barrels in July.  This gave the contract a market share for July of 14.4 percent, compared with 28.9 percent for Brent LCOc1 and 56.7 percent for WTI CLc1 crude futures.  “Shanghai crude has good liquidity due to its high volatility and its correlation with international oil futures. It has become a good investment for speculators,” said Zhang Huiyao, Deputy General Manager for crude oil trading at Huatai Futures in Guangzhou.  Despite this early success, operator Shanghai International Energy Exchange is playing it cool.  “China’s crude oil futures remain ... behind the mature contracts in Europe and the U.S.,” President Jiang Yan told Chinese media this month.  “For the contract to have greater impact, it requires ... greater participation by foreign companies,” he said.  Zhang Huiyao of Huatai Futures said more industrial players and pure trading companies would also help.  “We are hoping the exchange will create more derivatives contracts linked to the current crude oil futures to engage more diverse investors,” she said.  Commodity exchanges often build futures volumes by introducing related contracts, which could include buy/sell options, forward contract time spreads or, in the case of a crude contract, derivatives for refined fuel products.  (GRAPHIC: Shanghai vs WTI & Brent crude futures, tmsnrt.rs/2P2ZZJz) Given China’s status as the world’s biggest oil importer, some analysts say the rise of Shanghai crude futures as a benchmark was inevitable.  Yet there has been a more immediate reason for its fast rise: U.S. sanctions against Iran.  Washington re-imposed sanctions on Tehran in May, including its financial sector and transactions in the U.S. dollar. From November, the sanctions will also target Iranian oil exports, and Washington has put pressure on companies and governments around the globe to fall in line.  As Iran’s biggest customer and amid its trade dispute with Washington, Beijing is expected to ignore U.S. demands.  China is already shifting some of its crude futures trading activity away from the dollar and into its own yuan.  “I’m convinced China’s strategy on the trade war is it will continue to purchase crude from Iran in yuan, hedging (in) Shanghai,” Innes said, eliminating the currency risk of buying oil in the U.S. dollar.  Given Russia’s own disputes with Washington, Innes said it could also be interested in selling oil to China in the yuan.  Shanghai crude futures could eventually remake global oil markets.  Beyond an active take-up from domestic retail traders, China’s large oil firms have moved some futures positions out of Brent and into Shanghai crude, said Barry White, senior vice president for derivatives sales at U.S. financial services firm INTL FCStone.  Chinese oil refiners find the medium to sour Middle East crude underlying Shanghai futures “more in line with their imports and usage” than Brent, which is priced off North Sea crude grades that tend to be lighter in quality, White said.  The first front-month contract since the Shanghai oil futures were launched is due for delivery in September, with Chinese oil-trading majors like Unipec (600028.SS), China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] and Zhenhua Oil accounting for most of the volume.  CNPC declined to comment, while Unipec and Zhenhua Oil did not immediately respond to queries.  Western commodity merchants and banks have also been doing test trades in Shanghai crude futures, brokers and company sources said, and are planning to start playing a bigger role.  While other futures like DME’s Oman crude 1OQc1 have had some success as a benchmark for physical oil prices, their take-up by the financial industry has been limited.  China’s new benchmark could change this, potentially breaking the Brent-WTI financial duopoly that has dominated oil trading for decades, requiring international traders to get used to dealing some crude futures in yuan.  “The internationalisation of the yuan will continue to pick up the pace as mainland markets become more accessible and transparent, and the Shanghai oil contract is an excellent start to that process,” said OANDA’s Innes.
