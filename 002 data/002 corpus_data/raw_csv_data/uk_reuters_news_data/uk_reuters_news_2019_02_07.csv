2019-02-07,"WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV told Reuters on Thursday it paid $77 million in U.S. civil penalties late last year for failing to meet 2016 model year fuel economy requirements. The Italian-American automaker has been lobbying the Trump administration to revise fuel economy requirements and last year regulators proposed freezing requirements at 2020 model year levels through 2026. Shane Karr, head of external affairs for Fiat Chrysler in North America, said in a statement the fuel economy program should be reformed rather than “requiring companies to make large compliance payments because assumptions made in 2011 turned out to be wrong.” (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/fiat-chrysler-emissions-penalties/fiat-chrysler-paid-u-s-77-million-in-fuel-economy-penalties-in-2018-idUKL1N2021OX,07 Feb 2019,"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV

2019-02-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell about 2 percent on Thursday as the market was weighed down by concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year. A rebound from late December lows seemed to stall amid worries that a trade war between the U.S. and China would continue, weighing on demand. The market also contended with the possibility that oil producers would not adhere strictly to cuts agreed to last year.  Brent crude futures fell $1.06 a barrel, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $61.63.  U.S. crude futures fell $1.37 a barrel, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $52.64.  “The correction is stalled, mainly on concerns about demand growth,” said Gene McGillian, director of Market Research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “There seems to be uncertainty about what is going to happen with the trade talks, with global economic growth and demand in the coming year,” he said.  In particular, he said, the market is worried about whether demand is sufficient to absorb growing crude production from the U.S.  “Supply fundamentals have increasingly been turning supportive in recent weeks, but against this the market still worries about the yet-to-be-realized – if at all – impact on demand from weaker macroeconomic fundamentals,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Though the United States published robust jobs data last week, global markets remain nervous after China reported the lowest annual economic growth in nearly 30 years in January. That focuses yet more attention on the outcome of U.S.-China talks to end the trade war between the world’s top two economies.  The oil price also came under pressure as weekly data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday showed an unwelcome increase in stocks of crude oil.     A decline in OPEC production and a squeeze on supply from Iran and Venezuela because of U.S. sanctions have led many analysts to forecast that the market will be balanced in 2019. The oil price is showing a 20 percent gain so far this year. Price support is provided by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tighten the market. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, told OPEC it had pumped 10.24 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, two OPEC sources told Reuters, a deeper cut than targeted in the supply pact. The kingdom pumped 10.643 million bpd in December. “We believe that financial markets may be overestimating the risks of a global recession,” said Jean-Pierre Durante, Head of Applied Research at Pictet Wealth Management. “Moreover, lower oil prices – prices were between 14 percent and 18 percent lower in January than their 2018 average – are likely to stimulate economic activity and oil demand, particularly in emerging markets.”     U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s oil industry are expected to freeze sales proceeds of Venezuelan crude exports to the United States.

2019-02-07,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a former U.S.-based  oil trader for Brazil’s Petrobras already charged in his home country with taking part in a corruption scheme involving commodity companies Vitol SA, Glencore PLC  and Trafigura AG, according to people familiar with the matter. It was the first confirmation that U.S. investigators have joined a new phase of Brazil’s “Car Wash” corruption probe, which has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America. The U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York is talking to Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, a Houston-based oil trader wanted on charges in Brazil for accepting millions of dollars in kickbacks for himself and others, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Berkowitz, 39, is cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation and could face charges in the United States, one of the people said, although he has not been currently charged. Berkowitz could not be reached for comment through associates, phone or emails, and it was not immediately known what law firm was representing him.  Brazilian prosecutors said executives of the commodities companies, including some in the United States, were involved in improper payments to executives at state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and that Berkowitz and others worked directly with those firms.  Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura and others collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras officials to secure advantages in deals, Brazilian prosecutors said.  The New York case signals prosecutors there are examining the U.S. arms of Vitol and others implicated by Brazilian officials, as some of those funds moved through U.S. and European banking systems.  Bribes paid to Petrobras moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, Brazilian authorities have said, opening an avenue for U.S. prosecutors to probe for violations of U.S. money laundering laws.  In December, Mike Loya, the Houston-based head of Vitol’s U.S. operations, was named in Brazilian charging documents against Berkowitz and others of having full knowledge of the trading scheme. Loya has not been charged. He did not reply to requests for comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bini is handling the case, the people said. Reached by phone, Bini declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. Federal prosecutors in Brazil declined on Thursday to say if they were collaborating with the U.S. Justice Department on the case.  Investigators from New York’s Eastern District office have worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian prosecutors on the Car Wash probe in the past. In late 2016, they jointly negotiated with construction firm Odebrecht that resulted in a $2.6 billion fine and access to company executives who could provide testimony about decades of bribes paid across Latin America. Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore declined to comment on the U.S. investigation. Vitol and Glencore reiterated past statements that they are cooperating with Brazilian authorities, and Trafigura said it takes the allegations seriously. All have been suspended from business dealings with Petrobras.    Brazil issued an Interpol red notice in early December calling Berkowitz a fugitive from prosecution and requesting his detention. The U.S. Marshals office in Houston said this month it has not received a request to arrest Berkowitz.  U.S. authorities two months ago arrested Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade, a Brazilian businessman, over allegations he funnelled bribes to Petrobras officials from Vitol and others, according to Brazilian court documents.  Andrade, Berkowitz and nine others were charged in Brazil in December with allegations they funnelled business to Vitol and other trading firms between 2011 and 2014. Andrade could not be located to request comment.

2019-02-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on Thursday laid out a “Green New Deal” that would eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade, an effort to make climate change a central issue in the 2020 presidential race. The document, unveiled by rising political star Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey, marks the first formal attempt by lawmakers to define potential legislation to create big government-led investments in clean energy and infrastructure to transition the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels. The plan, which takes the form of a non-binding congressional resolution, outlines some of the most aggressive climate goals ever put forward by Democratic lawmakers and clashes dramatically with the Trump administration’s efforts to advance domestic oil, gas and coal production by rolling back environmental protections.  The name, Green New Deal, references the New Deal of the 1930s that President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to aid Americans suffering in the Great Depression by embarking on huge government-led infrastructure projects. “Today is the day that we choose to assert ourselves as a global leader in transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy and charting that path,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. The resolution so far has 64 House co-sponsors and nine Senate sponsors - four of whom are Democratic presidential hopefuls for 2020. Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gilibrand, Corey Booker and Elizabeth Warren co-sponsored the resolution. Ocasio-Cortez said she will immediately begin to work on legislation that would “fully flesh out the projects involved in the Green New Deal.”  Republicans have been quick to criticize the initiative, waving off any kind of proposal as heavy-handed. The Trump administration does not believe action on climate change is necessary and is focused on increasing production of oil, gas and coal on federal and private land. “It’s a socialist manifesto that lays out a laundry list of government giveaways, including guaranteed food, housing, college, & economic security even for those who refuse to work,” Republican Senator John Barrasso, chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said on Twitter. The non-binding resolution outlines several goals for the United States, including meeting 100 percent of power demand from zero-emission energy sources like wind and solar within 10 years. The plan also calls for new projects to modernize U.S. transportation infrastructure, cut carbon emissions from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, make buildings and homes more energy efficient and increase land preservation. The plan is intended to address the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which said global temperatures must be kept less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to avoid the most severe impacts of a changing climate, the authors of the policy said. The Green New Deal also aims to create an economic safety net for communities that will be affected by the impacts of climate change and the shift away from fossil fuel use, including through guarantees of healthcare, jobs, and jobs training. It was not clear how the programs would be funded. “We... need to be sure that workers currently employed in fossil fuel industries have higher-wages and better jobs available to them to be able to make this transition, and a federal jobs guarantee ensures that no worker is left behind,” according to a summary of the plan.      The Green New Deal was put into the media spotlight by a youth coalition called the Sunrise Movement and Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest woman to serve in Congress.        Members of the group have already put pressure on Democratic presidential hopefuls and plan to continue lobbying members of Congress next week to support the resolution.  Greg Carlock, a climate researcher with Data for Progress who helped author the Green New Deal, said lawmakers who seek middle ground policies on global warming risk losing youth support in future elections. “They will not accept vague endorsements,” he said.  Markey said on Thursday that despite its lofty goals, the Green New Deal has more political momentum than a carbon cap-and-trade legislation he introduced 10 years ago. “The difference between 2009 and today is the movement that has now been built,” he said. “This is going enter the 2020 election cycle as one of the top two or three issues for every candidate on both sides.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Nick Macfie, Dan Grebler and Cynthia Osterman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-climate-greennewdeal/update-2-u-s-democrats-float-green-new-deal-to-end-fossil-fuel-era-idUKL1N2020SM,07 Feb 2019,"Democrats on Thursday laid out

2019-02-07,"(Reuters) - Trading houses that resell Venezuelan crude oil have not yet found workarounds since the United States announced sanctions to cut off socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s revenue, according to shipping data and sources. Merchants, trading partners and Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA were expecting oil swaps and so-called triangulation of sales to be the easiest ways to continue shipping, as has happened when sanctions were imposed on other nations, such as Iran and Russia.  But the U.S. measures - tougher and deeper than past sanctions - have for now blocked a large portion of trading in Venezuelan oil worldwide as end-users are reluctant to take cargoes, leaving barrels stranded in the Atlantic basin, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. The lack of Venezuelan oil has U.S. refiners scrambling for replacements and threatens global trade that is worth $6 billion a year. The sanctions are affecting Europe-based trading firms including Trafigura and Vitol, which regularly offer Venezuelan oil to refiners, and PetroChina Co Ltd, which along with Russia’s Rosneft recoup money lent to Venezuela by reselling PDVSA barrels.  Almost 9 million barrels remain stuck in tankers waiting for payment or discharge instructions, according to Eikon data. Most are anchored in the U.S. Gulf Coast as self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido rushes to set up escrow accounts to receive proceeds. Trading companies have also delayed loadings of Venezuelan oil scheduled by PDVSA for February delivery, according to sources and data, because merchants are having trouble finding buyers. “No one who typically takes Venezuelan crude from us is lifting a single barrel,” a Trafigura trader said, referring to barrels offered on the spot market. “Buyers are not sure of the risks and how to ensure any payments are not remitted to PDVSA.” To be sure, PDVSA has not stopped exporting. There are more than a dozen tankers in the water headed for destinations like India, China and Singapore that have loaded since sanctions were imposed on Jan. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  Most vessels will not arrive at their destinations for several weeks, but they are for end-users like India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, which pays for Venezuelan crude by cash and oil swaps. Those exports, if completed, would amount to about 1 million barrels per day, short of the 1.4 million bpd average for the three previous months, according to Eikon.  The U.S. sanctions limit U.S. refiners to paying into escrow accounts that cannot be accessed by Maduro’s government, effectively cutting off shipments. Foreign firms that engage in oil trading involving the U.S. financial system or U.S. units are similarly restricted. Trafigura told Reuters the firm is following “all applicable sanctions.” Vitol did not immediately comment but has previously said that it is compliant with sanctions. PetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trading houses lifted some 255,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuela’s crude and fuel in 2018, or 20 percent of overall exports, according to PDVSA’s internal data seen by Reuters. Sales could flow temporarily if European branches of oil firms and trading houses find a way to sell Venezuelan crude in currencies other than U.S. dollars, but Europe is also mulling sanctions, meaning the window could close quickly. PetroChina, which resells Venezuelan oil to customers in destinations from the United States to Singapore, has recently reduced cargo lifting. The Aframax tanker Flavin chartered by PetroChina arrived in Venezuelan waters on Jan. 25, and was scheduled to load 500,000 barrels of fuel oil bound for Rotterdam, Netherlands. But the oil has not been loaded, in part due to sanctions, according to two sources involved in the case.  As of Feb. 7, the Flavin was still docked at PDVSA’s Amuay port, according to Eikon. Another PetroChina cargo, the Aframax Stride, was loaded on Jan. 25, but it is now anchored off the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius.

2019-02-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the world pulled back sharply on Thursday on fears of a global growth slowdown spreading to Europe and renewed worries about any near-term resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions, while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a sixth session. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.10 percent, on pace for its biggest one-day drop in more than a month as it receded from two-month highs reached earlier in the week. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.49 percent, as disappointing corporate updates from Publicis and other companies also weighed, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 benchmark index dropped 1.2 percent. The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next on expectations the bloc’s largest countries will be held back by global trade tensions and domestic challenges. Germany’s DAX stock index tumbled 2.7 percent as industrial output in  Europe’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month. Safe-haven assets gained, including Japan’s yen and gold. “Even though we are in the midst of earnings season, the macro environment is really impacting global risk sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago.  “Fears of a more dramatic slowdown in Europe are being joined with the fears around a slowdown in China. And the broad slowdown in global trade is having a direct impact on some of these economies and some of the results.” Heightened concerns about U.S.-China trade relations also rattled investors, including news that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are unlikely to meet before a March 1 deadline set by their governments to reach a trade deal, according to U.S. officials. “Europe kick-started us to the downside this morning and then there was follow-through from the Trump headline and all of a sudden you have an overdue sell-off on your hands,” said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.     On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 258.8 points, or 1.02 percent, to 25,131.5, the S&P 500 lost 31.79 points, or 1.16 percent, to 2,699.82 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 99.87 points, or 1.35 percent, to 7,275.41. U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp will buy rival SunTrust Banks Inc for about $28 billion in stock, the biggest bank deal in about a decade. Shares of both banks rose.  The downgrade in European growth expectations filtered into currency markets, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.1353. The dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.1 percent, firming for a sixth session in a row. The dollar’s gains come despite the Federal Reserve’s dovish shift on interest rates last week. “When analysing a currency’s exchange rate, it should be relative to a peer. So far it seems none of these peers have a competitive advantage, making the dollar the less unloved currency,” Hussein Sayed, strategist at forex broker FXTM, said in a note. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.6572 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Wednesday.

2019-02-07,"PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - France plans to back an EU proposal to regulate Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, its foreign ministry said on Thursday, potentially threatening its completion and dealing a blow to Germany which has been trying to garner support for the project.  The European Union executive wants to extend its internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines before construction is completed, giving it a say over how the new gas link under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany is used. In its current form, Nord Stream 2, fully owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom, would not be compliant with tougher new rules foreseen for new infrastructure projects.  Diplomatic sources said earlier that Germany had been pressuring other European capitals to block the new directive. “France intends to support the adoption of such a directive. Work is continuing with our partners, in particular with Germany, on possible changes to the text,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a briefing. Any delay in building the pipeline would create uncertainty for Gazprom’s partners: Germany’s Uniper and BASF’s Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. The EU bloc is divided in its support for the project. Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries view the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as holding the EU hostage to Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritise the economic benefits. An EU source said earlier that France’s vote would be decisive, likely leaving Germany short of a blocking minority. Opponents of the pipeline worry it will weaken support for Ukraine by depriving Kiev of gas transit fees along the traditional route for Russian supplies, which fill over a third of the EU’s gas needs. The U.S. ambassadors to Germany, Denmark and the European Union urged EU members to vote against the pipeline. “Cancelling the project would send a clear signal that Moscow cannot get away unscathed with its aggression against neighbouring states, and its meddling in our democracies,” they wrote in a joint op-ed published by Deutsche Welle on Thursday. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Nord Stream 2 would not make Germany dependent on Russia for gas, stressing that Ukraine must remain a transit country. “Do we become dependent on Russia due to this second gas pipeline? I say ‘no’, if we diversify at the same time,” Merkel told a news conference in Bratislava. Uniper, which has so far spent about 600 million euros (525.42 million pounds) out of the 950 million it earmarked for the project, said its assumption was that Nord Stream 2 would still be realised. “This is a project for the next decades and therefore, to a certain extent, independent of current events,” a spokesman for the group said.     A spokesman for Wintershall said the group would closely watch any further developments. If the proposed regulation musters enough support, negotiations on final draft rules could begin as early as next week.

2019-02-07,"BENGHAZI, Libya, Feb 7 (Reuters) - East Libyan military forces control a pumping substation for the El Sharara oilfield but the main production area is still occupied by armed tribesmen, a field engineer said on Thursday. The Libyan National Army (LNA), based in the east of the politically divided country, said on Wednesday it had seized the 315,000 barrels per day field from tribesmen and protesters who forced operations to halt when they took the site on Dec. 8. The engineer, who asked not to be identified, said a convoy of LNA vehicles had arrived at a substation about 20 km (12 miles) from main field, which extends for 40 km (25 miles) in Libya’s southern desert. He said the field perimeter was not fenced off and said the LNA was still trying to negotiate access to the main facility with the tribesman and protesters, who had taken the field demanding salary payments and development funds. The National Oil Corporation, the state-owned oil firm based in the west of Libya, shut production as a result of the protest and declared force majeure, a waiver on its contracts. The LNA, loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a commander whose powerbase is the eastern city of Benghazi, had demanded on Wednesday that production resume and force majeure be lifted. NOC and the internationally recognised government, also based in the Tripoli in Libya’s west, declined to comment. Oil output from the OPEC state has been disrupted since conflict erupted in 2011 and a political wedge was driven down the middle of the country. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure. Haftar’s LNA seized Benghazi, Libya’s second-largest city, in 2017, expelling Islamist and other fighters there. The LNA said last month it was launching an offensive to fight militants and secure oilfields in the south. A resident in Ubari, a town close to El Sharara, said one LNA unit had attacked by an unknown group in the area. Reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli and Ulf Laessing

2019-02-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - France warned its citizens in Chad on Thursday to be extra vigilant after its fighter jets struck a heavily-armed rebel convoy that crossed last week from southern Libya aiming to destabilise President Idriss Deby. French warplanes destroyed about 20 pick-up trucks in a third day of air strikes on Wednesday after Deby asked Paris for support. France sees him as key to a wider regional fight against Islamist militants. “Given the air operations which the French military are carrying out in northeast Chad and to prevent any malicious act against them, French nationals are urged to be more vigilant,” the embassy said in a message to its 1,500 citizens in Chad. The strikes, which started on Sunday, come as Chadian rebels have increased their activities in southern Libya since vowing last year to overthrow Deby. The Union of Forces of Resistance (UFR), a rebel Chadian coalition created in 2009 after almost toppling Deby, has said it was behind this week’s incursion, which saw some 50 pick-up trucks drive almost unopposed more than 600 km (372.82 miles) into Chadian territory. “Bombings are continuing today. Several dozen vehicles have been destroyed and there are many seriously wounded,” a senior UFR official told Reuters, declining to say how many had died. “We will not return to Libya. We will wage war inside Chad.”   Army spokesman Patrik Steiger said there had been no French air strikes on Thursday and the military was assessing the state and intentions of the convoy.  A statement after a Chad government meeting said Deby had informed ministers “the column of mercenaries” had been completely destroyed. Deby has faced several rebellions since seizing power in 1990 in a military coup. International observers have questioned the fairness of elections that have kept him in office since, and last year he pushed through constitutional reforms that could keep him in office until 2033. France intervened in 2008 to stop the UFR toppling Deby, but President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants a new relationship with France’s former colonies and the era of propping up leaders is over. However, France considers its former colony as vital in the fight against Islamist militants in West Africa and based its 4,500-strong counter-terrorism Operation Barkhane force in the capital N’djamena  The incursion, which Chadian troops had initially attempted to stop, underscores how Deby’s fight against Islamist militants in the region has strained his military and hit the oil-dependent economy, leading to growing dissatisfaction in one of the world’s poorest nations.

2019-02-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday the country will decide around 2022 whether state-owned utility EDF will be allowed to build new nuclear reactors. In November, Macron said France would reduce the share of nuclear in the power mix to 50 percent by 2035, down from 75 percent today, and said that a decision on whether to build new nuclear plants would be taken mid-2021. Because of repeated delays and budget overruns of EDF’s EPR reactor model under construction in Flamanville, northern France, Macron’s government has not yet committed to building new reactors once old reactors close.  “We will decide around 2022 about what France does with the new generation of EPRs, depending on the outcome of studies and any progress made,” Macron said during a debate with young people in the Saone-et-Loire region.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.95 percent, receding from two-month highs reached earlier in the week, as the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.11 percent. The European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next on expectations the bloc’s largest countries will be held back by global trade tensions and domestic challenges. Germany’s DAX stock index tumbled 2.3 percent as industrial output in Europe’s biggest economy unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month. “Even though we are in the midst of earnings season, the macro environment is really impacting global risk sentiment,” said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management in Chicago. “Fears of a more dramatic slowdown in Europe are being joined with the fears around a slowdown in China. And the broad slowdown in global trade is having a direct impact on some of these economies and some of the results.” Adding to the growth jitters, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said in a television interview that there was a sizable distance to go in U.S.-China trade talks. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 246 points, or 0.97 percent, to 25,144.3, the S&P 500 lost 29.76 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,701.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 88.26 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7,287.02. U.S. regional lender BB&T Corp will buy rival SunTrust Banks Inc for about $28 billion in stock, the biggest bank deal in about a decade. Shares of both banks rose. The downgrade in European growth expectations filtered into currency markets, with the euro down 0.05 percent to $1.1354. The dollar index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.03 percent, firming for a sixth session in a row. The dollar’s gains come despite the Federal Reserve’s dovish shift on interest rates last week. “When analyzing a currency’s exchange rate, it should be relative to a peer. So far it seems none of these peers have a competitive advantage, making the dollar the less unloved currency,” Hussein Sayed, strategist at forex broker FXTM said in a note. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.6644 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Wednesday. Oil fell after data showing a rise in U.S. inventories weighed on market participants already rattled by worries over the global economy.

2019-02-07,"PARIS, Feb 7 (Reuters) - French electricity generation saw it biggest increase in ten years, up 3.7 percent at 549 terawatt hour (TWh) compared with 2017, thanks to a surge in power output from nuclear and renewables sources, French grid operator said on Thursday. The increased output from nuclear and renewables enabled France cut is carbon emissions from power generation by 28 percent year-on-year in 2018, RTE said in its yearly report. The strong availability in nuclear and renewables, and a mild winter, also led to a sharp fall in power generation from coal, gas and oil-fired generators, down 26.8 percent in 2018 compared with the previous year. RTE said renewable wind, and solar power in France rose 15.3 percent and 11.3 percent respectively in 2018 thanks to favourable weather conditions and a rise in installed renewables capacity, which added 2,400 megawatts during the year, the equivalent of two nuclear reactors. It said power consumption was stable for the sixth year in a row at 474 TWh, in line with its forecast. It helped to keep France as the top, net electricity exporter in Europe with 86.3 TWh exported, while 26 TWh was imported during the year.

2019-02-07,"Feb 7 (Reuters) - A portion of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone oil pipeline remained shut on Thursday for investigation of a possible leak on its right-of-way near St. Louis, Missouri, a company spokesman said. TransCanada shut the pipeline down on Wednesday between Steele City, Nebraska and Patoka, Illinois and dispatched crews to assess the situation, spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email. The 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline is a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to U.S. refineries. Canadian pipelines are already congested, due to expanding production in recent years, forcing the Alberta provincial government to order production cuts starting last month. Canadian heavy oil has attracted greater demand due to U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s state oil company. The discount on Canadian heavy crude compared to U.S. light oil widened to $10.15 per barrel on Thursday morning from $9.40 earlier, according to Net Energy Exchange. TransCanada shares eased 0.2 percent to C$55.98 in Toronto. An official with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources told Reuters on Wednesday that the release of oil had stopped and it planned to find the leak on Thursday. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) could not be immediately reached.

2019-02-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Oil firm DNO is looking to buy more assets after its recent takeover of London-listed Faroe Petroleum to further expand its North Sea presence. Oslo-listed DNO, which produces most of its oil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, clinched a hostile takeover bid for London-based Faroe Petroleum, valuing Faroe at 634 million pounds, in January.  “We would like to have another Faroe Petroleum under our belt,” DNO’s executive chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani told Reuters, adding that he was speaking in terms of asset size. Potential “bolt-on acquisitions” included buying extra stakes in the licenses where DNO already operates or swapping assets near its hubs, Mossavar-Rahmani said.   DNO said Faroe puts it among the top five companies by production licenses held on the Norwegian continental shelf. Norway was a sellers’ market with oil and gas assets fully priced, Mossavar-Rahmani said. “But our advantage is that we are sitting at a table with the top players now,” he said, adding that he was “already getting calls from executives from top Norwegian players wanting to speak about assets swaps or other deals”. DNO has not yet decided what to do with Faroe’s holdings on the UK continental shelf (UKCS).  “We are still in very early stages, but we hope that there are some opportunities there as well,” Mossavar-Rahmani said.  DNO posted a higher-than-expected fourth quarter operating profit of $230 million, up from $25.7 million a year before and beating a $68.5 million forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. The earnings increase came as a result of a change in revenue recognition criteria.  The move did not impact its cash flow reporting, though, with quarterly free cash flow of $111 million also beating expectations, analysts at Sparebank 1 Markets said. Last September, DNO’s board decided to pay an annual dividend of 434 million Norwegian crowns, its first in 13-years, in two tranches of 0.2 crowns per share, one in March 2019.  Mossavar-Rahmani told a news conference he hoped that the dividend programme will be extended beyond March, but declined to speculated about a potential size as it also has to consider capital and exploration spending needs.  DNO said it would lift its total spending, including exploration, by $420 million in 2019, up 40 percent from last year as it planned a record drilling programme, including up to 20 wells in Kurdistan and 5 to 10 wells in Norway. Its working interest production stood at 91,570 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the fourth-quarter, up from 77,232 boepd from a year ago, helped by the ramp-up of output from its Peshkabir field in Kurdistan. DNO said it would publish pro-forma results and its 2019 investment programme later this month and in March. Its shares were up 1.1 percent by 1419 GMT, outperforming the wider European oil and gas index, which was down 0.8 percent.

2019-02-07,"(Repeats to more subscribers, no changes to headline or text) By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to set greenhouse gas emissions targets and tie executive compensation and rank-and-file bonuses to the reductions, the oil major said in its latest climate report released on Thursday. The move is a first for a U.S. oil major and focuses on the company’s oil fields. More investors have been pressuring San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and other big oil companies to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. Chevron said that by 2023, it will reduce its methane and flaring intensity by 25 percent to 30 percent from 2016 levels, and said the goal would be added to the scorecard that determines incentive pay for around 45,000 employees. “It’s about the mindset and the culture of the company,” said Chevron Vice President Mark Nelson, noting that including most of its global workforce would “harness” ideas from all employees. Among other oil companies, London-based BP and France’s Total have set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from to their own operations. Royal Dutch Shell in December announced it would link executive compensation to reducing carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2020, including so-called Scope 3 emissions from fuels sold to customers around the world. Chevron’s report said it does not support establishing Scope 3 targets. Exxon’s latest climate report, published on Tuesday, includes a goal of reducing methane emissions from operations by 15 percent and flaring by 25 percent by 2020 compared with 2016 levels, as well as reducing greenhouse gas intensity at its Canadian oil sands facilities by 10 percent by 2023. Chevron’s target aims to reduce emissions and flaring as a percentage of production, but does not set a goal for total emissions - a measure that activist investors prefer. The targets will apply to Chevron’s operations as well as joint ventures or assets it has a stake in but does not operate itself, the company said. Methane, the main component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless, and has more than 80 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. Methane can leak from oilfield equipment and pipelines, or is flared or vented during maintenance work, and when new oil wells are added in areas that don’t have natural gas pipelines.

2019-02-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in British oil services firm Petrofac slumped almost 30 percent on Thursday after a former senior executive pleaded guilty to 11 counts of bribery in relation to oil deals in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Britain’s Serious Fraud Office said David Lufkin, a former global head of sales for Petrofac, was convicted over what the prosecutor called corrupt attempts by Petrofac to secure deals, via agents, worth more than $730 million (566 million pounds) in Iraq and more than $3.5 billion in Saudi Arabia. The 51-year-old Briton will be sentenced at a later date. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Petrofac said a number of Petrofac individuals and entities were alleged to have acted “with the individual concerned”, although no current board member of Petrofac Ltd was alleged to have been involved and there had been no further charges. “The SFO has chosen to bring charges against a former employee of a subsidiary company,” Petrofac Chairman René Médori said in a statement.  “It has deliberately not chosen to charge any group company or any other officer or employee. In the absence of any charge or credible evidence, Petrofac intends as a matter of policy to stand by its employees.” Petrofac’s shares pared some of their losses to stand 27.64 percent down by 1430 GMT, their lowest level in around 12 months. The shares earlier posted their steepest daily fall since May 2017. The SFO said it was continuing its investigation into Petrofac’s use of agents in jurisdictions including Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The projects named in the SFO statement in relation to Petrofac payments to agents include engineering contracts for the Petro Rabigh petrochemical plant, partly owned by Saudi Aramco, and Aramco’s Jazan refinery in 2012. Another contract named by the SFO was a 2015 project awarded by state-run Aramco to Petrofac for work at its Fadhili gas plant.  Contracts mentioned by the SFO in Iraq relate to the Badra oilfield, which Russia’s Gazprom Neft is developing, and the Fao Terminal in 2012. Neither Aramco, Petro Rabigh nor Gazprom Neft are accused of any wrongdoing. Aramco declined to comment. Petro Rabigh, Iraq’s state oil marketer Somo, the Iraqi Oil Ministry and Gazprom Neft made no immediate comment. The SFO first said it had begun an investigation into Petrofac in 2017 as part of a wider probe into Monaco-based oil and gas consultancy Unaoil.  In February 2018, Petrofac said it expected its top management to be interviewed as part of the SFO probe.

2019-02-07,"* Quick start for a policy to hedge volume risks * Can cut risk capital costs as banks more comfortable * Price hedges, solar inclusion are next down the line By Vera Eckert ESSEN, Germany, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Munich Re aims to cover 1 gigawatt (GW) of wind power capacity this year with a new insurance product that allows turbine operators to hedge against revenue losses from volatile wind speeds, a project manager said on Thursday. The German insurer claims its product is unique because it uses an onsite machine to track real-time wind energy output, unlike similar products available that rely on satellite pictures or weather station forecasts, and will also cover yet-to-be built plants which do not have to build up a performance history first. “Having just launched the product, we see a lot of interest and hope to be insuring 1 GW this year worldwide (of existing and new wind power capacity),” project manager Ronny Bendlin Spuer told Reuters on the sidelines of the E-World fair in Essen, Germany. “We already hope to close a deal in the first half of 2019 with a 300 MW pilot wind park that has been operating for a couple of years and are in further advanced discussions as well,” he added. Germany has 53 GW of onshore wind capacity and 6 GW offshore but that is set to increase significantly as the country shifts to renewables and ends coal burning for power by 2038. Munich Re competes with Swiss Re and Nephila Capital/Allianz in providing wind power insurance coverage in Europe, Australia, the United States and Asia. The new product will allow operators to build insurance cover against fluctuations in output, on top of equipment maker warranties and property insurance. “It will help guarantee more even cash flows and thus improve the bankability of projects,” said Bendlin Spuer. He would not specify costs and savings for customers, saying that was very much project-dependent. Wind derivatives products on European exchanges have not taken off because there is no standardised, one-size-fits-all answer to individual producers’ dilemma. Big wind power operators can spread risks across locations at times of low wind, when single-site operators struggle. Munich Re, which reported a sharp drop in fourth quarter profit on Wednesday following a spate of natural catastrophes, expects hedging and a similar product could eventually be launched for producers of solar energy.

2019-02-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Policymakers and analysts who claim the outlook is “unusually uncertain” are normally overstating their own forecasting problem and understating the difficulties faced by their predecessors. The outlook always looks more certain in retrospect, when the outcome is known, and a causal chain can be constructed that makes it appear nearly inevitable, than it does in prospect, when multiple pathways look possible. Unusually uncertain is often a fancy way of saying “I don’t know” and concealing the limits of forecasting, which is often much less reliable than policymakers and analysts would like their audience to believe. But there are times when it is genuinely more difficult to predict what will happen in future, especially when systems approach turning points or inflection points. I am normally sceptical when policymakers and analysts say the outlook is unusually uncertain, but at the moment they may actually be justified in making that claim, with the economy delicately poised between moderation and recession, and hyper-sensitive to even small shocks that could nudge it towards either eventuality. In both the economy and the oil market, forecast accuracy deteriorates around cyclical turning points, which is why almost all forecasters missed the onset of the last recession in 2007 or the collapse in oil prices in 2008. For the same reason, most forecasters missed the slump in oil prices in the middle of 2014, the recovery in oil prices from early 2016, or the renewed fall in prices during late 2018. “The largest errors in forecasts of real and nominal GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate, are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks,” wrote business cycle expert Victor Zarnowitz. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense that they miss the turns and underestimate recessions and recoveries.” “Leading indicators rarely miss major turns in economic activity, but they now and then err in giving false signals of recession or (less often) recovery” (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting”, Zarnowitz, 1992). However, even leading indicators may struggle to discriminate between a true turning point (where the cycle changes direction) and an inflection point (where the cycle continues in same direction but with a change of rate). In the vicinity of a turning point or an inflection, the economy and the oil market can become very sensitive to even small changes in conditions and sentiment, which contributes to the increased forecasting difficulty. The global economy and the oil market both now show clear signs of a slowdown. Every leading indicator tells the same story of a sharp loss of momentum in the second half of 2018 after strong growth in 2017. But all those indicators for the economy and the oil market are in a range that could be consistent with either an imminent recession or a renewed acceleration after a period of sluggish growth. With every indicator poised between a true turning point in the cycle or simply an inflection in the growth rate, there is no way to discriminate in advance. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ULs8I8) The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is one commonly employed leading indicator for predicting recessions in the United States. Based on the current shape of the yield curve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates there is a 24 percent probability the U.S. economy will be in recession in January 2020. The forecast probability of recession has more than doubled over the last year, and risen six times over the last two years, and is now unusually elevated. But the forecast probability is still well below the 40 percent hit in the run up to the recessions of 2007-2009, 2001, 1981-82 or 1980. The probability looks more like the elevated risk in 1990 (which turned into a recession) or 1996 and 1999 (which did not). Based on the yield curve, it is impossible to say whether the U.S. economy is heading for an end-of-cycle turning point or a temporary in-cycle slowdown. The U.S. equity market is similarly hovering uncertainly between an intra-cycle slowdown and an end-of-cycle turning point. The S&P 500 equity index is now down slightly over the last 12 months after strong year-on-year gains during 2017 and most of 2018. The flattening of equity prices is certainly consistent with a slowdown in the economic and corporate earnings outlook but is not yet at levels that preceded the recessions of 1990, 2001 or 2007. U.S. manufacturing surveys show a loss of momentum at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019, a warning sign, but the composite activity indicators are still well below the levels that preceded the last three recessions. Even the much-ballyhooed U.S. job market indicators are ambiguous. Non-farm employment is rising at around 1.8 percent per year, faster than the 1.5 percent reported 12 months earlier, but fairly slow compared with earlier expansions. If the U.S. economy is performing relatively well, most of the rest of the global economy is performing relatively poorly, but not so badly that we can confidently predicted a recession rather than a slowdown. China’s official purchasing managers’ index shows manufacturing activity has been losing momentum for the last year and actually contracted in December and January, but only slightly. Globally, purchasing managers’ indicators show new export orders have been losing momentum since the start of 2018 and have now fallen for five months in a row. But the declines in orders have been relatively small, so far, and could be consistent with an in-cycle slowdown such as 2015-2016 or 2011-2012 rather than a full recession like 2007-2009 or 2001. Air freight indicators also point to flat-lining or falling volumes in 2018 after strong growth in 2016 and 2017, but do not yet show the large falls associated with the last two recessions. Like the rest of the economy, the oil market appears to be poised uncertainly between the probability of a recession-induced supply surplus or a recovery-driven deficit. OPEC’s aggressive output cuts, coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, have offset the feared slowdown in oil consumption growth and eliminated much of the incipient surplus in 2019. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has returned close to flat, after collapsing from backwardation into contango during the fourth quarter, suggesting traders currently see the oil market close to balance this year. Brent spreads cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between periods of over- and under-supply; they do not usually stay close to flat for very long. But the outlook is poised between fears about a recession-driven slowdown in consumption and concerns about supply losses from Iran and Venezuela as well as OPEC cuts and a possible slowdown in U.S. shale growth. The global economic outlook is the single biggest source of uncertainty for the oil market, and until that source of uncertainty is resolved or at least reduced, the oil outlook remains equally unclear.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2019-02-07,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The United States could help Hungary diversify away from Russian energy by encouraging ExxonMobil to proceed with long-stalled plans to develop the Domino-1 gas field in the Black Sea, Hungary’s foreign minister said. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto discussed diversification of Hungary’s natural gas imports with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on Wednesday, the ministry said on Thursday. He asked Perry to do what he could to facilitate the start of production from Domino-1 which is controlled by Exxon and Romania’s Petrom, a subsidiary of Austrian firm OMV. Discovered off Romania in 2012 with estimated gas reserves of 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet, the companies have since sought greater clarity from Romanian authorities before developing the field. Exxon said in January it was continuing to evaluate the project, pinning its final investment decision on factors including “competitive and stable fiscal terms for existing offshore concessions for the duration of the agreements.” OMV Chief Executive Rainer Seele said on Wednesday that the company was in dialogue with the Romanian government over the project, which is expected to cost a billion euros. Szijjarto said it was in Hungary’s strategic interest that the consortium make the investment required to produce the gas and that Hungary has access to this new source of energy. Hungary could import the gas via a pipeline Romania is building from the Black Sea through an interconnector between the two countries, which will be capable of handling reverse flows, Szijjarto was quoted by the ministry as saying. In November, Perry called on Hungary and its neighbors to reject Russian gas pipelines which Washington says are being used to cement Moscow’s grip on central and eastern Europe. Import-reliant Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and Russian firm Rosatom is involved in a 12.5-billion-euro expansion of Hungary’s Paks nuclear power plant, the country’s main domestic source of electricity. Last year Hungary agreed to buy 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia in 2020.

The representative of the creditor protection team at the mine, Michael Elliot, said more than 20 people were still stuck underground at the mine in Middelburg and are presumed dead. “As I’ve been informed, there are six deceased people in this point in time that have been taken to the mortuary,” Elliot told Reuters over the phone. Rescue efforts were hampered by dangerously high levels of toxic gas underground, Elliot said.   “We first have to restore power to the mine and we have to restore the ventilation to make it safe and once it’s safe... then we will go and recover these people that are missing,” he said.  The mine is owned by Tegeta Resources and Exploration, which is undergoing creditor protection after its owners, the Gupta brothers, found it difficult to continue doing business in South Africa following corruption allegations against them. Several people had entered the mine on Wednesday afternoon  to steal copper wires that supply electricity for lighting and ventilation when a gas pipe exploded, police spokesman Leonard Hlati said. “The mine is wired with copper. They were going for copper,” Hlati said. Copper is often stolen from disused mines in South Africa and sold for scrap. The Gupta brothers, their lawyers and officials from their firms and family representatives could not be reached for comment about the mine incident.  The brothers - who headed what was one of the country’s biggest conglomerates - were accused of unduly influencing former president Jacob Zuma over political appointments and winning contracts. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.

2019-02-07,"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp posted a 56 percent jump in the number of barrels of crude it processed per day during the fourth quarter and the refiner’s margins rose, helped by access to cheap oil from Canada and its purchase of rival Andeavor. At its refineries in the U.S. Midwest, Marathon has been processing large amounts of Canadian crude, which has turned cheaper relative to the benchmark West Texas Intermediate because of transport bottlenecks and a storage glut in Canada. Refiners such as Marathon process crude into diesel, gasoline and other products. Some of them faced here challenges after the United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. In November, Marathon Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the company was importing more than 500,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude. On Thursday, the Findlay, Ohio-based company said refining and marketing margin per barrel of oil jumped about 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Crude oil throughput rose to about 3 million barrels per day from 1.84 million barrels last year, helped by its acquisition of Andeavor. Marathon agreed to buy Andeavor for more than $23 billion last year, to become one of the world’s largest refiners. The deal was closed in October. “We have realized $160 million of synergies in just three months and continue to expect total annual gross run-rate synergies of up to $600 million at year-end 2019,” CEO Heminger said in a statement. Income from its retail unit, which includes Speedway gas stations and convenience stores, rose more than four times to $613 million. The company made a margin of 32.35 cents per gallon at its stores, compared with 17.72 cents last year. “Relative to our estimate, the beat was roughly split between refining and retail, two areas that benefited from the extreme drop in crude prices in the quarter,” analysts at Tudor, Pickering and Holt said. Marathon’s adjusted profit of $2.41 per share beat the energy investment firm’s estimate of $2.24 per share. Net income attributable to Marathon fell to $951 million, or $1.38 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.02 billion, or $4.13 per share, a year earlier. In the year-ago quarter, the company recorded a $1.5 billion gain related to the U.S. tax overhaul. Total revenue rose to $32.54 billion from $21.24 billion. Shares of Marathon were up almost a percent amid a drop in oil prices on Thursday.

2019-02-07,"(Company corrects to show it expects the cartel office to take its next steps (not reach a decision) in the first half of 2019, paragraph 12) * Q3 net loss of 40.5 mln euro, EBIT down 82 pct * Price pressure seen increasing * CEO warns against protectionist measures * Shares down 5.6 percent By Kirsti Knolle VIENNA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Specialty steelmaker Voestalpine expects further downward pressure on earnings from a slowing European economy, it said on Thursday after a swing to a quarterly loss knocked 5 percent off its share price. The European steel sector is navigating choppy waters as the car industry, one of its main customers, is slowing and pressure on oil prices has dampened demand from the oil equipment industry. Voestalpine issued its second profit warning in four months in January and its statement on Thursday sent its shares down as much as 5.6 percent. Finnish stainless steel maker Outokumpu and German steelmaker Salzgitter also warned of weaker profits. Voestalpine, whose share price fell by nearly half last year, reported a net loss of 40.5 million euros ($46 million) for the October-December quarter. That compared to a net profit of 167 million euros in the same period a year earlier. Besides overall weak sentiment, slower demand from the automotive industry, stand-stills at its plant in Texas, operating problems in another U.S. plant and provisions for a German cartel investigation added to its problems, the Austrian group said. Chief Executive Wolfgang Eder, who bows out in July after 15 years in charge, sees Britain’s still unclear divorce procedure from the European Union and the trade dispute between the United States and China holding back growth. He said he does not expect a major downturn in the steel sector but more pressure on prices, largely due to weakening demand in China. “We will see more pressure again from imports ... from other countries into Europe,” he said on a media call, urging politicians not to intensify protectionist measures as this would worsen the situation. The United States imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico in June. In response, the EU decided to impose limits on steel coming into the bloc. However, Eder said Voestalpine’s dividend for the current business year will not fall significantly from last year’s 1.40 euros per share. He said he expects the German cartel office to take its next steps regarding a 2017 probe into alleged agreements relating to heavy plate in the first half 2019. Eder declined to say what Voestalpine’s provision for this was. Difficulties with a new assembly line for auto components at a plant in Cartersville, in the U.S. state of Georgia, have been brought under control and all negative effects for the financial year have been booked, Eder said. Production at the group’s Texas plant had been stabilized. Voestalpine’s shares were down 5.5 percent at 25.73 euros at 1137 GMT. $1 = 0.8811 euros

2019-02-07,"BEIRUT, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Lebanon’s parliament speaker said on Thursday an Israeli move to licence energy exploration near a disputed maritime boundary threatened to drain Lebanese oil wealth before its own drilling had started. Nabih Berri on Wednesday accused Israel of breaching Lebanese waters by licensing a company to exploit the area. Asked about the accusation, Israel’s foreign ministry declined to comment. Lebanon last year licensed a consortium of Italy’s Eni , France’s Total and Russia’s Novatek to carry out the country’s first offshore energy exploration in two blocks. One of the blocks, Block 9, contains waters disputed with Israel. Berri, speaking after a meeting with visiting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, said the Israeli move threatened “to drain a whole basin and a large part of the oil wealth” before Lebanon had started to drill. “Therefore it was necessary for us to warn companies including (Italy’s) Eni and others and I will raise this matter in France with the French president too”, he said. Lebanon sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean - along with Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Syria - where a number of big gas fields have been discovered since 2009. Lebanon has said the dispute would not stop it benefiting from potential undersea reserves in Block 9, while consortium operator Total has said it would not drill the block’s first well near the disputed sliver of water. The unresolved maritime border dispute is over a sea zone of about 860 sq km (330 square miles) which extends along the edge of three of Lebanon’s energy blocks. U.S. diplomats mediated last year after a spike in tensions that also involved a row over a border wall Israel built and over Iran-backed Hezbollah’s growing arsenal.

2019-02-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s government has no plans to review regulations for fracking gas in the country, it said on Thursday, following calls from industry to revisit the rules. Chemical giant Ineos and fracking firm Cuadrilla earlier this week said current restrictions around seismic events at fracking sites could force the industry to close. Under the so-called traffic light system fracking must be paused for 18 hours following any seismic event of magnitude 0.5 or above, something which forced Cuadrilla to halt its operations several times last year. “We set these regulations in consultation with industry and we have no plans to review them,” a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said in an email. The government however, said it still believes shale gas could be an important energy source for the country and the industry could generate economic benefits and well paid jobs. Cuadrilla said this week its test drilling in northwest England showed a rich reservoir of high quality and recoverable gas. Environmentalists have campaigned against fracking, saying extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have also raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination.

2019-02-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund will push the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose more data on greenhouse gases they emit and how they adapt to climate change during the coming annual general meeting season, a top fund official said. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund invests the revenues of Norway’s oil and gas production and has stakes in some 9,000 companies across 72 countries. It was an early mover among international investors in trying to assess climate change risk, wanting to avoid investments in one sector negatively impacting another - so-called “externalities” - and hurting its overall portfolio. This year, it will make a fresh push on firms to explain how their business will be affected, and how they are adapting, to a world where temperatures may rise by 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F). “What we would like to see more of is scenarios, including a two-degree scenario, and we want better disclosure of the assumptions for these scenarios,” Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund’s chief corporate governance officer, told Reuters. “We want clear targets for CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, including methane. And we want to see reporting of progress against the targets,” she added. “We would like to see it more disaggregated, meaning not for  the whole company, but more broken down, for instance regional or even on an asset level.” As part of its green push, the fund has been developing an in-house software, called Angle, that can take non-financial data, such as CO2 emissions, combine it with trading data and earnings data, and see how it will affect a company years ahead. That tool has informed divestments in some 30 companies in 2018, fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters, helping show that these companies did not have a sustainable business model over the long-term. He did not name them. Presentation material showed two of the 30 divested companies were involved in palm oil; one in rubber; ten in coal-based power; and one in “CO2 intensity”.    The next step in the software’s development, first disclosed by Reuters in October, is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves. “It is still in the works,” Slyngstad said. Smith Ihenacho said companies were generally better at reporting climate-related data, citing for instance banks and oil and gas companies as “quite good” examples.  But others, like power producers, were lagging. “There is still far to go for many companies to report at the level we would like to see,” she said. The fund itself “emitted” 107 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018 via its ownership stakes — roughly twice the amount emitted by Norway in 2017 — according to its annual responsible investment report released on Thursday. In 2018, the fund voted against one or more resolutions put forward at 27.5 percent of AGMs it attended last year, roughly the same level as in 2017. The fund said it voted against the CEO also holding the position of board chairman at Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Total, Procter & Gamble and Pfizer, among others. It also voted against executive pay proposals at JP Morgan Chase, Verizon, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, among others.

2019-02-07,"PARIS/BERLIN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Germany is pressuring other European capitals to block an EU proposal to regulate Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline ahead of a key meeting on Friday, diplomatic sources said, but may fail to convince France, threatening the project’s construction. The European Union executive wants to extend its internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines to have a say over the new gas link under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. In its current form, the project, fully owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom, would not be compliant. National capitals have so far failed to agree on the plan, with big member states such as France, Italy and Spain unwilling to go against Berlin’s opposition to the draft rules. France, however, may have shifted its position, according to one source close to the talks, opening the way for Germany to lose its blocking minority on the EU proposal. “France’s vote would be decisive,” another EU source said, adding that Spain and Italy have not taken firm sides. “It’s very unpredictable what will happen tomorrow.” French officials refused to comment on their position ahead of Friday’s meeting in Brussels, with an Elysee source saying negotiations were still ongoing. The bloc is split, with eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries viewing the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as holding the EU hostage to Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritise the economic benefits. Opponents of the pipeline, including the United States, worry it will undermine support for Ukraine by depriving Kiev of gas transit fees along the traditional route for Russian supplies, which fill over a third of the EU’s gas needs. The German government has said gas transits through Ukraine must continue as a condition for the project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline. However, EU-mediated talks between Russia and Ukraine to agree the terms of such transits have so far failed. If the European Commission’s gas regulation proposal musters enough support from the bloc’s 28 member states, negotiations on final draft rules could begin as early as next week as the European Parliament has already backed the plan. How fast the legislation passes is critical to whether the pipeline proceeds. It foresees tougher rules for new infrastructure projects, but Nord Stream 2 construction is already underway. Any delay to building the pipeline would weaken Moscow’s hand in talks with Ukraine for a new gas transit deal after 2019 and create uncertainty for Gazprom’s partners: Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall, Anglo-Dutch Shell , Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie.

2019-02-07,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia is on track to meet its carbon emissions target under the Paris Climate accord well before 2030, thanks to increasing growth in wind and solar power, a study has found, contradicting a report last month calling for sharper emissions cuts. With several big wind and solar farms opening over the past year and rapidly growing installation of rooftop solar panels,  Australia is adopting renewable energy faster per capita than the rest of the world, said a study published by Australian National University (ANU) researchers on Friday. The pipeline of new wind and solar systems is averaging about 6.3 gigawatts (GW) a year, the study showed. Based on the new renewable energy that has started in Australia since last June and is expected over the next few years, emissions will drop sharply from the power sector, offsetting possible increases from other sectors, such as transport and farms, the ANU researchers calculated.  Each extra gigawatt of renewables displaces about 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions from coal-fired power, the study said, implying Australia’s pipeline of renewables would cut emissions by about 12 million to 13 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year. Assuming other sectors’ emissions grow by 2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year, the net reduction would be about 10 million to 11 million tonnes a year, which would put Australia on track to meet its Paris target before 2030.  “By this time next year it’ll be quite obvious to everybody that something really surprising has happened in the greenhouse accounts,” said the study’s lead researcher, Andrew Blakers, an engineering professor. The additional Australian renewables equate to 250 watts per person a year, compared with about 50 watts per person for the European Union, Japan, China and the United States, the study said. “Australia is far and away the renewable energy superstar in terms of annual per capita deployment,” Blakers said. The study, based on data from Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator, was not commissioned by anyone, he said.  To meet Australia’s Paris Climate accord commitment to cut carbon emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, emissions would have to fall to between 430 million and 442 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  As of the end of 2017, emissions had risen to 553.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, according to data from Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Extrapolating from that figure, the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development said last month Australia needed to cut emissions more sharply to meet its Paris target as the country remained heavily dependent on coal-fired power.

Wall Street looked set to suffer back-to-back losses later after Europe had set the tone. Some poor earnings and weak data out of Germany ensured most of the main bourses were lower and kept MSCI’s main index of world stocks in the red for a second day too. The extent of the current slowdown in the global economy was highlighted as India unexpectedly cut its interest rates and the euro got hit to $1.1346 by Germany’s fourth consecutive drop in industrial output. That only compounded the 1.3 percent the euro has lost over the last week and the tailwind behind the dollar, which has risen every day since Friday’s strong U.S. jobs data. It has also recovered almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes last month. “Another day, another piece of terrible German data. EUR/USD risks a move to $1.1300,” said ING’s chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist, Petr Krpata. Elsewhere the pound was struggling near $1.29 again after the Bank of England kept rates on hold, while gloomy jobs data saw New Zealand’s dollar suffer a similar flop as its Australian counterpart had seen the previous day. The kiwi slid to $0.6744, losing nearly 2 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors wagered on the risk of a cut in interest rates there. New Zealand’s central bank holds its first meeting of the year next week. Asian trading was still light overall though with China on holiday and no major economic data on the diary. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1 percent as it rose to its highest since early October. The index has risen steadily since early January as the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its tune and emerging markets have surged more broadly after a torrid 2018. Australia’s benchmark stock index jumped 1.2 percent amid expectations of easy monetary policy after the central bank chief shifted away from his previous tightening bias. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent though and the caution quickly spread to Europe. London’s FTSE was the only major bourse clinging to positive territory, helped by a weak pound, whereas the rest were down at least 0.6 percent as were E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow. One of the day’s big surprises came from India where its central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates to 6.25 percent to boost a slowing economy after a sharp slide in the inflation rate. Italian bonds were back under pressure with the European Commission slashing its 2019 growth forecast. Italy agreed a deficit target of 2.04 percent in December, averting a major fall-out with the EU, though this was based on a growth assumption of 1.0 percent. Slowing growth in Italy could make it harder for the country to remain within EU rules. However, Benjamin Schroeder, rates strategist at ING, said he did not expect the EU to demand more fiscal tightening from Italy, should its forecasts be reduced. “The EU has another thing to deal with — Brexit — and the other thing is do you want to infuse the campaign ahead of the parliamentary elections with this topic.” The next major trigger for markets will more likely be any breakthrough in the U.S.-Sino tariff talks when the two sides meet in Beijing next week. U.S. President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he and other U.S. officials will aim to clinch a deal next week to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Probably more pressing though for the U.S. markets is the threat of another government shutdown, Nick Twidale, an analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia said. “With both sides of the house standing firm on the contentious border wall issue at present and the deadline approaching swiftly on Feb 15 we could be back where we were just a few weeks ago.” The broad dollar gains put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,303.96 per ounce, slipping further from last week’s top of $1,326.30. Oil prices eased too after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country held at record levels. Brent crude futures slipped 23 cents to $62.46. U.S. crude eased 19 cents to $53.82 a barrel. Additional Reporting by Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey in Sydney

2019-02-07,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Canada’s struggling oil industry is looking to what is known as partial upgrading technology to thin its sludge-like crude and squeeze more of it through congested pipelines. It is the latest effort by the Alberta provincial government to rescue an industry hurt last year by steep discounts for its oil, as production far exceeded pipeline capacity. The government has already forced output cuts, given subsidies to petrochemical plants and said it would invest in trains to move crude. Alberta in January announced a C$440 million loan guarantee for a C$2-billion partial upgrading facility planned by private company Value Creation. The Edmonton-area plant would turn 77,500 barrels per day (bpd) of diluted bitumen into medium crude oil and low-sulfur diesel, starting in 2022. Producing a medium grade would give the world’s fourth-largest producer more of a different type of crude to sell that does not compete with abundant U.S. light shale oil. Most of the oil produced in Canada is thick, heavy crude that comes from northern Alberta’s oil sands. Some is then put through a full upgrading process at great cost, turning that crude into synthetic light oil. Other heavy crude must be diluted with light oil - an extra expense - to travel through pipelines. “Our crude oil would have a tailor fit to refineries, so we would have no problem to find the market,” Value Creation Chief Executive Columba Yeung said in an interview. Partial upgrading is not yet done on a commercial scale anywhere. It removes sulfur and other impurities to create lighter grades of oil that do not require dilution to move through pipelines, lowering costs and making shipping more efficient. In 2018, the United States imported 2.4 million barrels of medium, sour crude per day, only 15 percent of which came from Canada, according to IHS Markit. “There’s a case to be made for product diversification,” said IHS Vice President Kevin Birn. The timing for partial upgrading comes with risks, however. Alberta’s New Democratic Party government is facing a tough spring election, and by the time the first upgrader is finished in 2022, additional pipeline capacity may be open, reducing the urgency to remove diluent from shipments to free up space. The opposition United Conservative Party would review the viability of any subsidized energy projects if it forms a government, said Prasad Panda, the party’s energy critic. Several pipelines in the works would raise Canada’s export capacity to 5.5 million bpd, creating a surplus of space until 2030, according to the Canadian Energy Research Institute. Yeung counters that additional pipelines would only enhance opportunities for partially upgraded oil to reach markets. Developers of a dozen partial upgrading technologies, including MEG Energy Corp, are undeterred, however, and hope Value Creation’s plant is only the first. Among the other companies grappling with ways to help alleviate Alberta’s problem is Calgary-based Fractal Systems, which intends to profit mainly by removing and reselling diluent from heavy crude. Field Upgrading has a tiny 10 bpd pilot plant that it hopes to scale up to 10,000 bpd by 2022 to produce low-sulfur heavy oil suitable for marine shipping. The technology produces fuel compliant with tougher shipping emission requirements that take effect next year, said co-founder Neil Camarta. “It’s really important that we get some of these technologies out of the lab and into development, because there’s potential there,” Camarta said.

2019-02-07,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Chris Prentice and A. Ananthalakshmi NEW YORK/KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 7 (Reuters) - In June, the High Seas tanker ship loaded up on ethanol in Texas and set off for Asia. Two months later - after a circuitous journey that included a ship-to-ship transfer and a stop in Malaysia - its cargo arrived in China, according to shipping data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with Malaysian and Chinese port officials. At the time, the roundabout route puzzled global ethanol traders and ship brokers, who called it a convoluted and costly way to get U.S. fuel to China. (MAP: tmsnrt.rs/2HP1ywa ) But the journey reflects a broader shift in global ethanol flows since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring. Although China slapped retaliatory tariffs up to 70 percent on U.S. ethanol shipments, the fuel can still legally enter China tariff-free if it arrives blended with at least 40 percent Asian-produced fuel, according to trade rules established between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the regional economic and political body. In a striking example of how global commodity markets respond to government policies blocking free trade, some 88,000 tonnes of U.S. ethanol landed on Malaysian shores through November of last year - all since June, shortly after China hiked its tax on U.S. shipments. The surge follows years of negligible imports of U.S. ethanol to Malaysia. In turn, Malaysia has exported 69,000 tonnes of ethanol to China, the first time the nation has been an exporter of the fuel in at least three years, according to Chinese import data. Blending U.S. and Asian ethanol for the Chinese market undermines the intent of Beijing’s tariffs and helps struggling American ethanol producers by keeping a path open to a major export market that would otherwise be closed. “Global commodity markets are incredibly creative in finding ways to ensure willing sellers are able to meet the demands of willing buyers,” Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement to Reuters. The group represents U.S. ethanol producers. In at least two cases examined by Reuters, including that of the High Seas, blending of U.S. ethanol cargoes with other products appeared to have occurred in Malaysia before the cargoes were shipped on to China, according to a Reuters analysis of shipping records and interviews with port officials. Chinese merchants including the state-backed oil company Unipec notified Chinese authorities about the unusual activity last summer - which represented competition they had not anticipated under the tariff scheme, according to two industry sources. Unipec’s parent company Sinopec did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for China’s General Administration of Customs declined to comment. Norazman Ayob, deputy secretary general of the Malaysian trade ministry, confirmed that Malaysia exported ethanol to China this year. The ministry was unable to confirm whether it had been mixed with U.S. fuel, he said, but noted such blending would be legal under the ASEAN-China pact. Malaysia has no track record of significant domestic ethanol production, so it is unclear where the ethanol blended with the U.S. product originates. Additional U.S. ethanol has flowed in unusual volumes to other destinations since Trump’s trade war began, including other ASEAN member nations the Philippines and Indonesia, according to shipping and trade data, though Reuters could not confirm its final destination. The High Seas cargo ship was among the first to engage in the rising U.S.-to-Malaysia ethanol trade, according to shipping data from financial information provider Refinitiv and bills of lading from the ports. It loaded 25,000 tonnes of ethanol in Texas City on June 23 and then another 10,000 tonnes in Beaumont on June 27. Some of the ethanol was produced by Green Plains Inc , one of America’s top ethanol producers. Green Plains spokesman Jim Stark confirmed the loading of the company’s product in Beaumont but said it could not confirm the cargo’s ultimate destination. At the time it left Texas, the shipment was owned by units of SOCAR Trading SA, the marketing arm of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, according to the bills of lading. The shipment was initially destined for the Philippines. But after it crossed through the Panama Canal and reached the waters near Singapore in mid-August, the High Seas transferred its cargo to the QUDS, another tanker, according to the Refinitiv data. Vincent Mohy, general counsel for SOCAR, said that the firm sold all of the U.S. ethanol at the time of the transfer to the QUDS and that it made clear to the buyer the fuel originated in the United States. Mohy declined to name the buyer. The QUDS landed in the Malaysian port of Kuantan days later and took on another 12,074 tonnes of ethanol before heading to the Chinese port of Zhoushan and emptying its hold by the end of the month, according to the shipping data, a Chinese port official and two Malaysian port officials. According to one of the Kuantan port officials and a source in the Malaysian government, the cargo on the QUDS was sold by Malaysia’s Rich Greenergy Sdn Bhd to China’s Zhanjiang Industry Petrochemical Company Limited. Kelvin Shum, Rich Greenergy’s CEO, declined to comment, saying he had signed a non-disclosure agreement about the deal. Efforts to reach Zhanjiang were not successful. The convoluted voyage was replicated in at least one other case, that of the Maritime Tuntiga. That ship also carried Texas ethanol into Southeast Asia this summer, transferring its cargo into another vessel – the Taibah – near Singapore. Like the QUDS, the Taibah moved on to the port of Kuantan in Malaysia, picked up about 12,000 tonnes more ethanol, and then moved on to Zhoushan, according to the shipping data and the Kuantan port officials.

2019-02-07,"MUMBAI/KOLKATA (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries will invest 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in the eastern state of West Bengal, a part of which would fund the company’s new e-commerce venture, its chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday. The energy and telecoms conglomerate, which already runs retail stores, has announced plans to diversify into e-commerce at a time when India’s new foreign investment curbs have dealt a blow to Amazon.com Inc and Walmart’s Flipkart. The investment announcements also come as a boost for the state’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who has in recent weeks rallied regional parties and the main opposition Congress to forge an alliance to beat Prime Minister Narendra Modi in upcoming elections, which must be held by May.   Ambani’s so-called “new commerce” venture aims to connect small merchants with his retail network and warehouses, helping them better manage their inventory. It already has more than 500 retail stores in the state, selling everything from clothes to groceries, and the new plan would “increase manifold” its warehouse space in the next 24 months in West Bengal, he said. The new e-commerce platform “will bring win-win benefits to consumers, retailers and producers” and help 30 million small shopkeepers, Ambani said.  The billionaire businessman has been more vocal about his e-commerce plans after India in December imposed new restrictions on how foreign companies operate in the e-commerce sector. The new rules, which kicked in on Feb. 1, have disrupted product listings on Amazon.com’s India website. Addressing a business summit in West Bengal’s Kolkata city, Ambani also said he plans to expand the reach of his telecom services in the state and swiftly open a data centre which would be “as good as the ones in Silicon Valley”. “There is no area of the economy, governance or life which is untouched by the revolutionary potential of digital technologies,” Ambani said.

2019-02-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total’s South African offshore discovery could contain 1 billion barrels of total resources and is “probably quite big”, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Thursday. Total said it had made a significant gas condensate discovery after drilling its Brulpadda prospects on Block 11B/12B in the Outeniqua Basin. “It is gas condensate and light oil. Mainly gas. There are four other prospects on the licence that we have to drill; it could be around 1 billion barrels of total resources of gas and condensate,” Pouyanne said.  The Brulpadda well encountered 57 metres of net gas condensate in Lower Cretaceous reservoirs. The well was extended to a final depth of 3,633 metres and has also been successful. “With this discovery Total has opened a new world-class gas and oil play and is well positioned to test several follow-on prospects on the same block,” Total’s senior vice president for exploration, Kevin McLachlan, said in a statement. Africa’s most industrialised economy, which imports most of its refined petroleum products and crude oil, welcomed the announcement. “It is potentially a major boost for the economy,” mineral resources minister Gwede Manthashe said in a statement. South Africa wants to build its gas network and has previously mentioned the possibility of importing LNG from Mozambique, where a gas pipeline already supplies most of the gas South Africa uses to power its industrial heartland in the north.  The proximity of the find to Mossel Bay’s gas-to-liquid plant is also a boon, said national oil and gas company PetroSA. “We potentially could be supplied by Total with gas and condensate, which means the GTL refinery can be ramped up ... it is currently running below 50 percent of its design capacity,” said PetroSA acting CEO Bongani Sayidini. Brulpadda is one of several high-profile exploration prospects for Total. Which has said the field could hold between 500 million to more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.      After the confirmation of Brulpadda’s potential, Total and its partners plan to acquire 3D seismic data this year, followed by up to four exploration wells on the licence, the company said. Total has a 45 percent working interest and is the operator of Block 11B/12B, which covers an area of 19,000 square km. Other partners include Qatar Petroleum, CNR International and Main Street, a South African consortium, holding 25 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent stakes respectively.

2019-02-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - French energy major Total is eyeing further strong growth in oil and gas production in 2019 after record output in 2018 enabled it to post a 28 percent jump in full-year earnings. Total said production is expected to rise by 9 percent to reach over 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019. The company said on Thursday output reached an all-time high of 2.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 thanks to the start-up of various operations and increased production in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and deep sea projects in Australia, Angola, Nigeria, Russia and Brazil. Total also announced a major, new discovery off the coast of South Africa that could contain around 1 billion barrels of total resources of gas condensate and light oil. The company reported a rise in full-year profit to $13.6 billion, following on from strong results from other oil majors, while its cash flow was at around $26 billion, up 18 percent compared with the previous year. “These excellent results reflect the strong growth of more than 8 percent of the group’s hydrocarbons production,” Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said, adding its output growth was strongest among its peers.  “Between production growth and spending discipline, we have a clear visibility of the growth of our cash flow in 2019. At $60 per barrel, we will be better than at $71 per barrel in 2018,” he said. Total said it was targeting cost reductions of $4.7 billion in 2019 after beating its 2018 target, and expected net investments to be in the range of $15-16 billion. Brokerage Jefferies kept a “buy” rating on Total, saying the company’s results had beaten most market forecasts, although the shares slipped on the back of a drop in oil prices.  On Tuesday, BP reported a doubling of profit, driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following a large U.S. shale acquisition. Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron also reported stronger-than-forecast earnings, driven by higher production in U.S. shale basins where oil majors have invested billions in recent years. Total said the results would enable it to continue its shareholder returns policy announced last year. After increasing dividends by 3.2 percent in 2018, it planned a 3.1 percent rise in 2019. It will also buy back $1.5 billion of its shares in 2019 after buying back the same amount last year, but this could increase if oil prices rose, Pouyanne said. Total added it would eliminate its scrip dividend scheme from June 2019. At 1140 GMT, Total shares were down 0.68 percent, alongside a similar-sized fall in the broader Paris market.

2019-02-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy bills are set to rise for millions of households in Britain after the country’s energy regulator gave the green light to suppliers to increase bills by more than 10 percent from April 1.  Ofgem was tasked by parliament last year to set a limit after lawmakers said customers were being overcharged for electricity and gas. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the tariffs a “rip-off”. Ofgem, which reviews the price cap every six months, said it needed to allow suppliers to charge more as wholesale energy contracts, used to help formulate the cap level, were 17 percent higher than during the last cap period. “No consumer wants to see a price rise but these (increases) are justified,” Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said on a call with journalists. The cap for average annual consumption on the most commonly used tariffs used by around 11 million households will rise by 10.3 percent - or 117 pounds - to 1,254 pounds.  Britain’s headline inflation rate increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in December, while average weekly earnings were up 3.4 percent year-on-year in the three months to the end of November. Ofgem calculates the cap using a formula that includes wholesale gas prices, energy suppliers network costs and costs of government policies, such as renewable power subsidies.  (Graphic: What costs make up a British duel fuel energy bill?  link: tmsnrt.rs/2TDnSKs). Several of Britain’s biggest suppliers, a group known as the “Big Six,” complained the cap was initially set too low. Innogy’s npower said the cap was partly why it announced plans to shed 900 jobs last week. Most are expected to increase prices once it is raised. Britain’s energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said people are still expected to be around 75-100 pounds a year better off than they would be without the cap. “With over 60 companies and more than 200 tariffs to choose from, consumers can always shop around for a cheaper deal and make big savings by switching,” Perry said. Several smaller, independent energy suppliers such as Bulb and Octopus Energy have said they will not increase prices following the cap rise as their innovative technology allows them to keep prices lower. “Today’s announcement just reinforces the massive gap between these dinosaur companies and modern retailers,” said Octopus Energy CEO Greg Jackson. Britain’s big six energy suppliers are Centrica’s British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, Innogy’s npower, E.ON and EDF Energy.

2019-02-07,"WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Rising Democratic star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Senator Ed Markey on Thursday laid out the goals of a Green New Deal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years, setting a high bar for Democrats who plan to make climate change a central issue in the 2020 presidential race. The resolution is the first formal attempt by lawmakers to define the scale of legislation to create large-scale government-led investments in clean energy and infrastructure to transform the U.S. economy. “The Green New Deal fully tackles the existential threat posed by climate change by presenting a comprehensive, 10-year plan that is as big as the problem it hopes to solve while creating a new era of shared prosperity,” according to a summary of the resolution released by the lawmakers on Thursday. Ocasio-Cortez said she will immediately begin to work on legislation that would “fully flesh out the projects involved in the Green New Deal.” Republicans have already criticized the initiative, waving off any kind of proposal as heavy-handed. The Trump administration does not believe action on climate change is necessary and is focused on increasing production of oil, gas and coal on federal and private land. Doug Lamborn, a Republican from Colorado, said at a climate change hearing in the House natural resources committee on Wednesday that the policy was akin to a “Soviet five-year plan.” The non-binding resolution outlines several goals for the United States to meet in 10 years, including meeting 100 percent of power demand from zero-emissions energy sources. It also calls for new projects to modernize U.S. transportation infrastructure, de-carbonize the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, make buildings and homes more energy efficient and increase land preservation. The Green New Deal also aims to create an economic safety net for “frontline” communities that will be affected by a radical shift away from fossil fuel use. “We ... need to be sure that workers currently employed in fossil fuel industries have higher-wage and better jobs available to them to be able to make this transition, and a federal jobs guarantee ensures that no worker is left behind,” according to a summary of the plan. The Green New Deal was put into the media spotlight by a youth coalition called the Sunrise Movement and Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest woman to serve in Congress. Markey, a veteran lawmaker from Massachusetts, introduced sweeping climate change legislation a decade ago, which passed in the House but stopped short in the Senate. At least a half dozen Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls have said they would adopt Green New Deal policies, without offering specifics.

2019-02-07,"* Net sales in 2018 up 16 percent * EBIT, underlying operating profit fall * Vattenfall says it will keep growing in district heating (Adds context, quotes, Brexit) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Swedish utility Vattenfall will look to invest in more wind power projects in 2019, Chief Executive Magnus Hall told Reuters on Thursday after the company reported lower operating profits for last year. Thanks to hedging contracts, the company’s profit will be little affected if average power prices fall this year from the high levels seen in 2018, he added. Hedging, however, together with higher spending on investment and a lower result in district heating as fuel costs rose, was behind Vattenfall’s weaker EBIT and underlying operating profit, despite increased net sales. Average power prices rose last year in Europe due to a cold winter that increased demand for electricity and heat, combined with an unusually dry and warm summer that affected nuclear power plants and hydropower dam levels. “We are trying to take out volatility, that is why we are hedging,” Hall said. “We will be looking to other wind projects. We need to create a pipeline so we have projects that we can go for.” Vattenfall said its 2018 net sales rose 16 percent to 156.8 billion crowns ($17 billion), but its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) and underlying operating profit fell 5 percent and 14 percent respectively. The company’s wind power business, which Vattenfall aims to expand, grew in 2018 as that segment’s underlying operating profit jumped to 3.7 billion crowns from 2.1 billion a year before. In contrast, Vattenfall’s heat business took a hit, with profit sinking to 0.8 billion crowns from 3.4 billion in 2017. “We are quite disappointed on the heat side but... we will continue to grow in the district heating business.

2019-02-07,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output unexpectedly fell in December for the fourth consecutive month, sending another signal that growth in Europe’s biggest economy is weakening. Data from the Federal Statistics Office on Thursday showed industrial output was down by 0.4 percent, confounding a Reuters forecast for an increase of 0.7 percent. Analysts said the fall makes it more likely that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter, which would translate into a recession after growth domestic product fell in the third quarter. After nearly a decade of steady growth, the German economy has been facing headwinds from trade frictions between the United States and both China and the European Union. Britain’s possible departure from the EU next month without a deal is also clouding the outlook for German manufacturers. December’s drop in industrial output was led by the construction sector, where activity shrank by more than 4 percent, which could not be offset by a small rise in manufacturing output, a breakdown of the data showed. The economy ministry said the auto sector, which has been a drag on the economy because new emissions standards translated into fewer new vehicle registrations, rebounded in December as output rose by more than 7 percent.  The figure for November was revised up to a fall of 1.3 percent from a previously reported drop of 1.9 percent. “A positive GDP reading in the fourth quarter of 2018 now looks tight,” said Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank Group. “A positive (industry) reading would have reduced the chance of a negative GDP reading in the fourth quarter.” Growing signs of a slowdown have prompted the government to revise down its growth forecast for this year to 1 percent. Industry groups and economists have said complacency on the economy from Chancellor Angela Merkel is also contributing to the slowdown. They have urged her to grant families and businesses more generous tax cuts, and enact tax reforms that give women and the long-term unemployed more incentives to join the workforce. Merkel is also facing calls to make Germany more attractive to foreign workers to plug critical labour shortages. Weaker growth or stagnation in Germany could have implications for the whole euro zone, whose largest economy acts as a bellwether of the economic health of the single currency bloc. Private consumption has been providing impetus for the German economy as exports weaken, but economists suspect the slowdown in manufacturing has been spreading to services firms who depend mostly on the domestic market for growth. Those suspicions were confirmed by the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, which on Thursday revised down its growth forecast for this year to 0.9 percent from 1.7 percent. The disappointing output data came after separate figures released on Wednesday showed that industrial orders had unexpectedly fallen for the second month in a row in December.

2019-02-07,"ISLAMABAD, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Pakistan has signed a provisional agreement with Russian energy giant Gazprom on a feasibility study for an offshore pipeline that would supply natural gas from the Middle East to Pakistan and other parts of South Asia. The memorandum of understanding is the latest in a series of energy-related agreements between Pakistan and Russia, former Cold War foes who have grown closer in recent years. An offshore pipeline from Iran has long been discussed by Pakistani officials, but its viability has been questioned due to the delicate geopolitical situation in South Asia and the rivalry between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan. U.S. sanctions against Iran are also a major hindrance for most gas pipeline projects in the region, with the offshore spur from Iran to Pakistan and India set to cost an estimated $10 billion, according to Pakistani media. “(The agreement) provides for a joint feasibility study regarding gas supplies from the Middle East to South Asian countries,” Gazprom said in a statement on Wednesday, without specifically mentioning Iran or India. Pakistan’s Petroleum Ministry said it would take three to four years to complete the pipeline, which would include “other ancillary projects such as Under Ground Gas storage, desalination and other power projects.” Pakistan will import some 500 million to 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day from Middle East sources, the ministry said, according to the agreement Gazprom signed with Pakistan’s state-run energy infrastructure arm Inter State Gas Systems (ISGS). Islamabad previously signed an intergovernmental agreement with Russia to discuss the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Pakistan, one of the world’s fastest growing LNG markets. But a $2 billion North-South pipeline to deliver gas from Pakistan’s coastal regions to industrial areas in the north has been held up since 2015 due to a disagreement over fees and U.S. sanctions against Russian state conglomerate Rostec.

2019-02-07,"(Updates with early European trading) * World shares down for second day, dollar powers up for fifth day * European bourse, euro hit by more weak German data * European Commission slashes Italy growth forecast * Asia ex-Japan shares tick up, Australia leads gains * Dollar holds gains as kiwi slides on jobs data By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - World shares ground to a halt on Thursday as the dollar scored its longest winning streak since a hot run in early October that helped set off a wave of global ‘bear’ markets. Some poor earnings and weak data out of Germany ensured Europe’s main bourses started lower and kept MSCI’s main index of world stocks heading for only its second two-day run of falls of the year so far. The extent of the current slowdown in the global economy was highlighted as India unexpectedly cut its interest rates and the euro got hit to $1.1346 by Germany’s fourth consecutive drop industrial output. That only compounded the 1.3 percent the euro has lost over the last week and the tailwind behind the dollar, which has risen every day since Friday’s strong U.S. jobs data. It has also recovered almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes last month. “Another day, another piece of terrible German data. EUR/USD risks a move to $1.1300,” said ING’s chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist, Petr Krpata. Elsewhere the pound was struggling near $1.29 again ahead of a Bank of England meeting, while gloomy jobs data saw New Zealand’s dollar suffer a similar flop as its Australian counterpart had seen the previous day. The kiwi slid to $0.6744, losing nearly 2 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors wagered on the risk of a cut in interest rates there. The country’s central bank holds its first meeting of the year next week. Asian trading was still light overall though with China on holiday and no major economic data on the diary. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1 percent as it rose to its highest since early October. The index has risen steadily since early January as the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its tune and emerging markets have surged more broadly after a torrid 2018. Australia’s benchmark stock index jumped 1.2 percent amid expectations of easy monetary policy after the country’s central bank chief shifted away from his previous tightening bias. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent though and the caution quickly spread to Europe. London’s FTSE was the only major bourse clinging to positive territory whereas the rest were down at least 0.2 percent as were E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow . One of the day’s big surprises came from India where its central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates to 6.25 percent to boost a slowing economy after a sharp slide in the inflation rate. Italy’s bonds were back under pressure with the European Commission slashing its 2019 growth forecast. Italy agreed a deficit target of 2.04 percent in December, averting a major fall-out with the EU, though this was based on a growth assumption of 1.0 percent. Slowing growth in Italy could make it harder for the country to remain within EU rules. However, Benjamin Schroeder, rates strategist at ING, said he did not expect the EU to demand more fiscal tightening from Italy, should its forecasts be reduced. “The EU has another thing to deal with — Brexit — and the other thing is do you want to infuse the campaign ahead of the parliamentary elections with this topic.” The next major trigger for markets will more likely be any breakthrough in the U.S.-Sino tariff talks when the two sides meet in Beijing next week. U.S. President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he and other U.S. officials will aim to clinch a deal next week to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Probably more pressing though for the U.S. markets is the threat of another government shutdown, Nick Twidale, an analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia said. “With both sides of the house standing firm on the contentious border wall issue at present and the deadline approaching swiftly on Feb 15 we could be back where we were just a few weeks ago.” The broad dollar gains put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,303.96 per ounce, slipping further from last week’s top of $1,326.30. Oil prices eased too after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country held at record levels. Brent crude futures slipped 23 cents to $62.46. U.S. crude eased 19 cents to $53.82 a barrel. Additional Reporting by Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey in Sydney

2019-02-07,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian coal haulier Pacific National said on Thursday that one of its trains derailed near the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and that some services would be affected while repair work was carried out. The Hunter Valley is Australia’s top thermal coal-producing region and home to operations run by Yancoal, Glencore and Peabody Energy. There were no injuries, Pacific National said in an emailed statement, adding that the train had derailed in the early morning on Wednesday near the area of Baerami with the last six wagons coming off the tracks. “The regulator is currently onsite assessing the situation with the removal of the wagons and repairs to the track expected to commence after assessments have been completed,” the company said. Pacific National said rail services west of Mount Pleasant would be impacted while the work is being done.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was investigating the incident that caused damage to around 2 km (1.3 miles) of the train track.  The train had been travelling through a section of the network that was under a temporary speed restriction of 20 km per hour (13 miles per hour), which had been imposed to “mitigate risk due to a measured series of defects in the track,” the investigator said in a statement on its website. A Yancoal spokesman said that its Moolarben Coal complex  had been directly impacted by the train derailment but that it was too early to advise of any potential impact to customers, as it awaited confirmation of when haulage would restart. A Glencore spokesman referred Reuters to Pacific National. Representatives from Peabody were not immediately available to comment.    The incident is Australia’s third freight train derailment in as many months. BHP Group forced a train off its tracks in November after it ran away without its driver en route to the northwestern iron ore export hub of Port Hedland. In December, around 30 wagons in an empty iron ore train derailed around 700 km (438 miles) east of Perth after poor weather eroded part of the track.

2019-02-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Europe’s offshore wind capacity grew by 18 percent in 2018 as new wind farms came online and it is expected to rise further this year, industry group WindEurope said. Europe installed 2.6 gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind energy in 2018, raising total capacity to 18.5 GW, WindEurope’s annual report on the industry shows. Britain and Germany accounted for 85 percent of the new capacity, adding 1.3 GW and 969 megawatts respectively. Another six offshore wind farms are currently under construction in Europe, the report said. In addition, another 12 new offshore wind projects reached a final investment decision stage last year, representing a further 4.2 GW of capacity and 10.3 billion euros of investment. “Offshore wind now represents 2 percent of all the electricity consumed in Europe. And with a big pipeline of projects under construction and development, this number will rise significantly,” WindEurope chief executive Giles Dickson said in a statement. “The technology keeps developing. The turbines keep getting bigger. And the costs keep falling. It’s now no more expensive to build offshore wind than it is to build coal or gas plants.

2019-02-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - TGS, a provider of seismic data for the oil industry, proposed a higher-than-expected dividend on Thursday as its quarterly earnings rose, though less than forecast, and saw demand for its services picking up this year.  The company said there were signs of strengthening demand in 2019 despite uncertainty related to factors such as U.S. onshore production, oil prices and exploration and production budgets. While oil companies have increased their exploration investments after years of cost cuts, recent crude price volatility has impacted their spending on seismic data. Seismic surveyors like TGS are a bellwether of oil companies’ appetite for conducting exploration for oil and gas deposits. “With the market fundamentals continuing to improve, they (oil companies) are likely to come under increasing pressure to replenish reserves and secure growing production in the longer-term,” TGS said in a statement. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose to $68 million in the last quarter of 2018, from $51.6 million a year ago, but lagged market expectations of $77.8 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.    The company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.20 per share to $0.27 per share, higher than the $0.24 per share expected in the Reuters poll.  The company said it expected its investments in new multi-client surveys, data of which it can sell to a number of buyers, to rise 20 percent to $300 million in 2019. Commitments from buyers ahead of multi-client surveys, or pre-funding revenues, were expected to cover about 40-45 percent of the investments this year, it added.  Last year, TGS spending on new multi-client surveys totaled $250 million with pre-funding levels at 42 percent, compared with the previous guidance of $260 million and around 40 percent respectively. Its sales after seismic data is gathered, or so-called late sales, rose nearly 6 percent to $152 million in the fourth-quarter from a year ago. Unlike some of its competitors, such as PGS, TGS does not own seismic vessels and rents them. Last November, TGS announced a strategic partnership with Norway’s Axxis Geo Solutions (AGS) for multi-client ocean bottom node projects in the North Sea.  The technology allows surveyors to get a sharper image of sub-surface petroleum reservoirs, improving chances of making discoveries or increasing recovery from the producing fields.

2019-02-07,"(Updates to add details, context, quotes) MOSCOW, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Russian steelmaker MMK’s fourth quarter core earnings fell 9.3 percent year-on-year although it said earnings for 2018 as a whole were up 19 percent to a record $2.4 billion. “The decrease in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 was due to the fall in the average sale price of finished products against a backdrop of a seasonal decrease in sales of steel products,” MMK said in a statement. Shares in MMK were down 0.08 percent at 0804 GMT after it said fourth quarter earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to $537 million, from $592 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The steelmaker also blamed a growing cost of sales quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to higher prices of key raw materials. Although higher iron ore prices will affect results in the first quarter of 2019, this should be offset by a seasonal recovery in steel prices, it added. In general, 2019 should bring sufficient demand to maintain high capacity utilisation at MMK facilities, supported by high global steel consumption and restrictions on production in China, the company said. MMK said its net profit fell 35 percent year-on-year to $245 million, while fourth quarter free cash flow was $239 million. “Free cash flow beat our expectations by 54 percent... As a result, we anticipate MMK’s dividend yield should beat our expectations and have 3 percent dividend yield,” BCS Global Markets analyst Oleg Petropavlovsky said in a note. In November the firm, controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Rashnikov, recommended a third-quarter dividend payment of 2.114 roubles per share. It has not yet announced its fourth quarter dividend. MMK said its capital expenditure in 2018 as a whole was $860 million, meaning major investment projects were being implemented at a faster pace than initially envisaged.

2019-02-07,"ADDIS ABABA, Feb 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In a damp office at Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa University, doctoral student Hailu Geremew fantasises about working on the nuclear reactor his country is now pondering building. “Oh that is my dream, my dream, my dream,” said the nuclear physicist, 32, wearing rectangular glasses and a cardigan. Geremew is part of a new generation of African scientists whose prospects are expanding as their governments team up with foreign powers on a potential fast-track to electrification. For now, South Africa is the only country on the continent operating a nuclear power plant. But in recent years, at least seven other sub-Saharan African states have signed agreements to deploy nuclear power with backing from Russia, according to public announcements and the World Nuclear Association (WNA), an industry body. Geremew first heard about the ambitious nuclear deal Ethiopia had struck with Moscow on the television news two years ago. The next day, his university department was buzzing with talk about it. Ethiopia’s memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation with Russia paves the way for the construction of a nuclear power plant and a research reactor in the long term, said Frehiwot Woldehanna, Ethiopia’s state minister for the energy sector. The East African country has been electrifying rapidly to meet rising energy demand and its own goal to become the biggest power exporter on the continent, while sticking to pledges to remain a low emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gases. Under a 2015-2020 development plan, Addis Ababa wants to raise power generation to more than 17,000 megawatts (MW) from current capacity of just over 4,200 MW, mainly by harnessing hydro, wind and geothermal sources. Its most ambitious project under construction is the Grand Renaissance Dam on the Nile river that will churn out 6,000 MW at full capacity when completed within the next four years, according to Ethiopian Electric Power, the state-owned utility. But Woldehanna worries about betting on an abundance of water for the country’s main source of electricity, as droughts become more frequent. With rivers sometimes drying up, “you cannot fully rely on hydropower”, he said, adding that nuclear technologies have “environmental” advantages over others. Plans for a nuclear power plant in Ethiopia remain at the “pre-feasibility stage”, but the country is serious about building one, he emphasised. With sub-Saharan Africa’s 48 countries generating the same amount of power as Spain, despite a population 18 times larger, the option to bring electricity access to their people on a bigger scale using nuclear energy is gaining momentum. Nearly six out of 10 sub-Saharan Africans still lack access to electricity, according to World Bank data. Like Ethiopia, emerging nuclear states Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Rwanda, Zambia and Ghana have signed agreements with Russia’s state nuclear corporation, ROSATOM - most since 2016. Their content ranges from language on the construction of nuclear reactors to assistance with feasibility studies and personnel training, press statements show. ROSATOM’s solutions for managing spent fuel and radioactive waste vary from country to country, but are normally worked out at the later stages of a nuclear new-build programme “in the strictest compliance with international law”, a spokeswoman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Chinese state-owned nuclear firms have also taken the lead in the region, sealing deals with Kenya, Sudan and Uganda, WNA data shows. South African student Masamaki Masanja, 23, won a ROSATOM competition for young people to make videos about Africa’s nuclear potential, and got to visit the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant in western Russia in 2017. “It was mind-blowing,” said the second-year mechanical engineering student, via Skype. The experience left him with a strong sense that nuclear power should be adapted quickly for Africa’s needs. Sub-Saharan African nations have shown an interest in nuclear because coal is scarce, while large volumes of natural gas in Nigeria and Tanzania tend to be exported for profit, said Jessica Lovering, co-author of a 2018 report, “Atoms for Africa”, from the U.S.-based Center for Global Development. Booming populations and international pressure to curb greenhouse gas emissions also play a role, she added. Ethiopia, for instance, has pledged under the Paris Agreement on climate change to curb its already meagre emissions by two-thirds from business-as-usual projections by 2030. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015 by about 195 nations, seeks to wean the global economy off fossil fuels in the second half of this century, limiting the rise in average temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Ramping up nuclear power may be a carbon-neutral option, but presents dilemmas such as the high cost of building a plant and setting up supporting infrastructure, including safe management of nuclear fuel, said Lovering. Yet gaining access to large amounts of cheap electricity from nuclear plants that run 24/7 could boost domestic manufacturing, as well as lighting up homes, she said. Some political observers, however, are concerned about the prospect of nuclear reactors backed by Russia in some countries with rebel groups and weak government institutions. An Africa-based Western diplomat, who asked to remain anonymous, doubted Russia’s assurances it would collect nuclear waste from projects it helped establish. “You could end up with very unfortunate situations in parts of Africa ... if you have a decaying nuclear power plant overrun by rebels, with waste that’s not going away,” he said. Multiple requests for an interview with Russia’s ambassador in Ethiopia were declined. So-called dirty bombs can combine conventional explosives like dynamite with radioactive material such as nuclear waste. Noel Stott, a South Africa-based researcher with VERTIC, a non-profit that tracks the implementation of international treaties, highlighted an array of agreements in place to control the weaponisation of nuclear technology. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which all African countries but South Sudan are party, mandates safeguards to secure nuclear material, for example. And 40 nations have joined the Treaty of Pelindaba that creates a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. HALF-BAKED? At family-run cookie factory Mo-Ya, which towers over surrounding homes in Addis Ababa, chief executive officer Sara Zemui said Ethiopia’s plans to grow and modernise its energy production would mean better-powered businesses - and more jobs. Frequent electricity cuts have long disrupted baking at the factory, spoiling batches of the cookies whose sugary scent perfumes Sunday mass at a nearby church. A few months ago, Mo-Ya forked out more than $100,000 to purchase equipment that, in a blackout, enables a seamless transition to generator power, Zemui said. Here, as in the nearly two-thirds of Ethiopia with access to an electricity connection, power cuts - and associated costs - are caused mainly by overloads on the ageing grid, said Tilahun Legesse, a director at the Ethiopian Electric Utility. In other parts of Africa, however, similar daily outages are due to insufficient power production, said Lovering. At Addis Ababa University, assistant professor Tilahun Tesfaye cannot wait for his country to reap the benefits of a nuclear reactor. “It’s long, long overdue,” he said. “The need is very high.” But the road will be a long one, he said, pointing to out-of-order machinery in his nuclear physics laboratory, the largest such facility in this country of 105 million people. It could take 20 years for Ethiopia to build a nuclear power plant, estimated Hong-Jun Ahn, a Korean electrical engineer who advises the Ethiopian government on its nuclear plans. Yonas Gebru, director of Addis Ababa-based advocacy group Forum for Environment, said green activists could prove another hurdle amid debate over whether nuclear power is “clean” energy. ""It would be good, and it would be wise also ... to better capitalise on already started initiatives such as hydropower, wind energy (and) solar energy,"" said Gebru.

Trading was still light overall with China on holiday and no major economic data on the diary. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1 percent as it rose to its highest since early October. The index has risen steadily since early January as the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its tune on policy for further rate rises. Australia’s benchmark stock index jumped 1.2 percent amid expectations of easy monetary policy after the country’s central bank chief shifted away from his previous tightening bias. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.6 percent. The positive sentiment in Asia was unlikely to extend elsewhere with spreadbetters pointing to a weak start for European shares. London’s FTSE futures was down 0.2 percent as were E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 and Dow . The next major trigger for markets will be any breakthrough in the U.S.-Sino tariff talks when the two sides meet in Beijing next week. U.S. President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he and other U.S. officials will aim to clinch a deal next week to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “Investors are continuing to look for clarity on the trade situation between the United States and China and as the trading days drift by with no concrete update on progress then markets become more and more concerned,” said Nick Twidale, analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “Probably more pressing for the U.S. markets is the threat of another government shutdown,” Twidale added. “With both sides of the house standing firm on the contentious border wall issue at present and the deadline approaching swiftly on Feb 15 we could be back where we were just a few weeks ago.” In currency markets, the early mover was the New Zealand dollar which slid after data showed unemployment, job gains and wages growth all missed forecasts. “The figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year,” said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac. “Soft jobs growth and hours worked increase the risk of another weak economic print in the December quarter.” The kiwi slid to $0.6744, losing nearly 2 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors wagered on the risk of a cut in interest rates. Bonds rallied hard, with two-year yields dropping 8 basis points to 1.66 percent, well below the 1.75 percent cash rate. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) holds its first policy meeting of the year next week and markets are betting it will adopt a dovish stance. Its neighbour, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), caused ripples on Wednesday when it tempered a long-standing tightening bias and indicated the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The Aussie dollar duly dived 1.8 percent and gave a broad fillip to the U.S. dollar. The currency was last at $0.7098. The dollar index has now risen for five straight sessions to reach 96.44, recovering almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes. Less lucky was the euro, which was dragged back to $1.1359 in the wake of a dismal reading on German industrial output. The dollar could make no headway on the yen, which benefited from its own safe-haven status, and idled at 109.95. The broad dollar gains put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,303.96 per ounce, slipping further from last week’s top of $1,326.30.

2019-02-07,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Canada’s struggling oil industry is looking to what is known as partial upgrading technology to thin its sludge-like crude and squeeze more of it through congested pipelines. It is the latest effort by the Alberta provincial government to rescue an industry hurt last year by steep discounts for its oil, as production far exceeded pipeline capacity. The government has already forced output cuts, given subsidies to petrochemical plants and said it would invest in trains to move crude. Alberta in January announced a C$440 million loan guarantee for a C$2-billion partial upgrading facility planned by private company Value Creation. The Edmonton-area plant would turn 77,500 barrels per day (bpd) of diluted bitumen into medium crude oil and low-sulfur diesel, starting in 2022. Producing a medium grade would give the world’s fourth-largest producer more of a different type of crude to sell that does not compete with abundant U.S. light shale oil. Most of the oil produced in Canada is thick, heavy crude that comes from northern Alberta’s oil sands. Some is then put through a full upgrading process at great cost, turning that crude into synthetic light oil. Other heavy crude must be diluted with light oil - an extra expense - to travel through pipelines. “Our crude oil would have a tailor fit to refineries, so we would have no problem to find the market,” Value Creation Chief Executive Columba Yeung said in an interview. Partial upgrading is not yet done on a commercial scale anywhere. It removes sulfur and other impurities to create lighter grades of oil that do not require dilution to move through pipelines, lowering costs and making shipping more efficient. In 2018, the United States imported 2.4 million barrels of medium, sour crude per day, only 15 percent of which came from Canada, according to IHS Markit. “There’s a case to be made for product diversification,” said IHS Vice President Kevin Birn. The timing for partial upgrading comes with risks, however. Alberta’s New Democratic Party government is facing a tough spring election, and by the time the first upgrader is finished in 2022, additional pipeline capacity may be open, reducing the urgency to remove diluent from shipments to free up space. The opposition United Conservative Party would review the viability of any subsidized energy projects if it forms a government, said Prasad Panda, the party’s energy critic. Several pipelines in the works would raise Canada’s export capacity to 5.5 million bpd, creating a surplus of space until 2030, according to the Canadian Energy Research Institute. Yeung counters that additional pipelines would only enhance opportunities for partially upgraded oil to reach markets. Developers of a dozen partial upgrading technologies, including MEG Energy Corp, are undeterred, however, and hope Value Creation’s plant is only the first. Among the other companies grappling with ways to help alleviate Alberta’s problem is Calgary-based Fractal Systems, which intends to profit mainly by removing and reselling diluent from heavy crude. Field Upgrading has a tiny 10 bpd pilot plant that it hopes to scale up to 10,000 bpd by 2022 to produce low-sulfur heavy oil suitable for marine shipping. The technology produces fuel compliant with tougher shipping emission requirements that take effect next year, said co-founder Neil Camarta. “It’s really important that we get some of these technologies out of the lab and into development, because there’s potential there,” Camarta said.

2019-02-07,"NEW YORK/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - In June, the High Seas tanker ship loaded up on ethanol in Texas and set off for Asia. Two months later - after a circuitous journey that included a ship-to-ship transfer and a stop in Malaysia - its cargo arrived in China, according to shipping data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with Malaysian and Chinese port officials. At the time, the roundabout route puzzled global ethanol traders and ship brokers, who called it a convoluted and costly way to get U.S. fuel to China. (MAP: tmsnrt.rs/2HP1ywa ) But the journey reflects a broader shift in global ethanol flows since U.S. President Donald Trump ignited a trade war with China last spring.  Although China slapped retaliatory tariffs up to 70 percent on U.S. ethanol shipments, the fuel can still legally enter China tariff-free if it arrives blended with at least 40 percent Asian-produced fuel, according to trade rules established between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the regional economic and political body. In a striking example of how global commodity markets respond to government policies blocking free trade, some 88,000 tonnes of U.S. ethanol landed on Malaysian shores through November of last year - all since June, shortly after China hiked its tax on U.S. shipments. The surge follows years of negligible imports of U.S. ethanol to Malaysia. In turn, Malaysia has exported 69,000 tonnes of ethanol to China, the first time the nation has been an exporter of the fuel in at least three years, according to Chinese import data.  Blending U.S. and Asian ethanol for the Chinese market undermines the intent of Beijing’s tariffs and helps struggling American ethanol producers by keeping a path open to a major export market that would otherwise be closed. “Global commodity markets are incredibly creative in finding ways to ensure willing sellers are able to meet the demands of willing buyers,” Geoff Cooper, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said in a statement to Reuters. The group represents U.S. ethanol producers. In at least two cases examined by Reuters, including that of the High Seas, blending of U.S. ethanol cargoes with other products appeared to have occurred in Malaysia before the cargoes were shipped on to China, according to a Reuters analysis of shipping records and interviews with port officials.  Chinese merchants including the state-backed oil company Unipec notified Chinese authorities about the unusual activity last summer - which represented competition they had not anticipated under the tariff scheme, according to two industry sources.  Unipec’s parent company Sinopec did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for China’s General Administration of Customs declined to comment. Norazman Ayob, deputy secretary general of the Malaysian trade ministry, confirmed that Malaysia exported ethanol to China this year. The ministry was unable to confirm whether it had been mixed with U.S. fuel, he said, but noted such blending would be legal under the ASEAN-China pact. Malaysia has no track record of significant domestic ethanol production, so it is unclear where the ethanol blended with the U.S. product originates.  Additional U.S. ethanol has flowed in unusual volumes to other destinations since Trump’s trade war began, including other ASEAN member nations the Philippines and Indonesia, according to shipping and trade data, though Reuters could not confirm its final destination. The High Seas cargo ship was among the first to engage in the rising U.S.-to-Malaysia ethanol trade, according to shipping data from financial information provider Refinitiv and bills of lading from the ports. It loaded 25,000 tonnes of ethanol in Texas City on June 23 and then another 10,000 tonnes in Beaumont on June 27. Some of the ethanol was produced by Green Plains Inc, one of America’s top ethanol producers. Green Plains spokesman Jim Stark confirmed the loading of the company’s product in Beaumont but said it could not confirm the cargo’s ultimate destination. At the time it left Texas, the shipment was owned by units of SOCAR Trading SA, the marketing arm of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, according to the bills of lading. The shipment was initially destined for the Philippines.  But after it crossed through the Panama Canal and reached the waters near Singapore in mid-August, the High Seas transferred its cargo to the QUDS, another tanker, according to the Refinitiv data. Vincent Mohy, general counsel for SOCAR, said that the firm sold all of the U.S. ethanol at the time of the transfer to the QUDS and that it made clear to the buyer the fuel originated in the United States. Mohy declined to name the buyer.   The QUDS landed in the Malaysian port of Kuantan days later and took on another 12,074 tonnes of ethanol before heading to the Chinese port of Zhoushan and emptying its hold by the end of the month, according to the shipping data, a Chinese port official and two Malaysian port officials. According to one of the Kuantan port officials and a source in the Malaysian government, the cargo on the QUDS was sold by Malaysia’s Rich Greenergy Sdn Bhd to China’s Zhanjiang Industry Petrochemical Company Limited. Kelvin Shum, Rich Greenergy’s CEO, declined to comment, saying he had signed a non-disclosure agreement about the deal. Efforts to reach Zhanjiang were not successful.  The convoluted voyage was replicated in at least one other case, that of the Maritime Tuntiga. That ship also carried Texas ethanol into Southeast Asia this summer, transferring its cargo into another vessel – the Taibah – near Singapore.  Like the QUDS, the Taibah moved on to the port of Kuantan in Malaysia, picked up about 12,000 tonnes more ethanol, and then moved on to Zhoushan, according to the shipping data and the Kuantan port officials.

2019-02-07,"* H1 profit up 10 pct on higher wholesale power prices * But expects FY19 profit to be flat on year earlier * Says maintaining ageing coal plants is getting more expensive * Shares drop nearly 5 pct, broader market up around 1 pct (Adds comment, share price) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - AGL Energy, Australia’s top power producer, reported a 10-percent rise in half-year underlying profit, but warned that profits would be weaker in the next six months as it steps up spending on maintaining its ageing coal-fired plants. Earnings in the second-half of the financial year that started in July will also be hit by lower gas sales to large business clients, a continued price war for customers and retail electricity price cuts in the state of Victoria, new Chief Executive Brett Redman said on Thursday. AGL, which has the nation’s biggest fleet of coal-fired power plants, said it would hold off from buying back shares. Shares in the company fell nearly 5 percent in a broader market that was up 1 percent. The firm on Thursday abandoned its three-year cost-saving target to 2021 and halved its target for the year to June 2019 to A$60 million ($43 million) taking into account the extra spending on its coal fleet. That spending comes after breakdowns at a number of coal-fired plants, including AGL’s Loy Yang, recently led to blackouts as supply was unable to meet soaring cooling demand amid a brutal heatwave in southeastern Australia. “We’ve made some active decisions this year to really focus on our plant availability and ensure we’ve got the generation there when we need it,” acting Chief Financial Officer Damien Nicks told analysts on a conference call. “As a result, we have additional costs.” AGL’s underlying profit for the six months to Dec. 31, which excludes one-off items, rose to A$537 million from A$487 million at the same time last year, boosted by strong wholesale power prices. AGL said it was on track to hit the midpoint of its forecast range for underlying profit of between A$970 million and A$1.07 billion in the year to June, roughly flat on last year. Revenue slipped 1.8 percent to A$6.34 billion. The company said last August that average wholesale power prices, which had jumped over the previous two years following the closure of two coal-fired power plants by two of its rivals, likely peaked in 2018. “As we look into the future, some of the lead indicators of profitability, like the wholesale electricity prices, are pointing to a flatter to slightly lower future,” Redman told analysts. AGL and its rivals, including Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia, owned by Hong Kong’s CLP Holdings, have come under pressure from the government to cut power prices to homes and businesses as rocketing energy costs have become a hot political issue. But Redman said the government’s proposed “big stick” legislation designed to lower prices and the lack of a broader energy policy was deterring it from going ahead with A$1.5 billion in new generation investments. “There is no question that policy and regulatory uncertainty is contributing to delays in both executing and approving projects,” he said. $1 = 1.4081 Australian dollars

2019-02-07,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present. In a report to state regulators bit.ly/2SevTIZ, PG&E said it would also remove 375,000 trees near electricity lines, trim vegetation over 2,500 square miles (6,475 square km) and conduct thousands of inspections to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires. PG&E is under intense scrutiny for its role in sparking more than a dozen wildfires over the past two years. It filed bankruptcy last month, citing anticipated liabilities, including the possibility its equipment set off November’s deadly Camp Fire, which destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise and killed 86 people.     The San Francisco-based utility, which serves 16 million customers, said it would increase nearly tenfold its efforts to turn off the power to communities threatened by wildfire, increasing the number of households and businesses potentially affected by fire-prevention blackouts in 2019 to 5.4 million. Such shutoffs were also used last year to keep live electricity in the lines from setting off a fire when high winds and heat hit extreme levels and nearby brush or trees could be ignited.  Mark Toney, who directs the utility consumer advocacy group the Utility Reform Network (TURN), said shutting off power would harm vulnerable people, including those who rely on electricity to power life-saving medical equipment. “The fact that there is such a dramatic expansion of power shutoffs as a strategy to stop wildfires is a sign of PG&E’s failure and mismanagement when it comes to trimming the trees and taking care of the grid,” he said. PG&E spokeswoman Kristi Jourdan said the company would only turn off the power to a community as a last resort to keep people safe. “We understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects the operation of critical facilities, communications systems and much more,” she said. The company is also on probation in relation to a criminal conviction in the deadly 2010 explosion of one of its natural gas lines in the city of San Bruno near San Francisco. The judge in that case said he would consider the company’s wildfire plan in deciding whether PG&E should do more to prevent wildfire.  California law requires all investor-owned utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans annually.

2019-02-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Robert Bosch have agreed to pay lawyers representing owners of U.S. diesel vehicles $66 million in fees and costs, according to court filing on Wednesday and people briefed on the matter. In a court filing late on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, lawyer Elizabeth Cabraser said after negotiations overseen by court-appointed settlement master Ken Feinberg, the companies agreed not to oppose an award of $59 million in attorneys’ fees and $7 million in costs. The lawyers had originally sought up to $106.5 million in fees and costs. Under a settlement announced last month, Fiat Chrysler and Bosch, which provided emissions control software for the Fiat Chrysler vehicles, will give 104,000 diesel owners up to $307.5 million or about $2,800 per vehicle for diesel software updates. The legal fees are on top of those costs. Fiat Chrysler and  Bosch did not immediately comment late Wednesday. Fiat Chrysler is paying up to $280 million, or 90 percent of the settlement costs, and Bosch is paying $27.5 million, or 10 percent. The companies are expected to divide the attorney costs under the same formula, meaning Fiat Chrysler will pay $60 million and Bosch $6 million, the people briefed on the settlement said. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen must still approve the legal fees. He has set a May 3 hearing on a motion to grant final approval. The Italian-American automaker on Jan. 10 announced it settled with the U.S. Justice Department, California and diesel owners over civil claims that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests. Fiat Chrysler previously estimated the value of the settlements at about $800 million. Fiat Chrysler is also paying $311 million in total civil penalties and issuing extended warranties worth $105 million, among other costs. The settlement covers 104,000 Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee diesels from the model years 2014 to 2016. In addition, Fiat Chrysler will pay $72.5 million for state civil penalties and $33.5 million to California to offset excess emissions and consumer claims. The hefty penalty was the latest fallout from the U.S. government’s stepped-up enforcement of vehicle emissions rules after Volkswagen AG admitted in September 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules.  The Justice Department has a pending criminal investigation against Fiat Chrysler.

2019-02-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s self-declared interim president, Juan Guaido, will name a new board for Citgo Petroleum Corp this week, Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and owned by Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), is Venezuela’s top foreign asset.  But the United States has imposed sanctions on PDVSA as part of Washington’s bid to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to step down after he was re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham. The U.S. actions have, in turn, squeezed Citgo. Venezuela’s opposition said on Wednesday it would use income accrued by Citgo since last month to finance its efforts to dislodge Maduro. “The interim president is going to name a new governance board very soon here, probably as early as today or tomorrow and that’ll be recognised under U.S. law,” Rubio said in an interview with the Journal. Rubio added that the United States would then recognise that board as the legal entity controlling Citgo. It was not immediately clear how Rubio received that information. Representatives for Rubio, Citgo, the White House and Carlos Vecchio, the U.S. representative for Guaido, did not immediately respond to requests for comments. PDVSA has said it would use legal manoeuvres to block a takeover of Citgo. Washington has recognised Guaido, an opposition leader and head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, as the interim president of Venezuela. Other countries have followed suit. But Maduro, who denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup against him, has retained control of the state and still counts on support from Russia and China.

2019-02-07,"* U.S. crude inventories climb, output still at record * But OPEC cuts, Venezuela crisis tighten market * U.S. oil output, drilling & storage: tmsnrt.rs/2DTTRRH By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices dipped on Thursday after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country stayed at record levels, but OPEC-led supply cuts and the crisis in Venezuela supported markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.82 per barrel at 0036 GMT, down 19 cents, or 0.35 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. U.S. crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA climbed by 1.3 million barrels in the week that ended Feb. 1, to 447.21 million barrels, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Wednesday. Meanwhile, average weekly U.S. crude oil production remained at the record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) C-OUT-T-EIA it reached in late 2018. Countering the rising U.S. crude output and inventories are voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s oil industry are expected to knock out at least 500,000 bpd of crude exports. “We expect the oil price to rise in the first-half of 2019 on tightening supply conditions and decline in the second-half on weakening economic activity and an increase in U.S. crude exports to international markets,” said French bank BNP Paribas. It added that it saw average 2019 prices for Brent at $68 per barrel and for WTI at $61 per barrel, both down by $8 from its previous outlook.

2019-02-07,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei dips in quiet trade, S&P 500 futures flat * Dollar holds gains as NZ$ slides on jobs data By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Asian share markets were in a muted mood on Thursday and looked set for a sleepy session with China still on holiday and no major economic data on the diary. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little moved in early trade after ending almost unchanged on Wednesday. Japan’s Nikkei dipped 0.2 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.06 percent in very thin trade. Wall Street had already snoozed through a subdued session, though disappointing revenue forecasts hammered shares of the major videogame makers. Electronic Arts Inc tumbled 13.3 percent and Activision Blizzard Inc sank 10.1 percent. The Dow fell 0.08 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.36 percent. Markets are still waiting on developments in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute after President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that he and other U.S. officials will travel to Beijing next week for trade talks, aiming to clinch a deal to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. In currency markets, the early mover was the New Zealand dollar which slid after local data showed unemployment, job gains and wages growth all missed forecasts. “The figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year,” said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac. “Soft jobs growth and hours worked increase the risk of another weak economic print in the December quarter.” The kiwi slid to $0.6772, losing 1.6 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors narrowed the odds on a cut in interest rates. Bonds rallied hard, with two-year yields dropping 7 basis points to 1.67 percent, well below the 1.75 percent cash rate. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand holds its first policy meeting of the year next week and markets are wagering it will take a dovish stance. Its neighbour, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), caused ripples on Wednesday when it tempered a long-standing tightening bias and indicated the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The Aussie dollar duly dived 1.8 percent to stand at $0.7110 and gave a broad fillip to the U.S. dollar. The dollar index has now risen for five straight sessions to reach 96.400, recovering almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes. Less lucky was the euro, which was dragged back to $1.1366 in the wake of a dismal reading on German industrial output. The dollar could make no headway on the yen, which benefited from its own safe-haven status, and idled at 109.93. It broad gains still put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,306.84 per ounce, slipping further from last week’s top of $1,326.30. Oil prices were underpinned by signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply. Brent crude futures gained 71 cents higher on Wednesday to settle at $62.69 and were yet to trade. U.S. crude eased 6 cents in Asia to $53.95 a barrel.
