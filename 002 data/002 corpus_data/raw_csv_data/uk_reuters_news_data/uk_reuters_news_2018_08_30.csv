2018-08-30,"HOUSTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Texas oil production fell in June from a year earlier for the first time in 16 months, according to figures released on Thursday by the state’s energy regulator, a fresh sign that a lack of pipeline space in the nation’s largest shale field may be curbing production. Texas June oil production was 98.9 million barrels, down about 2 percent from the same month last year and off 7 percent from the previous month, the Texas Railroad Commission estimated in a monthly report. So far this year, the state’s crude output had been rising 10.4 percent annually. The slowdown comes as oil prices in West Texas, home of the oil-rich Permian Basin, have fallen to near four-year lows as production outpaces takeaway capacity, including pipelines, local refineries and rail cars. This week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in Midland, Texas, traded at a more than $18-a-barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark, its lowest level since August 2014 WTC-WTM. Back then, local oil prices also sank because there were not enough pipelines to carry away production. Some West Texas producers have said they will pull back on activity and delay well completions as a result of falling local oil prices. The number of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) in the Permian rose by 167 in July, to 3,470, accounting for around 43 percent of all DUCs in the United States, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. Keane Group, which hydraulically fractures shale wells, last month said it expected DUCs to rise as operators continue to drill wells to hold onto specialized rigs. When prices are weak, producers will hold off completing wells and grow their DUC count. The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts West Texas oil production will grow next month, despite the weaker prices and transportation bottlenecks. It calls for output to rise by 34,000 barrels per day to 3.42 million, the EIA said this month.

2018-08-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rally in U.S. stocks came to a halt on Thursday on new concerns that the U.S.-Chinese trade dispute will intensify, while economic turmoil in Argentina and Turkey sent those countries’ currencies tumbling. Stock markets and major government bond yields have risen in recent weeks on hopes that a global trade war could be averted, particularly as leaders of the United States and Canada expressed optimism they could reach a new North American Free Trade Agreement by Friday. Investor sentiment darkened, however, on the prospect that a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods may likely take effect in September. President Donald Trump has told aides he is ready to impose tariffs on $200 billion more in Chinese imports as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends next week, Bloomberg News reported. “It was an average sleepy summer afternoon going into the long (Labor Day) weekend until the latest Trump announcement of tariffs on China,” said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. The Argentine peso ARS= tumbled again, even after the central bank hiked its benchmark interest rate by 15 percentage points to a dizzying 60 percent on Thursday in a bid to control rampant inflation and stem the currency's slide. The peso finished at a record closing low of 39.25 per U.S. dollar. The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said it was studying a request from Argentina to speed up disbursement from a $50 billion loan program, but still wants Argentina to adopt stronger fiscal and monetary policies. Turkey's lira TRY= was pressured after reports that the country's central bank deputy governor and rate-setter, Erkan Kilimci, is leaving the bank. Earlier this month, Turkey's currency crisis sent the lira to a record low against the U.S. dollar and sparked concerns about emerging markets investments.

2018-08-30,"(Adds auction details, comments from officials) SAO PAULO, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled power company Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, sold three power distribution companies at a public auction on Thursday in Sao Paulo, concluding another step in its divestiture program. Local companies acquired the assets. Energisa SA bought power distribution firms Eletroacre and Ceron, which operate in the northern states of Acre and Rondônia, while Oliveira Energia in association with ATEM purchased Boa Vista Energia, located in Roraima, according to the exchange. The bids comprised a combination of tariffs the acquirers are planning to charge plus a signing bonus. They will also need to comply with requirements for immediate cash injection in the distributors and for long-term investment programs. Dyogo Oliveira, the head of Brazil’s development bank BNDES, which acted as an adviser to Eletrobras in the deal, said Energisa and Oliveira Energia will have to inject 688 million reais ($165 million) in the companies they acquired. Investments over five years to modernize the firms are expected to reach 1.5 billion reais, Oliveira said. Energisa said after the auction that it now owns 11 power distribution companies in Brazil. Eletrobras has now sold five power distribution companies, mostly money-losing units. It sold earlier Celg and Cepisa. The divestitures are part of a plan the company has to sell non-core assets to reduce its debt. Eletrobras is expected to hold another auction on Sept. 27 to sell Amazonas Energia. $1 = 4.16 reais

2018-08-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday to the highest in more than a month, extending gains on growing evidence of disruptions to crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and after a fall in U.S. inventories. Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose 63 cents a barrel to settle at $77.77. U.S. crude CLc1 settled 74 cents higher at $70.25 a barrel, after earlier hitting a session high of $70.50. Both contracts were at their highest in more than one month. A rally that started earlier in the day accelerated as U.S. crude rose above $70 a barrel, and more speculators entered the market, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. “There are pretty good tailwinds here that will keep people jumping on board,” he said. Brent’s wide premium to WTI is likely to encourage exports of U.S. crude, keeping U.S. inventories lower and boosting activity following weekly inventory data, he said.  Brent has risen by almost 10 percent over the past two weeks on widespread perceptions that the global oil market is tightening and could run short in the next few months as U.S. sanctions restrict crude exports from Iran. “There are a lot of supportive factors here,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  In addition to support from geopolitical events, natural disasters could impact the market if a potential storm system currently off the coast of Africa strengthens and heads to the Gulf of Mexico, he said. “The oil market is once again tightening,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at Swiss bank UBS in Zurich. “Iranian oil export declines are already visible well in advance of U.S. oil-related sanctions, which enter into force in November.” Iranian crude exports are likely to drop to a little more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, against a peak of 3.1 million bpd in April, as importers bow to American pressure to cut orders. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in which Iran is the third-biggest producer, will discuss in December whether it can compensate for a sudden drop in Iranian supply after sanctions start in November, the head of Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said on Wednesday. Crude exports from crisis-struck OPEC member Venezuela have also fallen sharply, halving in recent years to about 1 million bpd. For the graphic on Venezuela crude oil exports png, click tmsnrt.rs/2LvCPtl Official U.S. oil inventory data on Wednesday also helped the bullish trend. U.S. commercial crude inventories USOILC=ECB fell by a larger than expected 2.6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 24, to 405.79 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S] U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA was flat from the previous week's record of 11 million bpd.The market pared gains slightly after information provider Genscape said inventories at the delivery hub at Cushing, Oklahoma had risen 101,433 barrels since Aug. 24, traders said.   For the graphic on  U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels png, click tmsnrt.rs/2OKP4nJ The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned of a tightening market toward the end of the year because of falling supply in countries such as Iran and Venezuela combined with strong demand, especially in Asia. “Definitely there are some worries that oil markets can tighten towards the end of this year,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters on Wednesday. BNP Paribas global oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian highlighted a combination of supply risks. “As Iranian oil exports are lost to the market, Venezuelan production continues to decline, Angola struggles to maintain output and Libya is subject to episodic outages,” he told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. “The path of least resistance (for prices), at least in our view, is up.”  Still, the market could face renewed headwinds from uncertainty about growth in emerging markets, said Again Capital’s Kilduff. “What’s been holding us back is demand concerns. We thought Argentina was put to bed and it is a detracting factor.” Argentina’s central bank on Thursday yanked up its benchmark interest rate to 60 percent from 45 percent in a bid to control inflation running at more than 31 percent as the country’s currency plummeted 15.6 percent to a record low 39 pesos per U.S. dollar.

2018-08-30,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by a 2015 deal with major powers, a confidential report by the U.N. atomic watchdog indicated on Thursday. In its second quarterly report since President Donald Trump announced in May that the United States would quit the accord and reimpose sanctions, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had stayed within the caps on uranium enrichment levels, enriched uranium stocks and other items. In its last report in May, the IAEA had said Iran could do more to cooperate with inspectors and thereby “enhance confidence”, but stopped short of saying the Islamic Republic had given it cause for concern. Thursday’s report to member states seen by Reuters contained similar language. It said the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog was able to carry out all so-called complementary access inspections needed to verify Iran’s compliance with the deal. “Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhances confidence,” said the report, which was distributed to IAEA member states. “The production rate (of enriched uranium) is constant. There is no change whatsoever,” a senior diplomat added.     With the United States reimposing its sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear deal, many diplomats and analysts now doubt that the accord will survive despite European Union efforts to counter some of the effects of Trump’s move. Sticking to the nuclear accord is not the only way forward for Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday. “Being the party to still honour the deal in deeds & not just words is not Iran’s only option,” he said on Twitter. Speaking after the IAEA report was sent to the agency’s member states, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the deal was still holding, despite the U.S. withdrawal.  He urged his fellow ministers, who met in Vienna on Thursday to discuss EU policy on Iran, to do more to protect Tehran from U.S. sanctions, calling for “permanent financial mechanisms that allow Iran to continue to trade”.  The EU implemented a law this month to shield European companies from the impact of U.S. sanctions on Tehran and has approved aid for the Iranian private sector, although large European companies are pulling out of Iran. Adhering to the deal should bring Iran economic benefits, Zarif said. “If preserving (the) JCPOA (the deal) is the goal, then there is no escape from mustering the courage to comply with commitment to normalize Iran’s economic relations instead of making extraneous demands,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. On Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast doubt on the ability of EU countries to save the agreement and said Tehran might abandon it. Khamenei told President Hassan Rouhani not to rely too much on European support as he came under increased pressure at home over his handling of the economy in the face of U.S. sanctions, with key ministers under attack by parliament. Le Drian, whose country signed the Iran deal along with Britain, Germany, China, Russia and the United States under then-President Barack Obama, said Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. Those issues were not covered by the 2015 deal and Trump has cited this as a major reason for pulling Washington out of it.  Le Drian said Iran, which says its missiles are only for defence, was arming regional allies with rockets and allowing “ballistic proliferation,” adding: “Iran needs to avoid the temptation to be the (regional) hegemon.” Iran has ruled out negotiations on its ballistic missiles and broader Middle Eastern role.

2018-08-30,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Nyhamna gas processing plant, which feeds Britain with gas through the North Sea’s biggest pipeline, may rely on power from local industries as a backup to its fragile electricity supply, grid operator Statnett told Reuters. Nyhamna is one of Norway’s biggest gas processing plants, requiring a stable and plentiful supply of electricity. Power supply has been a recurrent problem and the plant has had to shut down production due to outages in recent years, sometimes affecting gas supply to Britain. The processing capacity of the plant, which handles gas from Norway’s Ormen Lange field, will be raised to 84 million cubic meters (mcm) per day by October, to start accommodating output from the Aasta Hansteen field. The power-hungry plant is connected only by a single transmission line to Norway’s grid, and processing more gas will only add to concerns about the fragility of its power link. Operator Gassco and the country’s grid Statnett have negotiated for years about how to reinforce the power supply to Nyhamna, and more importantly who will pay for it, without results so far. “They (Gassco) are considering a cooperation with local industries, to have reserves as a short-term measure,” Statnett’s Chief Financial Officer Knut Hundhammer told Reuters. Statnett had earlier expressed concerns over the security of supply to Nyhamna, which it described as “below the desired level” in the risk segment of its mid-year report. “Some industries are much more flexible than Nyhamna and they can provide capacity to the plant if needed,” Hundhammer said, declining to name the companies. Cooperation with local industry would give Nyhamna a fallback option if power to the plant was cut or reduced. Hundhammer said the industries that may supply Nyhamna in case of need get their supply from other power lines, so their electricity flow would not be disrupted if Nyhamna’s link suffered an outage. A Gassco spokeswoman said different measures were being considered, and costs and usefulness were always part of those assessments. “At Nyhamna, Gassco is seeking opportunities in reinforcements in the regional grid, as well as other measures,” she said. The Nyhamna plant sits on an island near the mainland town of Molde, with local businesses including furniture makers, oil services companies, producers of building materials and auto parts firms. Some distance further away, at the town of Sunndalsoera, Norway’s largest power consumer Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) has Europe’s largest aluminium plant with annual capacity of well over 400,000 metric tons of metal. Α Norsk Hydro spokesman said that even though the firm hasn’t been approached, cooperation on power security was feasible. “Security of power supply is important for both our plant and Nyhamna... We could find a solution that is mutually beneficial,” he said. Statnett and Gassco were still working on options to enhance power supply at Nyhamna for the long-term but Hundhammer declined to elaborate on when that would be and how much it would cost, as the negotiations are ongoing.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Environmental campaigners launched a boat on the River Thames on Thursday made almost entirely of recycled plastic waste, in an effort to raise awareness of growing levels of rubbish in Britain’s waterways. The 12-seater punt was built by Mark Edwards, who also made the Gloriana barge for Queen Elizabeth’s 2012 diamond jubilee. Named the “PET Project,” the boat will run regular trips along the river to fish out plastic rubbish, which in turn will be used to build more such vessels. Edwards used traditional techniques to make the boat. “We went back to the technology inherited from the Vikings,” he told reporters at the launch in Richmond, southwest London. “It took us two men, about six weeks flat out, so it’s quite a lot of work ... but for a craft that’s going to last 100 years it’s nothing.” Each year 300 tonnes of rubbish is cleared from the Thames and a large proportion of it is food and drink packaging that comes from dry land, says the environmental charity Hubbub which is behind the project.  It adds on its website: “Much of the litter is being eaten by birds, fish and other species which is leading to 70 percent of Thames fish found to have plastic in their gut.” PET project is Hubbub’s second boat made of recycled plastic waste.  “I think this ... shows that plastic is not just an issue that’s in far away oceans - it’s present here in London and actually there’s lots we can all do about it,” said its director Gavin Ellis.  “It’s about making sure you don’t put litter in an overflowing bin where it can blow out into the river and it’s obviously about not dropping litter directly into the river.” Reporting by Saeed Haque; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-recycling-boat/campaigners-launch-uk-boat-made-of-recycled-plastic-waste-idUKL8N1VL4U4,30 Aug 2018,"Environmental campaigners

2018-08-30,"NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India’s state railways on Thursday signed a preliminary deal with gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd to use natural gas in some of its operations, part of a drive by the world’s third biggest oil consumer to gradually shift to cleaner fuels. India is building infrastructure, including pipelines and import facilities, to raise the share of gas in its energy mix to 15 percent in next few years from the current level of about 6.5 percent. Using natural gas will be about 25 percent cheaper than the alternatives fuels used by the railways at workshops and production units, said Ashwani Lohani, chairman of Indian Railways’ board. He said the company would strive to shift all 54 of its workshops to natural gas by June 2019. Indian Railways annually consumes about 3 billion litres of diesel, said Chetram, chief administrative officer of Indian Railways Organisation for Alternate fuels. Only a fraction of that will be replaced by natural gas, he added. He said Indian Railways can replace 844,027 cubic metres of acetylene, 2.35 million kilograms of liquefied petroleum gas and 140,991 kilograms of cut gases to save 170 million rupees  ($2.4 million) a year. “The objective of this memorandum of understanding is, on a pan-India basis, wherever we have reach, we will be supplying natural gas to the Indian Railways,” said B.C.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - An overhang of homeless crude in the Atlantic Basin has halved in recent weeks, suggesting oil traders are bracing for a further supply loss from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and a new rally in prices. Iran’s oil exports are already dropping fast as refiners scurry to find alternatives ahead of a reimposition of U.S. sanctions in early November, which in turn has helped drain a glut of unsold oil. The millions of unsold barrels of crude that had pooled around northwest Europe, the Mediterranean and West Africa over July and August are rapidly draining. A months-long surplus in the West African market that depressed prices to their lowest in months has almost vanished. Traders had said just one week ago that leftover crude from the August and September loading schedules amounted to some 30 cargoes, equivalent to an average 930,000 barrels per day (bpd).  Now, that overhang has dwindled to a handful of unsold cargoes, while demand for October-loading Angolan oil, the favored West African grades for Chinese refiners, has been even more robust than that for September.  “The overall situation ... is that U.S. sanctions toward Iran are now increasingly kicking in, which will help to dry up the physical crude oil market and place it back into solid backwardation,” SEB head of commodities Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note this week. “This will shift the front end Brent crude oil price into the higher $70s range with a touch of $80s.” GRAPHIC: Surplus of unsold WAF crude cargoes dwindles - reut.rs/2LGD9FK The belief that supply will fall short of demand is reflected in the futures market when the price of a prompt-dated contract rises above that of a longer-dated one, a situation known as backwardation. With a little over nine weeks until possibly more than 1 million bpd of Iranian supply is off the market, Brent futures are now at their closest to backwardation in almost a month, leaving the front-month October contract LCOc1 just 35 cents below November LCOc2, nearly half what it was in late July. Concern over oil demand, particularly in China, has been put to rest, for now at least.  Consumption by China’s independent refiners, or teapots, has picked up sharply in August to around 1.4 million bpd, up 40 percent from near-record lows in July, as plants return from prolonged summer maintenance. Shipments of West African crude to Asia generally have hit record highs of 2.59 million bpd in August, thanks in large part to Indian demand, while European refineries’ appetite for crudes similar to Iran’s has pushed the price of Russian Urals to its highest in nine months.  “Looking at the spreads, it’s starting to appear as if the market is somewhat tightening. The West African overhang has disappeared, so it looks as though that ramp-up in OPEC output in June and July is starting to be eaten into,” ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said. A number of major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are boosting output, after having agreed to cut by up to 1.8 million bpd since January 2017, to fill any gaps in supply left by the sanctions and prevent demand-damaging price spikes. In Europe, the North Sea market is still suffering from a surplus of crude that grew so large earlier in August that traders resorted to keeping it on tankers, arguably the most expensive storage option.  GRAPHIC: Crude oil in floating storage around the Atlantic Basin - reut.rs/2MY6iRs This pool is finally shrinking. According to Reuters data, some 16 million barrels of oil are still in floating storage around northwest Europe and the Mediterranean, including North Sea crudes such as Forties and Ekofisk, Saudi Arab Light, Algerian Saharan, Russian Urals, U.S. shale and West African grades such as Nigerian Bonny Light and Ghanaian Jubilee. But this is down from nearly 20 million a few days ago. Even though oil supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may grow next year, output from Venezuela, Mexico and Angola continues to decline and other big exporters like Libya and Nigeria are prone to disruption.  Add to that years of underinvestment as a result of an oil price that struggled below $50 a barrel, and some big investors believe the market is ripe for a rally.

2018-08-30,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - The surging costs of carbon permits have caused some of Europe’s biggest utilities to lock in purchases in advance, while nuclear and hydro firms are benefiting from the knock-on effect on power prices. Carbon permits traded under the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) have become the best performing commodity this year, almost trebling in price to over 21 euros (18.86 pounds) a tonne since January on the back of stronger energy prices and measures to reduce supply. The ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis which dragged prices down to lows of 2-3 euros a tonne. Now at 10-year highs, stronger carbon prices make it more expensive for European utilities to burn fossil fuels, encouraging a shift to cleaner energy sources. Prices are expected to keep rising, according to a Reuters survey of analysts last month. Market participants can hedge their exposure to rising prices by buying enough carbon permits when the price is low to cover their future emissions output. If they have a surplus, they can sell them back to the market and make a profit when the price rises. If they don’t have enough, they would have to buy more at a higher price.  “Higher carbon prices mean higher costs for all European utilities, unless of course they hedged or stockpiled allowances,” said French energy consultant Hibault Laconde. One such company is coal-heavy German generator RWE (RWEG.DE), which said it had protected itself against power price volatility by selling fuels, as opposed to selling power production, and simultaneously buying enough emissions permits. “Our CO2 position is already financially hedged until the end of 2022 and we have also taken steps beyond 2022,” chief financial officer Markus Krebber said during recent half-year earnings calls with analysts. Coal plants have benefited for years from low carbon prices which kept operational costs down.  Many old German coal plants could be operated at low overheads and they were the price setters in the wholesale market for thermal generation. RWE’s hedging strategy involves nuclear and brown coal-generated power being sold usually up to three years in advance and hard coal and gas-fired ones closer to production. Rival Uniper (UN01.DE) said it sold the bulk of its hydroelectric output next year. The rise in carbon prices will force inefficient coal plants out of the market, chief financial officer Christopher Delbrueck said this week. Berlin-based Aurora Energy Research said German producers of coal from locally-mined lignite, a heavily polluting brown coal, such as Leag, EPH and RWE, had reason to worry. The carbon price rise to 21 euros from 6 euros a year ago could have produced additional costs of 2.3 billion euros, according to Aurora analyst Hanns Koenig. In coal-reliant Poland, the country’s four major state producers are historically heavily exposed to coal generation. Tauron’s chief executive has called the EU carbon price a quasi-ecological tax. “This is not a comfortable situation for us. Because of the CO2 policy, energy could become a luxury good,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP at the weekend. For companies producing electricity from low-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric plants, higher carbon prices are welcomed. The wholesale price of power reflects the cost of buying carbon permits and fuels. Coal and gas prices have risen this year due to Chinese demand, a cold winter and a heatwave across Europe. The benchmark German power price is at a six-and-a-half year high. France’s EDF (EDF.PA), which has a generation fleet made up of 77 percent nuclear and 10 percent renewables, should produce more competitive electricity in interconnected European markets. “The higher CO2 prices are a huge jackpot for EDF as they drive up wholesale power market prices ... This is the case for all nuclear and hydro power producers,” said Nicolas Goldberg, energy specialist at Colombus Consulting. A spokesman for Swedish utility Vattenfall said price rises supported its strategy of becoming less reliant on fossil fuels. “If current price developments continue, we expect a gradual decrease in profitability of coal-fired assets. However, our diversified portfolio with a significant (combined heat and power) share is rather robust to such developments,” he added. Germany’s Uniper, which has inherited the thermal and hydro plants of former parent E.ON (EONGn.DE), said it had  factored in significant price increases for carbon, coal and gas-fired power in the coming years. “That will give our earnings a boost from 2020/21,” CFO Delbrueck said. Germany’s E.ON is focussing on low-carbon power, grids and retail activities, and is left with nuclear power production only in Germany and Sweden, where it also operates hydropower. Czech nuclear, coal and renewable generator CEZ (CEZP.PR) has sold over 77 percent of its expected 2019 output, benefiting from a higher share of nuclear than pure coal generators. Some analysts say a carbon price around 20-30 euros could encourage more utilities to switch to lower carbon fuels.  Gas-fired power generation becomes more competitive at a carbon price of round 20 euros a tonne.  However, margins for gas-fired plants are still mostly negative, despite a cleaner carbon record, as high oil and gas prices mean high purchasing costs for generators vis-à-vis coal. Uniper’s Delbrueck said it should be closer to 30 euros to get a stronger fuel switch.

2018-08-30,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said only half of its VW branded passenger car models in Germany are compliant with a new pollution standard, thanks to a much tougher emissions testing regime.  Cars in the European Union must comply with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) from September, but Volkswagen has only gained regulatory clearance for seven of its 14 main model lines. “The new tests are more cumbersome and take two to three times longer than in the past, even limited edition models need to be tested separately,” Volkswagen’s Thomas Zahn said in a call with journalists on Thursday. “The coming months will be challenging for us,” said Zahn, head of sales and marketing for Volkswagen passenger cars. Volkswagen’s top-selling Golf model is among the vehicles still waiting to be cleared by authorities, Zahn said. He said he expected the Golf to pass the WLTP standards by the end of September. Shipments of cars are expected to slow down in September and October, but pick up again in the final two months of the year. “We expect very strong deliveries in December,” Zahn said. Carmakers including Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Volkswagen and supplier Valeo (VLOF.PA) have cut profit expectations, blaming a slowdown in global sales triggered in part by delays getting vehicles certified to the new standard. Analysts at Evercore ISI said the WLTP delays at the VW brand appear to be under control since the carmaker has not resorted to heavy discounting to keep sales flowing.  Nonetheless delays will cause profitability of the brand to drop to around 2 percent in the third quarter, from 5.5 percent in the second quarter, Evercore said in a note on Thursday.

2018-08-30,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China steel futures vs iron ore futures: tmsnrt.rs/2PfEcyv By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 30 (Reuters) - It’s been a long time coming but Chinese steel prices are finally showing signs of running out of steam, with futures having dropped for six straight sessions. The Shanghai Futures Exchange benchmark rebar contract closed at 4,160 yuan ($605) a tonne on Wednesday, having retreated from the seven-year high of 4,418 yuan a tonne, reached on Aug. 22. The recent declines point to an increasing tug-of-war between still robust margins for steel makers and the likelihood of slowing demand growth in China, which produces about half of the world’s steel. Steel futures gained about 29 percent from the end of last year to their recent peak, as Chinese mills enjoyed some of the strongest profits in years. Output curbs related to efforts to control pollution and the cutting of older, less efficient capacity, has boosted the industry’s fortunes. Improving profits have allowed steel mills to boost production by employing higher grade iron ore as a feedstock, which has the added benefit of requiring less coking coal per unit of steel produced. The result has been record output, with China producing a fourth straight monthly high in July of 81.24 million tonnes, according to official statistics. Year-to-date output to end-July grew 6.3 percent compared with the previous year to 532.85 million tonnes, as profit margins reached around 1,100 yuan a tonne, according to analysts from Huatai Futures. While it’s logical to expect steel mills to maximise production when profit margins are elevated, there is some concern as to where all the steel is going. The key construction sectors appear to still be enjoying strong activity, but perhaps not enough to justify a 6.3 percent increase in output. Other steel-consuming sectors, such as appliance and goods manufacturing and car making are in a similar position. Exports of steel products have been trending lower this year, with shipments of products in the first seven months of the year slipping 13.6 percent to 41.3 million tonnes. The escalating trade dispute with the United States, and imposition of duties by other countries on Chinese steel means exports are unlikely to return to growth any time soon. Visible inventories have been largely steady in recent weeks, but are still well down on levels earlier in the year, with data from consultancy SteelHome showing rebar stocks SH-TOT-RBARINV at 4.12 million tonnes in the week to Aug. 24, less than half the peak in early March. With mounting concern about a cooling in the Chinese economy in the second half of the year, the risk is rising that steel’s stellar run must be coming to an end. This should also have a desultory effect on iron ore as well, which has spent the past five months trading in a fairly narrow range. Ore with a 62 percent iron content, the main benchmark, ended at $65.35 a tonne on Wednesday, according to prices assessed by Argus Media MT-IO-QIN62=ARG. This means the steel-making ingredient has lost about 11.7 percent so far this year, although it should be noted that higher grade ore has performed better. Argus assessed 65 percent iron ore at $94.40 a tonne on Wednesday, which is up 3 percent so far this year. Low-grade iron ore has also declined more than the benchmark, with consultancy CuSteel citing 58 percent ore from India CUS-IF5800-IORE at a price of 245 yuan ($35.90) a tonne on Wednesday, down 12.5 percent from the end of last year. The outperformance of higher grade iron ore does confirm that China’s steel mills have been using better quality ore to maximise output and lower emissions. But it is also the case that they have still been importing significant volumes of lower grade ore. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters shows that Australia, which supplies mainly 62 percent and lower-grade 58 percent iron ore, has managed to boost its share of China’s imports to 67.4 percent for the first eight months of the year, compared with 66.1 percent for the same period in 2017. In contrast, high-grade suppliers Brazil and South Africa both lost market share, with the South American country dropping to 19.5 percent from 21.2 percent, and South Africa slipping to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shows signs of extending its nine-year expansion with the help of tax cuts and strong business and consumer confidence. Both the longevity of the expansion and the apparent limited slack in the labour and product markets suggest the current pace of growth is probably not sustainable in the medium term. The current cyclical expansion is 110 months old and will be the longest on record if the economy is still growing in July 2019. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto) While longevity alone is not a good predictor of cyclical turning points, with most financial and economic indicators close to multi-decade highs, the balance of risks is shifting. “What matters primarily ... is not the passage of calendar time but what happens over time in and to the economy in motion. It is historical and psychological time, filled with events and processes, perceptions and actions. “There is a simple corollary: knowledge of the current phase of the business cycle and its age can help but must not be used in isolation,” Victor Zarnowitz, a leading U.S. expert on business cycles, wrote in 1992. “The variability in length of business expansions and contractions is sufficiently large for the timing of cyclical turning points to be very difficult to forecast. “The age of a phase alone is not of much help in predicting its end: what matters more is the dynamics of the evolving business situation. (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting,” Zarnowitz, 1992) Zarnowitz went on to observe: “The largest errors in forecasts ... are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense they miss recessions and recoveries.” Fears about a future slowdown in the U.S. economy have grown as the U.S. Treasury curve has come closer to inverting, given the close correlation between slowdowns and inversions over several decades. Yields on U.S. Treasury paper with two years to maturity are now just 22 basis points below yields on 10-year notes, the narrowest gap since a few months before the start of the last recession in December 2007. The yield curve exhibits strongly cyclical behaviour, with a large negative gap during economic slowdowns and a smaller negative gap or even a positive one during expansions. To some extent, whether or not the curve actually inverts is arbitrary, since there is no special significance in the zero line, and the long-term average has been around 105-115 basis points. So the current gap is already in the 82nd-83rd percentile of the long-term distribution across multiple cycles since 1983, and the is economy already well into the cycle’s boom/tightening phase. It is not possible to predict either the precise timing or the depth of the next slowdown, but the narrowing yield gap indicates the distribution of risks over the next couple of years is now skewed to the downside. There are more scenarios in which something could go wrong (accelerating inflation, an emerging markets crisis, monetary policy errors, or a deterioration in corporate finances) and fewer in which everything goes right. The current yield gap is consistent with a wealth of other indicators, including purchasing surveys, consumer confidence, unemployment, retail price inflation, freight movements and the escalation in share prices. They all point to an economy approaching a cyclical peak, and then likely to move into a period of more moderate growth, if not recession, over the next 12 to 24 months. The critical question is whether the next slowdown, when it comes, proves just a pause in an otherwise sustained expansion (1994/95) or marks an end to the current cycle and start of a new one (2000/01 or 2007/08).

2018-08-30,"HOUSTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Texas oil production fell in June from a year earlier for the first time in 16 months, according to figures released on Thursday by the state’s energy regulator, a fresh sign that a lack of pipeline space in the nation’s largest shale field may be curbing production. Texas June oil production was 98.9 million barrels, down about 2 percent from the same month last year and off 7 percent from the previous month, the Texas Railroad Commission estimated in a monthly report. So far this year, the state’s crude output had been rising 10.4 percent annually. The slowdown comes as oil prices in West Texas, home of the oil-rich Permian Basin, have fallen to near four-year lows as production outpaces takeaway capacity, including pipelines, local refineries and rail cars. This week, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in Midland, Texas, traded at a more than $18-a-barrel discount to the U.S. benchmark, its lowest level since August 2014 WTC-WTM. Back then, local oil prices also sank because there were not enough pipelines to carry away production. Some West Texas producers have said they will pull back on activity and delay well completions as a result of falling local oil prices. The number of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) in the Permian rose by 167 in July, to 3,470, accounting for around 43 percent of all DUCs in the United States, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month. Keane Group, which hydraulically fractures shale wells, last month said it expected DUCs to rise as operators continue to drill wells to hold onto specialized rigs. When prices are weak, producers will hold off completing wells and grow their DUC count. The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts West Texas oil production will grow next month, despite the weaker prices and transportation bottlenecks. It calls for output to rise by 34,000 barrels per day to 3.42 million, the EIA said this month.

Local companies acquired the assets. Energisa SA bought power distribution firms Eletroacre and Ceron, which operate in the northern states of Acre and Rondônia, while Oliveira Energia in association with ATEM purchased Boa Vista Energia, located in Roraima, according to the exchange. The bids comprised a combination of tariffs the acquirers are planning to charge plus a signing bonus. They will also need to comply with requirements for immediate cash injection in the distributors and for long-term investment programs. Dyogo Oliveira, the head of Brazil’s development bank BNDES, which acted as an adviser to Eletrobras in the deal, said Energisa and Oliveira Energia will have to inject 688 million reais ($165 million) in the companies they acquired. Investments over five years to modernize the firms are expected to reach 1.5 billion reais, Oliveira said. Energisa said after the auction that it now owns 11 power distribution companies in Brazil. Eletrobras has now sold five power distribution companies, mostly money-losing units. It sold earlier Celg and Cepisa.

2018-08-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday to the highest in more than a month, extending gains on growing evidence of disruptions to crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and after a fall in U.S. inventories. Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose 63 cents a barrel to settle at $77.77. U.S. crude CLc1 settled 74 cents higher at $70.25 a barrel, after earlier hitting a session high of $70.50. Both contracts were at their highest in more than one month. A rally that started earlier in the day accelerated as U.S. crude rose above $70 a barrel, and more speculators entered the market, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. “There are pretty good tailwinds here that will keep people jumping on board,” he said. Brent’s wide premium to WTI is likely to encourage exports of U.S. crude, keeping U.S. inventories lower and boosting activity following weekly inventory data, he said.  Brent has risen by almost 10 percent over the past two weeks on widespread perceptions that the global oil market is tightening and could run short in the next few months as U.S. sanctions restrict crude exports from Iran. “There are a lot of supportive factors here,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  In addition to support from geopolitical events, natural disasters could impact the market if a potential storm system currently off the coast of Africa strengthens and heads to the Gulf of Mexico, he said. “The oil market is once again tightening,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at Swiss bank UBS in Zurich. “Iranian oil export declines are already visible well in advance of U.S. oil-related sanctions, which enter into force in November.” Iranian crude exports are likely to drop to a little more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, against a peak of 3.1 million bpd in April, as importers bow to American pressure to cut orders. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in which Iran is the third-biggest producer, will discuss in December whether it can compensate for a sudden drop in Iranian supply after sanctions start in November, the head of Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said on Wednesday. Crude exports from crisis-struck OPEC member Venezuela have also fallen sharply, halving in recent years to about 1 million bpd. For the graphic on Venezuela crude oil exports png, click tmsnrt.rs/2LvCPtl Official U.S. oil inventory data on Wednesday also helped the bullish trend. U.S. commercial crude inventories USOILC=ECB fell by a larger than expected 2.6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 24, to 405.79 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S] U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA was flat from the previous week's record of 11 million bpd.The market pared gains slightly after information provider Genscape said inventories at the delivery hub at Cushing, Oklahoma had risen 101,433 barrels since Aug. 24, traders said.   For the graphic on  U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels png, click tmsnrt.rs/2OKP4nJ The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned of a tightening market toward the end of the year because of falling supply in countries such as Iran and Venezuela combined with strong demand, especially in Asia. “Definitely there are some worries that oil markets can tighten towards the end of this year,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters on Wednesday. BNP Paribas global oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian highlighted a combination of supply risks. “As Iranian oil exports are lost to the market, Venezuelan production continues to decline, Angola struggles to maintain output and Libya is subject to episodic outages,” he told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. “The path of least resistance (for prices), at least in our view, is up.”  Still, the market could face renewed headwinds from uncertainty about growth in emerging markets, said Again Capital’s Kilduff. “What’s been holding us back is demand concerns. We thought Argentina was put to bed and it is a detracting factor.” Argentina’s central bank on Thursday yanked up its benchmark interest rate to 60 percent from 45 percent in a bid to control inflation running at more than 31 percent as the country’s currency plummeted 15.6 percent to a record low 39 pesos per U.S. dollar.

2018-08-30,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has remained within the main restrictions on its nuclear activities imposed by a 2015 deal with major powers, a confidential report by the U.N. atomic watchdog indicated on Thursday. In its second quarterly report since President Donald Trump announced in May that the United States would quit the accord and reimpose sanctions, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had stayed within the caps on uranium enrichment levels, enriched uranium stocks and other items. In its last report in May, the IAEA had said Iran could do more to cooperate with inspectors and thereby “enhance confidence”, but stopped short of saying the Islamic Republic had given it cause for concern. Thursday’s report to member states seen by Reuters contained similar language. It said the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog was able to carry out all so-called complementary access inspections needed to verify Iran’s compliance with the deal. “Timely and proactive cooperation by Iran in providing such access facilitates implementation of the Additional Protocol and enhances confidence,” said the report, which was distributed to IAEA member states. “The production rate (of enriched uranium) is constant. There is no change whatsoever,” a senior diplomat added.     With the United States reimposing its sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear deal, many diplomats and analysts now doubt that the accord will survive despite European Union efforts to counter some of the effects of Trump’s move. Sticking to the nuclear accord is not the only way forward for Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday. “Being the party to still honour the deal in deeds & not just words is not Iran’s only option,” he said on Twitter. Speaking after the IAEA report was sent to the agency’s member states, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the deal was still holding, despite the U.S. withdrawal.  He urged his fellow ministers, who met in Vienna on Thursday to discuss EU policy on Iran, to do more to protect Tehran from U.S. sanctions, calling for “permanent financial mechanisms that allow Iran to continue to trade”.  The EU implemented a law this month to shield European companies from the impact of U.S. sanctions on Tehran and has approved aid for the Iranian private sector, although large European companies are pulling out of Iran. Adhering to the deal should bring Iran economic benefits, Zarif said. “If preserving (the) JCPOA (the deal) is the goal, then there is no escape from mustering the courage to comply with commitment to normalize Iran’s economic relations instead of making extraneous demands,” Zarif wrote on Twitter. On Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei cast doubt on the ability of EU countries to save the agreement and said Tehran might abandon it. Khamenei told President Hassan Rouhani not to rely too much on European support as he came under increased pressure at home over his handling of the economy in the face of U.S. sanctions, with key ministers under attack by parliament. Le Drian, whose country signed the Iran deal along with Britain, Germany, China, Russia and the United States under then-President Barack Obama, said Tehran should be ready to negotiate on its future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen. Those issues were not covered by the 2015 deal and Trump has cited this as a major reason for pulling Washington out of it.  Le Drian said Iran, which says its missiles are only for defence, was arming regional allies with rockets and allowing “ballistic proliferation,” adding: “Iran needs to avoid the temptation to be the (regional) hegemon.” Iran has ruled out negotiations on its ballistic missiles and broader Middle Eastern role.

2018-08-30,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Canadian court on Thursday overturned approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, ruling that Ottawa failed to adequately consider aboriginal concerns, in a blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s efforts to balance environmental and economic issues.  Trudeau’s government agreed in May to buy the pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd for C$4.5 billion ($3.46 billion), betting it would win the court battle and expand Trans Mountain despite fierce political and environmental opposition. The decision also hurts Canada’s oil producers, who say the expanded pipeline is needed to address bottlenecks that have sharply reduced prices for their crude. Shares fell on the decision. The Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the National Energy Board (NEB) regulator wrongly narrowed its review of the project to exclude related tanker traffic. Additionally, the federal government failed to adequately consult First Nations, as required by law, it ruled. “The big takeaway is the duty to consult (indigenous people) is still the most important step in any major project,” said Andrew Leach, associate professor of business economics at the  University of Alberta.  Trudeau has portrayed himself as a friend to aboriginal people and tried to build national support for a carbon emissions reduction plan, even while backing Trans Mountain to support the oil industry. “It’s quite a slap to the government by the court on the grounds of reconciliation with First Nations,” said Kathryn Harrison, a professor of political science at the University of British Columbia. “They’ve committed billions of dollars in taxpayers’ funds, doubling down on a project that the courts have just quashed.” Trudeau’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, said the government remains “absolutely committed” to building the project, adding the sale could close as early as Friday. “We know that we must diversify our economy and our markets for resources, and that’s why it was important” to buy the pipeline, Morneau told reporters in Toronto. In a statement, Kinder Morgan Canada President Ian Anderson said the court ruling was not a condition of the pipeline’s sale to Ottawa. He said the project is suspending construction. Kinder Morgan Canada shareholders voted on Thursday to approve the pipeline’s sale to Ottawa.  Canada has the option to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court but Morneau said the government had made no decisions and needs time to study the ruling. An appeal to the higher court would drag out the project at least another couple of years, Harrison said.   “Thankfully, the court has stepped in where Canada has failed to protect and respect our rights and our water,” Coldwater Indian Band Chief Lee Spahan said in a statement. “Our members will be hugely relieved.” The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Edmonton, Alberta, to a port in the Vancouver area for export. It was approved by the federal government in 2016.  The court’s ruling is likely to amplify sentiments expressed by oil producers, such as Suncor Energy Inc, that they would hold off on further major investments in Canada’s oil patch until regulatory challenges abated. Shares of Canadian oil producers fell in Toronto, led lower by heavy oil producers MEG Energy Corp and Athabasca Oil Corp, which are especially hurt by price discounts connected to clogged pipelines. Further delays will harm Canada’s economy by limiting access to global markets, said Al Reid, executive vice-president of oil producer Cenovus Energy Inc.  Renewed doubts about Trans Mountain place greater importance for Canada’s oil industry on two other pipeline projects. Enbridge Inc is rebuilding Line 3 from Alberta to a hub in Wisconsin, while TransCanada Corp is considering construction of Keystone XL from Alberta to Nebraska.

2018-08-30,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT) expects stronger financial results in the third quarter thanks to higher refining margins, it said on Thursday. Hellenic, which runs three refineries and exports more than half its output, reported an 18 percent drop in second-quarter core profit. Lower refining margins, a stronger euro against the dollar, provisions for carbon emission rights and maintenance costs for two of its refineries weighed on profits. But conditions have been improving in the third quarter.  “Clearly, third quarter margins have been very strong,” Deputy Chief Executive Officer Andreas Shiamishis told an analysts call. “We have been able to run the refineries at very high utilisation rates which means we would expect to see a very strong third quarter at the end of September,” he added. Iranian crude oil has been a major source of supply for Hellenic but the refiner has stopped any purchases from the country since June after the United States imposed sanctions on Tehran, Shiamishis said. Hellenic was replacing it with other sources, including Europe and Saudi Arabia, without any material financial impact. The refiner reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for oil inventory holdings, of 187 million euros (167.99 million pounds) in April to June, down from 228 million euros in the same period a year earlier. Its shares trade at 7.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, compared with 17.5 times for rival Neste (NESTE.HE) and 13.7 times for Saras (SRS.MI).

Stock markets and major government bond yields have risen in recent weeks on hopes that a global trade war can be averted, particularly with the leaders of the United States and Canada optimistic they could reach a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by Friday. Investor sentiment darkened, however, on the prospect that U.S. tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods may likely take effect in late September. “I think this is an environment in which, if not for trade news, then we would be trading higher and we have seen that with the bumps in the Mexico trade talks,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. Argentina’s peso again tumbled. The country’s central bank on Thursday hoisted its benchmark interest rate by 15 percentage points in a bid to control rampant inflation after the peso plummeted to a record low 39 per U.S. dollar. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, is studying a request from Argentina to speed up disbursement from a $50 billion loan program. Turkey’s lira was also pressured anew after reports that Turkish central bank deputy governor and ratesetter Erkan Kilimci is leaving the bank. Earlier this month, the country’s currency crisis sent the lira plunging to a record low against the U.S. dollar and sparked concerns about emerging markets investments. U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday morning after a measure of underlying inflation hit the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for the third time this year. The year-on-year increase in the core PCE - the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding the volatile food and energy components - rose 0.2 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in June. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 111.9 points, or 0.43 percent, to 26,012.67, the S&P 500 lost 8.55 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,905.49 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.86 points, or 0.13 percent, to 8,098.83. The dollar index rose 0.26 percent, with the euro down 0.5 percent to $1.1647. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.8658 percent, down from 2.882 percent late on Wednesday. Earlier, Asian stocks lost gains as signs emerged that tariffs are beginning to hurt the Chinese economy. A Reuters poll showed activity among China’s manufacturers probably slowed for the third straight month in August. European shares followed suit on concerns over the effects on trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, including reduced Chinese demand for exports. A pan-European stock index dropped 0.3 percent, knocking the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, off a five-month high. The MSCI world equity index was last down 0.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 1.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng ended 0.9 percent lower. U.S. crude rose 0.3 percent to $69.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.65, up 0.25 percent on the day, as U.S. crude inventories dropped and Iranian crude shipments fell because of U.S. sanctions.

2018-08-30,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Par Pacific Holdings Inc (PARR.N) shares jumped 17 percent on Thursday after the refiner said it would acquire assets from its rival in Hawaii and expand its fuels production. The Houston-based company’s shares were at $21.12 in mid-morning trading, up $3.18 from the previous day’s close after rival Island Energy Services on Wednesday disclosed it would halt its refining operations on the island.  “This is clearly good news for Hawaii’s only other refinery,” analysts at investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt  said in a note on Thursday.  Par said in a conference call on Thursday it would pay $45 million in cash and stock to buy assets from Island Energy. The acquisition will allow Par to expand processing capacity at its Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery by about 28 percent to 120,000 barrels per day (bpd).  Par will add Island Energy’s atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation units to its Kapolei refinery, which has a current capacity of 93,500 bpd.  The company said it would spend $30 million from cash on hand and $15 million in shares to finance the purchase, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.  Par also will spend between $8 million and $10 million to integrate pipelines. “We will be able to run those units the day we close,” Par Pacific Holdings Chief Executive William Pate said on Thursday’s conference call.  Par also plans to lease terminals and pipelines from Island Energy, which will shift its focus to storage and logistics. Island owns refined products distribution pipelines around terminals near Hilo, Honolulu, Kahului and Port Allen, Hawaii. Because Par is not adding gasoline-producing units, its product mix will continue to be 50 percent diesel and will have less need to import motor fuels to Hawaii.  Par will spend $10 million for an overhaul of the Hawaii refinery in 2019, the company said.  The addition of the Island Energy units will better position Par to take advantage of the switch to lower sulfur marine fuels in 2020 mandated by the International Maritime Organization, a move that is expected to boost margins. Atmospheric crude distillation units do the primary refining of crude oil and provide feedstock for all other units. They operate at atmospheric pressure. Vacuum distillation units refine residual crude from atmospheric distillation units and increase the yield of motor fuel feedstock obtained from a barrel of oil.

2018-08-30,"(Adds quotes, background) By Nerijus Adomaitis STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm Aker Energy will delay submitting a plan for development of its block off Ghana until early next year to allow time to complete appraisal drilling, expected to start in October, its chief executive said on Thursday. The unlisted firm, controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, bought a 50-percent stake in Ghana’s Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points (DWT/CTP) block from Hess for $100 million in February. Aker had initially intended to summit a development plan in the second half of 2018, but has since changed its mind. “The forecast now is to start drilling in October ... Our goal is to identify the oil/water contact to update the reservoir model,” Chief Executive Jan Arve Haugan told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy conference. Aker Energy plans to make a final investment decision and to submit a field development plan to Ghanaian authorities early next year, with production seen starting in late-2021 or early 2022, Haugan said. The plan involves developing around 400 million barrels of oil by using a floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). “We believe that we should be able to increase the volumes further, but that depends on the recovery rate and on the possibility to tie in nearby discoveries,” Haugan said. The volumes in place are estimated to be more than a billion barrels, he added. The company has signed a letter of intent to use Maersk Drilling’s Maersk Viking drillship, which was previously employed by Exxon Mobil and is currently located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Haugan said. Executives of Aker, which has a 50 percent stake in Aker Energy, have previously compared the Ghanaian field to Norway’s Arctic Johan Castberg field in terms of break-even costs. Norway’s Equinor, operator of Johan Castberg, estimates the field’s break-even price at below $35 a barrel. “That’s not achievable as we speak, but we are working hard to bring down the costs,” Haugan said about the Ghanaian field. Aker Energy holds 50 percent in the DWT/CTP block, Lukoil has 38 percent, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation 10 percent and Fuel Trade 2 percent. Aker Energy could eventually become publicly listed, but there are no firm plans to do so, Haugan said.

2018-08-30,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Senate leader, Bukola Saraki, said on Thursday he would stand to become the main opposition candidate in 2019’s presidential elections, making him the highest profile challenger to incumbent Muhammadu Buhari to date. Saraki, who trained as a medical doctor, said the economy of Africa’s largest oil producer was “broken and in need of urgent revival”. He will now vie with other candidates, including former vice president Atiku Abubakar, to represent the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and a group of other opposition movements, who agreed in July to field a joint contender. “GDP growth rate has declined. Diversification remains an illusion. Unemployment is at an all-time high. Businesses are shutting down. Jobs are being lost in record numbers, and the capital needed to jumpstart our economy is going elsewhere,” Saraki said at a political event in the capital Abuja. Saraki, the Senate President, quit Buhari’s All Progressive Congress in July to rejoin the PDP amid other signs of splintering in the ruling party. The former state governor is currently Nigeria’s third most senior political figure, after the president and the vice president. Fighting within the APC coalition, which united to unseat Buhari’s predecessor rather than because of ideological unity, has mounted for years in a struggle for power and influence between those loyal to the head of state and others who say they have been targeted in a witch-hunt by the presidency. Divisions emerged publicly in the weeks following the APC’s conference in June where new party leaders were elected. Others saw their hopes of greater powers within the party dashed just months before the presidential and legislative elections.

2018-08-30,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Maersk Tankers is testing the use of wind power to fuel its ships, a new technology it says can cut fuel consumption by up to 10 percent and help the industry reduce polluting emissions. The move comes as the global shipping industry is suffering from rising oil prices and preparing for fuel costs to rise further by around a quarter, or some $24 billion, in 2020 when new rules limiting sulfur kick in. The company has installed two 30-metre tall metal cylinders on board the Maersk Pelican, a Long Range 2 (LR2) product tanker vessel. The cylinders, or rotor sails, work as mechanical sails that spin to propel the vessel forward. The Maersk Pelican will depart Rotterdam on Thursday for a test journey. If successful, Maersk Tankers, which shipping giant Maersk sold last year to its controlling shareholder and Japan’s Mitsui & Co for 1.71 billion, plans to install the cylinders on half its 164 vessels. The company did not specify what savings could amount to, but said an LR2 vessel on average uses around 35 tonnes of shipping fuel per day.  At the current price of high sulfur fuel of around $420 per ton, that would amount to yearly savings of as much as $365,000 if the vessel sails 250 days a year.  The change in regulations in 2020 forces a portion of the world’s fleet to switch to lower sulfur, but higher cost, fuels such as marine gasoil (MGO) and ultra low sulfur fuel oil. The total global shipping fuel bill is roughly $100 billion a year, consultants Wood Mackenzie estimated in April. Maersk Pelican is the third vessel to have the rotor sail technology installed. Norsepower, which delivered the technology, first installed it on a small cargo ship in 2014 and on a ferry sailing between Sweden and Finland in April this year.

2018-08-30,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan parliament voted on Thursday to retain the cap on commercial interest rates which the International Monetary Fund has insisted must be scrapped or modified in return for a new standby arrangement. In a response to emailed questions, Jan Mikkelsen, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Kenya, said they were aware of the passing of the finance bill and were currently assessing the implications for the IMF-supported program.    Kenyan lawmakers also voted to delay a proposed 16 percent tax on petroleum products for two more years, citing the high cost of living - a move that will be a blow to government efforts to raise revenues through higher taxes.  The rate cap, introduced in September 2016, was aimed at helping small traders access capital at affordable rates, but has had the opposite effect, with banks saying they cannot price risk to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) properly while the cap is in place. As a result, lending to the private sector fell from 9.3 percent in 2016 to 2.4 percent last year. “Many thousands of Kenyans have been unable to access bank lending and have turned to more expensive borrowing,” said Aly Khan Satchu, a Nairobi-based independent trader and analyst. President Uhuru Kenyatta said in April that he recognised the limitation of the law and hoped that the finance bill would  remove the cap that he said had ended up hurting the financial sector.[L8N1RU5NS]    The legislation still needs to secure presidential assent, and it was not clear what line Kenyatta would now take. “The president will have to crack the whip, and hard, because notwithstanding some bravado chatter, it would not make sense to lose the support of the IMF at a time when the markets are so skittish and our debt-to-GDP ratio is nudging 60 percent,” Satchu said. Some bank stocks at the Nairobi Securities Exchange edged lower on Thursday, after the bill was passed.  “It was not widely expected, people were banking on repeal of the interest cap,” said Sheema Shah, equities dealer at Apex Africa. “It’s still a buy, the current sell-off is temporary ... mostly it’s the foreign investors who are heavy on that particular stock who are selling off.”  In June, Finance Minister Henry Rotich proposed repealing the interest rate cap, a move cheered by bankers. But lawmakers have continued to insist they are not ready to remove the upper limit of commercial lending rates at 4 percentage points above the central bank rate. Lawmakers did, however, remove the minimum deposit rate of 70 percent of the central bank rate. The IMF has demanded the cap be repealed as a condition for Kenya to access its balance of payments support. Kenya secured a six-month extension for its stand-by credit arrangement of $989.8 million from the fund in March, and is seeking another extension when it expires in mid-September.[L8N1QW05W] Jibran Qureishi, an economist for East Africa at Stanbic Bank, said the decision threw open the question of how discussions with the IMF would now proceed. “On the IMF, with the VAT on fuel being postponed, with most of the tax measures not approved, this means the fiscal deficit is likely to remain higher than projected,” Qureishi said. “The odds of the (IMF) facility being retained are quite slim, but we have to see what will happen.”    Kenya’s legislature also rejected a “Robin Hood” tax of 0.05 percent on bank transfers of over 500,000 shillings ($5,000) during Thursday’s session and an employee contribution scheme towards the national housing development fund.  The rejected tax hikes were designed to fund a range of government development goals including universal healthcare and affordable housing.[L8N1UG3MC] Additional reporting by George Obulutsa; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Omar Mohammed and Andrew Bolton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-economy/update-3-kenyas-parliament-approves-retaining-interest-rate-cap-against-imf-wishes-idUKL8N1VL2X4,30 Aug 2018,"The Kenyan parliament voted on

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday it was considering doubling a 5 pence (six cents) charge for single-use plastic bags and extending it to all shops. Since October 2015, large retailers in England have been legally required to impose the charge, a measure which the government says has seen plastic bag sales in England’s seven biggest supermarkets drop by 86 percent. The government will launch a consultation later this year setting out plans to increase the charge to 10 pence and extend its reach. Small-and-medium-sized businesses are estimated to supply more than three billion plastic bags each year, it said. “We have taken huge strides to improve the environment, and the charge on plastic bags in supermarkets and big retailers has demonstrated the difference we can achieve by making small changes to our everyday habits,” Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement. “I want to leave a greener, healthier environment for future generations, but with plastic in the sea still set to treble we know we need to do more to better protect our oceans and eliminate this harmful waste.” Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-politics-plastic/britain-to-consider-doubling-charge-on-single-use-plastic-bags-idUKL8N1VL50S,30 Aug 2018,"The British government said on

2018-08-30,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Nyhamna gas processing plant, which feeds Britain with gas through the North Sea’s biggest pipeline, may rely on power from local industries as a backup to its fragile electricity supply, grid operator Statnett told Reuters. Nyhamna is one of Norway’s biggest gas processing plants, requiring a stable and plentiful supply of electricity. Power supply has been a recurrent problem and the plant has had to shut down production due to outages in recent years, sometimes affecting gas supply to Britain. The processing capacity of the plant, which handles gas from Norway’s Ormen Lange field, will be raised to 84 million cubic meters (mcm) per day by October, to start accommodating output from the Aasta Hansteen field. The power-hungry plant is connected only by a single transmission line to Norway’s grid, and processing more gas will only add to concerns about the fragility of its power link. Operator Gassco and the country’s grid Statnett have negotiated for years about how to reinforce the power supply to Nyhamna, and more importantly who will pay for it, without results so far. “They (Gassco) are considering a cooperation with local industries, to have reserves as a short-term measure,” Statnett’s Chief Financial Officer Knut Hundhammer told Reuters. Statnett had earlier expressed concerns over the security of supply to Nyhamna, which it described as “below the desired level” in the risk segment of its mid-year report. “Some industries are much more flexible than Nyhamna and they can provide capacity to the plant if needed,” Hundhammer said, declining to name the companies. Cooperation with local industry would give Nyhamna a fallback option if power to the plant was cut or reduced. Hundhammer said the industries that may supply Nyhamna in case of need get their supply from other power lines, so their electricity flow would not be disrupted if Nyhamna’s link suffered an outage. A Gassco spokeswoman said different measures were being considered, and costs and usefulness were always part of those assessments. “At Nyhamna, Gassco is seeking opportunities in reinforcements in the regional grid, as well as other measures,” she said. The Nyhamna plant sits on an island near the mainland town of Molde, with local businesses including furniture makers, oil services companies, producers of building materials and auto parts firms. Some distance further away, at the town of Sunndalsoera, Norway’s largest power consumer Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) has Europe’s largest aluminium plant with annual capacity of well over 400,000 metric tons of metal. Α Norsk Hydro spokesman said that even though the firm hasn’t been approached, cooperation on power security was feasible. “Security of power supply is important for both our plant and Nyhamna... We could find a solution that is mutually beneficial,” he said. Statnett and Gassco were still working on options to enhance power supply at Nyhamna for the long-term but Hundhammer declined to elaborate on when that would be and how much it would cost, as the negotiations are ongoing.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Environmental campaigners launched a boat on the River Thames on Thursday made almost entirely of recycled plastic waste, in an effort to raise awareness of growing levels of rubbish in Britain’s waterways. The 12-seater punt was built by Mark Edwards, who also made the Gloriana barge for Queen Elizabeth’s 2012 diamond jubilee. Named the “PET Project,” the boat will run regular trips along the river to fish out plastic rubbish, which in turn will be used to build more such vessels. Edwards used traditional techniques to make the boat. “We went back to the technology inherited from the Vikings,” he told reporters at the launch in Richmond, southwest London. “It took us two men, about six weeks flat out, so it’s quite a lot of work ... but for a craft that’s going to last 100 years it’s nothing.” Each year 300 tonnes of rubbish is cleared from the Thames and a large proportion of it is food and drink packaging that comes from dry land, says the environmental charity Hubbub which is behind the project.  It adds on its website: “Much of the litter is being eaten by birds, fish and other species which is leading to 70 percent of Thames fish found to have plastic in their gut.” PET project is Hubbub’s second boat made of recycled plastic waste.  “I think this ... shows that plastic is not just an issue that’s in far away oceans - it’s present here in London and actually there’s lots we can all do about it,” said its director Gavin Ellis.  “It’s about making sure you don’t put litter in an overflowing bin where it can blow out into the river and it’s obviously about not dropping litter directly into the river.” Reporting by Saeed Haque; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-recycling-boat/campaigners-launch-uk-boat-made-of-recycled-plastic-waste-idUKL8N1VL4U4,30 Aug 2018,"Environmental campaigners

2018-08-30,"NEW DELHI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - India’s state railways on Thursday signed a preliminary deal with gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd to use natural gas in some of its operations, part of a drive by the world’s third biggest oil consumer to gradually shift to cleaner fuels. India is building infrastructure, including pipelines and import facilities, to raise the share of gas in its energy mix to 15 percent in next few years from the current level of about 6.5 percent. Using natural gas will be about 25 percent cheaper than the alternatives fuels used by the railways at workshops and production units, said Ashwani Lohani, chairman of Indian Railways’ board. He said the company would strive to shift all 54 of its workshops to natural gas by June 2019. Indian Railways annually consumes about 3 billion litres of diesel, said Chetram, chief administrative officer of Indian Railways Organisation for Alternate fuels. Only a fraction of that will be replaced by natural gas, he added. He said Indian Railways can replace 844,027 cubic metres of acetylene, 2.35 million kilograms of liquefied petroleum gas and 140,991 kilograms of cut gases to save 170 million rupees  ($2.4 million) a year. “The objective of this memorandum of understanding is, on a pan-India basis, wherever we have reach, we will be supplying natural gas to the Indian Railways,” said B.C.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - An overhang of homeless crude in the Atlantic Basin has halved in recent weeks, suggesting oil traders are bracing for a further supply loss from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and a new rally in prices. Iran’s oil exports are already dropping fast as refiners scurry to find alternatives ahead of a reimposition of U.S. sanctions in early November, which in turn has helped drain a glut of unsold oil. The millions of unsold barrels of crude that had pooled around northwest Europe, the Mediterranean and West Africa over July and August are rapidly draining. A months-long surplus in the West African market that depressed prices to their lowest in months has almost vanished. Traders had said just one week ago that leftover crude from the August and September loading schedules amounted to some 30 cargoes, equivalent to an average 930,000 barrels per day (bpd).  Now, that overhang has dwindled to a handful of unsold cargoes, while demand for October-loading Angolan oil, the favored West African grades for Chinese refiners, has been even more robust than that for September.  “The overall situation ... is that U.S. sanctions toward Iran are now increasingly kicking in, which will help to dry up the physical crude oil market and place it back into solid backwardation,” SEB head of commodities Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note this week. “This will shift the front end Brent crude oil price into the higher $70s range with a touch of $80s.” GRAPHIC: Surplus of unsold WAF crude cargoes dwindles - reut.rs/2LGD9FK The belief that supply will fall short of demand is reflected in the futures market when the price of a prompt-dated contract rises above that of a longer-dated one, a situation known as backwardation. With a little over nine weeks until possibly more than 1 million bpd of Iranian supply is off the market, Brent futures are now at their closest to backwardation in almost a month, leaving the front-month October contract LCOc1 just 35 cents below November LCOc2, nearly half what it was in late July. Concern over oil demand, particularly in China, has been put to rest, for now at least.  Consumption by China’s independent refiners, or teapots, has picked up sharply in August to around 1.4 million bpd, up 40 percent from near-record lows in July, as plants return from prolonged summer maintenance. Shipments of West African crude to Asia generally have hit record highs of 2.59 million bpd in August, thanks in large part to Indian demand, while European refineries’ appetite for crudes similar to Iran’s has pushed the price of Russian Urals to its highest in nine months.  “Looking at the spreads, it’s starting to appear as if the market is somewhat tightening. The West African overhang has disappeared, so it looks as though that ramp-up in OPEC output in June and July is starting to be eaten into,” ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said. A number of major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, are boosting output, after having agreed to cut by up to 1.8 million bpd since January 2017, to fill any gaps in supply left by the sanctions and prevent demand-damaging price spikes. In Europe, the North Sea market is still suffering from a surplus of crude that grew so large earlier in August that traders resorted to keeping it on tankers, arguably the most expensive storage option.  GRAPHIC: Crude oil in floating storage around the Atlantic Basin - reut.rs/2MY6iRs This pool is finally shrinking. According to Reuters data, some 16 million barrels of oil are still in floating storage around northwest Europe and the Mediterranean, including North Sea crudes such as Forties and Ekofisk, Saudi Arab Light, Algerian Saharan, Russian Urals, U.S. shale and West African grades such as Nigerian Bonny Light and Ghanaian Jubilee. But this is down from nearly 20 million a few days ago. Even though oil supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may grow next year, output from Venezuela, Mexico and Angola continues to decline and other big exporters like Libya and Nigeria are prone to disruption.  Add to that years of underinvestment as a result of an oil price that struggled below $50 a barrel, and some big investors believe the market is ripe for a rally.

2018-08-30,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - The surging costs of carbon permits have caused some of Europe’s biggest utilities to lock in purchases in advance, while nuclear and hydro firms are benefiting from the knock-on effect on power prices. Carbon permits traded under the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) have become the best performing commodity this year, almost trebling in price to over 21 euros (18.86 pounds) a tonne since January on the back of stronger energy prices and measures to reduce supply. The ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis which dragged prices down to lows of 2-3 euros a tonne. Now at 10-year highs, stronger carbon prices make it more expensive for European utilities to burn fossil fuels, encouraging a shift to cleaner energy sources. Prices are expected to keep rising, according to a Reuters survey of analysts last month. Market participants can hedge their exposure to rising prices by buying enough carbon permits when the price is low to cover their future emissions output. If they have a surplus, they can sell them back to the market and make a profit when the price rises. If they don’t have enough, they would have to buy more at a higher price.  “Higher carbon prices mean higher costs for all European utilities, unless of course they hedged or stockpiled allowances,” said French energy consultant Hibault Laconde. One such company is coal-heavy German generator RWE (RWEG.DE), which said it had protected itself against power price volatility by selling fuels, as opposed to selling power production, and simultaneously buying enough emissions permits. “Our CO2 position is already financially hedged until the end of 2022 and we have also taken steps beyond 2022,” chief financial officer Markus Krebber said during recent half-year earnings calls with analysts. Coal plants have benefited for years from low carbon prices which kept operational costs down.  Many old German coal plants could be operated at low overheads and they were the price setters in the wholesale market for thermal generation. RWE’s hedging strategy involves nuclear and brown coal-generated power being sold usually up to three years in advance and hard coal and gas-fired ones closer to production. Rival Uniper (UN01.DE) said it sold the bulk of its hydroelectric output next year. The rise in carbon prices will force inefficient coal plants out of the market, chief financial officer Christopher Delbrueck said this week. Berlin-based Aurora Energy Research said German producers of coal from locally-mined lignite, a heavily polluting brown coal, such as Leag, EPH and RWE, had reason to worry. The carbon price rise to 21 euros from 6 euros a year ago could have produced additional costs of 2.3 billion euros, according to Aurora analyst Hanns Koenig. In coal-reliant Poland, the country’s four major state producers are historically heavily exposed to coal generation. Tauron’s chief executive has called the EU carbon price a quasi-ecological tax. “This is not a comfortable situation for us. Because of the CO2 policy, energy could become a luxury good,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP at the weekend. For companies producing electricity from low-carbon nuclear and hydroelectric plants, higher carbon prices are welcomed. The wholesale price of power reflects the cost of buying carbon permits and fuels. Coal and gas prices have risen this year due to Chinese demand, a cold winter and a heatwave across Europe. The benchmark German power price is at a six-and-a-half year high. France’s EDF (EDF.PA), which has a generation fleet made up of 77 percent nuclear and 10 percent renewables, should produce more competitive electricity in interconnected European markets. “The higher CO2 prices are a huge jackpot for EDF as they drive up wholesale power market prices ... This is the case for all nuclear and hydro power producers,” said Nicolas Goldberg, energy specialist at Colombus Consulting. A spokesman for Swedish utility Vattenfall said price rises supported its strategy of becoming less reliant on fossil fuels. “If current price developments continue, we expect a gradual decrease in profitability of coal-fired assets. However, our diversified portfolio with a significant (combined heat and power) share is rather robust to such developments,” he added. Germany’s Uniper, which has inherited the thermal and hydro plants of former parent E.ON (EONGn.DE), said it had  factored in significant price increases for carbon, coal and gas-fired power in the coming years. “That will give our earnings a boost from 2020/21,” CFO Delbrueck said. Germany’s E.ON is focussing on low-carbon power, grids and retail activities, and is left with nuclear power production only in Germany and Sweden, where it also operates hydropower. Czech nuclear, coal and renewable generator CEZ (CEZP.PR) has sold over 77 percent of its expected 2019 output, benefiting from a higher share of nuclear than pure coal generators. Some analysts say a carbon price around 20-30 euros could encourage more utilities to switch to lower carbon fuels.  Gas-fired power generation becomes more competitive at a carbon price of round 20 euros a tonne.  However, margins for gas-fired plants are still mostly negative, despite a cleaner carbon record, as high oil and gas prices mean high purchasing costs for generators vis-à-vis coal. Uniper’s Delbrueck said it should be closer to 30 euros to get a stronger fuel switch.

2018-08-30,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said only half of its VW branded passenger car models in Germany are compliant with a new pollution standard, thanks to a much tougher emissions testing regime.  Cars in the European Union must comply with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) from September, but Volkswagen has only gained regulatory clearance for seven of its 14 main model lines. “The new tests are more cumbersome and take two to three times longer than in the past, even limited edition models need to be tested separately,” Volkswagen’s Thomas Zahn said in a call with journalists on Thursday. “The coming months will be challenging for us,” said Zahn, head of sales and marketing for Volkswagen passenger cars. Volkswagen’s top-selling Golf model is among the vehicles still waiting to be cleared by authorities, Zahn said. He said he expected the Golf to pass the WLTP standards by the end of September. Shipments of cars are expected to slow down in September and October, but pick up again in the final two months of the year. “We expect very strong deliveries in December,” Zahn said. Carmakers including Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Volkswagen and supplier Valeo (VLOF.PA) have cut profit expectations, blaming a slowdown in global sales triggered in part by delays getting vehicles certified to the new standard. Analysts at Evercore ISI said the WLTP delays at the VW brand appear to be under control since the carmaker has not resorted to heavy discounting to keep sales flowing.  Nonetheless delays will cause profitability of the brand to drop to around 2 percent in the third quarter, from 5.5 percent in the second quarter, Evercore said in a note on Thursday.

2018-08-30,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China steel futures vs iron ore futures: tmsnrt.rs/2PfEcyv By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 30 (Reuters) - It’s been a long time coming but Chinese steel prices are finally showing signs of running out of steam, with futures having dropped for six straight sessions. The Shanghai Futures Exchange benchmark rebar contract closed at 4,160 yuan ($605) a tonne on Wednesday, having retreated from the seven-year high of 4,418 yuan a tonne, reached on Aug. 22. The recent declines point to an increasing tug-of-war between still robust margins for steel makers and the likelihood of slowing demand growth in China, which produces about half of the world’s steel. Steel futures gained about 29 percent from the end of last year to their recent peak, as Chinese mills enjoyed some of the strongest profits in years. Output curbs related to efforts to control pollution and the cutting of older, less efficient capacity, has boosted the industry’s fortunes. Improving profits have allowed steel mills to boost production by employing higher grade iron ore as a feedstock, which has the added benefit of requiring less coking coal per unit of steel produced. The result has been record output, with China producing a fourth straight monthly high in July of 81.24 million tonnes, according to official statistics. Year-to-date output to end-July grew 6.3 percent compared with the previous year to 532.85 million tonnes, as profit margins reached around 1,100 yuan a tonne, according to analysts from Huatai Futures. While it’s logical to expect steel mills to maximise production when profit margins are elevated, there is some concern as to where all the steel is going. The key construction sectors appear to still be enjoying strong activity, but perhaps not enough to justify a 6.3 percent increase in output. Other steel-consuming sectors, such as appliance and goods manufacturing and car making are in a similar position. Exports of steel products have been trending lower this year, with shipments of products in the first seven months of the year slipping 13.6 percent to 41.3 million tonnes. The escalating trade dispute with the United States, and imposition of duties by other countries on Chinese steel means exports are unlikely to return to growth any time soon. Visible inventories have been largely steady in recent weeks, but are still well down on levels earlier in the year, with data from consultancy SteelHome showing rebar stocks SH-TOT-RBARINV at 4.12 million tonnes in the week to Aug. 24, less than half the peak in early March. With mounting concern about a cooling in the Chinese economy in the second half of the year, the risk is rising that steel’s stellar run must be coming to an end. This should also have a desultory effect on iron ore as well, which has spent the past five months trading in a fairly narrow range. Ore with a 62 percent iron content, the main benchmark, ended at $65.35 a tonne on Wednesday, according to prices assessed by Argus Media MT-IO-QIN62=ARG. This means the steel-making ingredient has lost about 11.7 percent so far this year, although it should be noted that higher grade ore has performed better. Argus assessed 65 percent iron ore at $94.40 a tonne on Wednesday, which is up 3 percent so far this year. Low-grade iron ore has also declined more than the benchmark, with consultancy CuSteel citing 58 percent ore from India CUS-IF5800-IORE at a price of 245 yuan ($35.90) a tonne on Wednesday, down 12.5 percent from the end of last year. The outperformance of higher grade iron ore does confirm that China’s steel mills have been using better quality ore to maximise output and lower emissions. But it is also the case that they have still been importing significant volumes of lower grade ore. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Thomson Reuters shows that Australia, which supplies mainly 62 percent and lower-grade 58 percent iron ore, has managed to boost its share of China’s imports to 67.4 percent for the first eight months of the year, compared with 66.1 percent for the same period in 2017. In contrast, high-grade suppliers Brazil and South Africa both lost market share, with the South American country dropping to 19.5 percent from 21.2 percent, and South Africa slipping to 3.3 percent from 3.6 percent.

2018-08-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shows signs of extending its nine-year expansion with the help of tax cuts and strong business and consumer confidence. Both the longevity of the expansion and the apparent limited slack in the labour and product markets suggest the current pace of growth is probably not sustainable in the medium term. The current cyclical expansion is 110 months old and will be the longest on record if the economy is still growing in July 2019. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PlpDto) While longevity alone is not a good predictor of cyclical turning points, with most financial and economic indicators close to multi-decade highs, the balance of risks is shifting. “What matters primarily ... is not the passage of calendar time but what happens over time in and to the economy in motion. It is historical and psychological time, filled with events and processes, perceptions and actions. “There is a simple corollary: knowledge of the current phase of the business cycle and its age can help but must not be used in isolation,” Victor Zarnowitz, a leading U.S. expert on business cycles, wrote in 1992. “The variability in length of business expansions and contractions is sufficiently large for the timing of cyclical turning points to be very difficult to forecast. “The age of a phase alone is not of much help in predicting its end: what matters more is the dynamics of the evolving business situation. (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting,” Zarnowitz, 1992) Zarnowitz went on to observe: “The largest errors in forecasts ... are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense they miss recessions and recoveries.” Fears about a future slowdown in the U.S. economy have grown as the U.S. Treasury curve has come closer to inverting, given the close correlation between slowdowns and inversions over several decades. Yields on U.S. Treasury paper with two years to maturity are now just 22 basis points below yields on 10-year notes, the narrowest gap since a few months before the start of the last recession in December 2007. The yield curve exhibits strongly cyclical behaviour, with a large negative gap during economic slowdowns and a smaller negative gap or even a positive one during expansions. To some extent, whether or not the curve actually inverts is arbitrary, since there is no special significance in the zero line, and the long-term average has been around 105-115 basis points. So the current gap is already in the 82nd-83rd percentile of the long-term distribution across multiple cycles since 1983, and the is economy already well into the cycle’s boom/tightening phase. It is not possible to predict either the precise timing or the depth of the next slowdown, but the narrowing yield gap indicates the distribution of risks over the next couple of years is now skewed to the downside. There are more scenarios in which something could go wrong (accelerating inflation, an emerging markets crisis, monetary policy errors, or a deterioration in corporate finances) and fewer in which everything goes right. The current yield gap is consistent with a wealth of other indicators, including purchasing surveys, consumer confidence, unemployment, retail price inflation, freight movements and the escalation in share prices. They all point to an economy approaching a cyclical peak, and then likely to move into a period of more moderate growth, if not recession, over the next 12 to 24 months. The critical question is whether the next slowdown, when it comes, proves just a pause in an otherwise sustained expansion (1994/95) or marks an end to the current cycle and start of a new one (2000/01 or 2007/08). The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-kemp/column-u-s-economy-accelerates-towards-cyclical-peak-john-kemp-idUKL8N1VL3O9,30 Aug 2018,"The U.S. economy shows signs of

Benchmark Brent crude oil was up 50 cents a barrel at $77.64 by 1130 GMT. U.S. light crude was 40 cents higher at $69.91. Brent has risen by almost 10 percent over the past two weeks on widespread perceptions that the global oil market is tightening and could run short in the next few months as U.S. sanctions restrict crude exports from Iran. Iranian crude exports are likely to drop to a little more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, against a peak of 3.1 million bpd in April, as importers bow to American pressure to cut orders. “The oil market is once again tightening,” said Giovanni Staunovo, analyst at Swiss bank UBS in Zurich. “Iranian oil export declines are already visible well in advance of U.S. oil-related sanctions, which enter into force in November.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in which Iran is the third-biggest producer, will discuss in December whether it can compensate for a sudden drop in Iranian supply after sanctions start in November, the head of Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said on Wednesday. Crude exports from crisis-struck OPEC member Venezuela have also fallen sharply, halving in recent years to about 1 million bpd. Official U.S. oil inventory data on Wednesday also helped the bullish trend. U.S. commercial crude inventories fell by a larger than expected 2.6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 24, to 405.79 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA was flat from the previous week’s record of 11 million bpd. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned of a tightening market towards the end of the year because of falling supply in countries such as Iran and Venezuela combined with strong demand, especially in Asia. “Definitely there are some worries that oil markets can tighten towards the end of this year,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters on Wednesday. BNP Paribas global oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian highlighted a combination of supply risks. “As Iranian oil exports are lost to the market, Venezuelan production continues to decline, Angola struggles to maintain output and Libya is subject to episodic outages,” he told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. “The path of least resistance (for prices), at least in our view, is up.” Reporting by Christopher Johnson in LONDON and Henning

Stock markets and major government bond yields rose in recent weeks on hopes that a global trade war could be averted, particularly with the leaders of the United States and Canada optimistic they could reach a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) by Friday. But with tariffs beginning to hurt the Chinese economy, Asian stocks lost some of their gains and European shares followed suit on Thursday on concerns over trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at FX broker OANDA, said there’s a sense of urgency on NAFTA talks as the countries try to complete the deal before a new Mexican government takes control, and ahead of a mid-term vote in the United States. “It doesn’t mean the U.S. will look for a quick solution with China,” he said. “There’s still a long way to run with these trade situations, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more tariffs on more goods before it gets better.” A Reuters poll showed activity among China’s manufacturers probably slowed for the third straight month in August . This pushed the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 0.8 percent, and in turn hit European stocks on worries that reduced Chinese demand would hurt exporters. A pan-European stock index dropped 0.3 percent on Thursday, dragging the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, off a five-month high. The export-dependant German DAX underperformed and was down half a percent. Futures pricing suggested U.S. stocks were also set to open lower, having hit fresh record highs overnight. “Investors are relatively pessimistic and cautious for now amid low levels of trading volume, as there are still concerns over the development of the Sino-U.S. trade spat,” said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities. U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods are expected to take effect next month. Positive signals from London and Brussels over the trade component of EU divorce talks drove sterling higher against the euro on Thursday, though the risk of a no-deal Brexit kept the British currency well off its 2018 highs. The gains came as European Union negotiator Michel Barnier signalled an more accommodative stance towards London in ongoing talks. “It is a slight change in tone from Barnier and a sign that the EU is very aware of the Brexit deadline and they don’t want a no-deal Brexit any more than we do,” said Erlam of OANDA. Meanwhile, yet another emerging market currency is under scrutiny, this time Argentina’s, after the country asked the International Monetary Fund for early assistance, alarming investors and hurting the peso and the country’s bond prices. The IMF said it was studying the request from Argentina to speed up disbursement of a $50 billion loan. The Argentinian peso dropped more than 7 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline since the currency was allowed to float in December 2015. Yields on Argentina’s 100-year bond issued last year rose to its highest level yet at 9.859 percent overnight. The peso’s plunge came after a currency crisis hit Turkey earlier in the month, sparking worries about all emerging markets. The Turkish lira retreated to a two-week low after Moody’s on Wednesday downgraded 20 Turkish banks. In commodities, Brent crude futures extended gains and was up 0.59 percent to $77.73 per barrel. U.S. crude futures climbed 0.62 percent to $69.93 per barrel. Oil contracts had risen more than 1 percent on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories and as U.S. sanctions reduced Iranian crude shipments.

2018-08-30,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Ernest Scheyder Aug 30 (Reuters) - As global demand for lithium hits overdrive, Albemarle Corp is investing millions of dollars to engineer specialized types of the light metal for electric car batteries, part of a strategy to remain the niche market’s top producer. The pivot comes as battery makers such as Panasonic Corp , the sole battery supplier to Tesla Inc, increasingly demand more purified versions of lithium that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery’s charge, shaping Albemarle’s strategy, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by the company. Once used primarily as a pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder, lithium has become one of the world’s most in-demand commodities thanks to the rising popularity of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries. Roughly 500,000 electric vehicles were sold globally in 2016, a figure that is expected to jump sevenfold by 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Albemarle’s strategy, which includes developing a battery research center near its North Carolina headquarters, is aimed at setting it apart from its major competitors, including Chile’s SQM and China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp . Albemarle has historically sold basic types of lithium under short-term contracts, much like rivals. Now, the company is diverging from rivals and developing dozens of lithium products that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery’s charge. “What we are doing is not a moonshot, but rather just good engineering,” Albemarle’s lithium unit head, Eric Norris, said at a private dinner earlier this summer attended by State Street Global Advisors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other top shareholders, according to two sources. As more lithium production comes online in the Americas and Asia, concerns about oversupply are high, making a push into specialized lithium a crucial step for Albemarle. “Lithium is much more a specialty chemical than a mined product,” said Joe Lowry, an independent lithium industry consultant. “It’s definitely not a commodity because it’s not a fungible good.” Albemarle is now trying to use its technical know-how and clout to forge customer partnerships that it hopes guarantee profit for decades. “If every new lithium project that’s been announced does come online, that could cause market oversupply,” said Deutsche Bank mining analyst Chris Terry. “There’s a lot of bearishness in the market and differentiation is the key to success.” By treating the metal with various chemicals and other processing steps, lithium’s chemical structure can be rearranged to boost electricity storage and increase charge, which Albemarle hopes will make it even more indispensable to battery makers and the electric car industry, Norris told the investor dinner. “Battery requirements are becoming more stringent and there is a definitive move towards higher energy density batteries,” Albemarle spokeswoman Hailey Cobb said. Longer term, Albemarle is studying so-called “solid state” batteries, which contains no liquid and theoretically can store more electricity than the lithium ion battery, Norris told investors. While solid-state batteries are not expected to replace lithium ion batteries as the industry standard, they are seen as a promising technological evolution. And importantly for Albemarle, they will consume even more lithium. So far, Wall Street is rooting for Albemarle’s success. Seventeen of the 22 analysts that cover the stock recommend buying it. As an average, that same group thinks the stock should be trading 33 percent above current levels, according to Thomson Reuters data. Albemarle agrees and earlier this month said it would double its stock buyback for the year to $500 million. The global lithium business is dominated by Albemarle, SQM, Tianqi and FMC Corp, which is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company. SQM has stated publicly a goal of supplanting Albemarle as the world’s biggest lithium producer by the next decade, which Albemarle says is not a concern. “We are not interested in being the largest; we are concerned about meeting the needs of our customers and being the most profitable lithium company in the world,” said Hobb. But some on Wall Street are spooked, with shares of Albemarle down 25 percent this year. “Lithium has become the centerpiece for the future of the company,” said Chip Skinner, a portfolio manager with the Royce Funds, which holds Albemarle shares. “But supply and demand still matter.” To help retain its crown, the U.S. company is moving customers toward long-term contracts of a decade or more, far longer than the three- to five-year contracts it currently signs. The contracts have an option to reset pricing every year, in contrast to SQM which favors shorter contracts and typically charges spot market prices. Albemarle also poached former General Electric Co battery scientist Glen Merfeld this spring, and is hiring deputies for Merfeld to help oversee the new battery center. Norris told large investors that the shift to long-term contracts, which would have a base price guaranteed, could be as long as a decade or more in some cases and secure Albemarle’s 40 percent profit margins, regardless of market forces. “Lithium is a relationship-based business, and Albemarle is betting that brings it success in the long-run,” said Chris Berry, an independent energy metals analyst based in New York.

2018-08-30,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A move by China to slash subsidies for domestic solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices and eroding the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff on solar equipment imports, according to industry officials. That’s good news for U.S. companies that purchase and install imported solar panels, including Inovateus Solar and Pine Gate Renewables, which had expected that the protectionist policy would raise their costs and slow their business. The falling prices, however, will hurt panel manufacturers including China’s Jinko Solar [JKSAA.UL] and Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS, which had announced hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. solar manufacturing investments in the expectation that tariffs would boost their profits. Trump announced a 30-percent levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in an escalating global trade war that he says is aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers and other businesses rebound from years of decline. Critics say the tariffs could backfire by hurting other domestic industries that depend on imports. The prospect of solar tariffs initially sent U.S. panel prices soaring, making domestic manufacturing more profitable and drawing a handful of new investments. But the tax on imports cooled the red-hot pace of U.S. solar installations by raising panel costs. The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people, with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The solar panel market shifted in June after China - the world’s top solar installer and a major critic of the Trump tariff - announced a plan to cut the amount of installed solar capacity this year nearly in half by cutting subsidies for such projects. While the move could undermine the effectiveness of Trump’s tariffs on panels, China’s National Development and Reform Commission has said the subsidy cuts were motivated mainly by domestic concerns about the industry’s rapid growth. Surging solar capacity has left China struggling to build sufficient transmission infrastructure to link projects to the electrical grid, and the finance ministry has scrambled to find billions of yuan in subsidies owed to new projects.  The subsidy reductions forced Chinese panel makers to find new buyers on the export market. The increased global supply has driven down the cost of buying a panel in the United States to about 40 cents a watt from 45 cents shortly after the tariff, according to pricing data from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. The research firm said prices could fall to about 30 cents by the end of 2019 – less than they were before the administration began considering a tariff in 2017. “It’s becoming a buyer’s market again,” said Sheldon Kimber, chief executive of U.S. developer Intersect Power, a solar project developer founded in 2016 that has plans to purchase large volumes of panels starting in 2019. The unexpected price declines are eroding the effectiveness of the tariff in boosting manufacturing profits and could completely offset its initial market impact by November, said Paul Strigler, a vice president with Esplanade Capital, a Boston-based investment firm that has a fund dedicated to solar energy investments. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not respond to a request for comment. The four-year tariff on solar modules steps down by 5 percentage points a year before expiring in 2022. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), a trade group representing both solar developers and panel manufacturers, opposed the tariffs as a net loss of industry jobs and revenue. The falling prices mitigate some of the pain but still amount to a drag on growth, said SEIA spokesman Dan Whitten. “It may be less bad than it could have been, but it’s still not nearly as good as it should be,” he said. Utility-scale solar developers including Cyprus Creek Renewables and Southern Current told Reuters earlier this year that the higher panel prices caused by the tariff had forced them to cancel or freeze plans for more than $2.5 billion in projects – a figure that topped new investments announced by manufacturing firms that benefitted from the tariffs. Many installers are now feeling more optimistic. South Bend, Indiana-based Inovateus Solar, for example, said lower panel prices had helped it close a deal in June to develop a 6 megawatt system for the city of Pratt, Kansas and to revive hiring plans. “The drop in panel prices has really helped stimulate more activity,” Inovateus co-founder TJ Kanczuzewski said in an interview. The lower prices have also helped the economics of projects already in the pipeline, especially those with marginal prospects for a payoff, said Ben Catt, chief development officer of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Pine Gate Renewables. Cypress Creek said the decline has yet to resuscitate its shelved projects for 2018, but the company said it expects panel prices to keep falling, potentially helping projects next year. “Ramping construction up and down is not something that happens overnight,” said Cypress Creek’s director of government affairs, Hewitt Strange. Southern Current did not respond to requests for comment. Colin Smith, an analyst for Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, said he expects the U.S. utility-scale solar market to expand between 2020 and 2023 because of the falling price of panels, instead of remaining flat as the firm had forecast earlier this year.  “The market has become comfortable again,” Smith said. Panel manufacturers that announced U.S. expansions in response to the tariffs - including China’s Jinko Solar, California-based SunPower Corp and Canada’s Heliene - said they still planned to move forward with planned investments. But the falling prices are forcing them to operate at a lower margin, they said, to compete against foreign rivals who benefit from lower labor and material costs.  “It makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging,” SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner said in an interview. SunPower earlier this year agreed to take over the Oregon factory of troubled SolarWorld Americas - one of the companies that sought the tariffs. The deal is expected to close before the end of the third quarter, SunPower said. The facility is capable of producing nearly a gigawatt of solar cells and modules a year, or enough energy to power about 700,000 homes. Jinko’s investor relations director, Sebastian Liu, called the price collapse a normal fluctuation and said the firm was “making reasonable margins” thanks to a focus on higher efficiency products and lower costs for polysilicon, solar’s key raw material. He said Jinko will begin producing panels at a U.S. facility in Florida in the fourth quarter of this year. Heliene President Martin Pochtaruk said his company had weathered such price drops before and would do so again as it works toward opening its Minnesota factory next month. Heliene took over the facility in May of 2017 and has invested $21.5 million to get it up and running. The company expects to produce 140 MW of panels there a year. Heliene said it would focus on cost cuts to compensate for falling prices. “It is of course stressing” Pochtaruk said of the sudden market shift, but also “business as usual” in a volatile sector.

2018-08-30,"TEPIC, Mexico, Aug 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Energy from the ocean breakers that pound Mexico’s Pacific Coast could soon be turned into electricity as an Israeli joint venture finalises permits and financing for the country’s first wave energy plant. Wave power development has long lagged renewable rivals such as solar, but Eco Wave Power says it could prove an effective way to deliver power to coastal communities in countries such as Ghana or Kenya that have little access to electricity. “The ocean is the biggest renewable resource that we have and it’s completely untapped, and it has to change,” said Inna Braverman, co-founder of Tel Aviv-based Eco Wave Power. “At the moment we’re a comparable price to solar, but the advantage on top of solar is the availability of the resource... It keeps working 24/7,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. After scanning the coast for optimal wave conditions, the company decided to set up its first Mexican plant near Manzanillo, the country’s busiest cargo port some 845 kilometres (525 miles) west of Mexico City. Situated close to the shore, hundreds of floating buoys connected by arms to a jetty would move with the waves to generate clean electricity at the 4.8-megawatt plant. The power then would be fed into a sub-station controlled by the state-owned electricity company, said Ernesto Delarue Rodriguez, chief executive of joint venture partner Eco Wave Power Mexico. The plant would be able to power about 2,000 homes, he said. In the event of storms, Eco Wave Power’s system could lift its buoys or submerge them until high waves pass, the company said on its website. Aside from wave energy, companies around the world are looking to tap the vast potential of the oceans by creating energy from tides, currents and temperature differences - but commercial breakthroughs have so far been limited, experts say. “Ocean energy has not yet reached the commodity phase of development. If you want solar, go buy some solar panels. If you want wind energy, go buy a wind turbine,” said Mark Horenstein, professor of electrical engineering at Boston University “In the case of ocean energy, no one company or entity has come up with the killer application that’s going to be the definitive method for ocean energy.” Any ocean technology also has to be able to survive a “100-year storm” - the worst storm expected over a century - and such events could become increasingly more likely with a changing climate, he said. The patchy history of large-scale wave energy projects has made some investors cautious about sinking their money into ocean projects, said Braverman, whose company is considering a stock market listing to help raise capital. The Manzanillo project, which expects to receive final permits in the coming weeks, will cost around $15 million. A chunk of the financing will come from the Israeli company but much of it will be raised by the Mexican venture partner. Delarue, who is also working on a wave energy project in the Bahamas, said construction should start this year once financing and permits fall into place, though admitted that, in some cases, “Mexican investors... are not used to investing in start-up projects.” Aside from Mexico, Braverman said her company was waiting to start work on a 5-megawatt wave power plant in Gibraltar that could provide 15 percent of the enclave’s electricity, and has orders in countries including China and Britain. Born 200 miles from Chernobyl, just two weeks before the 1986 nuclear power plant disaster, Braverman said her experience of the devastating impact of contamination helped spur her interested in clean power. “There’s many people saying yes, we need to fight pollution in the future, yes, we need to recycle, we need to invest more in renewable energy but they don’t actually understand the meaning behind it,” she said. ""I experienced first hand the negative impact of pollution and I got a second chance in life,"" she said. (Reporting by Sophie Hares. Editing by Robert Carmichael and Laurie Goering.

2018-08-30,"(Reuters) - British water utility Severn Trent said on Thursday it would buy organic waste recycler Agrivert Holdings for 120 million pounds ($156 million), as it beefs up its renewables business that is largely shielded from rising energy costs. Agrivert generates renewable energy from food waste and operates food-waste processing plants and waste composting sites in Britain, Severn Trent said. “Renewable energy is strategically important to Seven Trent and the UK as a whole as we work towards achieving our decarbonization targets,” Severn Trent Chief Executive Officer Liv Garfield said in a statement on Thursday.    The deal will add 106 Gigawatt hours (GWh) per annum of energy generation to the 354 GWh currently produced by Severn Trent’s renewable energy portfolio, the company said. Severn Trent, which supplies water across the Midlands region, generated 38 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy, it had said in May. At the time it also said renewable energy sources act as a natural hedge against rising energy costs and it was on track to get roughly half of its gross energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020. Severn Trent, an FTSE 100 component, will fund the deal with existing cash and bank facilities, it said on Thursday.

2018-08-30,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A 25-year period for Denmark as a net oil exporter is set to end this year following output declines in the North Sea, the country’s energy agency said on Thursday after slashing its long-term oil production forecast. The Danish Energy Agency expects this year’s oil production to reach 128,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from 138,000 bpd last year and 10 percent lower than an estimate given a year ago. The lower production forecast was due to downward adjustments of North Sea resources, as well as delays and greater uncertainty regarding the development of several fields and discoveries. Denmark has been a net oil exporter since 1993, when technological developments such as horizontal drilling made it possible to extract difficult reserves in the North Sea. Production peaked in 2004 at 390,000 bpd. The flip to net importer comes as a surprise as Denmark was expected to remain a net exporter of oil for a number of years. But going forward, with the exception of 2024, the Nordic country’s oil consumption is seen exceeding production. The energy agency cut its five-year production forecast by 14 percent and the long-term forecast by 8 percent compared to previous projections given in 2017. Last year, Maersk Oil, which Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) sold to Total (TOTF.PA) last summer in a $7.45 billion (5.73 billion pounds) deal, and its partners decided to invest 21 billion Danish crowns (2.54 billion pounds) in redeveloping the Tyra field, the largest investment ever in the Danish part of the North Sea. The reconstruction of facilities at Tyra will hit oil production in 2020 and 2021, the Danish Energy Agency said. Total’s partners in the field are Shell (RDSa.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and Denmark’s state-owned Nordsofonden through the  Danish Underground Consortium. The forecast for gas production was reduced by 5 percent, but Denmark is still expected largely to remain a net exporter until after 2035.

2018-08-30,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish gas company PGNiG (PGN.WA) expects to spend more than 7.5 billion zlotys (1.54 billion pounds) on its distribution network by 2022, its chief executive said, after shareholders recently voted in favour of investment over dividends. That level of spending would be up from around 4.7 billion zlotys over the past four years. In a vote on July 20, shareholders of the state-controlled company, Poland’s dominant gas provider, voted to allocate 2017 net profit to reserve funds, freeing it up to be used for investment. “As long as our owners will not require dividends, we will certainly invest in distribution, even over the figure of 7.5 billion over the period by 2022,” Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak told a conference call with analysts.   PGNiG had planned to spend half of 2017 profit on dividends before holding the vote on the issue. When asked about dividend payouts next year from 2018 profit, Wozniak said it was too early to comment.  He was speaking after PGNiG reported a 41-percent rise in second quarter net profit from a year earlier to 704 million zlotys on higher oil and gas prices and increased sales. PGNiG imports most of the gas it sells from Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM), but has taken steps to reduce that reliance by buying more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar, the United States and Norway.  “Russian prices in this region are still at a very high level,” Maciej Wozniak, PGNiG deputy head, said on the call.   In June a Swedish arbitration court said in an interim ruling that PGNiG could demand a lower price for gas it buys from Gazprom. Piotr Wozniak said on Thursday that he hoped there would be a final ruling by the end of this year.  “Gazprom prices are and will be the highest unless the contact (with Gazprom) changes,” Wozniak told analysts.

2018-08-30,"SWAR CREEK DAM, Myanmar (Reuters) - As many as 85 villages were flooded in Myanmar after a dam failed, unleashing waters that blocked a major highway and forced more than 63,000 people from their homes, a state-run newspaper said on Thursday. The disaster spotlights safety concerns about dams in Southeast Asia after last month’s collapse of a hydroelectric dam in neighbouring Laos that displaced thousands of people and killed at least 27.  Firefighters, troops and officials launched a desperate rescue effort on Wednesday after the spillway of an irrigation dam burst at Swar creek in central Myanmar, sending a torrent of water through villages and the nearby towns of Swar and Yedashe. By Thursday morning the water was receding, but two people remained missing and were feared to have been washed away, said Min Thu, deputy administrator of Yedashe. “People whose villages are on higher ground are preparing to go back to their villages,” he told Reuters. The ruptured spillway had flooded 85 villages, affecting more than 63,000 people and submerging a section of highway, the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said. Traffic between Myanmar’s major cities of Yangon and Mandalay and the capital, Naypyitaw, was disrupted after the flooding damaged a bridge on the highway linking the cities. Work was underway on Thursday to repair the dam, where the water level had dropped by several meters, exposing sandy banks. A priority was to get as much water into the reservoir as possible before the dry season when it is needed for irrigation, said Kaung Myat Thein, an irrigation official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation. He said a probe would seek the cause of the dam breach. “The retaining wall of the spillway sank into the foundation about 4-5 feet, causing the flooding, but the main dam is intact,” said Kaung Myat Thein.  Days before the breach, authorities had given the all-clear to the dam, which can hold 216,350 acre-feet of water, despite residents’ concerns about overspill, state-run media have said. Kaung Myat Thein said the dam was regularly inspected and a  spillway collapse could not have been predicted.  “We could not know one day before, one hour before,” he said. As floodwaters receded, elders gathered at Oo Yin Hmu, a village of about 1,000 people only a few miles downstream from the dam, to review the damage.  Paddy fields stretching from the edge of the village were inundated. It would be years before they could be planted with rice again, said Zaw Zaw, a 45-year-old farmer. Residents ran to higher ground to escape the floodwaters, he said, but many lost their homes and possessions and were expected to ask the regional government for compensation. “My house was at the northern part of the village and all houses in the northern part didn’t survive,” said Pan Ei Phyu, 24, a villager who escaped with her family, buffalos and cows. “All of my farmland is turned into mud now. I don’t have land or anything else anymore. I don’t know what to do.” Graphic - Myanmar dam collapse IMG: tmsnrt.rs/2PkCtb7 Additional reporting by Simon Lewis and Thu Thu Aung in YANGON; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Darren Schuettler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/myanmar-dam/update-2-myanmar-dam-breach-floods-85-villages-thousands-driven-from-homes-idUKL3N1VL212,30 Aug 2018,"As many as 85

Stock markets and major government bond yields rose in recent weeks on hopes that a global trade war could be averted, particularly with the leaders of the United States and Canada optimistic they could reach new North American Trade Agreement by Friday. But with tariffs beginning to hurt the Chinese economy, Asian stocks lost some of their gains and European shares followed suit on Thursday on concerns over trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. “In all honestly, the NAFTA situation probably reflects a desire to get the agreement over the line before elections in Mexico and the mid-term vote in the U.S.,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, an FX broker. “It doesn’t mean the U.S. will look for a quick solution with China. There’s still a long way to run with these trade situations, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more tariffs on more goods before it gets better.” A pan-European stock index dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, dragging the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, off a five-month high. Earlier, a Reuters poll showed activity among China’s manufacturers probably slowed for the third straight month in August. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.3 percent, with broad gains across the region offset by losses in China. The Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.8 percent. “Investors are relatively pessimistic and cautious for now amid low levels of trading volume, as there are still concerns over the development of the Sino-U.S. trade spat,” said Yan Kaiwen, an analyst with China Fortune Securities. U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods are expected to take effect next month. The British pound extended its gains against the euro after recording its biggest gain in seven months on Wednesday . The gains came as European Union negotiator Michel Barnier signalled an more accommodative stance towards London in ongoing talks. “It is a slight change in tone from Barnier and a sign that the EU is very aware of the Brexit deadline and they don’t want a no-deal Brexit any more than we do,” said Erlam of OANDA. Yet another emerging market currency is under scrutiny, this time Argentina’s, after the country asked the International Monetary Fund for early assistance, alarming investors and hurting the peso and the country’s bond prices. The IMF said it was studying the request from Argentina to speed up disbursement of the $50 billion loan. The Argentinian peso dropped more than 7 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline since the currency was allowed to float in December 2015. Yields on Argentina’s 100-year bond issued last year rose to its highest level yet at 9.859 percent overnight. The peso’s plunge came after a currency crisis hit Turkey earlier in the month, sparking worries about all emerging markets. The Turkish lira retreated to a two-week low after Moody’s on Wednesday downgraded 20 Turkish banks. In commodities, Brent crude futures extended gains and was up 0.35 percent to $77.40 per barrel. U.S. crude futures climbed 0.37 percent to $69.77 per barrel. Oil contracts had risen more than 1 percent on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories and as U.S. sanctions reduced Iranian crude shipments.

2018-08-30,"JERUSALEM, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Israeli energy conglomerate Delek Group reported lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by a loss from exploration and production (E&P) business in the North Sea at its Ithaca Energy unit. Delek said it earned 170 million shekels ($47 million) in the second quarter, compared with 180 million a year earlier when a gain from the purchase of Ithaca boosted profits. Ithaca, wholly owned by Delek, contributed a 32 million shekel loss to Delek’s bottom line versus a 47 million shekel profit a year earlier. The decline was caused by a nearly one-month operational standstill to connect a floating production facility in June. Revenue rose to 2.1 billion shekels from 1.6 billion, boosted by higher sales at its Delek Israel unit but partly offset by the sale of 9.25 percent of its holdings in the Tamar natural gas field off Israel’s Mediterranean coast. Tamar’s gas sales hit a new quarterly record of 2.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the second quarter. In addition to a stake in Tamar, Delek, through a subsidiary, has a major share in the nearby Leviathan gas field. Delek said the Leviathan project is 60 percent complete and remains on schedule for the first gas sales to begin by the end of 2019. The company, with partner Noble Energy, is trying to acquire the rights to an East Mediterranean Gas-owned subsea pipeline to carry gas between Israel and Egypt. Delek and Noble have signed a $15 billion gas supply deal with Egypt’s Dolphinus Holdings. “We look forward to acquiring rights to the EMG pipeline in the near term, which would allow the implementation of the gas export agreement with Egypt covering volumes of up to 64 bcm,” Delek Chief Executive Asaf Bartfeld said. Delek said it would pay a dividend of 120 million shekels, the same as the first quarter. $1 = 3.6119 shekels

2018-08-30,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Thursday that trade issues with the United States can only be resolved through talks as equals, and it will press on with the steady opening of its economy regardless of U.S. actions. “The only correct choice in resolving trade friction between China and the U.S. is through talks based on sincerity and equality,” Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters at a regular briefing. “Whatever repressive measures the U.S. adopts, China will firmly and steadily push forward reform and opening at its own pace.”   Some Chinese firms and foreign companies in China have been affected by the U.S. tariffs and are working to mitigate the impact, Gao said, without elaborating. “We are confident that foreign trade will maintain steady momentum... and will roll out targeted policies to safeguard the legitimate rights of all firms in China, including foreign-invested firms,” said Gao.  China’s manufacturing sector is under pressure from higher borrowing costs, cooling investment and consumer spending, and a potential shock to exports as a result of the trade frictions with the United States. A Reuters poll showed on Thursday that activity in the vast factory sector likely slowed for a third straight month in August, as domestic demand remained weak and exporters faced rising uncertainties from the brewing U.S.-China trade war.  The head of China’s top planning agency also warned that the economy faces increasing risks in the second half of the year and policymakers need to step up efforts to meet key development goals. In the meantime, U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought in the second quarter, notching its best performance in nearly four years. However, U.S. goods trade deficit widened sharply in July as exports of agricultural products tumbled, indicating trade could be a drag on growth in the third quarter.

2018-08-30,"PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - A report commissioned by France’s government proposed building five new nuclear reactors, Les Echos reported on Thursday, two days after Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot resigned and said  that progress on goals such as a shift to renewable energy was too slow. The report, prepared for Hulot and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, examines how to maintain the industrial capacity of a French nuclear sector that slowed reactor construction in the 1990s, the business daily said. Among its proposals is the building of five new EPR reactors starting in 2025. “Government policy isn’t decided by a report,” Le Maire told Radio Classique when questioned about the Les Echos report on it. Nuclear power is “an asset for France”, he added, mentioning its low greenhouse emissions and costs he described as “competitive”. Hulot, a former presenter of environmental TV programmes and a popular figure in France, resigned on Tuesday during a live interview in a blow to President Emmanual Macron’s already tarnished green credentials. The resignation has added to political headaches afflicting Macron, whose ratings are at their lowest since his May 2017 election, and may yet prompt a wider government reshuffle. Hulot said staying put would have “created the illusion” that the government’s environment policy was satisfactory. In another interview published after his exit by daily Liberation, Hulot made a comment that could have been alluding to the proposals of the report in question. “If I go, there will be three more EPRs in coming years.” The report, drawn up by a nuclear industry veteran and a former defence official, was submitted for classification as secret, Les Echos also said, citing unnamed sources.

2018-08-30,"(Adds outlook and other comments from CEO) By Emily Chow and A. Ananthalakshmi KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Malaysian state-owned energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad is looking to expand its core business portfolio and plans to pay the government a higher dividend than earlier promised, its chief executive said on Thursday. The comments came as Petronas, as the company is known, reported a near doubling of profit in the second quarter, helped by higher oil prices. After years of cautionary spending due to a weak energy market, Petronas is loosening its purse strings as oil and gas prices stabilise. “We will endeavour to expand our core business portfolio while exploring opportunities to step out into speciality chemicals and new energy,” Chief Executive Officer Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said at a press conference. Petronas will continue to maintain a “prudent view on the outlook,” he said. The company, which is known to be conservative with its outlook, expects its full-year performance to be “satisfactory.” Petronas is budgeting for an oil price of $66 per barrel for next year. Petronas will pay the Malaysian government, its sole shareholder, a dividend of 24 billion ringgit ($5.8 billion) this year, up from 16 billion ringgit last year. The company had earlier expected to pay 19 billion ringgit this year. The higher dividend comes at a crucial time for the Malaysian government, which is relying more on Petronas - a significant contributor to government coffers and the country’s largest employer - to offset a revenue shortfall from scrapping an unpopular consumption tax. Petronas is the sole manager of Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves, and is the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter after Qatar and Australia. As oil prices plunged, Petronas said in 2016 that it would slash spending by 50 billion ringgit in the following four years. But it has been making new investments in recent months in Mexico, Senegal and Canada. The company’s upstream CEO Anuar Taib said there will be a modest increase in activity in Malaysia. Petronas is planning capital expenditure of 14-15 billion ringgit next year for Malaysian upstream activity, up from about 12 billion ringgit this year, he said. Petronas’ profit for the second quarter totalled 13.63 billion ringgit, up from 7.06 billion ringgit a year earlier. Revenue increased 14.7 percent to 59.24 billion ringgit. Production volume for the first half of the year rose to 2.383 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) per day from 2.342 mmboe per day in the same period last year. LNG sales volume for the first half dipped to 14.48 million metric tonnes, down by 0.21 million tonnes, mainly due to lower volume from plants, Petronas said. CEO Wan Zulkiflee said Petronas was in talks with Malaysia’s oil and gas-rich Sarawak state, which earlier this year asserted its right to its resources. Sarawak wants to assume full regulatory authority for the upstream and downstream industries in the state - a move that would affect Petronas’ operations. Last year, the state government formed an oil and gas company, Petroleum Sarawak Bhd (Petros), and has also been demanding higher royalties from Petronas. Wan Zulkiflee said Petronas is talking with Petros about day to day operations, but the demand on royalties will be dealt with by the federal government, which regulates the company. $1 = 4.1070 ringgit

2018-08-30,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s east coast will experience dry weather for at least the next three months, the country’s meteorological bureau said on Thursday, intensifying a drought that has wilted crops and left farmers struggling to stay in business. In its latest three-month outlook, the Bureau of Meteorology said there was only a 30 percent chance rainfall would exceed average levels over much of the country’s east coast during spring, which runs from September to November. If the drought gets worse, Australia’s agricultural sector will suffer further crop losses, while farmers will also be forced to slaughter livestock in greater numbers as they struggle to find enough food or water to keep them alive. The bureau also raised the prospect of dry weather in the country’s west, which has so far escaped drought conditions, bringing new concerns for Australian food manufacturers. Unable to source enough grain from the east coast, some food producers have started to import supplies from Western Australia, where recent favorable weather had encouraged farmers to sell leftover supplies. But the bureau said the west coast - the country’s largest agricultural producing region - will also experience drier than average weather over the next three months, tightening national supply yet further. “East coast farmers have largely written off wheat crops this year, but the issue could be the situation in the west,” said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. “Some had been calling for a crop in excess of 10 million tonnes (in Western Australia), but if the forecast materializes, the figure will be under threat.” Production of wheat from the world’s fourth-largest exporter is already expected to hit a decade low this year, although output from the west is expected to cushion the decline in the east. The bureau also said it saw a 50 percent chance of an El Nino weather event, which can bring warmer weather and dry conditions to Australia and could extend the dry weather into 2019. “An El Nino basically means that as we get into summer there’d  be less chance of having those recovery rains that we need and we may have to wait till autumn in 2019 to start seeing some recovery rains in the drought areas,” said Andrew Watkins, manager of long range forecasts at the Bureau of Meteorology.
