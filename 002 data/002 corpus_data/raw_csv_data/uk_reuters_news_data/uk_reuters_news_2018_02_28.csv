2018-02-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Department of the Interior committee voted on Wednesday to recommend to Secretary Ryan Zinke that the agency lower royalty rates for federal offshore oil and gas drilling, to spur production. The agency’s royalty policy committee voted unanimously to lower the rates to 12.5 percent through 2024. The existing rate of 18.75 percent was set during the administration of former President George W. Bush. The panel, which is made up of department and state officials, tribal representatives, and energy companies, also voted to increase the amount of acreage available for offshore oil and natural gas leasing in the outer continental shelf. The Houston meeting was aimed at updating around a dozen federal royalty rules, which guide energy and mineral production in the United States. The committee was formed last year to advise Zinke on whether the government was getting a fair price from resources companies for their use of public land. He will take its recommendations into account. The panel also voted to approve a proposal letting coal companies that mine on federal land set their own rates for coal used to calculate royalties. Zinke last year halted an Obama-era rule that had required coal companies to pay royalties on sales to their first unaffiliated customer. The rule, which had been intended to close a loophole that had let companies sell coal to its own subsidiaries at deflated prices, was criticized by Zinke as confusing. Randall Luthi, president of offshore energy lobby group the National Ocean Industries Association, said at the meeting that existing production offshore was “declining and at a very quick rate” and that lowering royalty rates should spur new activity. Pam Eaton, an advisor to conservation group Wilderness Society, attended the meeting as an observer. She said in comments after formal presentations that she wanted to remind the committee that its mission was “to ensure the public receives the full value of the natural resources produced from federal lands.”    Reporting By Valerie Volcovici, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien and Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-royalties/update-2-u-s-interior-panel-recommends-cutting-offshore-oil-and-gas-royalties-idUKL2N1QI2HB,28 Feb 2018,"A U.S. Department of the

2018-02-28,"TORONTO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia’s southern Gobi Desert will lift force majeure effective March 1 and majority owner Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Wednesday that it expected to make up any sales-related effect over the next few quarters. Force majeure was declared Jan. 17 after protests by Chinese coal haulers disrupted deliveries by blockading roads near the Chinese-Mongolian border, leaving Oyu Tolgoi convoys unable to deliver copper concentrates. Force majeure is a legal status companies invoke when they cannot make deliveries of a commodity because of forces outside of their control. Vancouver-based Turquoise Hill, majority owned by Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto , said the blockade was lifted Jan. 18 and the border re-opened Jan. 19, but ongoing congestion had hampered a return to normal border traffic. A period of consistent convoy crossings and stable concentrate supply chain are required before force majeure can be lifted, said Turquoise Hill, which owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi with the Mongolian government holding the remainder. The Chinese truckers were protesting increased enforcement of rules requiring them to pay Mongolian taxes and social insurance to receive permits to deliver coal, a source in the capital Ulaanbaatar said in January. The source said Mongolian authorities had also stopped Chinese truckers from picking up coal from the mine. Last week, the mine said it would weigh alternatives to guarantee electricity supply, after casting doubt on state plans to build a power plant in the region. Oyu Tolgoi is under pressure to procure power from domestic rather than Chinese sources within the next four years, as stipulated in a 2009 investment agreement.

2018-02-28,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan presidential candidate Henri Falcon said on Wednesday he would like a Wall Street economist, who sees dollarization as the solution for hyper-inflation in Venezuela, to play a big role on his team if he wins the upcoming election. Falcon said Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan who is chief economist at Torino Capital and advising him informally, would be the ideal leader of his economic team should he defeat socialist President Nicolas Maduro. “What is the cancer of Venezuela, apart from the government? The economy. So the economy is for specialists,” he told Reuters during an interview at his new offices in Caracas.  “Francisco is a man with many qualifications, but he is also a politician recognized internally and abroad ... We need to build a really good team led by a great economist, that’s Francisco Rodriguez.” Rodriguez, one of the most influential analysts of Venezuela’s dysfunctional economy, has recently been suggesting the bolivar currency should be scrapped for the U.S. dollar as an extreme measure to fix runaway inflation by stopping the government from printing excess money.  Rodriguez also believes Venezuela - in the fifth year of crippling recession that has left millions hungry and created widespread shortages - would receive major help from international loan bodies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund under a new government. Speaking to Reuters earlier on Wednesday on the sidelines of a Caracas forum, Rodriguez confirmed he was giving informal advice to Falcon. “I’m a friend, I respect him,” he said. He told the forum Falcon would make an excellent president. “This country cannot survive six more years of Nicolas Maduro, this country doesn’t deserve that,” he added. Falcon, a former state governor who has broken with an opposition boycott to run against Maduro, said he would prioritize repairing relations with Washington should he win the vote slated for April 22. While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences. “The United States would have a potential ally in a new Venezuelan government,” said Falcon, who defines himself as a center-leftist in favor of both market-friendly policies and strong welfare protection programs.  Falcon implied he disagreed with possible U.S. oil sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela, saying he opposed any measures that “end up hurting the poor.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has already slapped some individual sanctions on officials it deems guilty of rights abuses or eroding democracy in Venezuela, and has also imposed measures to block new financing for the government.  It is pondering measures against the oil sector if Maduro does not improve conditions for the election, which critics say has been rigged to legitimize “dictatorship.” Falcon, a 56-year-old former military man who supported the ruling socialists until a 2010 split, has drawn the wrath of Venezuela’s opposition coalition by throwing his hat into the ring and undercutting their boycott policy.  “Abstention is no use,” he said, pointing to past boycotts that had given the socialists big uncontested wins and arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change. “In world history, at least for the last two centuries, no government has won an election at a time of hyper-inflation,” he added, citing the price of a box of eggs equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the minimum monthly wage.   Prices in Venezuela rose more than 4,000 percent in the 12 months to the end of January,  according to estimates by the country’s opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists’ figures. Falcon is demanding improved election conditions, including a later vote date, U.N. observers, an end to “harassment” of Maduro opponents, and the removal of government handout booths known as “red spots” to curry favor with voters often set up near polling centers.   Without guarantees, he may withdraw his candidacy.  Falcon said he would like veteran Venezuelan politician Eduardo Fernandez, a former presidential candidate for opposition party COPEI, to be his foreign minister.  He would not be drawn on specific economic policy ideas, beyond saying he wanted to prioritize tackling inflation and supported a unified currency exchange system instead of the current mix of government and black market rates.

2018-02-28,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) * Domestic LNG plants restart since last week * Gas supply crunch ease as heating season draws to an end * State-owned gas producers cut off LNG plants to meet winter heating demand By Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason BEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - At least 10 of China’s domestic liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants have resumed output in the past week after the government cut off their supply, providing the first signs that the country’s gas supply crunch is starting to ease, company sources said. The return of the plants, which liquefy domestically produced gas that is then trucked to end-users, has raised LNG supply in China’s interior, pushing nationwide LNG prices lower. These restarts are also a sign that state-owned gas producers Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corp have resumed piping gas to the facilities after the government ordered them to divert shipments from the plants to residential users to make up a supply shortfall during the winter heating season. Yangcheng Shuntianda Gas Corp, based in China’s Shanxi province, southwest of the capital Beijing, has restarted its plant, with the capacity to liquefy 500,000 cubic metres of gas, after shutting in December, a sales manager at the company who only gave his surname of Wang told Reuters. “We lost 20 million yuan ($3.2 million) each month because we weren’t producing anything. Our boss was under extreme pressure from the bank to pay off loans,” said Wang. Yulin Huachen, which runs a similiar-sized plant in neighbouring Shaanxi province, resumed half of its production last weekend after closing for more than two months, said a company sales manager, who declined to be identified as he was not authorize to speak to the media. Sinopec and CNPC cut gas supplies to the LNG plants to meet the newly created demand from residential consumers. These buyers were converted to gas or electric heating ahead of this winter to reduce air pollution from coal-fired heating as part of the government’s war on smog. The companies could not cope with the extra demand because of inadequate infrastructure and insufficient domestic output. The government rules on the fuel switching also prioritised residential users over industrial consumers. CNPC and Sinopec declined to comment on whether they have resumed piped gas shipments to the LNG users. More of the LNG plants are expected to resume operations in the coming weeks as gas supplies improve, said Zhang Mengjie, gas analyst at Shandong-based Longzhong Information Group. Data from Longzhong shows the LNG plants were operating at just 27 percent of capacity last week, versus 38 percent a year ago and a typical level of 50 percent. The 27 percent is equivalent to daily output of 23 million cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations, based on overall daily operating capacity of 85.6 million cubic metres. Chinese LNG prices have fallen as the plants return to production and as some end-users remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The daily wholesale LNG price index tracking spot prices across the country assessed by industry publication www.yeslng.com fell 5.4 percent to 4,659 yuan per tonne from Monday to Wednesday. “Demand from downstream users is not very good now as some of them remain on holiday and won’t be back until next week,” said Diao Zhouwei, a natural gas analyst at IHS Markit. “With the weather getting warmer, demand from residential users is declining, which leaves more fuel for the industrial sector.” $1 = 6.3275 Chinese yuan renminbi

2018-02-28,"(Repeats with no change to text) By Jake Spring BRASILIA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld major changes to laws that protect the Amazon and other biomes, reducing penalties for past illegal deforestation in a blow to environmentalists trying to protect the world’s largest rainforest. Congress agreed to sweeping revisions in the law in 2012 that included an amnesty program for illegal deforestation on “small properties” that occurred before 2008 and reduced restoration requirements in others. The changes effectively reduced deforested land that must be restored under previous rules by 112,000 square miles (290,000 square km), an area nearly the size of Italy, according to a 2014 study published in the journal Science. Environmentalists said that the revised laws, known collectively as the forest code, would create a culture in which illegal deforestation is acceptable. “This awards the guy who deforested, awards the guy who disobeyed the law,” said Nurit Bensusan, policy coordinator at the Brazilian non-governmental organization Instituto Socioambiental. “With this amnesty you create a climate that invites deforestation in the future. It creates the impression that if you deforest today, tomorrow you’ll be handed amnesty.” Farmers and the agriculture lobby argue that the new laws allowed for continued growth of the sector key to the Brazilian economy, without bogging it down in ajudicating crimes of the past. The court decision has finally brought legal certainty to rural producers by forgiving penalties for deforestation before 2008 provided they comply with the law as rewritten in 2012, said Rodrigo Lima, director of agriculture consultancy Agroicone. “If this apparatus had been struck down, for example...everyone who submits information on the rural land registry could be fined at any moment even as they are complying with the (current) law.” The protections in question include those that apply to the Amazon rainforest, the majority of which lies in Brazil, which is vital to soaking up carbon emissions and countering climate change. Deforestation in the Amazon fell in the August 2016 to July 2017 monitoring period for the first time in three years, although the 6,624 square km (2,557 square miles) cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in 2012 and targets for slowing climate change. In televised oral arguments, Attorney General Grace Mendonca defended the 2012 revisions as constitutional saying that they had been designed to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic development. But many parts of the law designed to protect the environment have not been enforced with measures such as a national registry of rural land still not fully implemented.

2018-02-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production shattered a 47-year output record in November and retreated slightly in December, the U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday, as oil production from shale continued to upend global supply patterns. Oil output rose to 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, a revision from earlier estimates, the EIA said. December production fell 108,000 bpd to 9.949 million bpd, it said. November’s figure exceeded the 10.044 million barrels produced daily in November 1970. Output has surged in the last several years due to the shale boom, pushing the United States past Saudi Arabia among top producers. Only Russia now has greater daily oil output. The new record probably will not last. The U.S. government forecasts production will hit 11 million barrels per day later this year.  “We’ve got a lot more oil to produce and we’ll be through that 11 million barrel-per-day threshold much sooner than expected,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. The gains are primarily due to rising production in shale regions in Texas and North Dakota. Output there ramped up sharply at the beginning of the decade as new techniques involving hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, allowed drillers to extract vast quantities of crude from oil fields.  The increase in crude output has cut U.S. oil imports by a fifth over a decade, and boosted energy exports.  Soaring U.S. production kept a lid on oil prices this year, even though the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have reduced output. In December, production pulled back after three consecutive increases, according to the EIA. The decline was driven by offshore Gulf of Mexico output, which dropped by 131,000 bpd in the month. Four Gulf of Mexico platforms were shuttered throughout the month after a fire. The EIA said total crude oil and products demand in December was 20.08 million bpd, up about 0.5 percent from 19.98 million bpd a year earlier and down about 1 percent from the previous month. Americans consumed 0.01 percent less gasoline in 2017 than they did in the prior year, EIA data showed, marking the first year-to-year decrease since 2012.  U.S. gasoline demand was 9.32 million barrels in 2017, the data showed. Demand for gasoline hit record levels in 2016, averaging 9.326 million barrels per day. U.S. natural gas production in the lower 48 states rose to a monthly all-time high of 87.1 billion cubic feet per day in December, from the prior record of 86.4 bcfd in November, the EIA said.  The increase was driven by a 3.1 percent gain in Pennsylvania to a record 16.2 bcfd, and a 3.7 percent gain in Louisiana to 7.0 bcfd. Output in Texas, the largest U.S. gas producer, eased 0.2 percent to 22.7 bcfd.

2018-02-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, after official data showed a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. crude inventories and a surprise build in gasoline stocks. U.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels for the week ending Feb. 23, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels. Gasoline stocks also rose surprisingly. [EIA/S] “We had another pretty sizable build, and with that it kind of seemed like this recent bull market had the carpet pulled out from underneath it,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. Brent crude futures fell for a second day after rising 6 straight sessions.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell $1.37, or 2.17 percent, to settle at $61.64 a barrel. Most-active Brent crude futures LCOv1 for delivery in May were down $1.79, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $64.73 a barrel. The April contract LCOc1 settled down 85 cents, or 1.28 percent, at $65.78 a barrel ahead of expiration.  Prices briefly pared losses after the U.S. Energy Information Administration released data showing crude production in December dipped to 9.95 million barrels, down 108,000 barrels per day (bpd) from November. Prices resumed their downward path after that report, in which the EIA also revised its November crude production figures upward to a record 10.057 million bpd. [EIA/PSM]  “The market did attempt a late day rally but because it’s the end of the month, a lot of hedge funds decided to try and take some profits,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group. Soaring U.S. production, which has risen by a fifth since mid-2016, has kept a lid on oil prices this year, even as OPEC has maintained its supply cuts. “We’ve got a lot more oil to produce and we’ll be through that 11 million barrel-per-day threshold much sooner than expected,” said Streible.  The entire energy complex was led lower by gasoline futures after a surprise build in U.S. gasoline stocks, which rose by 2.5 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 190,000-barrel drawdown. The most active U.S. gasoline futures RBc2 fell as much as 3.1 percent to $1.9354 a gallon.  The rise in inventories came even as refineries boosted activity in the most recent week. “In spite of refiners undergoing maintenance, they continue to process more crude compared to previous years adding to gasoline and diesel supply,” said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  The market was also pressured by the rising dollar and stock markets, said Flynn. Equities markets weakened on Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar .DXY hit a one-month high. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. Prices were pressured earlier after three of the world’s top crude consumers- China, India and Japan - reported a slowdown in monthly factory activity.

The court decision has finally brought legal certainty to rural producers by forgiving penalties for deforestation before 2008 provided they comply with the law as rewritten in 2012, said Rodrigo Lima, director of agriculture consultancy Agroicone. “If this apparatus had been struck down, for example...everyone who submits information on the rural land registry could be fined at any moment even as they are complying with the (current) law.” The protections in question include those that apply to the Amazon rainforest, the majority of which lies in Brazil, which is vital to soaking up carbon emissions and countering climate change. Deforestation in the Amazon fell in the August 2016 to July 2017 monitoring period for the first time in three years, although the 6,624 square km (2,557 square miles) cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in 2012 and targets for slowing climate change. In televised oral arguments, Attorney General Grace Mendonca defended the 2012 revisions as constitutional saying that they had been designed to strike a balance between environmental protection and economic development. But many parts of the law designed to protect the environment have not been enforced with measures such as a national registry of rural land still not fully implemented.

2018-02-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to five-week highs on Wednesday on the prospect of tighter monetary policy and an upbeat U.S. economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s new chief, while global equity markets slid on declines by China’s Tencent and Celgene Corp. Also pushing the greenback higher was euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low, which knocked the euro to six-week lows and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution in removing monetary stimulus in the region. The dollar in February posted its strongest monthly performance since November 2016 as it also rose to a two-month high against the Canadian dollar CAD= and a six-week high against sterling GBP=. “The dollar has found tailwinds in America’s sturdy economy and its hawkish central bank,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The dollar index .DXY gained 0.34 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.27 percent to $1.2198. The Japanese yen JPY= firmed 0.55 percent versus the greenback at 106.73 per dollar.  Stocks globally snapped a record 15-month winning streak, pulled lower by Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) because of its large stake in Singapore-based Sea Ltd (SE.N), an online gaming and e-commerce firm, and Celgene (CELG.O). Sea posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president, who was the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea ADR’s fell 10.6 percent in New York. Celgene said late Tuesday that U.S. health regulators rejected its application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug due to insufficient data. The surprise development will likely delay the entry to market of one of Celgene’s most important pipeline assets. Tencent fell 3.1 percent, the biggest drag on MSCI’s all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS, which fell 1.1 percent as Celgene closed down 9 percent.   The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares fell 0.72 percent to close at 1,487.20. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 380.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to 25,029.2.

Longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped on expectations that a faster pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases would cool U.S. inflation and economic growth. U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years drew in imports and depleted inventories. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 11/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8679 percent. Euro zone bond yields held near recent lows as inflation in the bloc slowed, potentially complicating the European Central Bank’s plan to remove stimulus and move towards raising rates. U.S. oil prices fell 2.3 percent and gasoline futures tumbled after the U.S. government said crude inventories rose more than expected while gasoline stocks posted a big build instead of the draw that was forecast.

2018-02-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told an agriculture conference on Wednesday that he and President Donald Trump support the country’s biofuels policy, and that any reports to the contrary are “fake news.” Perdue made the comments a day after Trump hosted a meeting with Cabinet officials and senators to discuss potential changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard to help refiners who say they are struggling under the program. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel. That meeting yielded no deal. “I can tell you Trump stands with corn farmers, biofuel farmers and the RFS,” Perdue told an audience at the Commodity Classic in Anaheim, California, according to a recording heard by Reuters. “I stand with him and with you.” He said media reports that the administration does not support the RFS are “fake news.” “I will not support any policy that diminishes demand, undermines the RFS or is harmful to agricultural producers,” Perdue said. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that Perdue made the comments. Trump’s meeting on Tuesday reflected rising concern in the White House over the current state of the RFS, which has increasingly divided two of Trump’s most important constituencies: the energy industry and rural farmers. A refining company in Pennsylvania, a state that often plays a key role deciding the outcome in national elections, last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy. This bolstered charges by the industry that the RFS is unfair and costly. The White House meeting was held at the request of Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and was intended to get  Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, both Republican senators from the corn state Iowa, to accept significant changes to the program aimed at providing financial relief to refiners. The senators said on Tuesday they were asked to support placing price caps at the center of the program in exchange for greater use of higher-ethanol blended gasoline. The administration was also considering allowing exported ethanol to qualify for credits under the program, the senators said. The senators said the proposals would gut the program and attempt to solve a problem - high costs for refiners - that does not exist.  Perdue offered a different perceptive of the meeting, describing it more as a listening session than a negotiation.  “He listened to both sides and told senators Grassley and Ernst that he will be strong for farmers and maintain the RFS,” Grassley said. The White House is expected to hold another meeting on Thursday with merchant refiners and biofuel groups, though a full list of participants was not immediately known.

2018-02-28,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A member of Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) board of directors sent a tweet on Wednesday that questioned the future of the oil industry given the rise of renewable energy technologies. “If #oil energy consumption is declining and #renewableenergy consumption is on the #rise, what does that mean for the future of the oil industry?” Dambisa Moyo, an economist and author who joined the oil company’s board in 2016, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning. The tweet, deleted less than five hours after it was posted, was accompanied by two graphics produced by the financial television network CNBC. One showed oil consumption slipping from 2005 through 2015 and the other showed renewable energy consumption rising across the same period.  Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and other oil producers have come under increasing pressure to invest less in oil projects and more in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies.       An active presence on Twitter with 189,000 followers, Moyo added several hashtags to her post that have been associated in the past with activists pushing for greater adoption of renewables by oil producers, including “#environment,” “#getsmarter” and “#happywarrior.” Moyo could not be reached for additional comment.  Chevron said the tweet showed the diversity of thought amongst its leadership. “This simply demonstrates that Chevron’s board takes into account multiple points of view on the important topic of the future of energy,” Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement.  Moyo, who tweets under the handle @dambisamoyo, is also a board member of Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO). John Watson, who retired as Chevron’s chairman and chief executive earlier this month, told Reuters last fall that he did not see demand for oil peaking in the foreseeable future.  The view is widely shared in the oil industry and leaders of the world’s biggest oil companies are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat from climate change policies or renewable technologies. Chevron reported a quarterly profit earlier this month that fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations, denting its stock price. The International Energy Agency said earlier this month it expects global oil demand to rise 1.4 million barrels per day this year.

2018-02-28,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A judge in Louisiana who halted development of a section of Energy Transfer Partners’ Bayou Bridge oil pipeline last week said on Tuesday that her decision was designed to prevent “further irreparable harm” to wetlands. U.S. district judge Shelly Dick on Friday issued a temporary injunction preventing work on an extension to the Bayou Bridge system, revoking a permit and siding with environmentalists and fishermen who have expressed concerns about its potential effect on the local economy and wildlife. The $750 million pipeline, which is already under construction, is intended to move crude oil from Lake Charles, Louisiana, to St. James, Louisiana, and pass through the Atchafalaya Basin, a nearly one million acre (400,000 hectare) wetland that is vital to the state’s flood protection system and commercial fishing industry. The court battle renews a struggle between the oil industry and environmentalists, who are using lawsuits to halt or delay new infrastructure projects. Energy Transfer Partners faced similar controversy over its Dakota Access Pipeline, which was temporarily halted following protests but ultimately began service last year. “Bayou Bridge Pipeline respectfully disagrees with the District Court’s ruling that the Army Corps of Engineers did not properly consider the limited impacts of construction in the Atchafalaya Basin,” a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners said by email on Wednesday.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted two comprehensive environmental reviews that found no significant impact in the basin, she said.  A representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to comment. Energy Transfer said this week that it was appealing the ruling.  Environmentalists and local fisherman say so-called spoil banks created during pipeline dredging disrupt natural water flow in the basin and suffocate crawfish.  Louisiana is home to large oil refineries and has many pipelines that cut across the Atchafalaya Basin. “The court confirmed that the Army Corps can’t just keep issuing more permits for pipelines in the Atchafalaya, and ignoring the fact that they are routinely violated,” Jan Hasselman, an attorney for Earthjustice, the group representing the plaintiffs, said on Wednesday.  “After decades of noncompliance with the law - which has devastated the Basin - there is a glimmer of hope that the oil and gas industry will start being held accountable,” he added.  The Association of Oil Pipe Lines, an industry group, said pipelines have the least amount of local environmental and climate change impacts compared with other transport methods.

2018-02-28,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz said on Wednesday Russia’s Gazprom would have to pay it $2.56 billion (1.86 billion pounds) after a Stockholm court found in Naftogaz’s favour in the final stage of a long-running legal battle. In June 2014, Gazprom and Naftogaz lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with the Stockholm arbitration court, which resolves commercial disputes. The disagreement was a by-product of the worsening relations between Kiev and Moscow since Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the eruption of Russian-backed separatist violence in Ukraine’s Donbass region, which has killed more than 10,000 people. The latest ruling in Stockholm, which concludes the legal dispute, centred on Naftogaz’s claims that it was owed compensation for Gazprom not pumping a certain volume of gas per year via Ukraine and paying too little for what it did send through Naftogaz pipelines. “Naftogaz was awarded damages of $4.63 billion for Gazprom’s failure to deliver the agreed transit gas volumes,” Naftogaz spokeswoman Olena Osmolovska said. There was no immediate comment from Gazprom. Since the court previously ordered Naftogaz to pay Gazprom for gas supply arrears, the net payment Gazprom will have to make to Ukraine is $2.56 billion, Osmolovska said. The Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce does not publish or comment on its rulings, leaving it up to parties involved to go public if they want to. In previous rulings, the court denied Gazprom’s claim linked to a ‘take-or-pay’ clause that required buyers to pay for gas whether they take physical delivery or not, and found in Naftogaz’s favour in terms of pricing. But it also ordered Naftogaz to pay $2 billion to Gazprom for the gas arrears and ruled that it should buy 5 bcm of gas from Gazprom annually from 2018.

2018-02-28,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudanese lawmakers have accused the consortium running the country’s last working oilfields of dumping expired chemicals in the bush, and have threatened to shut down production unless it stops. Members of parliament’s energy committee told the assembly they had seen containers holding old chemicals including potassium chloride in a remote area in the northeast, saying locals feared for their health. Reuters could not immediately verify the assertion. The DAR Petroleum Operating Company (DPOC) - which runs the northeastern neighboring oil blocks 3 and 7 near the borders of Sudan and Ethiopia - told Reuters it had no one available to comment.  Spokespeople and officials from the members of the consortium - China’s Sinopec and CNPC, Malaysia’s Petronas, South Sudan’s Nilepet and Egypt’s Tri-Ocean Energy - all declined to comment. Any move to go through with the threatened shutdown would deal another heavy blow to South Sudan’s economy, which depends on its crude reserves for almost all its revenues and has already been battered by more than four years of civil war. James Lual Deng Kuel, head of the energy committee, told parliament on Wednesday last week that members had found chemicals were being dumped 10 km (7 miles) from a village in a location known as the Gumry Expired Toxic Chemicals Yard. The boxes were “left exposed to the winds and rains that might blow and carry the toxic material (away)”, he said.     The accusation and threatened action mark the first time South Sudanese lawmakers have moved to enforce standards on protecting the environment laid out in a 2012 law governing the oil industry. The parliamentarians spoke to DPOC staff members at the site, according to a report submitted to parliament by the committee members, seen by Reuters. The lawmakers told parliament they had seen 36 shipping containers filled with expired chemicals that they said had come over the border from Sudan. They provided photographs of sacks and containers and, in the report, said the chemical was potassium chloride that had expired in October 2016. MP Susana Peter Machar told Reuters last week her delegation had also seen 14 additional shipping containers carrying expired chemicals arriving in Paloich by truck from Sudan.  She said that if the consortium did not halt what she described as dumping, “we will force them to shut down oil production and we are serious”. The oilfields are the last still operating in the impoverished country after conflict shut down others and froze investment. They are estimated to produce about 130,000 barrels per day - a third of the country’s peak reached before the war.

2018-02-28,"ABUJA (Reuters) - The national executive committee of Nigeria’s ruling party has passed a vote of confidence in its leaders including President Muhammadu Buhari, it said on Wednesday.  The committee, whose decisions determine the direction of the president’s All Progressives Congress (APC) party, held a one-day meeting which concluded late on Tuesday. In an emailed statement it said the body had approved a one-year extension for party executives, including Buhari.   “By this decision, all affected officers will continue in acting capacity for another period of 12 months after the expiration of their current term,” it said in the statement. Nigeria’s parties must select their candidates for the 2019 presidential election between Aug. 18 and Oct. 7 this year. Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on Feb. 16, 2019.   Two senior party sources told Reuters on Wednesday that the national executive committee had endorsed Buhari to seek a second term in next year’s election. Buhari, 75, has not said whether he intends to seek re-election.  “The party made it clear that this endorsement is not an automatic ticket for the president,” one of the sources said, adding that the party would still conduct a presidential primary to be fair to other potential candidates. The national executive committee is made up of party grandees, including many state governors who have already publicly stated their support for any bid by Buhari to seek re-election.  But a presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the election had not been discussed.  “A vote of confidence was passed on the president and the  national chairman. Nothing about the presidential election was discussed,” said Adesina.  Buhari won power in May 2015 but spent five months on medical leave in Britain last year for an unspecified ailment, raising questions over whether he was well enough to stand again. Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria’s minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari’s 2015 campaign, said in January he would chair a group to support the re-election of Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Campaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again.

2018-02-28,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudanese lawmakers have accused the consortium running the country’s last working oilfields of dumping expired chemicals in the bush, and have threatened to shut down production unless it stops. Members of parliament’s energy committee told the assembly they had seen containers holding old chemicals including potassium chloride in a remote area in the northeast, saying locals feared for their health. Reuters could not immediately verify the assertion. The DAR Petroleum Operating Company (DPOC) - which runs the northeastern neighboring oil blocks 3 and 7 near the borders of Sudan and Ethiopia - told Reuters it had no one available to comment.  Spokespeople and officials from the members of the consortium - China’s Sinopec and CNPC, Malaysia’s Petronas, South Sudan’s Nilepet and Egypt’s Tri-Ocean Energy - all declined to comment. Any move to go through with the threatened shutdown would deal another heavy blow to South Sudan’s economy, which depends on its crude reserves for almost all its revenues and has already been battered by more than four years of civil war. James Lual Deng Kuel, head of the energy committee, told parliament on Wednesday last week that members had found chemicals were being dumped 10 km (7 miles) from a village in a location known as the Gumry Expired Toxic Chemicals Yard. The boxes were “left exposed to the winds and rains that might blow and carry the toxic material (away)”, he said.     The accusation and threatened action mark the first time South Sudanese lawmakers have moved to enforce standards on protecting the environment laid out in a 2012 law governing the oil industry. The parliamentarians spoke to DPOC staff members at the site, according to a report submitted to parliament by the committee members, seen by Reuters. The lawmakers told parliament they had seen 36 shipping containers filled with expired chemicals that they said had come over the border from Sudan. They provided photographs of sacks and containers and, in the report, said the chemical was potassium chloride that had expired in October 2016. MP Susana Peter Machar told Reuters last week her delegation had also seen 14 additional shipping containers carrying expired chemicals arriving in Paloich by truck from Sudan.  She said that if the consortium did not halt what she described as dumping, “we will force them to shut down oil production and we are serious”. The oilfields are the last still operating in the impoverished country after conflict shut down others and froze investment. They are estimated to produce about 130,000 barrels per day - a third of the country’s peak reached before the war.

2018-02-28,"(Adds details on each refinery, context and quote) By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Venezuelan PDVSA’s refineries will operate at 43 percent of their total capacity in March due to a lack of spare parts, light crude and feedstock, according to an internal document from the state-run firm seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The company’s refineries in Venezuela and the Caribbean have been hit by the OPEC-member’s oil output decline, leaving PDVSA short of the crude grades its facilities need to produce fuels for the domestic market and for export. A severe lack of cash stemming from export and production declines has led to delays in buying spare parts and equipment for needed maintenance, while limiting the volume of imported products, diluents and feedstock the firm can afford. PDVSA’s refining network plans to process 701,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan and imported crude next month, a slight increase versus an average of 660,000 bpd in March last year. That is still low compared to its total installed capacity of 1.62 million bpd, including the Isla refinery in Curacao. The Venezuelan domestic market’s fuel consumption, which surpassed 700,000 bpd a decade ago, has declined in recent years amid a long economic recession, hyperinflation and lack of basic medicine and food, which are forcing Venezuelans to skip meals and leave the country. PDVSA estimates the domestic market will consume some 425,000 bpd in March. But because of its refining system’s low operating level, PDVSA’s declining output and oil-for-loan pacts requiring the firm to export fuels to repay debts, the company will still require 293,200 bpd of imported products, diluents and crude in March, the report said. Last year, Venezuela faced intermittent shortages of gasoline and other fuels. PDVSA has ramped up its requests to buy imported crude and fuels on the open market since December. Last week it awarded tenders to buy Russian oil, gasoline blend stock, catalytic naphtha, vacuum gasoil, diesel and components for gasoline, according to offers seen by Reuters. The 655,000-bpd Amuay refinery, Venezuela’s largest, will process 303,000 bpd of crude next month due to lack of spare parts and equipment malfunctions, the report said. That volume includes 35,000 bpd of upgraded oil coming from the Petropiar joint venture with U.S. oil firm Chevron Corp . Amuay’s flexicoker, delayed coker, hydrotreater, alkylation unit and one of its crude distillation units are expected to remain out of service, while its fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) and two other distillation units will operate with limitations, the document said. At the 310,000-bpd Cardon, two crude distillation units will remain under maintenance, while two hydrotreaters, the alkylation units, the hydrodesulfurization unit (HDS) and the catalytic cracker will operate with restrictions due to lack of input, limiting crude processing to 110,000 bpd. Venezuela’s two smallest refineries, the 187,000-bpd Puerto la Cruz and the 146,000 bpd El Palito, will also operate with constraints due to insufficient feedstock and lack of spare parts, according to the report. “We are considering importing crude for El Palito refinery to maintain in service the distillation and medium conversion units,” the report said. El Palito is expected to process 85,000 bpd and Puerto la Cruz will process 146,000 bpd in March. The Isla refinery in Curacao will process 56,000 bpd in March due to maintenance work planned to finish in mid-April at one of crude distillation units, the alkylation unit, the FCC, the hydrotreater and the reformer. Most of the crude input will come from imports, according to the document.

2018-02-28,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria’s people are getting poorer despite the country’s slow recovery from recession, and economic reforms are urgently needed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a report seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The Fund expects the government to “muddle through” in the medium term, and any progress could also be threatened if elections next year consume political energy and resources, the report said. Since emerging from recession in the second quarter of 2017, Nigerian officials have repeatedly boasted that they have set the economy back on track. But critics say much of the recovery comes from a return to oil dependence after a rise in global oil prices and a rebound in crude production - more the result of militants in the Niger Delta halting attacks on oil facilities than of economic policy under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. The IMF said in the report that the outlook for growth has improved but remains challenging.  “Comprehensive and coherent” economic policies “remain urgent and must not be delayed by approaching elections and recovering oil prices,” it said in its annual Article IV review of Nigeria’s economy. “Higher oil prices would support a recovery in 2018 but a ‘muddle-through’ outlook is projected for the medium term under current policies, with fiscal dominance and structural constraints leading to continuing falls in real GDP per capita,” the IMF said. In the report, it identified risks to growth including additional delays to implementing policies and reforms ahead of 2019 elections, security tensions, and oil prices, a fall in which could see capital flows reversed. “Further delays in policy action — including because of pre-election pressures — can only make the inevitable adjustment more difficult and costlier,” the report said. The lender repeated its call for Nigeria to simplify its complex foreign exchange system, a bugbear for the IMF for more than a year which has left large gaps between official rates and various windows that certain groups can use to get other rates. “Moving towards a unified exchange rate should be pursued as soon as possible,” the IMF said. “(IMF) staff does not support the exchange measures that have given rise to the exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices.” The Fund further singled out the central bank, saying it should discontinue direct interventions in the economy. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) frequently injects hundreds of millions of dollars into the foreign exchange market to keep its own rates stable. Commercial banks struggling to remain solvent were also called out, but not identified by the IMF, including one that the lender said was already insolvent: “Some of these banks are kept afloat through continuous recourse to the CBN’s lending facilities.” The IMF said it does not comment on purported leaks. A spokeswoman for the Fund said a statement would be issued after the lender’s board meets to discuss its assessment on Friday. A Nigerian finance ministry spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a phone call and email requesting comment.

Also pushing the dollar higher was euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low, which knocked the euro to six-week lows, and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution in removing stimulus in the region. The greenback in February was poised to post its best monthly performance since November 2016 as it also rose to three-week highs against the Swiss franc, a two-week peak versus sterling and a two-month high against the Canadian dollar. “The dollar has found tailwinds in America’s sturdy economy and its hawkish central bank,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst, at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The dollar index rose 0.25 percent, with the euro down 0.23 percent to $1.2203. The Japanese yen firmed 0.58 percent versus the greenback at 106.70 per dollar. World stocks were set to snap a record 15-month long winning streak, pulled lower by mining heavyweights Rio Tinto and Glencore after weak factory data from China and a slide in Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings. Singapore-based Sea Ltd, an online gaming and e-commerce firm that counts Tencent as its biggest shareholder, posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president - the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea Limited was down 9.95 percent. Business disruption due to Lunar New Year holidays and curbs to factory output from tougher pollution rules drove the weakness, but there are worries of a bigger loss in momentum. Rio Tinto fell 3.0 percent and Glencore slid 2.56 percent, helping pull the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares down 0.65 percent to a provisional close of 1,488.26. Miners were some of the biggest decliners in London after growth in China’s manufacturing sector in February cooled to the weakest in more than 1-1/2 years. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 34.13 points, or 0.13 percent, to 25,375.9. The S&P 500 lost 1.14 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,743.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.61 points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,330.96. Longer-dated yields slipped on expectations that a faster pace of Fed rate increases would cool U.S. inflation and economic growth. U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years drew in imports and depleted inventories. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 8/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8806 percent. Euro zone bond yields held near recent lows as inflation in the bloc slowed, potentially complicating the European Central Bank’s plan to remove monetary stimulus and move towards raising rates. Oil prices fell almost 2 percent and gasoline futures tumbled after the U.S. government said crude inventories rose more than expected while gasoline stocks posted a big build instead of the draw that was forecast. U.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels for the week ending Feb. 23, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels. U.S. crude fell $1.18 to $61.83 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.53, down $1.10 on the day. Reporting by Herbert Lash

2018-02-28,"* Oil output forecast at 1.6 mln barrels per day in 2018 * Sonangol chairman targets investment and exploration * Chairman says debt down to $5 bln, from $14 bln in 2015 (Adds Sonangol debt figure, chairman quote) By Stephen Eisenhammer LUANDA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Oil output in Angola, Africa’s No. 2 crude producer, is forecast to total around 1.6 million barrels per day in 2018, the chairman of state-run oil company Sonangol said on Wednesday, close to the 1.632 million bpd it averaged last year. Sonangol’s Carlos Saturnino said he aimed to keep production steady by launching fresh investment and exploration in the sector, with Angola facing a gradual decline in oil output as aging fields become less productive. The fall in crude prices has devastated government finances over the past few years as oil makes up 95 percent of exports. In 2016, Angola produced 1.72 million bpd but output has been partly constrained since then by OPEC-mandated cuts. Speaking at a news conference in Luanda, Saturnino said net profit for Sonangol, which regulates Angola’s oil sector, was $224 million in 2017 versus $81 million the previous year when oil prices were lower. Debt in 2017 fell to around $5 billion from $14 billion in 2015, Saturnino said, due mainly to a government cash injection of about $10 billion over that period. Of the current $5 billion in debt, Saturnino said just under $2 billion was with Chinese banks, namely the China Development Bank and Bank of China. It was Saturnino’s first briefing since Angolan President João Lourenço fired Isabel dos Santos, daughter of his presidential predecessor, from the helm of Sonangol. Lourenço took power in September and is seeking to win credibility with international investors and shed Angola’s image as an opaque oil economy with rampant corruption. Saturnino said Sonangol had been “sick” when he took over in November and criticised the previous administration as being over-reliant on costly consultants and having conflicts of interest. “Sonangol is sick, it has challenges... but it’s trying to treat itself, to re-gain muscle and in time it will run and sprint again,” he said to loud applause from employees.

2018-02-28,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC oil output fell in February to a 10-month low as the United Arab Emirates joined other Gulf members in over-delivering on a supply reduction pact, a Reuters survey found, pushing compliance with the deal to its highest yet. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.28 million barrels per day in February, the survey found, down 70,000 bpd from January. The February total is the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys. Adherence by producers included in the deal rose to 149 percent of agreed cuts from a revised 144 percent in January, the survey found, suggesting a jump in prices early this year to their highest since 2014 has not weakened commitment. Oil in January topped $71 a barrel LCOc1 for the first time since 2014, and was trading above $66 on Wednesday. Still, OPEC says supply restraints should be maintained to ensure the end of a glut that has built up since 2014. “We still feel that the job is not complete,” UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told Reuters this month. “The price is one thing, rebalancing the market is something else and we need to balance the market.” OPEC is reducing output by about 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. The pact started in January 2017 and will run until the end of 2018. In February, the biggest decrease in supply came from the UAE, which holds the rotating OPEC presidency this year and was slower than its Gulf OPEC allies in 2017 to meet its supply-cut commitments fully. UAE output has fallen by 50,000 bpd to below its OPEC target, sources in the survey said, reflecting an effort to step up compliance and planned oilfield maintenance. The second-largest drop occurred in Libya, where output fell by 30,000 bpd because of the closure of the El Feel oilfield after a protest by guards. This set back a recovery in Libyan supply, which had hit 1 million bpd in January. Production has fallen further in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of a cash crunch, the survey found. Exports fell in February although refinery operations increased, sources in the survey said. Output in OPEC’s two largest producers was little changed. Top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady close to 10 million bpd, according to sources in the survey. Supply remains below the kingdom’s OPEC target. OPEC’s No. 2 producer Iraq exported fewer barrels from the south, the outlet for most of its crude, as bad weather delayed shipments. The country exported more from the north. Northern Iraqi exports could rise following an agreement by the government with Kurdish authorities to resume Kirkuk oil exports through Turkey’s Ceyhan port, although a specific timeframe was not disclosed. Among countries with higher output, the largest gain of only 20,000 bpd was in Nigeria, the survey found. Nigeria and Libya were originally exempt from cutting supply because their output had been curbed already by conflict and unrest. For 2018, both countries told OPEC that output would not exceed 2017 levels, ministers and delegates said. OPEC has an implied production target for 2018 of 32.73  million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and taking into account changes of membership since, plus Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output. According to the survey, OPEC pumped 450,000 bpd below this implied target in February - not least because of the involuntary decline in Venezuela. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-02-28,"* Rating takes Eskom deeper into junk status * Eskom says working on turnaround strategy * Utility secured $2 billion short-term loan (Adds Eskom comment, gets new loan) By Ed Stoddard and Nqobile Dludla JOHANNESBURG, Feb 28 (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit rating for South Africa’s state-run power utility Eskom to CCC+ from B- on Wednesday, citing liquidity concerns and insufficient government support that left it at risk of a default. Cash-strapped Eskom provides virtually all of South Africa’s power and is seen as a risk to the sovereign rating of Africa’s most industrialised economy after years of mismanagement and shoddy governance. Eskom, which has been facing serious liquidity issues, appointed a new board of directors last month to resolve a leadership crisis. New President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday appointed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan as public enterprises minister, in charge of state firms such as Eskom. Gordhan, who has been part of a parliamentary probe into Eskom’s woes, is a popular figure with investors, and there will be high expectations for him to clean up state-owned firms. S&P’s latest decision on Eskom takes it deeper into junk status, seven notches below investment grade into territory described as a “substantial risk”. The ratings agency also placed Eskom on a “negative” outlook. “Eskom remains at risk of facing a distressed exchange situation or default in the next six months despite securing 30 billion rand ($2.6 billion) in short-term funding from local and international funders so far this year,” S&P said. “We now believe there is a lower likelihood that Eskom would receive extraordinary support from the government, reflecting our view that government support for the utility over the past few months has been insufficient given that the utility’s liquidity concerns persist,” it said in a statement. Eskom said it wanted to provide “enough comfort to investors” and would continue to engage with the rating agencies and other players to implement a turnaround strategy. Eskom’s interim Group Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said the state had provided support to solve its liquidity problems. Acting Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim said: “The timing of the downgrade is unfortunate as we believe that we are starting to see slight improvements in market sentiments.” Eskom also said it had agreed a 20 billion rand credit facility with seven local and international banks. Eskom’s dollar-denominated Eurobonds fell across the curve after the downgrade, with Eskom’s 2023 eurobond falling 1 cent to 102.9 cents to the dollar according to Tradeweb.  The 2025 issue fell 0.7 cents to 104.5 cents. Investors in the utility’s bonds were confident the changes in government would help the utility attract funding. “Eskom will have an easier time than in December to finance itself, to get bridge financing and continue on. This is a more market friendly government than the previous one,” said Kaan Nazli, senior economist at Neuberger Berman, which holds Eskom bonds across the curve. Local fund manager Futuregrowth, which in 2016 stopped purchasing Eskom bonds over governance concerns said it would “wait-and-see” before deciding to reinvest. “It’s not for investors to prescribe to Eskom what changes to make. But decisions do need to be made by the board to put Eskom back on to sound operational footing,” Futuregrowth’s Olga Constantatos said. $1 = 11.7194 rand

2018-02-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world’s biggest automotive supplier, has decided against producing its own battery cells, saying the billions of euros of investment needed was too risky. The decision is a blow to European politicians and car manufacturers who have called for companies to band together to create a regional battery cell producer to compete with Asian players such as Samsung (005930.KS) and Panasonic (6752.T). “Given dynamic external market factors that can only be predicted with difficulty, it is unclear whether this investment would pay off for Bosch, and when,” Bosch said in a statement on Wednesday. Bosch had said it would only consider making battery cells if there was a chance it could capture a fifth of that market by 2030, a move it said would require about 20 billion euros (£17.7 billion) of investment to create 200 gigawatt hours of capacity. “In the overall interest of the company, such an investment is not justifiable,” Rolf Bulander, head of mobility solutions said on a conference call. “For new entrants, market conditions are more than challenging.” Bosch said it would continue to work with cell suppliers to design cells for hybrid- and electric-vehicle batteries, and buy these cells from them. “To be a significant player in electric mobility we don’t need to produce the cells by ourselves,” Bulander said. The company said it was therefore halting its research into cell technologies which had cost it in the region of 500 million euros, and dissolved the Lithium Energy and Power GmbH & Co. KG (LEAP) joint venture for lithium-ion technology. Bosch also plans to sell U.S. start-up Seeo Inc. which it bought in 2015 to enhance its expertise in next-generation lithium-ion batteries and already has potential buyers, said Bulander, declining to elaborate. Separately, Bosch said it did not expect a decline in registrations of diesel-engine cars to accelerate after Germany’s top administrative court on Tuesday removed uncertainty over the legality of diesel bans in cities. “The market is looking for secure framework conditions, then it will decide in favour of diesel vehicles,” Bulander said, noting current diesel models complied with emissions limits.

2018-02-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s government scrambled on Wednesday to find ways to avoid bans on heavily polluting diesel vehicles in major cities, seeking to reassure drivers and carmakers after a court ruled that local authorities were allowed to bar them. Tuesday’s ruling to allow city bans embarrassed Angela Merkel’s government, criticized for having cosy ties with the auto industry which employs some 800,000 people, and raises pressure on manufacturers to make costly modifications to vehicles.  In Germany, where motorists expect to drive powerful cars in cities and on motorways with no speed limits, any restrictions will be unpopular. Yet air quality is also a big concern, with green and consumer groups pushing for action.  Merkel’s government is at pains to play down the prospect of widespread bans which, companies say, could cut the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. Bans could also herald the end of the combustion engine, which Germans pride themselves on having invented.  “This is a complicated topic. There are different situations in different cities,” said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. Overall, some 70 cities, including Hamburg and Stuttgart, have been found to have excess levels of nitrogen oxide (NOx).  Seibert said NOx levels had fallen in recent years and many cities would not have to resort to bans. But he acknowledged solutions were needed for cities with significantly higher levels of the gas which can cause respiratory diseases. He added that a new government under conservative Merkel would consider the option of introducing a nationwide blue badge scheme to indicate how clean a car is. Details of any such schemes have not been agreed. Until now, the Environment Ministry has favored this option, arguing it would help local authorities control bans. However, opposition is also strong. “Blue badges are a more positive way of describing a ‘driving ban’ and I am very doubtful about that,” said Stephan Weil, premier of the state of Lower Saxony, home to Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Europe’s biggest carmaker. Since VW in 2015 admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers, also including Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), have faced a backlash against diesel technology, in which they have invested billions. While slowly moving toward electric cars and committing to software changes, critics accuse the government of skirting bigger steps such as phasing out diesel. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Rome, one of Europe’s most traffic-clogged cities, plans to ban diesel cars from its center by 2024, its mayor said, and a number of other European cities are considering curbs. Carmakers in Germany are also trying to avoid expensive hardware modifications to exhaust systems. Weil said refits were not a panacea, especially not for smaller cars with little room for additional equipment. “I prefer a modernization of the diesel fleet,” he told Die Welt daily. “The solution is modern, low-emission vehicles that do not, or barely, pollute the air ... and an expansion of electric vehicles,” he said.  One factor complicating any policymaking on a national basis is a difference in emphasis within the German government, which until now has been a coalition of Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD). Merkel hopes to renew that coalition but needs the approval of SPD members. Results of a ballot on the deal will be announced on Sunday and a government could be in place in March.  Differences were evident on Wednesday when a spokesman for the transport ministry, run by conservatives, said hardware modifications to diesel cars could be very expensive and must bear some relation to the value of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Justice and Consumer Affairs Minister Heiko Maas, of the SPD, said carmakers must take responsibility. “Drivers must not foot the bill for the failures of the auto industry,” Maas told the Rheinische Post daily, adding software upgrades were insufficient. He also said the possibility of class-action lawsuits outlined in the coalition deal would help diesel car owners, a measure demanded by consumer groups after the VW scandal. Other measures floated include introducing free public transport in some cities. At the weekend, documents seen by Reuters showed the government was considering bans on certain routes on an emergency basis.

2018-02-28,"* Majority of lawmakers approve lease agreements for exploration * Licences for four blocks were pending parliament approval * Energy minister says Greece turning new page in hydrocarbons ATHENS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Greece’s parliament gave the go-ahead on Wednesday for companies including France’s Total and Italy’s Edison to explore for oil and gas in the west of the country. Licences for four blocks - one offshore and three on land  - were awarded in 2016 but had to be ratified by parliament for exploration work to begin. Encouraged by recent large gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean, Greece is eager to attract investment in its energy sector as it tries to emerge from years of economic crisis. Western Greece is an underexplored area and very little data exists on its hydrocarbon potential. A Total-led consortium with Edison and Greece’s biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum was awarded Block 2 in the Ionian Sea; Hellenic Petroleum was also awarded the Arta-Preveza and northwestern Peloponnese onshore blocks and Energean, Greece’s only oil producer, the Aitoloakarnania onshore block. Hellenic Petroleum holds an exploration licence in the Patraikos Gulf off the Peloponnese peninsula and plans the first test drilling there in 2019. Energean also plans to start drilling in another field off the peninsula in 2019. “We are turning a new page in the chapter of tapping into hydrocarbons,” Energy Minister George Stathakis told parliament before the vote. He said the country was slowly catching up with Cyprus, Israel and Egypt. Total has shown interest in the eastern Mediterranean following major gas discoveries off Israel and Egypt. It is currently drilling for oil off Cyprus. Together with Hellenic Petroleum and U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil, it has also expressed interest in exploration at two sites off Crete, prompting Greece to launch a tender. The Greek branches of Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) had called on lawmakers to reject the bills ratifying the contracts, saying iconic and ecologically sensitive marine and coastal areas were at great risk. The bills “trapped the country in a growth model that is extremely polluting and dangerous to humans and the environment,” they said in a statement. Stathakis said Greece will make sure that strict environmental rules will be applied.

2018-02-28,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Wednesday he expected the first shipment of weapons from the United States in the next few weeks. In December, the United States angered Moscow when it approved the provision of weapons to support Ukraine in its nearly four-year-old conflict with pro-Russian rebels. In response to a question about when the delivery would take place, Poroshenko said talks with the United States about this topic had been progressing well. “The first delivery should happen in a very few weeks,” he said at a news conference in Kiev. Russian officials have said the decision to supply weapons to Ukraine is dangerous as it would encourage Kiev to use force in the eastern conflict zone. The United States says the weapons it plans to supply, which include Javelin anti-tank missiles, would help stabilise the situation and cannot effectively be used to take territory. More than 10,000 people have been killed since April 2014 in a conflict that pits Ukrainian forces against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

2018-02-28,"COLOMBO (Reuters) - Maldives on Wednesday denied a Japanese foreign ministry statement that said a Maldives-flagged vessel was used to illegally transfer goods from a North Korean-flagged tanker in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Japanese statement said the “Chon Ma San”, designated by the United States as a sanctions target, was spotted by a surveillance plane with the Maldivian-flagged tanker “Xin Yuan 18” some 250 km (160 miles) east of Shanghai on Saturday. It said “Japan strongly suspects that the vessels conducted ship-to-ship transfers” banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions. Maldives government denied that Xin Yuan 18 is of Maldivian origin and said “no such vessel is registered in the country.”  “We condemn ... the use of our national flag in a manner so as to tarnish the good standing and reputation of our nation,” the Maldives government said in a statement. It said Maldives has prioritised the implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions including those on North Korea. Authorities do not allow flags of convenience to foreign owned vessels to operate outside Maldivian waters, it said, adding that the government was investigating. “The Maldives will pursue aggressive action against any such acts which affects the national identity in such a detrimental manner,” it said.  The Maldives is facing a political crisis that has hurt tourism, its main revenue source and any international action could hurt its economy further, analysts say. It is the fourth time Japan has suspected such an illegal transfer in recent weeks and comes as Washington and key Asian allies preparer to expand the interceptions of ships suspected of violating North Korean sanctions.  North Korea last year conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States, triggering deeper U.N. Security Council sanctions.  Washington on Friday slapped sanctions on dozens more companies and vessels linked to North Korea’s shipping trade and urged the United Nations to blacklist some entities to shut down smuggling aimed at obtaining oil and selling coal.

The RTE said that at 0941 Central European Time (CET), French power usage had peaked at 94,817 megawatts, just above last winter’s peak of 94,190 MW on Jan 20, 2017, but well below the 2012 peak of 102,098 MW on Feb. 8, 2012 and the 96,700 MW peak in 2010. French peak power consumption - which typically lasts just 15 to 30 minutes in the early evening - has gradually increased over the past 15 years. In 2000, the peak was at 79,600 MW, rising to 89,000 MW in 2007 and rising above 90,000 MW for the first time in 2009 with a peak of 92,400 MW. With about a third of all homes relying on electricity for heating, French power demand is highly sensitive to the change in temperatures, with a fall of one degree corresponding to about 2,400 MW of extra power demand, the equivalent of two large nuclear reactors.

The 0.3-percent increase was short of economists’ forecasts for a gain of 0.5 percent. Of the 21 major commodity groups, prices were up in seven and down in 10, leaving four unchanged. Prices for energy and petroleum products rose 3.4 percent, driven by more expensive motor gasoline, diesel fuel and light fuel oils. Excluding the energy and petroleum category, producer prices were down 0.1 percent. The overall increase was also tempered by a 0.9-percent decline in the vehicles sector, due to lower prices for vehicle engines and parts, as well as aircraft and parts. The appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the greenback in January also had an impact on the figures as some producer prices are reported in U.S. dollars. If the exchange rate had held constant, overall producer prices would have increased 1 percent, the statistics agency said.

2018-02-28,"BERLIN, Feb 28 (Reuters) - German cities are able to ban the most polluting diesel cars after a landmark court ruling, allowing them to decide the extent to which any curbs should be implemented if at all. Tuesday’s ruling by Germany’s highest administrative court in Leipzig is expected to further drive the shift away from combustion engines and could force carmakers to pay to improve exhaust systems. Here are some of the possible consequences for German automakers and drivers after the ruling which may hit the value of 12 million vehicles in Europe’s largest car market. Any driving bans would probably affect vehicles equipped with Euro-5 emissions-control technology and older models. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads last year, about 2.7 million were fitted with the latest Euro-6 standard, which has applied to all new cars sold since September 2015, according to the KBA motor vehicle watchdog. The court said there will be no right to financial compensation for car owners in the wake of possible driving bans but it called for “proportionality”. Possible bans should affect only older models with the highest emissions and curbs must be accompanied by “sufficient exceptions” for groups relying heavily on diesel cars and vans including city residents and tradespeople such as delivery, repair and emergency workers, it said. Authorities in about 70 German cities including Munich, Hamburg and Stuttgart which were found to have excess levels of toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) have started deliberating if and how they will adjust clean air programmes to comply with the ruling. Hamburg said it would start implementing limits on diesel vehicles from the end of April. Stuttgart said it would take about six months to redraw anti-pollution strategies before deciding on concrete steps. Civil movements and environmentalists have reinforced calls on the government to end their cosy ties with automakers and force the industry to swallow the costs of upgrading diesel exhaust cleaning systems. Carmakers have so far rejected costly hardware changes, saying retrofitted vehicles would end up consuming more fuel and emitting more carbon dioxide. The court made clear that uniform nationwide rules on tackling diesel pollution are not necessary. But with the ruling seen as a precedent for all cities in Germany, it will revive discussion about introducing ways to label cleaner diesel cars, for instance via so-called blue badges. Germany’s would-be coalition parties, the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, have made no provisions in their hard-fought policy platform for a blue badge. Environmentalists said blue badges are inexpensive and easy to implement while critics including Germany’s transport minister have said they would expropriate millions of drivers. Diesel car resale values in Germany have held broadly stable in the aftermath of the Volkswagen 2015 emissions scandal but have been declining since last July while values for gasoline vehicles started to rise at about the same time, data by market researcher Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH showed. With driving bans now more likely, analysts expect this trend to continue, also backed by rising diesel new car sales across Europe and the equivalent drop in gasoline registrations.

2018-02-28,"* ASN does not expect EDF report on weldings before summer * Regulator will review measures in second half of this year * Weldings issue could impact late 2018 fuel loading target (Updates with details) PARIS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - French utility EDF will not be allowed to start up its new Flamanville nuclear reactor without the approval by the country’s ASN regulator of a solution to sub-standard welding. State-controlled EDF said last week that more than half of the weldings on the reactor’s secondary cooling circuit did not meet the required specifications. It said this would not affect Flamanville’s safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of 2018, however an ASN spokeswoman said on Wednesday the weldings problem could have an impact on the start-up calendar. EDF’s Flamanville reactor - the same Areva-designed EPR reactor it is building in Hinkley Point, Britain - is years behind schedule and billions over budget. The utility will have to present solutions to the ASN, which will then seek input from experts in the second half of this year, before deciding whether the weldings are fit for service, the spokeswoman said. It seemed unlikely that ASN would receive a full report on the issue from EDF before the summer, she added. In a statement on Wednesday, the ASN said that this report would have to measure the impact on reactor safety of the problems with the welding. The reactor’s original safety documentation does not address the impact of a possible rupture of the weldings because they were designed to be rupture-proof. The ASN said it had also asked EDF to study the possibility of repairing the weldings or replacing the piping. In June, the ASN ruled that Flamanville’s vessel cover would have to be replaced just six years after startup because carbon concentrations in its steel could make it brittle.

2018-02-28,"* Cyprus president says peace talks not possible at moment * Turkey, Cyprus at odds over natgas search * East Med natgas finds among largest in past decade ATHENS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - An early resumption of peace talks on ethnically-split Cyprus was ‘impossible’, President Nicos Anastasiades said on Wednesday, accusing rival Turkey of violating international law  in a row over offshore oil and gas exploration. Cyprus and Turkey are at odds in a race to tap hydrocarbons in the eastern Mediterranean, an area which has yielded some of the world’s largest natural gas finds in the past decade but which has also brought decades-old grievances to the surface. A vessel charted by Italy’s state-controlled Eni was unable to reach an area Cyprus has licensed for drilling because of Turkish military manoeuvres in a two-week standoff in February. The two states do not have diplomatic relations, and Ankara maintains that Greek Cypriots, who run Cyprus’s internationally-recognised government, are violating either Turkish or Turkish Cypriot rights. Greek Cypriots say the same about Turkey, and the dispute appears to leave little room for compromise. “Unfortunately Turkey, and our Turkish Cypriot compatriots, appear to be not only unwilling (to re-engage in talks), but with additional violations of international law and unacceptable demands render the resumption of talks impossible, at least at the present time,” Anastasiades told the country’s parliament. He said that he would be willing to re-engage in dialogue if Turkey rescinded its ‘unlawful actions’ and Turkish Cypriots their ‘unacceptable claims’. The veteran conservative started a second five-year term at the helm of the island nation on Wednesday. Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup, and repeated attempts at reconciliation have failed. Greek Cypriots live in its south and Turkish Cypriots in the north. Natural gas discoveries by Egypt and Israel in areas not far from Cyprus have given sharper focus to the island’s standoff. The discoveries could either add impetus to a deal on Cyprus, or impede resolving a complex conflict on power-sharing and boundaries that concern tens of thousands of internally displaced people on either side of the divide. Anastasiades said his government had prepared legislation to create a sovereign hydrocarbons fund. In previous consultations, the two sides had also agreed on how potential revenue would be distributed, he said. Eni and France’s Total reported in early February a promising natural gas field south of Cyprus, which they said looked geologcally similar to the mammoth Zohr field off Egypt.

2018-02-28,"(Corrects headline to say 2017 coal consumption instead of 2018) * Coal consumption rises first time after 3-yr fall * Coal portion of total energy mix down, clean energy up * China still on track to meet de-carbonisation target -expert BEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - China’s coal consumption last year picked up for the first time since 2013, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, despite Beijing’s push to promote less-polluting energy sources. The world’s biggest coal consumer used 0.4 percent more coal in absolute terms in 2017 compared to a year ago, the bureau said in its annual National Social and Economic Development communique, without giving the value of total coal consumption. However, as a portion of total energy consumption, coal usage fell 1.6 percentage points to 60.4 percent last year, while clean energy, including natural gas and renewables, rose 1.3 percentage points to 20.8 percent from 2016, the communique showed. That indicates the country remains on track to fulfil its promise to decarbonise its economy and reduce air pollution, as it vowed to cut the coal portion to below 58 percent of total energy consumption by 2020. Carbon intensity, the level of carbon emissions per unit of economic growth, dropped by 5.1 percent in 2017 compared to a year ago. Total energy consumption rose by 2.9 percent to 4.49 billion tonnes of standard coal equivalent which is still below the target of 5 billion tonnes by 2020. “The slight increase in China’s coal demand thankfully does little to change the overall trend of declining demand in coal’s largest market,” said Harri Lammi, global coal campaigner at environmental group Greenpeace. “It continues on the path away from reliance on the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel as the energy structure transitions and renewable energy installations soar.” China had a total of 163.7 gigawatts (GW) of installed wind capacity and 130.3 GW of solar capacity by end 2017, up 10.5 percent and 68.7 percent compare to a year ago, according to data from the National Energy Administration (NEA). Natural gas and renewables consumption also increased after nearly 4 million households across the northern China were ordered by Beijing to convert from coal to electricity or natural gas in 2017 as part of its air pollution campaign. Average level of major air pollutants fell significantly in 2017, with concentrations of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5 and capable of lodging deep in the lungs, in the smog-prone Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region dropped by 39.6 percent to 64 micrograms per cubic metres compared to five years ago. China aims to introduce even tougher air quality targets to cover the 2018 to 2020 period and to continue push the conversion of coal to clean energy.

2018-02-28,"* MSCI world shares fall 0.3 pct, add to Powell-fuelled loss * Chinese, Japanese data disappoint * World shares set to snap record winning streak * Euro zone inflation stays weak, US GDP ahead (Updates prices, adds new comment, charts) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - World stocks were set to snap a record 15-month long winning streak on Wednesday, tumbling another quarter percent after new Fed boss Jerome Powell’s comments suggested the possibility of four U.S. interest rate rises this year rather than three. Barely recovered from an early-February sell-off, equity sentiment has been shaken by Powell and by data showing China’s manufacturing sector slowing to its weakest in over 1-1/2 years and Japanese industrial output down the most since March 2011. Equity futures signalled Wall Street would open flat after declines of more than 1 percent on Tuesday when the U.S. Federal Reserve chief delivered his debut testimony to Congress. Powell had struck a mildly hawkish note, noting inflation had risen since December and vowing to prevent the economy from overheating.. But that was enough for traders to add bets on the Fed squeezing in another rate rise this year, with futures now pricing a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike. U.S. 10-year yields retreated after rising on Tuesday towards four-year highs though the dollar hovered near three week peaks and is set for a monthly rise against a basket of currencies after three months of declines. On equities, MSCI’s all-country index fell 0.3 percent , capping a turbulent month that saw trillions of dollars wiped off share markets during an early-February volatility explosion. “After yesterday, the market is contemplating that we will probably get four rate hikes this year and you have seen the reaction in equities and Treasuries,” said Peter Garnry, head of global equities at Saxo Bank in Stockholm. Powell also said financial conditions remained accommodative despite higher volatility. Wall Street’s main volatility gauge, the VIX, closed Tuesday with its biggest daily rise since early-February, easing only slightly on Wednesday. “The Fed ‘put’ for equities is likely still there but it’s weaker,” Garnry said, referring to investors’ assumption that the central bank would intervene to prop up equity markets. “The recent vol hiccup has changed the volatility outlook to a higher level.” European shares lost 0.5 percent, down 3.8 percent in February, their first monthly loss since November. Emerging equities fell 1 percent, pulled down by a 1.4 percent tumble in Hong Kong and set for their biggest monthly loss since November 2016, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.4 percent and snapped a five-month run of gains. A fall in new orders for U.S.-made capital goods for the second month in a row, plus the dismal Chinese and Japanese numbers, are also making investors fret about a possible setback to growth, especially in China, the world’s No. 2 economy. Not everyone is bearish however. “Equities and risk assets may wobble as yields rise, but stronger growth should be good for corporate earnings and offset the impact from the expected increase in central bank policy rates,” the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock said. Unicredit analysts agreed. They said that while markets might price in higher U.S. interest rates, these would likely remain modest and also hinge on economic data staying robust. “As long as both of these conditions are met, we do not believe that (Powell’s) testimony threatens to derail risk appetite, at least not in a sustained way,” they told clients. Markets are ending February pretty much as they began it — on a sour note, spooked by concerns U.S. inflation would pick up and that central banks could end up tightening policy further and faster than originally anticipated. The MSCI index remains more than 5 percent below record highs hit at the end of January. Equity gains from here may be hindered by bond markets, with U.S. 10-year yields close to the psychologically key 3 percent level and up 17 basis points this month. UBS Wealth Management predicted that U.S. GDP data later in the day would reinforce “the picture of an economy performing at or above trend, justifying four rate hikes this year”. But the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank could act as counterweights — euro zone inflation for February at 1.2 percent showed on Wednesday that the ECB’s near-2-percent target remains years away. German 10-year bond yields meanwhile are set for their first monthly fall since October, down 2.5 basis points in February, while Japanese yields are just off two-month lows hit earlier this week Additional Reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney and Dhara

2018-02-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson praised social reforms in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, seeking to neutralise any potential criticism over human rights and the war in Yemen ahead of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to London next week. Prince Mohammed will arrive in London on March 7 for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May and other senior ministers, his first trip to Britain since being named heir to the throne last summer when he effectively took over running the country. Despite him enacting a programme of social reforms, his visit is expected to spark protests over wider rights issues, including Saudi Arabia’s role in Yemen, where more than 10,000 people have been killed in a conflict since 2015. But Johnson said Prince Mohammed deserved support for overturning a ban on women driving, relaxing gender segregation and setting a target to get more women into the Saudi workforce. “If you are inclined to dismiss these advances, then I will respectfully suggest that you are making a profound mistake,” he wrote in an article for the Times newspaper.  “Change does not come easily in Saudi Arabia. In a matter of a few months, genuine reform has taken place after decades of stasis.” Describing Saudi Arabia as one of Britain’s “oldest friends in the region”, Johnson highlighted the importance of defence cooperation both to counter Islamic State militants and as a diplomatic counterweight to Iran’s Middle East influence. Britain has openly sought to woo Saudi Arabia ahead of the expected stock market listing of state oil company Saudi Aramco, which could be the largest such offering in history. Both May and U.S. President Donald Trump want the potentially lucrative listing to take place on their stock exchanges. But, the government’s support for Prince Mohammed has been criticised by rights groups and opposition lawmakers - particularly over the licensing of 4.6 billion pounds worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the start of the Yemen conflict. London says it has strict controls on arms sales, and on Tuesday May said she would be discussing the conflict and humanitarian situation in Yemen “frankly and constructively” with Prince Mohammed.

2018-02-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota (7203.T) said on Wednesday it will build the next generation of its Auris car in England in a welcome boost to Prime Minister Theresa May as Britain leaves the European Union, confirming a previous Reuters report. The Japanese carmaker will make its new Auris hatchback at Burnaston, Derbyshire, replacing the current run of the model made there, the company said in a statement. Sources told Reuters last year that Toyota planned to build the model in Britain on the assumption that ministers will secure a transitional Brexit deal designed to maintain current trading conditions until at least the end of 2020. The automaker said free trade was important for the future.  “With around 85 percent of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success,” said Toyota Europe President and CEO Johan van Zyl in Wednesday’s statement.  Business minister Greg Clark hailed the announcement and said Britain’s automotive sector was one of the most productive in the world, adding “this government will continue work to create the best possible environment.” Carmakers are worried that without the right Brexit deal, their factories could be subject to tariffs and trade barriers, adding to costs and risking the long-term viability of sites.  Toyota’s Burnaston plant churned out 144,000 models last year, down 20 percent from 2016 according to industry data, as its current line-up of models neared the end of their product life cycle. Nearly one in five of those cars were Avensis models, according to a source familiar with the situation. The firm did not comment on the future of the model in its statement on Wednesday. A Toyota spokesman later declined to comment or speculate on the Avensis.

2018-02-28,"PARIS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF will not be allowed to start up its new Flamanville nuclear reactor without regulator ASN’s approval of a solution to problems with substandard welding, the ASN said on Wednesday. Last week, EDF said more than half of the weldings on the reactor’s secondary cooling circuit did not meet required specifications. It said that did not affect Flamanville’s safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of 2018. An ASN spokeswoman said the weldings problem could have an impact on the start-up calendar, however. EDF will have to present solutions in a report to the ASN, which will then seek input from experts in the second half of this year, she said. ASN will then rule on whether the reactor is fit for service. The spokeswoman said it seemed unlikely that ASN would receive a full report on the issue from EDF before the summer.

2018-02-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - A cold snap dubbed the ‘Beast from the East’ sent British wholesale energy prices to at least 10-year highs on Wednesday as traders scrambled to secure supplies. Britain’s Met Office weather service forecast sub-zero temperatures for much of the week, with gas supplies facing a crunch on Wednesday due to outages. Temperatures fell to minus 12 Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit) in some rural areas while the Met Office warned of up to 40 cm of snow in parts of Scotland and Ireland braced for what could be its biggest snowfall since 1982. The cold snap comes just days after a law was introduced in Britain’s parliament aimed a capping consumers’ energy bills, a move which British Gas owner Centrica (CNA.L) said could hurt competition.  “The (British) market is acutely tight. Highest consumption since 2010; flexibility being tested from various sources and now UKCS (UK Continental shelf) and Norwegian outages,” said Thomson Reuters analyst Oliver Sanderson. Prices for within-day gas delivery TRGBNBPWKD surged 146 percent to 190.00 pence per therm, their highest for at least 10 years. Wholesale power prices rose 30 percent TRGBBD1. As much as 80 percent of Britain uses natural gas for home heating, meaning cold temperatures can have a big impact on demand which on Wednesday was almost 30 percent higher than normal, National Grid data showed. An outage at the Kollsnes gas processing plant sparked concerns about imports from Norway, which over the past two years has provided about 40 percent of Britain’s gas, some of which is re-exported to Ireland, Thomson Reuters data showed. Smaller outages at British sites supplying gas from the North Sea added to supply concerns. Britain’s ability to respond to short-term demand shocks has been hampered by the closure last year of Centrica’s Rough gas storage site, the country’s largest. At its operational peak, Rough could store around 10 percent of Britain’s gas demand. Very high demand combined with some supply outages “is underlying the impact of the loss of flexibility driven by the closure of Rough and the big reductions in supply seen from Groningen,” said Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski. Output at Groningen, Europe’s biggest gas field, has plummeted as Dutch authorities try to reduce earthquakes in the region.  Dutch gas exports to Britain fell more than 50 percent last year, data from Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy showed. Britain’s top power utilities typically hedge supplies many months in advance so short-term price spikes should not automatically trigger higher prices for customers. But smaller suppliers, which account for around 20 percent of the market, are usually less hedged and may need to pass on price rises sooner. Bulb, which has around 300,000 customers, said on Tuesday it would raise bills by 2.8 percent from April 28.

2018-02-28,"(Recasts, adds Exxon executive comments on LNG plans in Mozambique and Qatar, investment timeline for expanding Papua New Guinea, and new projects) By Oleg Vukmanovic SINGAPORE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Investments in new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are thawing out after three years of low prices, with Exxon Mobil expecting to advance in Mozambique and Qatar, and Oil Search looking to expand in Papua New Guinea. Surging gas demand from China and Southeast Asia is reassuring export project developers sitting on huge untapped gas discoveries across the globe that the market cycle is finally beginning to turn. Oil executives at the LNGA conference in Singapore on Wednesday were upbeat on prospects for the development of new supply outside the United States, a recent magnet for LNG investments. Exxon Mobil expects to advance “pretty soon” on Mozambique’s huge LNG export potential, said Frank Kretschmer, the company’s senior vice president for LNG marketing in Asia Pacific. “We are presently in discussion with our partners on marketing arrangements and we will move forward pretty soon,” Kretschmer told Reuters. Exxon completed its $2.8 billion purchase of a 25 percent stake in Mozambique’s Area 4 gas reserves from Italian oil firm Eni last year, taking charge of developing one of the world’s biggest new sources of LNG. Rival Mozambique gas developer Anadarko Petroleum last week announced its first binding long-term LNG sales from its planned project. In a presentation, Kretschmer also said Exxon expected to expand its existing LNG export operations in top producer Qatar, in addition to already announced expansions in Papua New Guinea. Qatar rocked the LNG industry last year when it said it plans to raise its liquefaction capacity by 30 percent from 77 million tonnes a year, either by building new production units or expanding existing ones. Exxon is one of three main Western partners in Qatari LNG facilities, but the Gulf state has not yet publicly disclosed which companies will benefit from the expansion. French major Total is competing for the Qatar expansion alongside Chinese and Indian national oil companies, industry sources at the conference said. Next year, Exxon and partners also expect to sanction a doubling of capacity at their Papua New Guinea production venture, PNG LNG, Ian Munro, executive general manager at Oil Search, a participant in the project, told Reuters. Munro said Oil Search was also considering independently building small-scale LNG export plants in Papua New Guinea to strengthen its supply to rich Asian markets. The new batch of small LNG facilities would be of around 0.5 million to 1.5 million tonnes per year, Munro said. “We have a drilling program beyond that and we have a number of high profile wells we’ll drill on and offshore over the next three years,” he said. “We’re excited about smaller scale LNG opportunities and looking to grow beyond the big projects to provide a deeper portfolio to Asia,” Munro said.

2018-02-28,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian bus maker Van Hool said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell 40 hydrogen-powered vehicles to the German cities of Cologne and Wuppertal, saying it was the largest such order in Europe to date. An alternative to battery-powered electric vehicles, hydrogen is a technology which also produces no carbon emissions, converting hydrogen into electric energy from a fuel cell. Last year, the heads of some of the world’s biggest oil companies and automakers agreed to push investments in hydrogen technology, saying it could cut annual carbon emissions by 6 billion tonnes by 2050.  Van Hool said Cologne had placed the order after testing two hydrogen buses from May 2014. “This unique order, the largest ever for hydrogen buses in Europe, is a serious shot in the arm for the use of hydrogen technology in public transport,” said Chief Executive Filip Van Hool. The buses, powered by fuel cells made by Canadian group Ballard Power Systems Inc, would be built in Belgium and delivered from the second half of 2019, Van Hool said. While hydrogen is often produced from natural gas, proponents say its production from renewable energy sources offers a solution to the storage issues often associated with intermittent solar and wind energy.  Critics say storing renewable electricity as hydrogen is less efficient than using batteries. Last year, Germany said it would introduce world’s first trains powered by hydrogen fuel cells into service, with 14 emission-free trains due to transport passengers in Lower Saxony from 2021.

2018-02-28,"(Reuters) - Oil analysts expect the price of crude to rise steadily this year but remain in a tight band dictated by U.S. shale output growth on one side and OPEC supply restraint on the other, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday. The survey of 37 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 would average $63 a barrel in 2018, slightly higher than $62.37 projected in the previous month’s poll.  “OPEC’s level of compliance (with agreed production curbs) and the pace of U.S. shale’s output growth are likely to be the key fundamental price drivers in 2018,” Ashley Petersen of Stratas Advisors said.  “Prices will likely be more volatile in 2018 than 2017, driven by whipsawing sentiment around the pace of U.S. growth.” U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA could surpass 11 million barrels per day this year, with production already near a record above 10 million bpd. “The U.S. has stolen the show somewhat,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.  “That its oil market is dominated by a large number of uncoordinated, private-sector firms, many of whom benefit from lower production costs than producers elsewhere, means the U.S. will remain a major player for the foreseeable future.”   Meanwhile, OPEC is closing in on its goal of reducing oil inventories held by industrial nations to their five-year average, figures from the group’s head of research showed this month.     The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to cap output by about 1.8 million bpd in a deal running from January last year until the end of 2018.  Saudi Arabia last week said it hoped OPEC and its allies would be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the deal expires. “The supply deal remains a key uncertainty for the oil market. A transition of the deal is needed but not yet visible, with both an over-tightening and an orderly unwinding being potential scenarios,” said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.     Analysts said that without a smooth exit from the pact, global inventories may drop sharply and trigger a potentially damaging price rise.       Oil output in Venezuela, one of OPEC’s larger producers, has dropped to its lowest in more than 20 years as the country grapples with an economic crisis, in turn helping curtail OPEC’s supply beyond the group’s agreed 1.2-million bpd commitment. Growing demand from Asian economies, led by China, was expected to absorb part of the increase in U.S. supply. “Rising global oil demand will be driven mainly by emerging markets, with non-OECD consumption rising by an average of 2.8 percent per year in 2018-19, which would be the fastest rate since 2013,” the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Birch said.  U.S. light crude CLc1 is forecast to average $58.88 a barrel in 2018, up from $58.11 in the January poll.

Buhari, who took office in May 2015, has not yet said whether he intends to seek re-election. The 75-year-old leader spent five months on medical leave in Britain last year for an unspecified ailment, raising questions about his ability to run Africa’s most populous nation. The national executive committee of the president’s All Progressives Congress (APC) party, which takes decisions on the party’s direction, held a one-day meeting which concluded late on Tuesday. “The party made it clear that this endorsement is not an automatic ticket for the president,” one of the sources said, adding that the party would still conduct a presidential primary to be fair to other potential candidates. A spokesman for the president could not immediately be reached for comment. Nigeria’s political parties must select their candidates for the 2019 presidential election between Aug. 18 and Oct. 7 this year. Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on Feb. 16, 2019. Adebayo Shittu, Nigeria’s minister of communications who played a prominent role in Buhari’s 2015 campaign, said in January he would chair a group to support the re-election of Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Campaigning for the re-election of a president in Nigeria has often started with such support groups before the incumbent declares his intention to run again.

2018-02-28,"ROME (Reuters) - Rome, one of Europe’s most traffic-clogged cities and home to thousands of ancient outdoor monuments threatened by pollution, plans to ban diesel cars from the center by 2024, its mayor said. Virginia Raggi announced the decision on her Facebook page on Tuesday, saying: “If we want to intervene seriously, we have to have the courage to adopt strong measures”. Her comments followed a court ruling in Germany that cities there can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets.  About two-thirds of the 1.8 million new cars sold in Italy last year were diesel, according to industry figures. Rome has no major industries, so nearly all of the air pollution in the Italian capital is caused by motor vehicles. The city regularly tries to ban older, more polluting vehicles from roads on days when pollution reaches critical levels. It has also tried to reduce pollution by allowing only cars whose number plates end in either odd or even numbers to circulate on alternate days.  But both regulations are widely flouted and lightly enforced by traffic police. To skirt the alternate days regulation, many families buy a used car with a different number plate. Apart from health issues, pollution from combustion engines causes severe damage to Rome’s many ancient outdoor monuments. According to a study last year by a branch of the culture ministry, 3,600 stone monuments and 60 bronze sculptures risk serious deterioration because of air pollution. Ahead of celebrations marking the start of the new millennium in 2000, the darkened facade of St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican was cleaned as part of a project that lasted several years. But fresh signs of pollution-related stains are visible again. Before the German court’s ruling on Tuesday, officials in highly industrialized Milan, in northern Italy, had already announced plans to make the city diesel free by 2030.

2018-02-28,"* MSCI world shares fall 0.3 pct, add to Powell-fuelled loss * Chinese, Japanese data disappoint * World shares set to snap record winning streak * Euro zone inflation stays weak, US GDP ahead (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - World stocks were set to snap a record 15-month long winning streak on Wednesday, tumbling another quarter percent after new Fed boss Jerome Powell’s comments suggested the possibility of four U.S. interest rate rises this year rather than three. Barely recovered after an early-February sell-off, equity sentiment has been shaken by Powell and by data showing China’s manufacturing sector slowing to its weakest in over 1-1/2 years and Japanese industrial output down the most since March 2011. The U.S. Federal Reserve chief, in his debut testimony to Congress on Wednesday, struck a mildly hawkish note, noting inflation had risen since December and vowing to prevent the economy from overheating. That was enough for traders to add bets on the Fed squeezing in another rate rise this year, with futures tied to target policy rates now pricing a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike. With U.S. 10-year yields again approaching recent four-year highs, New York shares closed 1 percent lower on Tuesday. MSCI’s all-country index fell 0.8 percent on Tuesday and tumbled another 0.3 percent on Wednesday. Wall Street’s main volatility gauge, the VIX, opened a touch lower, after seeing its biggest daily rise since early-February . But a fall in new orders for U.S.-made capital goods for the second month in a row, plus the dismal Chinese and Japanese numbers, have made investors fret about a possible setback to growth, especially in China, the world’s No. 2 economy. “(Powell’s) more hawkish tone and disappointing durable goods data explains the sell-off in stocks. China PMI data was also a bit disappointing overnight,” said Benjamin Schroeder, a strategist at ING Bank. Emerging equities fell 1 percent, pulled down by a 1.4 percent tumble in Hong Kong and on track for their biggest monthly loss since November 2016, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.4 percent and snapped a five-month run of gains. European shares lost around 0.3 percent and have shed 3.6 percent in February, their first monthly loss since November. Equity futures suggested a flat to slightly firmer session for Wall Street. Not everyone is bearish however. “Equities and risk assets may wobble as yields rise, but stronger growth should be good for corporate earnings and offset the impact from the expected increase in central bank policy rates,” the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock said. Analysts at Unicredit agreed. They said that while markets might price in higher U.S. interest rates, these would likely remain modest and also hinge on economic data staying robust. “As long as both of these conditions are met, we do not believe that (Powell’s) testimony threatens to derail risk appetite, at least not in a sustained way,” they told clients. Markets are ending February pretty much as they began it — on a sour note, spooked by concerns U.S. inflation would pick up and that central banks could end up tightening policy further and faster than originally anticipated. Those fears were behind the selloff that wiped trillions of dollars off world stocks in less than a week early in February. The MSCI index remains more than 5 percent below record highs hit at the end of January. Their path higher is likely to be hindered by bond markets, with U.S. 10-year yields close to the psychologically key 3 percent level and up 17 basis points this month. Headwinds also could come from the dollar, which is set for a monthly rise against a basket of currencies following three months of declines and which touched three-week peaks after Powell’s comments. Analysts at UBS Wealth Management predicted that U.S. GDP data due later in the day would reinforce “the picture of an economy performing at or above trend, justifying four rate hikes this year”. But the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank could act as counterweights to a hawkish Fed — euro zone inflation for February at 1.2 percent showed on Wednesday that the ECB’s near-2-percent target remains years away. German 10-year bond yields meanwhile are set for their first monthly fall since October, down 2.5 basis points in February, while Japanese yields are just off two-month lows hit earlier this week Additional Reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney and Dhara

2018-02-28,"* Domestic LNG plants restart since last week * Gas supply crunch ease as heating season draws to an end * State-owned gas producers cut off LNG plants to meet winter heating demand By Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason BEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - At least 10 of China’s domestic liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants have resumed output in the past week after the government cut off their supply, providing the first signs that the country’s gas supply crunch is starting to ease, company sources said. The return of the plants, which liquefy domestically produced gas that is then trucked to end-users, has raised LNG supply in China’s interior, pushing nationwide LNG prices lower. These restarts are also a sign that state-owned gas producers Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corp have resumed piping gas to the facilities after the government ordered them to divert shipments from the plants to residential users to make up a supply shortfall during the winter heating season. Yangcheng Shuntianda Gas Corp, based in China’s Shanxi province, southwest of the capital Beijing, has restarted its plant, with the capacity to liquefy 500,000 cubic metres of gas, after shutting in December, a sales manager at the company who only gave his surname of Wang told Reuters. “We lost 20 million yuan ($3.2 million) each month because we weren’t producing anything. Our boss was under extreme pressure from the bank to pay off loans,” said Wang. Yulin Huachen, which runs a similiar-sized plant in neighbouring Shaanxi province, resumed half of its production last weekend after closing for more than two months, said a company sales manager, who declined to be identified as he was not authorize to speak to the media. Sinopec and CNPC cut gas supplies to the LNG plants to meet the newly created demand from residential consumers. These buyers were converted to gas or electric heating ahead of this winter to reduce air pollution from coal-fired heating as part of the government’s war on smog. The companies could not cope with the extra demand because of inadequate infrastructure and insufficient domestic output. The government rules on the fuel switching also prioritised residential users over industrial consumers. CNPC and Sinopec declined to comment on whether they have resumed piped gas shipments to the LNG users. More of the LNG plants are expected to resume operations in the coming weeks as gas supplies improve, said Zhang Mengjie, gas analyst at Shandong-based Longzhong Information Group. Data from Longzhong shows the LNG plants were operating at just 27 percent of capacity last week, versus 38 percent a year ago and a typical level of 50 percent. The 27 percent is equivalent to daily output of 23 million cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations, based on overall daily operating capacity of 85.6 million cubic metres. Chinese LNG prices have fallen as the plants return to production and as some end-users remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The daily wholesale LNG price index tracking spot prices across the country assessed by industry publication www.yeslng.com fell 5.4 percent to 4,659 yuan per tonne from Monday to Wednesday. “Demand from downstream users is not very good now as some of them remain on holiday and won’t be back until next week,” said Diao Zhouwei, a natural gas analyst at IHS Markit. “With the weather getting warmer, demand from residential users is declining, which leaves more fuel for the industrial sector.” $1 = 6.3275 Chinese yuan renminbi

2018-02-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s HNA Group has amassed an estimated 3 billion yuan ($476 million) bill with a state-run aviation fuel company, two oil industry sources said, underscoring how a deepening cash crunch is plaguing core operations at the conglomerate. HNA’s outstanding balance with China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd (CNAF), the country’s near-monopoly marketer and distributor of aviation fuel, has swelled significantly over the last six months, the sources said, without quantifying. “HNA has not stopped fully paying its bills, but it only has paid a small amount at a time, so the outstanding (balance) has grown bigger and bigger,” said a senior oil industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter. A second executive briefed on the situation said the problem “really deteriorated over the past several months”.   Both executives requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter. HNA has controlling stakes in Hainan Airlines Holding Co and 12 other carriers in China and Hong Kong.  The company also has invested heavily in aviation leasing, logistics and financial services, taking leading stakes in Deutsche Bank AG and Old Mutual’s asset management unit. HNA Group said in a statement on Wednesday Hainan Airlines “maintained positive and friendly communication” with CNAF. “At present, all businesses are carried out steadily,” it added, without elaborating.    The unpaid bills underscore how an ongoing liquidity squeeze is rippling through company core operations, impacting even its highly successful airlines business. Some HNA airlines have delayed payments for leased aircrafts, Reuters reported last month, prompting executives from leasing units of Bank of China Ltd, China Minsheng Banking Corp, and Bank of Communications Co to hold recovery talks. “HNA and its subsidiaries are maintaining stable operations, and are in the process of gradually paying each lessor’s fees as planned,” the company said at the time. Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit profile of HNA Group and two of its units, including airline caterer Gategroup, citing a “deteriorating liquidity profile”. Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm Avolon Holdings, acquired by HNA subsidiary Bohai Capital Holding two years ago for about $2.5 billion (1.8 billion pounds), also took the unprecedented step of amending its guarantee structure, formalising segregation of its financial resources from HNA and its units.      HNA is also seeking to restructure its far-flung operations following $50 billion investment spree, while raising cash by selling equity and prime real estate assets. Among its recent divestments are a Sydney office tower and two plots of land in Hong Kong. State-run CNAF supplies fuel at about 215 airports in China, and 46 airports globally. The fuel supplier became acutely of HNA’s problems in late September when HNA’s liquidity problems “started to erupt”, said one of the executives.         The sources estimated HNA’s outstanding bill to CNAF now amounted to about 3 billion yuan. That represented about four months worth of total billing to the group, one of the sources added.  CNAF has responded by setting up a task force to explore repayment options, the two executives said.   “CNAF has initiated many exchanges with HNA, verbally and in writing, but that has been barely fruitful,” the executive said.  Solutions proposed by the fuel supplier have included swapping the debt for a stake in Meilan Haikou Airport, which is controlled by HNA, the first executive said. CNAF has continued to supply fuel to HNA airlines, concerned about the impact of suspending sales for airlines that make hundreds of international and domestic flights every day. “(Ironically) it’s now CNAF’s social responsibility to keep its flights running, because if fuel is suspended, passengers will be hurt and then it becomes a social problem,” said the first executive. China’s central government state assets regulator and the Civil Aviation Administration have been briefed on the matter, but neither has given clear guidance over how to sort out the situation, the executives said. The two bodies did not immediately responded to requests for comment. A CNAF spokesperson, contacted by Reuters, acknowledged the company has amassed a “sizeable” outstanding bill since the second half of last year, but declined to elaborate. “Communications with HNA are under way,” the spokesperson said. “It’s hard to predict results, but we’re hoping for a solution.” Reporting by Aizhu Chen and Matthew Miller in BEIJING; Editing by Lincoln Feast",https://uk.reuters.com/article/hna-group-debt-fuel/exclusive-amid-liquidity-concerns-chinas-hna-group-aviation-fuel-bill-hits-476-mln-sources-idUKL4N1QI3LR,28 Feb 2018,"* HNA Group has been selling assets to address liquidity

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped more than 1 percent, its biggest daily percentage drop since Feb.9 when world financial markets were battered by concerns U.S. inflation is picking up. The index is now down nearly 5 percent in February. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 1 percent on a slightly firmer yen. China’s blue-chip CSI300 skidded 0.6 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite fell 0.8 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined more than 1 percent. In an indication of the dour mood, S&P E- Mini futures slipped 0.1 percent while FTSE futures were off 0.6 percent. Asian markets had opened mildly lower but selling intensified after data showed growth in China’s manufacturing sector in February slowed more than expected to the weakest in over 1-1/2 years. Growth in China’s services industry also slowed, suggesting the key sector was starting to display signs of fatigue. The weakness was driven by disruption due to the Lunar New Year holidays and curbs to factory output from tougher pollution rules, but there are worries of a bigger loss in momentum. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, said the “the risk is still that the economy fares worse this year than is generally expected.” Some analysts cautioned the timing of the long holiday may have skewed the activity readings. In Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, industrial output in January took its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory. Growth in India’s factory activity slowed too in February. Sentiment across financial markets was already sour after Fed’s Jerome Powell gave an upbeat view of the U.S. economy on Tuesday and said recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation. When asked about likely catalysts for more than three rate hikes in 2018, he said each member would write a new “dot plot” rate path ahead of the March meeting and that he wouldn’t want to prejudge that outcome. Rate futures fell following Powell’s remarks as traders began pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike this year. Fears of faster U.S. rate hikes have caused anxiety that other central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs. That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth. “Today’s comments appear to open the door for others on the (Fed) Committee to revise their forecast as they see fit, and that Powell himself may be inclined to look for four hikes this year,” JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said in a note. The Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March. The dollar held on to gains after rallying against most major currencies on Tuesday. It hovered near a recent 1-1/2 month top against the Australian dollar and held near a three-week high on the euro at $1.2221. However, it did not fare well against the Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven. The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 107.10 yen. Dollar bulls were wrongfooted after the Bank of Japan announced it would trim the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation. Analysts are predicting a stronger yen this year despite faster U.S. rate rises, although speculators and Japanese retail investors have built huge short positions in yen futures setting the scene for a massive shakeout. In commodities, oil prices extended declines on weak output data from China and Japan and as an industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures fell 40 cents to $66.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 33 cents at $62.68. Spot gold eased to $1,317.61 an ounce, not far from Tuesday’s $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-02-28,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Whole villages were flattened and water sources spoiled by a powerful earthquake that killed at least 20 people, residents said on Wednesday as rescuers struggled to reach the hardest-hit areas in Papua New Guinea’s remote, mountainous highlands. The magnitude 7.5 quake rocked the rugged Southern Highlands province some 560 km (350 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, triggering landslides, damaging mining, gas and power infrastructure, and cutting communications. Scores of aftershocks have hampered rescue efforts and rattled nervous villagers over the past two days, including a 6.0 tremor just before 1 p.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday registered by the U.S. Geological Survey. Most of the confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi, where television pictures showed collapsed buildings and landslides, and the town of Tari, according to authorities and residents contacted by Reuters. “It’s massive destruction,” Stanley Mamu told Reuters by telephone from Tari, 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre. One person was killed in Tari and another five were killed in a landslide in a nearby village, he said. “There are buildings on the ground and landslides along the roads. My home was destroyed. The main sources of water were all flooded, it’s dirty and brown and people can’t drink that water,” Mamu said. Elsewhere rivers had silted up or become blocked, villages damaged and gardens and water tanks destroyed, though the biggest landslides hit sparsely populated areas, according to Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF), an air transport operator that flew a three-hour survey on Tuesday. A cloudy morning and fog in the afternoon on Wednesday hampered official efforts to assess damage by helicopter, let alone distribute aid, said Kaigabu Kamnanaya, Director of Risk Management at Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre. Miners and oil and gas companies were also assessing the damage, which included ensuring a 700-km (435-mile) gas pipeline that connects to a coastal liquefaction plant was intact before it could be reopened. Australia sent a C-130 military transport plane to help with aerial surveillance. The office of Australia’s Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in a statement it would likely take days before the extent of the damage was clear. (GRAPHIC: Papua New Guinea quake IMG, tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) A police officer in Mendi said landslides had buried homes and blocked a river residents worried could flood the town. “We are really in deep fear,” said police sergeant Naring Bongi. “It continues to be active. We didn’t sleep well and stayed awake until daybreak ... no helicopters or government officials have come to our assistance.”     Medical supplies and heavy equipment to clear landslides were also needed, said James Justin, a spokesman for provincial MP Manasseh Makiba, as well as food in places where productive gardens had been wrecked. “The casualties have yet to be confirmed but many more than 20 people have lost their lives,” he said. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

It is down more than 4.5 percent in February after global equity markets were mauled at the start of the month by worries U.S. inflation is picking up. Japan’s Nikkei stumbled 0.4 percent on a slightly firmer yen, while S&P futures slipped 0.3 percent. China’s blue-chip CSI300 skidded 0.8 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index each declined more than 1 percent. Asian markets had opened mildly lower but selling intensified after data showed growth in China’s manufacturing sector in February slowed more than expected to the weakest in over 1-1/2 years as the Lunar New Year holidays disrupted business activity and tougher pollution rules curtailed factory output. Growth in China’s services industry also slowed, suggesting the key sector was starting to display signs of fatigue. The services sector accounts for over half of China’s economy. However, analysts cautioned the timing of the long holiday may have skewed the activity readings, and a clearer picture of conditions in China may not emerge for another month. Sentiment was already sour after Fed’s Jerome Powell gave an upbeat view of the U.S. economy on Tuesday and said recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation. When asked about likely catalysts for more than three rate hikes in 2018, he said each member would write a new “dot plot” rate path ahead of the March meeting and that he wouldn’t want to prejudge that outcome. Rate futures fell following Powell’s remarks as traders began pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike this year. Fears of faster U.S. rate hikes have caused anxiety that other central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs. That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth. “Today’s comments appear to open the door for others on the (Fed) Committee to revise their forecast as they see fit, and that Powell himself may be inclined to look for four hikes this year,” JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli said in a note. “We are naturally more confident in our standing call for four hikes this year and another four next year.” The Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March. Responding to Powell, equity markets in Europe and Wall Street turned south with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq falling more than 1 percent each. Treasury prices slipped with yields on the 10-year U.S. note rising past 2.9 percent. The dollar held on to gains after rallying against most major currencies overnight. It hovered near a recent 1-1/2 month top against the Australian dollar and held near a three-week high on the euro at $1.2227. However, it did not fare well against the Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven. Dollar bulls were wrongfooted after the Bank of Japan announced it would trim the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation. In commodities, oil prices extended declines into a second day fell as industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles. Brent crude futures fell 31 cents to $66.32 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 37 cents at $62.64. Spot gold eased to $1,317.31 an ounce, not far from Tuesday’s $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-02-28,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude and especially refined fuels in the most recently reported week but supportive comments from OPEC helped steady oil prices. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by the equivalent of 48 million barrels in the week to Feb. 20. The hedge funds’ net long position has been cut in each of the four most recent weeks by a total of 263 million barrels, in what has been the largest drawdown for more than seven months. Most of the drawdown has come from the liquidation of bullish long positions rather than the establishment of new bearish short ones and it has been proportionately greater in fuels rather than crude. Portfolio managers have cut their net long position in U.S. heating oil by 58 million barrels, European heating oil by 45 million barrels and U.S. gasoline by 27 million barrels since Jan. 23. Over the same period, the net long position in Brent has been cut by 61 million barrels while WTI is down by 71 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs/2BTh857). Most of this liquidation seems to be attributable to profit-taking after the big rally in oil prices over the last seven months. Few fund managers have dared to initiate new short positions. Short positions across the whole of the petroleum complex total just 137 million barrels. Short positions in NYMEX WTI have fallen to just 30 million barrels, the lowest since July 2014. Fund positioning remains very stretched with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of almost 10:1, but down from almost 12:1 at the end of January. Despite the profit-taking, oil prices have steadied, probably owing to a combination of strong consumption growth, a continued fall in oil inventories, and supportive comments from senior OPEC leaders. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has confirmed that it intends to maintain production restraint throughout the remainder of 2018, even if that risks over-tightening the market. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little it, so be it. Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information ... stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” the kingdom’s energy minister said on Feb. 14. Saudi officials have indicated they want to change the organisation’s target for inventories from the five-year average, which is close to being achieved, to something more ambitious. This represents a significant hardening of OPEC’s policy and has partially reversed the recent slide in benchmark Brent prices, which was probably the intention. But with the market still looking very stretched, especially on the crude side, OPEC may need to sustain its verbal intervention to reassure investors and keep prices firm.

2018-02-28,"* MSCI Asia-ex Japan down 0.2 pct, set for second straight fall * Nikkei off 0.2 pct, Kospi index inches higher * Fears of faster rate rises after Jerome Powell’s testimony * U.S. dollar stronger against most major currencies By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares faltered on Wednesday and bonds were sold off as risk appetite soured after comments from new Federal Reserve Chair revived fears about faster rate rises in the United States. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.2 percent, on track for a second straight day of losses. It is down more than 4 percent in February after global equity markets were mauled at the start of the month by worries U.S. inflation is picking up. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.2 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI index ticked higher. Australian shares slipped 0.4 percent. Jerome Powell noted in his semi-annual testimony on Tuesday that the U.S. economy was strong, inflation was ticking higher and that the global backdrop was better than in December. When asked about likely catalysts for more than three rate hikes in 2018, he said each member would write a new “dot plot” rate path ahead of the March meeting and that he wouldn’t want to prejudge that outcome. “These comments highlighted to market participants the possibility that, at the March meeting, the Fed’s median “dot” could move up, signalling that four, rather than just three, hikes were likely to be appropriate in 2018,” said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “While we believe the possibility exists that the median dot for 2018 moves higher, that is not yet our base case,” Girard added. “Whether or not the median dot shifts, we are sticking with our long-held view that the Fed will hike rates four times in 2018.” Fears of faster U.S. rate hikes have fed fears that other central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs. That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth. The Fed had caused a so called “taper tantrum” in May 2013 when it signalled it was time to stop pumping cash into the U.S. economy, a move that created havoc in financial markets -particularly in Asia. Asian markets have, so far, taken U.S. rate rises in their stride. The Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March. Rate futures fell following Powell’s remarks as traders began pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike this year. Equity markets in Europe and Wall Street turned south with the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq falling more than 1 percent each. Treasury prices slipped on Powell’s testimony with yields on the 10-year U.S. note briefly rising past 2.9 percent. They were last at 2.89 percent. The dollar staged a broad-based rally against most major currencies. It rose 0.8 percent overnight against the Australian dollar to hover near a recent 1-1/2 month top. Against the euro, it held near a three-week high after rising 0.7 percent overnight. The euro was last at $1.2231. The dollar’s gains against the Japanese yen were, however, limited. It climbed 0.4 percent overnight and was last up 0.1 percent at 107.45 yen. Commodities including base metals fell because a firmer dollar depreciates their value. Oil fell amid expectations that upcoming weekly data will show an increase in U.S. crude inventories. Brent crude futures closed down $1.09 at $66.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 22 cents at $62.79. Spot gold slipped to $1,316.86 an ounce, not far from Tuesday’s $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-02-28,"TOKYO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices extended declines into a second day after industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles, with surging production in the country hampering OPEC attempts to end a global glut. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $62.82 by 0028 GMT, after falling 90 cents the previous session. Brent crude was yet to trade. On Tuesday, the contract fell 87 cents to close at $66.63 a barrel. U.S. crude stockpiles climbed last week as imports increased, while gasoline inventories climbed and distillate stocks were drawn down, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. Crude inventories rose by 933,000 barrels in the week to 421.2 million, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.1 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 1.3 million barrels, the API said. Refinery crude runs dropped by 209,000 barrels per day, API data showed. Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick
