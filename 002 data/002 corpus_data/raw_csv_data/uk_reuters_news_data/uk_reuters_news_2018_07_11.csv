2018-07-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) faces at least two lawsuits by U.S. shareholders accusing the big Anglo-Swiss mining company of having made false and misleading disclosures before it received a subpoena in a corruption probe, and its stock tumbled. The lawsuits were filed on Monday with the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, and on Wednesday after market hours with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They accused Glencore of concealing how its conduct would subject it to heightened regulatory scrutiny into its compliance with money laundering and bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Glencore did not immediately respond after market hours on Wednesday to requests for comment. Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg is a defendant in both lawsuits, and Chief Financial officer Steven Kalmin is a defendant in the New Jersey lawsuit. Glencore’s U.S.-listed shares fell 9 percent on July 3 after the company disclosed having a day earlier received a Department of Justice subpoena concerning its operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Venezuela. On Wednesday, Glencore said it would cooperate with the Justice Department and had set up a board committee, including chairman and former BP Plc (BP.L) Chief Executive Tony Hayward, to oversee its response. Some analysts have said the subpoena might have resulted from Glencore’s settling of a mining dispute in Congo with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, under U.S. sanctions since last year, by agreeing to pay royalties in euros. Analysts have said Congo accounts for about 25 percent of Glencore’s net present value. Glencore mines cobalt, a key ingredient in batteries for electric vehicles, in the central African country. Both lawsuits seek unspecified damages for shareholders, who hope to pursue their claims as groups in class actions. It is common for shareholders to file U.S. lawsuits accusing companies of misleading them about their businesses and saying that their stock prices declined once the truth came out. The cases are Church v Glencore Plc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 18-11477; and Robison v Glencore Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-06286.

2018-07-11,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s next energy agenda will prioritize increasing gasoline and diesel production and later decide on possible changes to the industry reform championed by the outgoing government, according to a top aide to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Rocio Nahle, tapped by Lopez Obrador to be energy minister, told local outlet Aristegui Noticias on Wednesday that the country’s next government will address the “energy imbalance” in which Mexico produces less fuel at home and turns to imports to meet national demand. Lopez Obrador won a landslide victory in the July 1 election and will take office in December. “We will be assessing if any legislative changes (to the oil opening) are necessary,” said Nahle, adding that the transition team would not immediately propose changes to the existing laws. The comments by Nahle, who also won a Senate seat in the election, are in line with Lopez Obrador’s pledge last weekend to end Mexico’s massive fuel imports over the first three years of his term. So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of about 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and another 232,000 bpd of diesel, almost all of it from the United States, as gasoline output at the country’s six refineries owned and operated by state-run Pemex [PEMX.UL] has halved since 2013, the first year of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto’s term. Domestic gasoline output barely meets a quarter of national demand from the country’s legions of motorists. During the election campaign, Lopez Obrador was sharply critical of the Pena Nieto’s policy to allow foreign and private oil companies to operate fields on their own for the first time in decades, ending Pemex’s monopoly. The overhaul was designed to reverse a decade-long oil output slide and has already resulted in competitive auctions that have awarded more than 100 exploration and production contracts, deals Lopez Obrador has repeatedly promised to review for signs of corruption. Nahle said the next government will also begin construction of at least one new oil refinery, which she expects to be operating by the halfway point of Lopez Obrador’s six-year term. So far this year, Pemex’s existing refineries are producing an average of 220,000 bpd of gasoline and about 125,000 bpd of diesel, according to company data.

2018-07-11,"CALGARY (Reuters) - OPEC President Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Wednesday that volatility in the crude market was undesirable and OPEC prefers a more stable price environment, speaking after crude had its biggest one-day drop in two years. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large producers are working on a long-term plan to build spare capacity that would cushion the market from unexpected outages, he said.  When Libya reopened key oil exporting ports on Wednesday, global oil prices fell sharply, with benchmark Brent futures plunging 6.92 percent, the steepest one-day drop in two years. [O/R] “Fluctuation is not good and we do not like to see lots of fluctuation in the prices,” Al-Mazrouei said, speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a Canada-United Arab Emirates Business Council event in Calgary. Tripoli-based Libya National Oil Corp said on Wednesday four export terminals were being reopened after a standoff that had shut down most of the OPEC member’s oil output. Libyan oil production has fallen to 527,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a high of 1.28 million bpd in February following port closures in late June, the NOC said on Monday. The fluctuations will continue as long as there is no long-term plan for production, Al-Mazrouei said.  “OPEC and non-OPEC are working on this long-term plan for market stability,” he said. While the group cannot order countries to invest to increase production, Al-Mazrouei said his presence in Canada was aimed at boosting investment in oil exploration and production.  “I am confident that we have enough spare capacity to meet the target that OPEC and non-OPEC have taken,” he said.

2018-07-11,"HOUSTON, July 11 (Reuters) - Weatherford International Plc on Wednesday said it will sell its land drilling rig operations in Algeria, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, as well as two rigs in Iraq, to ADES International Holding for $287.5 million. Weatherford is shedding underperforming assets in a bid to halt losses and trim its debt burden. The deal could boost investor confidence that Weatherford Chief Executive Mark McCollum can turn around the beleaguered oilfield services company. “Mark McCollum’s vision is finally starting to take shape,” James West, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note on Wednesday. “Weatherford may be hitting its stride on the path to becoming a sustainable, focused powerhouse within the industry.” Investors had anticipated the sale to bring in around $250 million, he said. The deal will include 31 land drilling rigs, related contracts and roughly 2,300 employees and contract workers, the company said. It expects most of the transactions to be largely completed by year-end. Weatherford said it expects to sell its remaining drilling rigs in smaller transactions in the coming quarters. McCollum joined Weatherford last year from rival Halliburton Co, where he had been chief financial officer. He inherited a company with $7.9 billion in debt and still working to recover from the 2014 downturn in oil prices. On Wednesday, its shares were trading at $3.49, off more than 85 percent from four years ago. McCollum has pledged $1 billion in cost savings by the end of 2019 and is selling assets to pare debt. Last December the firm sold its U.S. fracking business to rival Schlumberger NV . In addition to its land rig business, the company is looking to sell four smaller businesses that could generate up to $500 million. In May, McCollum said the firm may need to sell one of its larger businesses to make a major dent in its debt load.

2018-07-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s acting chief said on Wednesday he would push to cut regulations on industry and speed up decisions on permits, echoing the policies of former head Scott Pruitt who stepped down last week.  Andrew Wheeler, a longtime Washington insider, took the reins on Monday after Pruitt, a former attorney general from Oklahoma, resigned over more than a dozen ethics controversies.  Unlike Pruitt, Wheeler has been known to shun the spotlight. But some environmentalists say his experience means he can carry out Trump’s policy of slashing regulations more effectively.  Wheeler said President Donald Trump talked to him last week and asked him to provide regulatory relief to industry while protecting air and water quality. “I think we can do all three of those things at the same time,” Wheeler said in his first address to EPA staff. Environmentalists have complained that the EPA under Trump has worked to reverse Obama era limits on pollution.  Wheeler worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Senator Jim Inhofe, a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant. He said that he was “not at all ashamed” of more recent lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, the focus of criticism by environmentalists. His top issue in work for Murray was the Miners Protection Act, shoring up pension and healthcare benefits for United Mine Worker retirees, said Wheeler, whose grandfather was a coal miner during the Great Depression. Robert Murray, the company’s chief executive, has pressured the Trump administration to ease regulations on mining.  Wheeler also lobbied for energy interests including utility Xcel Energy Inc, Bears Head LNG. He also consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland, and International Paper, according to his public financial disclosures.  The EPA will prioritize cleaning up industrial Superfund sites and financing investments in water infrastructure, Wheeler said, continuing Pruitt’s goal of bringing the agency “back to basics.” Wheeler also pledged to speed up permitting, setting a goal of issuing decisions on all permits before the agency in six months. He said this would ease uncertainty for small businesses. Left unmentioned was Pruitt’s final move at the agency to undo rules on refurbished trucks known as “gliders,” which environmentalists say generate as much as 40 times the pollution of modern engines.  Like Pruitt, Wheeler believes the EPA in the previous administration of Barack Obama overstepped federal clean air law by issuing rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Wheeler, who had been confirmed by the Senate to serve as Pruitt’s deputy, will deal with issues including replacing the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, requirements of biofuels mixed into gasoline and diesel, and whether the EPA chief has a role in promoting U.S. fossil-fuel exports. On Monday, after pressure from industry for regulatory certainty, the EPA sent a rule to reduce greenhouse emissions from power plants to the White House’s office of Management and Budget for review. It is expected to be more industry friendly than the Clean Power Plan. The EPA will open the rule to public comment after the OMB reviews it. It is not yet known if Trump will nominate Wheeler to replace Pruitt permanently, if he does, the Senate would again have to confirm him.

2018-07-11,"BRUSSELS, July 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will on Wednesday welcome a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, but say that it must be used to cut the risk of confrontation and address Russian “malign activity”. Trump is due to meet Putin on Monday, a meeting which has raised eyebrows among Western allies because it comes days after the U.S. leader attended a NATO summit aimed at bolstering Europe’s defences against what it calls Russian aggression. May’s spokesman, speaking to reporters ahead of a dinner for NATO leaders on Wednesday, said the prime minister was planning to highlight Kremlin-linked cyber attacks and the use of a Soviet-era nerve agent on British soil. “I welcome President Trump’s forthcoming meeting with President Putin: open channels of communication between the U.S. and Russia are key to managing the risks of confrontation,” she planned to say, according to the spokesman. Her endorsement of the Trump-Putin meeting attempts to cut off awkward questions about Trump’s commitment to NATO, an organisation he has openly and repeatedly criticised, which has dogged the ongoing NATO summit and threatened to undermine Trump’s visit to London later this week. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump called for NATO leaders to increase their defence spending to 4 percent of their country’s economic output — double the group’s goal of 2 percent, which only a handful of members currently meet anyway. Britain’s official stance on Russia has been ‘engage, but beware’, but direct diplomatic relations have effectively frozen since London blamed Moscow for the use of a nerve agent in an attempted murder of a Russian former spy living in England. Russia has denied any involvement in the incident, and rejects Western claims that it has orchestrated high profile cyber attacks. At the NATO dinner, May will look to leverage the presence of fellow Western leaders by urging that engagement with Russia must come from a position of strength, underpinned by a strong transatlantic alliance. “As we engage Russia we must do so from a position of unity and strength — holding out hope for a better future, but also clear and unwavering on where Russia needs to change its behaviour for this to become a reality,” she planned to say. “And, as long as Russia persists in its efforts to undermine our interests and values, we must continue to deter and counter them.” (Reporting by William James Editing by Catherine Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-summit-britain/uk-welcomes-trump-putin-meeting-says-it-must-address-russian-malign-activity-idUKL8N1U75AF,11 Jul 2018,"British Prime Minister Theresa

2018-07-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global benchmark Brent crude oil had its biggest one-day drop in two years on Wednesday as escalating U.S.-China trade tensions threatened to hurt oil demand, and news that Libya would reopen its ports raised expectations of growing supply. Brent crude LCOc1 fell $5.46, or 6.9 percent, to settle at $73.40 a barrel. The decline was the largest one-day move on a percentage basis since Feb. 9, 2016. U.S. crude CLc1 fell $3.73, or 5 percent, to $70.38 a barrel.  The sell-off began early in the session after Libya’s National Oil Company said it would reopen ports which had been closed since late June. “The headline on Libya was merely the trigger,” said John Saucer, a vice president at advisory firm Mobius Risk Group. The sell-off intensified after news of a fall in U.S. crude oil inventories failed to reverse market sentiment.  “The scope of today’s sell-off is unequivocally a speculative washout,” said Saucer. Hedge funds and other money managers with bullish wagers appeared to pare long positions, pulling back from positions added as crude approached three and a half year highs last month, Saucer said.      The selling pressure intensified as trade tensions between the U.S. and China raised concerns about demand. The specter of tariffs on a further $200 billion of Chinese goods sent commodities lower, along with stock markets, as tension between the world’s biggest economies intensified. “Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China has prompted risk aversion in today’s trading session, which is evident in oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy. Crude oil prices also fell as the U.S. dollar rose on Wednesday’s surprisingly strong U.S. inflation report, which increased prospects the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates twice more this year. A stronger dollar can weaken dollar-denominated commodities, like crude. “Trade concerns have bitten today,” said Michael McCarthy, chief markets strategist at CMC Markets. “If these tariffs are introduced, there will be an impact on global growth and demand.” China is a top buyer of U.S. crude, and has said it could tax U.S. oil if trade tensions escalate. Tripoli-based Libya National Oil Corp said on Wednesday four export terminals were being reopened after eastern factions handed over the ports, ending a standoff that had shut down most of Libya’s oil output. Libyan oil production has fallen to 527,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a high of 1.28 million bpd in February following port closures in late June, the NOC said on Monday.     “Libyan relief changes the conversation about spare capacity,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. Concerns about a lack of spare capacity had led crude to rally.  Prospects of U.S. sanctions on crude exports from Iran, the world’s fifth-biggest oil producer, has helped push oil prices up in recent weeks, with both crude contracts trading near 3-1/2-year highs until Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington would consider requests from some countries to be exempt from sanctions due to go into effect in November to prevent Iran from exporting oil. Washington had previously said countries must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial restrictions, with no exemptions. The market shrugged off bullish U.S. government data showing crude stockpiles slumped by nearly 13 million barrels last week, the biggest slide in nearly two years. [EIA/S] USOILC=ECI Supply to the U.S. market has also been squeezed by the loss of some Canadian oil production. “In spite of the extraordinary draw in crude oil inventories, the market is under pressure after refiners produced a record amount of gasoline this week and in conjunction with a greater than expected build in distillate inventories,” said Andrew Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.  During the session, CME Group said a technical issue impacted connectivity for some customers. “Our markets remain open while we work directly with customers to resolve the issue,” a CME spokesman said in an emailed statement.

2018-07-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns about an escalating U.S.-China trade war made markets topsy-turvy on Wednesday, with U.S. stocks breaking a four-session winning streak and Brent crude prices seeing their biggest one-day drop in two years. Even so, the U.S. dollar hit a six-month high against the safe-haven Japanese yen as currency traders put trade worries aside and focused on Labor Department data that showed producer prices rising more than expected. Metal prices also slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat overnight of 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods dampened hopes that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row. The clock now starts ticking on a two-month period of public comment before the levies are imposed.

2018-07-11,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari said on Wednesday the country will sign up soon to a $3 trillion (2.27 trillion pounds) African free-trade agreement. Nigeria is one of Africa’s two largest economies, the other being South Africa. Buhari’s government had refused to join a continental free-trade zone established in March, on the grounds that it wishes to defend its own businesses and industry.  The administration later said it wanted more time to consult business leaders. “In trying to guarantee employment, goods and services in our country, we have to be careful with agreements that will compete, maybe successfully, against our upcoming industries,” Buhari told a news conference during a visit by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. “I am a slow reader, maybe because I was an ex-soldier. I didn’t read it fast enough before my officials saw that it was all right for signature. I kept it on my table. I will soon sign it.” Earlier Ramaphosa told a business conference in Abuja that South Africa saw huge benefits from the continental free trade deal and that a draft agreement relating to the movement of people was being reviewed. In his first visit to Nigeria since becoming South Africa’s president in February, Ramaphosa said he was seeking greater collaboration between the two countries.  He condemned xenophobic attacks on foreigners in South Africa, including Nigerians, against a backdrop of economic hardship and soaring unemployment.  “This is a working visit to come to Nigeria and I’ve made it a specific issue that I want relations with Nigeria to improve exponentially,” Ramaphosa told the conference. Nigeria and South Africa have the two largest economies in Africa. Along with Angola, they make up about three-fifths of sub-Saharan Africa’s annual economic output. Both countries have been hit hard in recent years by low commodity prices that slowed growth, cut government revenues and weakened their currencies. But each has emerged from recession, largely because of a rebound in commodity prices.  The growth of the two economies played a large part in the World Bank’s forecast that sub-Saharan Africa’s economy will grow by 3.1 percent this year, up from 2.6 percent in 2017. The continental free-trade zone, which encompasses 1.2 billion people, was initially joined by 44 countries in March. South Africa signed up earlier this month. Six countries, including Nigeria, are yet to sign the agreement. Economists point to the continent’s low level of intra-regional trade as one of the reasons for Africa’s enduring poverty and lack of a strong manufacturing base. African Union officials said countries that have signed the agreement will need to submit a schedule of tariffs by December, adding that they expect intra-African trade to double over the next four years once tariffs are reduced.

The metal shrapnel blown out from the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at the refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, tore through a tank containing hot asphalt, which spread fire through the plant, Kristen Kulinowski, the safety board’s interim executive, said. The metallurgical analysis may determine what caused the explosion “It’s a painstaking process as much of the metal is covered with asphalt,” Kulinowski said. The refinery has remained shut since the explosion on April 26. Husky spokeswoman Kim Guttormson said there is no date for the restart of the refinery, but the company may provide an update on its July 26 conference call on second-quarter earnings. The CSB has not released control of the FCCU to Husky, board spokeswoman Hillary Cohen said. Another update on the investigation will be issued in August.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat overnight of 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods dampened hopes that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row. The clock now starts ticking on a two-month period of public comment before the levies are imposed. Trump has said he may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. U.S. stocks fell but were not hit as hard as in Shanghai, where shares closed 1.78 percent lower and the yuan weakened toward last week’s 11-month lows. “Unfortunately the markets haven’t come to grips with the current levels of trade policies and tariffs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. “Concerns over trade and trade wars are really having an adverse effect, less so on the U.S. markets than the international markets, but it is certainly taking a bite.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 195.89 points, or 0.79 percent, to 24,723.77, the S&P 500 lost 17.65 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,776.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 34.64 points, or 0.45 percent, to 7,724.56. In Europe, shares extended losses after Trump kicked off a NATO summit in Brussels by accusing Germany of being a “captive” of Russia. Australia’s dollar, often seen as a proxy for China’s economic fortunes due to Australian raw materials exported there, was 1.09 percent lower. Industrial metals copper, zinc and lead all slumped as much as 4 percent to their lowest levels in about a year over worries that the dispute could dent China’s commodity-hungry economy. Copper lost 3.12 percent to $6,135.00 a tonne. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.41 percent to $2,060.50 a tonne. Brent crude futures nosedived, settling at $73.40 per barrel, down $5.46 or 6.92 percent. U.S. crude oil futures settled $3.73, or 5.03 percent, lower at $70.38 per barrel. Wall Street’s S&P 500 stepped back from the six-month high it neared on Tuesday as it rode a wave of optimism about positive U.S. corporate earnings. Morgan Stanley told clients in a research note on Wednesday that the trade conflict is “creating earnings noise and eroding gains from fiscal stimulus, which we think was already in the price.” The dollar index rose 0.6 percent. The safe-haven Japanese yen weakened 0.94 percent versus the greenback at 112.03 per dollar. Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Amy Caren

2018-07-11,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused Germany on Wednesday of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, before a NATO summit where he pressed allies to more than double defence spending. Having lambasted NATO members for failing to reach a target of spending 2 percent of national income on defence, Trump told fellow leaders in Brussels he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, officials said. That would represent a massive upheaval of budgetary priorities in Europe where Germany and many others have pledged only to reach 2 percent by 2024 or later, and it was not clear what allies would spend the money on. At the end of the first session of a two-day summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the aim first was to reach 2 percent, but moments later Trump tweeted that allies were undercutting the United States on trade and needed to immediately up spending. The exchange was part of an uncomfortable day as anxious Western allies were subjected to the U.S. president’s “America first” approach. His comment that Germany was controlled by Russia earned a rebuke from Berlin. “We are not prisoners, neither of Russia nor of the United States,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.  But Trump was also at times enthusiastic and affable, exchanging embraces and handshakes with fellow leaders, posing for photographs in front of a NATO military band and mingling at a summit dinner in a Brussels museum. Unlike a fraught Group of Seven summit in Canada in June, Trump did not block a final leaders’ statement, which paved the way for Macedonia to start NATO membership talks and a modernisation of the alliance to better deter Moscow. Earlier, Trump strode into NATO’s new glass-and-steel headquarters and into the amphitheatre-like North Atlantic Council decision-making chamber to shake hands with leaders - but only after publicly railing against Germany, one of NATO’s top European powers, at a breakfast meeting with Stoltenberg. Trump told Stoltenberg Germany was wrong to support an $11-billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet targets for NATO spending. “We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia,” Trump said in the presence of reporters. “We’re protecting Germany, we’re protecting France, we’re protecting all of these countries. And then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where they’re paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia,” he said. “I think that’s very inappropriate.” Trump appeared to substantially overstate German reliance on Russian energy and to imply Berlin was funding a pipeline that Chancellor Angela Merkel says is a commercial venture. She hit back by contrasting her own experience of growing up in Soviet-controlled East Germany with the sovereign, united Germany now playing a major role in NATO. Trump and Merkel later held businesslike talks on the sidelines. Trump said he had a “very, very good relationship” with Merkel who described the two as “good partners”. A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had voiced his “personal attachment” to Europe and gave “rather positive and constructive messages” to his allies.  “There is no break-up between America and Europe,” the source said after Macron and Trump held “friendly” talks. But with tensions in the alliance smouldering over Trump’s trade tariffs on European steel, his earlier comments fuelled concerns about the U.S. role in keeping the peace that has reigned since World War Two. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for “fair play” and more respect for multilateralism.  Baltic leaders, fearful of any repeat of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, called for unity, while Slovak President Andre Kiska said his country was “one of the good guys” because it was increasing defence spending. Those comments underscored the risks to Trump’s strategy by dividing allies between those who spend more on defence and those who do not, such as Belgium, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg, but who contribute with troops to NATO missions. NATO’s Stoltenberg later told reporters that Trump, who will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, had used “very direct language” but that NATO spending was rising strongly. The NATO chief was also frank about the impact of Trump’s stance at a broader level.  “There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimise the negative impact on NATO,” he said. “So far it hasn’t impacted on NATO that much. I cannot guarantee that that will not be the case in the future. The transatlantic bond is not one, there are many ties, some of them have been weakened.”  Additional reporting by William James, Sabine Siebold, Humeyra Pamuk, Phil Stewart, Writing by Alastair Macdonald and Robin Emmott, Editing by Mark Heinrich and Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nato-summit/update-9-trump-calls-germany-captive-of-russia-demands-higher-defence-spending-idUKL8N1U71LJ,11 Jul 2018,"* But some transatlantic ties ""have been weakened""

2018-07-11,"HOUSTON, July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chemical Safety Board is analyzing metal blasted away from a unit at Husky Energy Inc’s Superior, Wisconsin, refinery as part of an on-going probe of an April 26 explosion, the agency’s acting executive said on Wednesday. The shrapnel blown away from the gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the 36,000 barrel-per-day refinery tore through other refinery units including a tank containing hot asphalt, which poured out in a wave of flame across the refinery, said Kristen Kulinowski, the board’s interim executive. The risk of further explosions forced most of Superior’s 27,000 residents to evacuate for 24 hours. The metallurgical analysis is proceeding slowly, Kulinowski said. “It’s a painstaking process as much of the metal is covered with asphalt,” she said. The Superior refinery has remained shut since the explosion. Like the National Transportation Safety Board, the CSB has no regulatory or enforcement authority but recommends changes in industry practices and regulations based on its investigations.

2018-07-11,"ANKARA/LONDON (Reuters) - The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said last week that Tehran would block all exports through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if countries heed U.S. calls to stop buying Iranian oil from November. A fifth of global oil consumption passes through the Strait from Middle East crude producers to major markets. Outlined below are previous confrontations in the Gulf involving Iran, the military capabilities of the various parties and the diplomatic context of the latest threats: [nL1N1TS0ZR][nL8N1U13OA][nL8N1U02XF] Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Oman’s territorial waters. However, ships pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy. In 2016, the Guards interrogated and held U.S. sailors overnight after they entered Iranian territorial waters elsewhere in the Gulf. A year earlier, Iran fired shots at a Singapore-flagged tanker which it said damaged an Iranian oil platform and held a container ship and its crew for a week over a debt dispute after diverting it with patrol boats in the Strait. In 2007, Iran detained British sailors further north in the Gulf. Iran also performs annual war games and tests medium range cruise and ballistic missiles. The deputy head of IRGC, Hossein Salami said in 2014 that Iran could use its cruise and ballistic missiles and drones, mines, speedboats, and missile launchers in the Gulf area to confront the United States. In 2015, the Guards staged a drill, shown on state television, in which a replica of a U.S. aircraft carrier was destroyed with missiles and speed-boats loaded with explosives while the guards practiced laying mines in the Strait. In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Guards and U.S. military in the Gulf. The U.S. navy has said that from January 2016 to August 2017 there was an average of 2.5 “unsafe” or “unprofessional” interactions per month between U.S. Navy and Iranian maritime forces, including an Iranian drone flying near a U.S. Navy warplane and Iranian military boat sailing close to a US Navy vessel. Tehran has accused U.S. forces of provocation. “Their security and the security of their interests in the region are in our hands” the Guards’ Salami said this year, although the number of incidents has dropped in recent months. During the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-1988 the two sides attacked ships in the Gulf to hamper one another’s oil exports in what was known as the Tanker War. In 1988, a U.S. frigate struck an Iranian mine, blowing a hole in its hull and breaking its keel, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) said. The United States destroyed two Iranian oil terminals, sank an Iranian warship and damaged another in response, the ONI said. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is tasked with protecting commercial ships in the area. U.S. officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a “red line” and have pledged to take action to reopen it. “We have the forces we need to maintain free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation,” Navy Capt. Bill Urban, U.S. Central Command spokesman told Reuters. Western navies also stage military exercises in the Gulf and Arab states across the Gulf from Iran, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have high-tech naval capacities. An ONI report said last year that Iran’s Guards’ naval doctrine was “based on speed, numbers, stealth, survivability, and lethality” and that it had aquired fast attack craft, small boats, anti-ship cruise missiles and mines. “Individually, these improvements cannot compete with Western technology. However, taken together, they could create an overall capability that is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly when employed in tight operational spaces like the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz,” the ONI said. The U.S. has said it would use minesweepers, warship escorts and potentially air strikes to protect the free flow of commerce but reopening the Strait could be a lengthy process especially if the Guards laid mines. Michael Connell, head of the Iran programme with U.S. non-profit research body CNA, said of all Iran’s capabilities, mines were probably the one that caused the most concern. He also said a misjudged incident which would trigger direct fire was a more likely scenario than a blockade of the Strait. “I would be less worried about a bolt out of the blue attempt to close the Strait and more worried about stumbling into a conflict,” he said. Iranian officials differ over the significance of the latest threat to close the Strait. “By calling on countries to cut their oil exports from Iran, America has already declared war on Iran,” a senior Iranian official and a former Revolutionary Guards commander who served during the 1980s war with Iraq told Reuters. “If we come to that point of not being able to export any oil, we will surely close the waterway.” Another official, who like the first declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, placed the threat in the context of talks with world powers on the future of the nuclear deal. Iran has said it would remain in the deal, which frees it from international sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, only if its interests were guaranteed. “The Strait issue gives Iran an upper hand in the talks. Everyone should know that Iran cannot be pressured,” the second  senior Iranian government official said. “Iran has never closed the waterway ... even under the worst conditions and mounted pressure on the country.” Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iran/explainer-how-could-iran-disrupt-gulf-oil-flows-idUKL8N1U52QH,11 Jul 2018,"The commander of Iran's

2018-07-11,"(Reuters) - Fast-food company Restaurant Brands International (QSR.TO) said on Wednesday it plans to open 1,500 outlets of its Canadian coffee-and-donut chain Tim Hortons in China over the next decade, capitalizing on a growing cafe culture in the world’s second-largest economy. The move, its biggest expansion outside of the core Canadian market, is part of new President Alex Macedo’s two-pronged strategy to battle intense competition in the fast-food industry at home and to fix its bruised reputation. “One is improving and increasing our leadership in Canada, and the second is taking a little bit of Canada to the world,” Macedo, told Reuters in an interview ahead of Wednesday’s announcement at parent Restaurant Brands International’s (QSR.TO) Oakville, Ontario, headquarters.  The move into China, in a joint venture with private equity firm Cartesian Capital Group, adds to Tim Hortons’ global footprint, after last year’s entry into the Philippines, Britain, Spain and Mexico. Tim Hortons will keep its beverage offering the same in China but will customize its food menu for the local market, Macedo told Reuters on Wednesday. Tim Hortons has operated in the United States since 1984 and the United Arab Emirates since 2011. Tim Hortons has 4,256 locations across Canada, 725 in the United States and between five and 20 in the countries it entered last year, according to the company. Macedo, who became president of Tim Hortons in December, is seeking to stem profit declines and sweeten customer sentiment amid a bitter and public feud with a group of unhappy franchisees in Canada and the United States that pushed public perception of the chain to 50th place in a January survey from fourth a year earlier.  China’s coffee and tea consumption is expected to climb to 750,218 metric tons by 2020, from 693,748 in 2015, according to Statista. Shanghai alone has an estimated 6,500 coffee houses, with small chains, independent stores and bakeries battling for a slice of a market that research firm Mintel says could grow to 79 billion yuan ($11.84 billion) by 2022 from 60 billion yuan this year. Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) is aiming to have 10,000 coffee shops in China within a decade, more than the United States. “I wouldn’t say (Tim Hortons) has saturated the market in Canada, but they’re mightily close,” said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel in Toronto. Madden is waiting for the franchisee issues to be resolved and for valuations to come down to buy the stock. RBI shares were up 1.8 percent at C$82.57 in early trades,  their highest level since November. At home, Macedo admitted Tim Hortons could have operated differently to reduce negative publicity and said the company is taking a slew of measures, including upgrading outlets, a new kids menu and all-day breakfast. It also began testing deliveries this week and plans to introduce self-service kiosks, he said.  Many of these ideas came from franchisees, he said, acknowledging the company had not communicated well with them in the past and that he was trying to change that by meeting disgruntled franchisees all around Canada. Great White North Franchisee Association, which was formed last year to fight the company’s alleged mismanagement of franchise operations, did not immediately comment. It has previously said that RBI inflated prices on items franchisees buy from the corporate office, a claim the company and the official franchisee advisory board, which has largely distanced itself from the GWNFA, attribute to market moves and to lack of proper communication about the reasons.      “Public perception of this brand has really been tainted and tarnished over the last year to 18 months,” Goodreid’s Madden said. “It’s going to require things that put money back into the pockets of franchisees to fix it.” Reporting by Nichola Saminather in Toronto and Karan Nagarkatti in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Laharee Chatterjee and John Benny in Bengarluru; editing by Patrick Graham, Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Jonathan Oatis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/rstrnt-brnd-china/update-4-tim-hortons-to-enter-china-as-part-of-new-strategy-to-boost-profits-perception-idUKL4N1U748L,11 Jul 2018,"Canadian coffee-and-donut chain Tim

2018-07-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ditched a detailed plan that would have forced refiners to blend more biofuels into their gasoline and diesel in 2019 to compensate for volumes likely to be exempted under the agency’s small refinery hardship waiver program, according to newly released EPA documents. The plan would have boosted the renewable fuel blending obligation for the refining industry to 11.76 percent from 10.88 percent to offset volumes lost under the waiver program, which has been expanded sharply under President Donald Trump’s EPA, and keep overall blended volumes on target. The idea was aimed at assuaging the powerful U.S. corn lobby which has accused Trump’s EPA of undermining demand for biofuels like corn-based ethanol through the waiver program, but was scrapped amid intense protest from the refining industry. “What this shows is the EPA acknowledges it has the authority and the ability to reallocate the volumes lost under the small refinery exemption program,” Geoff Cooper, an executive at the Renewable Fuels Association, said on Wednesday.     The EPA said the documents reflect the agency’s process for administering the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which is done in conjunction with the departments of Energy and Agriculture as well as the White House. The move would have likely rallied compliance credit prices that have plunged to multi-year lows amid reports of the agency’s expansion of the waiver program. Under the RFS, the EPA must set annual requirements for the volume of renewable fuels that oil refiners and other fuel companies must blend with their petroleum-based products. The 2005 policy has been a source of contention between powerful corn and oil lobbies in Washington.  The agency also has the power to exempt smaller refineries from the blending requirements if they can prove that complying with the regulation would cause them financial stress.  The EPA, under recently-resigned director Scott Pruitt, has roughly tripled the number of exemptions granted to small refiners, angering Midwest farmers and their legislative backers who say he effectively lowered the annual biofuels mandate.  Exemptions representing some 2.25 million gallons worth of biofuel were granted for 2017 and 2016, according to the EPA. That includes waivers covering 1.46 million compliance credits, called RINs, in 2017, the EPA said. Under the scrapped plan, the EPA would have estimated the number of gallons of gasoline and diesel that would likely be exempted in 2019 under the small refinery waiver program and force the larger refineries to make up the difference.  The EPA projected some 8.18 billion gallons of gasoline and 5.44 billion gallons of diesel produced by small refiners would be exempt from the requirements in 2019, the documents showed.  The documents were published by the EPA as part of requirements aimed at providing the public more insight into federal decision making. Reuters and other news outlets reported on the EPA’s 2019 volumes proposal, but the documents provide new details about the agency’s approach. The proposed changes came in a June 19th email from Tia Sutton of the EPA to the White House Office of Management and Budget. Pruitt, who resigned amid ethics scandals last week, had just returned from a Midwest tour where he met with farmers angry over his expansion of the exemption program. A day later, some legal justification was added to the proposed rule, stating “this approach is consistent with the text of our regulations, which accounts for the amount of gasoline and amount of diesel projected to be produced by exempt small refineries in 2019.”  Refiners learned of the changes and made a full-court press to the agency and White House to reverse it. Refinery-state senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both Republicans, had calls with Pruitt a day after reports of the changes circulated, according to Pruitt’s public schedule. On June 22, the EPA struck the changes in a new email to the OMB office, the documents showed.  The final proposed rule was published on June 26.

2018-07-11,"* NOC says operations to be restored swiftly * Standoff threatened to keep 850,000 bpd offline * NOC head calls for more transparency on spending (Updates with tanker at Hariga loading, detail on storage tanks) By Ayman al-Warfalli and Aidan Lewis BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS, July 11 (Reuters) - Tripoli-based National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Wednesday four export terminals were being reopened after eastern factions handed over the ports, ending a standoff that had shut down most of Libya’s oil output. Production and export operations would be restored “within the next few hours”, an NOC statement said, although the restart at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, where workers were evacuated and storage tanks damaged in fighting last month, was expected to be gradual. A tanker at Hariga terminal started loading 1 million barrels of crude on Wednesday afternoon, a port source said. Eastern factions had effectively blockaded exports from the territory they control since late June, saying too much oil revenue processed through Tripoli was going to armed groups based in western Libya, including their rivals. The disruption had threatened to keep offline as much as 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Libyan oil, from previous production of a little over 1 million bpd. It risked deepening a wedge between rival political and military alliances based in eastern and western Libya since disputed elections four years ago, and raised the prospect of complicating U.N.-led efforts to end years of turmoil since the country’s 2011 uprising. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider terminals were shut when armed opponents of eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar attacked them on June 14. The assault was repelled a week later, but eastern officials aligned with Haftar blocked the internationally recognised NOC in Tripoli from re-entering the ports and stopped loadings at Zueitina and Hariga terminals, saying they would take control of exports through a parallel NOC based in the east. NOC Tripoli said the ports were restored to its control on Wednesday, allowing it to lift force majeure, a legal waiver on contractual obligations, at all four terminals. It commended Haftar’s Libyan National Army for “putting the national interest first” by handing them back. Eastern oil facilities guards and the head of the parallel NOC, Faraj Said, confirmed the ports were reopening, although Said told Reuters that Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, which have been damaged in repeated rounds of fighting, required repairs. “The ports of Zueitina and Hariga are now open for any tankers carrying a contract. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider need some maintenance,” he said. A Reuters team that visited the ports on Tuesday found the area littered with armed vehicles destroyed in last month’s clashes. An engineer at the Harouge storage tanks in Ras Lanuf said four out of 13 tanks were still functional, with about 600,000 barrels ready for export. At Es Sider, an engineer said damage was limited to bullet holes and theft of vehicles, and that five storage tanks holding 1.4 million barrels are in use for exports. Over the past two weeks eastern factions had come under intense international pressure to end the stoppage, diplomatic sources said. Sources in the east said conditions for reopening the ports included ensuring an equitable distribution of resources across Libya, and welcomed the suggestion late on Tuesday by the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli of a committee to review central bank spending. NOC Tripoli Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the debate over fair distribution of oil revenues was “at the heart of the recent crisis”. “The real solution is transparency, so I renew my call on the responsible authorities, the ministry of finance and central bank, to publish budgets and detailed public expenditure,” he said in the NOC statement. But analysts say any deal is likely to be fragile given the slow progress so far in unifying rival central banks in east and west Libya, reforming spending and reducing the economic power of armed groups. Libya’s oil production has fluctuated widely since 2013, sending what was one of the wealthiest economies in the region into crisis. The gap between the official and black market exchange rates has fuelled corruption and criminal activity. Bloated state salaries and subsidies remain unreformed. A Western diplomat described the reopening of the ports as a “step in the right direction,” but said the actions “durability depends on how quickly a fiscal reform package moves forward”.

2018-07-11,"(Adds quotes, details) BRUSSELS, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told NATO leaders on Wednesday they should increase their defence spending to 4 percent of their country’s economic output, double the group’s current goal of two percent. NATO allies shrugged off the demand as part and parcel of Trump’s brash push for allies to spend more on their own defence at a summit in Brussels, with a quip from the alliance’s chief that it should aim to meet its goal before reaching further. “We should first get to 2 pct,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, adding that eight of the 29 allies were meeting that target, while others had a plan to do - turning a leaf on years of defence budget cuts. Striking a strident tone at the summit, Trump’s aspirational target of 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) was above the United States own spending on defence. The United States, the world’s biggest military power, spent some 3.57 percent on defence last year, according to NATO figures. A White House spokeswoman said his remarks came as he was urging leaders to increase their outlays on defence and were not a formal proposal. “He suggested that countries not only meet their commitment of 2 percent of their GDP on defence spending, but that they increase it to 4 percent,” Sarah Sanders told reporters. “Trump wants to see our allies share more of the burden and at a very minimum meet their already stated obligations.” A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron also played down Trump’s words as rhetoric, saying “it is not a new demand.” (Reporting by Jeff Mason, Jeff Mason David Brunnstrom, Humeyra Pamuk and Marine Pennetier Writing by Alissa de Carbonnel Editing by Will James)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nato-summit-trump-spending/update-1-trump-tells-nato-leaders-to-increase-defence-spend-to-4-pct-idUKL8N1U755W,11 Jul 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump

2018-07-11,"ABUJA, July 11 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari said on Wednesday the country will soon sign up to an African continental free trade agreement.

2018-07-11,"* U.S. raises stakes in China trade war * Wall Street dips, but tariff effect muted * Asian, European stocks fall, safe-havens gain broadly * Copper, zinc slide and oil retreats (Adds Wall Street open; updates throughout; changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - Stocks fell and metals prices slumped on Wednesday as U.S. threats of tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods pushed the world’s two biggest economies closer to a full-scale trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat overnight of 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods dampened hopes that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row. The clock now starts ticking on a two-month period of public comment before the levies are imposed. Trump has said he may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. U.S. stocks fell on the news but were not hit nearly as hard as in Shanghai, where shares closed 1.78 percent lower and the yuan weakening toward last week’s 11-month lows. “Unfortunately the markets haven’t come to grips with the current levels of trade policies and tariffs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. “Concerns over trade and trade wars are really having an adverse effect, less so on the U.S. markets than the international markets, but it is certainly taking a bite.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 179.96 points, or 0.72 percent, to 24,739.7, the S&P 500 lost 18.12 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,775.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 47.90 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,711.30. In Europe, shares extended losses after Trump kicked off a NATO summit in Brussels by accusing Germany of being a “captive” of Russia. Australia’s dollar, often seen as a proxy for China’s economic fortunes due to Australian raw materials exported there, was 0.83 percent lower. Industrial metals copper, zinc and lead all slumped as much as 4 percent to their lowest levels in about a year over worries that the dispute could dent China’s commodity-hungry economy. Copper lost 2.93 percent to $6,147.00 a tonne. Three-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.48 percent to $2,059.00 a tonne. Wall Street’s S&P 500 stepped back from the six-month high it neared on Tuesday as it rode a wave of optimism about positive U.S. corporate earnings. Morgan Stanley told clients in a research note on Wednesday that the trade conflict is “creating earnings noise and eroding gains from fiscal stimulus, which we think was already in the price.” The dollar index rose 0.2 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.1721. The Japanese yen received something of a safety bid. It weakened 0.51 percent versus the greenback at 111.58 per dollar. U.S. crude fell 2.32 percent to $72.39 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.34, down 3.2 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London and Amy Caren

2018-07-11,"NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - A refinery in Saudi Arabia has shipped its RBOB gasoline to the United States for the first time, a potential precursor for more deliveries to a region where prices are currently at seasonal three-year highs. The 400,000 barrels-per-day Jubail Satorp refinery, a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and French company Total, said in its verified Twitter account that it sent the shipment of reformulated blendstock gasoline - commonly called RBOB - to the United States. It did not say whether those barrels had arrived yet, and its exact destination was unclear. The shipment is unusual because when Satorp was founded in 2008, it was not expected to send RBOB to the United States, as Saudi gasoline demand remained strong, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects in New York. Satorp was not immediately available for comment. Motor gasoline inventories in the United States fell to about 239 million barrels in the week to July 6, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Stockpiles were up from the same time last year, when inventories totaled 235.7 million barrels. Market participants expect the additional supply could slow U.S. inventory drawdowns. RBOB RBOB-DIFF-NYH prices have been trading at seasonal three-year highs as crude has rallied in the midst of the busy U.S. summer driving season. Cash prices for the product in New York Harbor were at 2.00 cents per gallon above the futures benchmark on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday, the highest seasonally since 2015. The RBOB futures contract on NYMEX settled at $2.1603 a gallon on Tuesday. Energy trading companies often route vessels based on favorable spreads for crude oil and products, and right now moving gasoline to the United States is more profitable. But this shipment also could mean demand in Saudi Arabia is weakening, Campbell said. The shipment suggests that the Americas has become one of the best destinations for surplus gasoline, he added. “It’s tough because that means Asia really is quite significantly oversupplied,” Campbell said. Demand in Saudi Arabia has waned as the government has undertaken reforms that have reduced fuel consumption across several sectors, Campbell said.

2018-07-11,"(Adds additional details, prices) By David Gaffen July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stocks fell by nearly 13 million barrels last week, the most in nearly two years, dropping overall crude stocks to their lowest point since February 2015, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 12.6 million barrels in the week to July 6, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 4.5 million barrels. That dropped overall crude inventories, not including the U.S. strategic reserve, to 405.2 million barrels. Oil prices rebounded from losses on the news. The decline in overall inventories was partially due to a fall-off in stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures, which were down by 2.1 million barrels. An outage at Syncrude facility in Canada has reduced the flow of synthetic crude from Canada, sapping stocks in Cushing. In addition, overall crude imports declined on the week, falling to 7.4 million barrels per day, off by 1.3 million bpd from the week-earlier period. “It looks like it’s all in the import number. Imports were down 1.6 million bpd, multiplied by 7 that’s 11.9 million barrels,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. “There’s some refinery throughput pull back as well. Those two numbers are where this is all coming from.” U.S. oil prices jumped on the news, but later retreated, though were still above the day’s lows. U.S. crude fell 88 cents to $73.22 a barrel by 10:43 a.m. EDT (1443 GMT) while Brent crude dropped $1.81 to $77.03 a barrel. Refinery crude runs fell by 1,000 bpd, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.4 percentage point. Gasoline stocks fell by 694,000 barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 750,000 barrels drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 4.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.2 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

2018-07-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday forecast world demand for its crude will decline next year as growth in consumption slows and rivals pump more, pointing to the return of an oil market surplus despite an OPEC-led pact to restrain supplies. Giving its first 2019 forecasts in a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the world would need 32.18 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its 15 members next year, down 760,000 bpd from this year. The drop in demand for OPEC crude means there will be less strain on producers such as Saudi Arabia in making up for supply losses such as falling Venezuelan and Libyan output, and an imminent drop in Iranian exports as U.S. sanctions return. “Following the robust growth seen this year, oil market developments are expected to slightly moderate in 2019, with the world economy and global oil demand forecasts to grow slightly less,” OPEC said in the report. Oil LCOc1 topped $80 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014, boosted by OPEC-led output cuts and involuntary supply losses. U.S. President Donald Trump has been urging Saudi Arabia and OPEC to raise output to cool prices. OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries agreed on June 22-23 to return to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction by Venezuela and others pushed adherence above 160 percent. The strong pace of oil demand that helped OPEC balance the market is expected to wane next year. OPEC expects world oil demand to grow by 1.45 million bpd, down from 1.65 million bpd in 2018, and said any upside could be accommodated. “If the world economy performs better than expected, leading to higher growth in crude oil demand, OPEC will continue to have sufficient supply to support oil market stability,” OPEC said. Oil prices LCOc1 maintained an earlier decline on Wednesday after the release of the OPEC report, trading around $77 a barrel. In June, OPEC oil output rose by 173,000 bpd to 32.33 million bpd largely due to higher Saudi production, the report said, citing figures OPEC collects from secondary sources.  This means compliance with the original supply-cutting deal has slipped to 130 percent, according to a Reuters calculation, meaning members are still cutting more than promised. OPEC’s June output is 150,000 bpd more than OPEC expects the demand for its oil to average next year, suggesting a small surplus in the market should OPEC keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal. Still, a drop in Iranian exports could easily push the balance back to deficit. Iranian news agency Mehr, citing figures from the state oil company, said oil exports would drop by 500,000 bpd with the restart of sanctions. And the higher prices that have followed the OPEC-led deal have prompted growth in rival supply and a surge of U.S. shale. OPEC expects non-OPEC supply to expand by 2.1 million bpd next year, far more than the expansion in world demand. Next year’s supply growth will be led by the United States, with Brazil and Canada also contributing. But OPEC sees U.S. shale supply additions slowing in the second half of 2018 and into 2019 as bottlenecks persist. “Some of the planned pipeline capacity increases have been delayed, and as a result, the takeaway capacity issue could remain a major constraint until next winter,” OPEC said.

2018-07-11,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German city of Stuttgart will bar only the most polluting diesel vehicles from its streets next year and will seek to avoid a widening of the ban by taking measures to improve air quality, a state ministry said. Stuttgart, the heartland of Germany’s automotive industry, plans to start banning diesel vehicles meeting the Euro-4 or older emissions standards from January 2019, the state ministry of Baden-Wuerttemberg said on Wednesday. “We want to avoid bans on Euro-5 diesels with a comprehensive package of clean air measures,” said Andreas Schwarz, leader of the Greens’ parliamentary group in the Baden-Wuerttemberg regional assembly. But he also said the city’s clean-air measures, such as an expansion of public transportation and electric mobility, would need to have a sufficient effect on pollution levels. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx). Dozens of German cities including Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart exceed European Union limits on NOx, which is known to cause respiratory diseases. If by mid-2019 it does not look like the measures Stuttgart has taken to improve air quality will bring its NOx levels within the legal limits, the ban could be widened to Euro-5 diesels in January 2020, the Baden-Wuerttemberg ministry said. Germany’s top administrative court ruled in February in favor of allowing major cities to ban heavily polluting diesel cars. Soon after, Hamburg became the first German city to ban diesel cars that do not meet the latest Euro-6 standards from some busy streets, seeking to raise pressure on carmakers to undertake costly retrofits. A regional court in Stuttgart had demanded last month the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, home to carmakers Mercedes-Benz and VW unit Porsche, draw up a firm plan for when it will ban Euro-5 diesels. Bans on diesel vehicles from city centers are also planned in Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to bar new diesel cars from entering the city center as soon as next year.

2018-07-11,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia has agreed a $1.9 billion (1.43 billion pounds) deal to buy 14 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made MiG-29s, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Slovakia picked the new F-16s made by Lockheed Martin over Swedish Gripen jets produced by Saab, calling them more modern and more advanced, according to an analysis published before the decision. “We picked the best solution because they are modern machines, which from a price, quality and capability point of view that we can afford, have no competition,” Defence Minister Peter Gajdos said in a statement. NATO member Slovakia plans to spend about 6.5 billion euros (5.75 billion pounds) by 2030 to modernise its military, and wants to reduce its reliance on Russian equipment, but has a maintenance contract with Russia for its 12 MiG-29s until autumn 2019.   Under the contract, which is worth 20 million to 50 million euros a year, dozens of Russian technicians are based at a Slovak military airbase. That arrangement may have to be extended as delivery of the first F-16s will take up to 36 months from the signing of the contract. Slovakia may also ask one of its neighbouring countries, which are also its NATO allies, to help protect its airspace, Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said. “Slovakia will pay 1.589 billion euros for 14 fighter jets, pilot training, ammunition and two-year logistical support,” Pellegrini told reporters. The contract with Lockheed Martin will be signed by the end of this year, Finance Minister Peter Kazimir said. Slovakia had been in talks with Gripen maker Saab for years, before Gajdos stalled discussions and invited other bidders.  That sparked criticism from government coalition partners that delays in closing the deal would prolong Slovakia’s dependence on Russia. Among central European neighbours, Hungary and the Czech Republic operate Gripens. Poland flies a large fleet of 48 F-16s while also keeping around 30 MiG 29s.Slovakia’s defence spending is due to rise from 1.2 percent of gross domestic product this year to 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent by 2024.  NATO members have agreed to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defence by 2024 and U.S. President Donald Trump, who was in Brussels for a NATO summit on Wednesday, has criticised members that are not meeting that commitment.

2018-07-11,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s top diplomat has indicated the United States might grant waivers to some countries allowing them to continue importing Iranian crude when sanctions snapback in November. “There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday in a television interview with Sky News Arabia. “We’ll consider it.” In a separate briefing for reporters travelling with the secretary, a senior State Department official elaborated on recent discussions between U.S. diplomats and their Saudi counterparts. “In our meeting with the Saudi energy minister, we discussed maintaining a well-supplied oil market to guard against volatility,” the unnamed official told reporters in a background briefing. “We coordinated – we discussed U.S. oil sanctions to deny Iran revenue to finance terrorism. We talked about minimizing market disruptions and helping partners find alternatives to Iranian supply of oil,” the official added. It remains unclear whether the latest comments from Pompeo about considering applications for waivers, and his unnamed briefer, represent a softening of the administration’s position. Press briefings given earlier this month suggested that the administration’s goal was to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero, possibly with effect from November. “Our goal is to increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue from crude oil sales,” a senior State Department official told reporters at a press briefing earlier this month. “We are working to minimize disruptions to the global market, but we are confident that there is sufficient global spare oil production capacity,” Brian Hook, the director of policy planning, said on July 2. “We are not looking to grant licences or waivers broadly on the re-imposition of sanctions, because we believe pressure is critical to achieve our national security objectives.” On the other hand, the administration has also briefed journalists on background it will review waiver applications on a case-by-case basis and work with countries that are reducing their oil imports from Iran (“U.S. says to work with allies to cut Iran oil imports”, Reuters, June 28). The current position seems to be that sanctions will definitely snapback on Nov. 4 but the United States will “consider” applications from “a handful” of countries to be allowed to continue importing some oil. The compromise would ensure at least some Iranian oil continues reaching the global market, as it did under the previous sanctions in force between 2012 and 2015. There are doubts about whether Saudi Arabia and other producers can increase output by enough to cover all the 2.4 million barrels per day of Iranian oil exports if sanctions attempted to push them to zero. Waivers and exemptions allowing at least some Iranian barrels to continue being exported may be the only practical way to re-impose sanctions without risking a sharp spike in oil prices. Price increases are especially sensitive at this time because the re-imposition of sanctions coincides with U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. Despite multiple briefings and statements by senior U.S. officials, the administration’s policy on sanctions and oil supplies remains unclear. The ambiguity may be intentional to increase pressure on Iran, but it is also maximising uncertainty in the oil market about future supplies and is likely to keep upward pressure on prices. Traders, refiners and hedge funds have been left without a clear picture of how much oil will be available to the market towards the end of the year and into 2019. Because the oil market is forward-looking, uncertainty about supplies in the final quarter and next year is directly affecting prices now. Market participants will be looking for clarity from the State Department on several key issues as they try to assess the severity of sanctions and oil availability: (1) If the administration’s target is not zero oil exports, how much crude does the United States plan to allow Iran’s customers to purchase without imposing financial penalties on them? (2) If there are to be sanctions exemptions, which countries and/or companies will receive them, on what basis will they be granted, and will sanctions relief be conditional? (3) Has the United States reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia (and perhaps also the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia) to offset the impact of oil volumes lost from Iran? (4) Is the imposition of sanctions, and granting of waivers, being coordinated with the European Union (especially France, Germany and Britain) and with Russia and China? Under the last round of oil sanctions, in effect from 2012 until early 2016, Iran was still able to continue exporting reduced volumes of crude amounting to around 1 million bpd, mostly to customers in Asia. If the United States plans to allow a similar volume of exports this time, it would cut exports by around 1.5 million bpd, but the administration has given no indication about likely export volumes beyond November. Last time, refiners in Japan, South Korea, India, China and Turkey were among those that continued importing limited volumes of Iranian crude, without financial penalties from the United States. In most cases, sanctions exemptions were implicitly or explicitly conditional on promises to reduce the volume of imported Iranian crude over time (“Iran sanctions”, Congressional Research Service, June 29, 2018). The administration has given no indication of whether the same countries will be exempted this time and if so on what conditions. France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China have all pledged to uphold the 2015 nuclear agreement, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for limits on the country’s nuclear activities. These five countries have been negotiating a package of economic measures to provide Iran with an incentive to remain within the agreement, accept continued restrictions on nuclear activities and permit inspections. The contents of the economic package have not been published but Iran has indicated an early draft does not go far enough (“Negotiations over saving Iranian nuclear deal to continue”, Radio Free Europe, July 6). France has indicated the package might only be ready by November and Germany has said it will not be able to fully compensate for the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions. The tougher the U.S. sanctions, the more they reduce Iran’s oil export revenues, the more economic incentives that the other foreign powers may need to offer Iran to persuade the country to abide by the agreement. There may therefore be a link between the waiver process between the United States and Iran’s refining customers on the one hand, and the negotiations the Europeans, Russia and China are holding with Iran on the other. The other awkward linkage is between U.S. sanctions on Iran and the U.S. trade dispute with China over intellectual property protection, technology transfers and the bilateral trade imbalance. China is one of the largest importers of oil from both the United States and Iran. China has already targeted oil imports from the United States for retaliation in the trade dispute. If China stops buying crude oil from the United States, it will need to find other sources of supply, one of which might be Iran. China’s leaders must make a tricky calculation. The country might actually increase oil imports from Iran to express its displeasure with the United States and diversify its crude supply. But that would be provocative and risk secondary sanctions being applied to China’s major oil companies – many of which have business dealings with the United States. Alternatively, China could leave its imports from Iran unchanged, reduce them and apply for waivers, or cut them to zero. Heeding sanctions would avert a further intensification of disputes with the United States but reduce China’s oil buying options, reduce its supply security, and risk further upward pressure on oil prices. China has so far matched U.S. actions at each step of the bilateral trade dispute, but it has not sought to escalate the conflict, so the country may try to avoid the provocation of increasing oil imports from Iran. If the U.S.-China trade dispute continues to worsen, however, sanctions policy could become entangled in the broader strategic conflict between the two superpowers.

2018-07-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) is planning to raise $3.5 billion for investments in energy infrastructure in what is poised to be its largest alternative investment fund yet, an executive at the world’s largest asset manager told Reuters. The company announced on Wednesday that it has already raised $1.5 billion for the Global Energy and Power Infrastructure Fund III. The private fund will focus on operating infrastructure, such as power plants, pipelines and wind farms, in developed markets, potentially including the United States. Mark Florian, BlackRock’s global head of its energy and power infrastructure team, said there is growing demand for new infrastructure as countries around the world shift from coal and nuclear power sources to natural gas and renewable energy. He said large utilities and global energy companies are outsourcing the management and development of infrastructure, creating an opportunity for investment organizations such as his that want to provide capital. “The needs are just getting bigger,” Florian said in a telephone interview. BlackRock, known more for its stock and bond funds, has been building up its infrastructure unit, which it started in 2011. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has told analysts this year that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to “be one of the more significant” drivers for BlackRock’s business over the next few years. The latest fundraising comes just over a year after BlackRock closed a deal to buy First Reserve Corp’s Energy Infrastructure Funds unit, bringing over some of that company’s existing funds and employees. Overall, BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion in assets, including $41 billion on the “real assets” team that includes the energy infrastructure business.

2018-07-11,"DHAKA, July 11 (Reuters) - General Electric and Mitsubishi Corporation are forming a joint venture with a Bangladesh private power firm to set up a 2,400 megawatt (MW) thermal power plant and related oil and LNG terminals in an investment of $3 billion, the companies said on Wednesday. The local firm, Summit, will hold 55 percent equity while Mitsubishi will take 25 percent and GE 20 percent. The project involves four thermal units of 600 MW each, a 380,000 metre cubic capacity liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and oil terminals with 100,000 metric tons capacity. The three firms signed a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday. Muhammad Aziz Khan, chairman of the Summit Group, said the plan is to launch the project next year and complete it by 2023. “The project will be using the world’s most efficient and environment friendly technology,” he said. Nearly 30 percent of Bangladesh’s population do not have access to electricity. “We have joined in this tripartite agreement with the widest experience in infrastructure and energy,” said Tetsuji Nakagawa, senior vice president of Mitsubishi. “In partnership with Summit Power, our HA technology enables unprecedented levels of efficiency to strengthen Bangladesh’s power generation,” Russell Stokes, president and chief executive officer of GE Power, said at a deal signing event in Dhaka.

2018-07-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Germany’s BASF (BASFn.DE) managed to wrap up a preliminary deal to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex quite quickly, aided in part by trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, sources with knowledge of the matter said. The proposed complex, worth some $10 billion in investment to 2030, will be located in Guangdong, China’s most populous province which had been worried about the impact of a U.S. decision to heavily penalize telecom firm ZTE Corp (0763.HK) (000063.SZ), also based there.     Fears that a U.S.-China trade war would hurt investment prospects for the business-friendly province made local government officials that much more receptive to overtures by BASF, a global giant with state-of-the art technology, separate people briefed on matter also said.     BASF’s announcement, part of $23 billion worth of bilateral deals unveiled as German Chancellor Angela Merkel met Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Berlin this week is conspicuous for its timing, trade and chemical industry experts said. In reaching out to Europe, China is showing it is open for business as the trade row with Washington deepens. BASF’s coup, while still a rare example of a foreign player prising open the Chinese government’s tight control over its energy and chemical industries, also follows measures by Beijing to lift some caps on foreign ownership in the auto and banking sectors. “Now that we have this trade war that was kicked off last week, Beijing is telling Washington that it is still doing business and that there are capable companies around the world to do business with,” said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore. The outcomes of Li’s visit, during which the widow of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize-winning political dissident Liu Xiaobo, left de facto house arrest in China to live in Germany, signaled a measured warming in what has been a bilateral relationship fraught with spying allegations and commercial mistrust. China this week has also approved a huge new wholly owned Shanghai factory for U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), and a $2.3 billion joint venture organic light-emitting diode (OLED) plant to be built by South Korea’s LG Display Co Ltd (034220.KS). In contrast, the Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in the trade dispute, threatening 10 percent tariffs on a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn it would be forced to retaliate. BASF’s search for a potential site for its second major project in the world’s largest chemical market had been in the works for a while, an industry insider with knowledge of the deal said. Like other sources, the industry insider declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The German firm had decided to go it alone rather than working with a state-owned partner as it had done previously and chose Guangdong as recently as three months ago, the person said, adding BASF had spied a “window of opportunity”, banking on the province’s desire for cutting-edge technology. The person also said local governments had become more aware that they “cannot not own everything” and foreign investment could help them build what they wanted. BASF’s overtures coincided with a crisis for ZTE, slapped with a ban barring U.S. suppliers from selling it components after the firm broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE has had to curtail operations and is working to lift the ban. “The ZTE case helped,” the person said on Tuesday, without elaborating further. BASF’s media relations department said the company chose Guangdong for its first major investment in South China to tap the region’s fast economic growth and declined to comment on whether ZTE’s travails had helped speed up the decision-making. Amid China’s increased openness to foreign investment, BASF’s knowledge of doing business in China meant it could “seize the right opportunity at the right time”, a Beijing-based energy industry executive said. Under the agreement, BASF will explore building an integrated chemicals complex with petrochemicals plants and a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes per year of ethylene. It is a chance to greatly expand in a Chinese chemicals market worth an estimated $1.5 trillion a year, feeding plastics, coatings and adhesives to the southern province’s fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors. By contrast, rival petrochemical giants have yet to strike wholly owned similar-sized deals in China - which accounts for around 40 percent of the world’s chemical production. So far, they’ve stuck with joint ventures even though China eased restrictions on foreign ownership in the sector in 2011. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) started an expanded joint venture petrochemical plant in Huizhou in May with China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) late last year signed a joint study memorandum of understanding with the government of Huizhou for a similar facility - although that agreement allows for the possibility of full ownership. BASF plans to do a pre-feasibility study of its site by the end of the year, followed by a thorough analysis by end-2019 with construction estimated to start in 2023. The company aims to complete the first plants by 2026. BASF’s first major foray in China, nearly two decades ago, was a joint venture with state oil major Sinopec to build a $5.2 billion petrochemical complex in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.

2018-07-11,"* Russian state firm is leader in global nuclear industry * Big rivals Areva and Westinghouse have lost ground * Rosatom pitches deals to suit nations new to nuclear * China may pose biggest challenge in coming years -experts By Geert De Clercq PARIS, July 11 (Reuters) - Rosatom is in talks with Jordan to revive a deal to build a nuclear plant in the kingdom, according to the deputy CEO of the Russian company, which is looking to add another nuclear newcomer nation to its customer list. The state-owned firm is the clear leader in the global nuclear industry after two of its biggest rivals, Areva and Westinghouse, hit financial troubles, and it has a track record of building plants in countries without any nuclear tradition. Russia signed an intergovernmental agreement with the Middle Eastern country in 2015 to build a $10 billion facility, but there has been little progress since and in recent weeks there have been local media reports that Jordanian authorities have scrapped the deal. Kirill Komarov, deputy CEO of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom, told Reuters that talks were still ongoing to resolve technical and financing issues, without elaborating. “The Jordan deal was definitely not scrapped. Maybe we need some more time with our Jordanian colleagues,” Komarov said. He added Jordan was a difficult place for nuclear as a large part of the country was desert and a reactor needs lots of water for cooling. He said that one of the options being considered was to build a smaller reactor than originally envisaged - a so-called “small modular reactor” rather than a conventional one. Industry experts say the main snag for the tender won by Rosatom was disagreements between Jordan and the Russian company over how the project should be financed. A senior source in the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission told Reuters the original project had been put on hold and now both parties were exploring the feasibility of constructing a small modular reactor. Eight years ago, France’s Areva was also in the running in Jordan, but it has since had a government bailout. Renamed Framatome, it is now part of utility EDF. The other big Western reactor builder, Toshiba-owned U.S. firm Westinghouse, has been in bankruptcy for more than a year, limiting is ability to pursue foreign contracts. With Chinese and South Korean vendors lacking much experience with building reactors abroad, that has left the field open for Rosatom. The Russian firm has an order book worth $134 billion and contracts to build 22 nuclear reactors in nine countries over the next decade, including Belarus, Bangladesh, China, India, Turkey, Finland, Hungary, Egypt and Iran. Framatome has one contract in its order book, for a nuclear plant in Hinkley Point, Britain. Westinghouse not a single one. The biggest challenge to Rosatom’s business could come from China in coming years, according to industry experts. China has the ambition to become a top nuclear vendor through its state-owned companies, even if it has little experience in building reactors abroad. With a deal to fund EDF’s project Hinkley Point project in Britain and later build its own reactors there, China has a foot in the door in a top European energy market, and it has signed cooperation agreements in several countries without nuclear. “China has the ability and the appetite to export nuclear,” said George Borovas, head of nuclear at law firm Shearman & Sterling. “I expect them to become very competitive in the global market.” NEW-BUILD CONTRACTS Rosatom has won most major global new-build contracts over the past decade. In Turkey, a country with huge energy needs, Rosatom won a $20 billion contract eight years ago to build, own and operate four reactors in Akkuyu, on the Mediterranean coast. Concrete on unit 1 was poured in April and Komarov said Rosatom has already invested $3 billion. But it is still looking for a partner to take a stake of up to 49 percent. Komarov said Rosatom is looking for a partner who can bring financing but also some industrial skills, construction skills and an understanding of Turkish energy markets. He said Rosatom has held talks with several firms in Turkey and the Middle East, and that Rosatom is still targeting startup for 2023, the centenary of the Turkish republic. Industry experts say Rosatom’s key advantage is the range of options it can provide. Unlike Westinghouse and Areva, Rosatom has the experience and financial clout to not only sell reactors but also to build the entire power plant around it. Areva, following its bailout, was split up in fuel group Orano and reactor builder Framatome, leaving Rosatom as the world’s only integrated nuclear firm, with a one-stop shopping model from uranium enrichment to nuclear waste handling. “Rosatom’s flexibility to offer different contracting methods and scenarios to suit the particular risk-taking and financial capabilities of each country, is a very smart way of approaching this industry,” said industry lawyer Borovas.

2018-07-11,"* U.S. raises stakes in China trade war * Asian, European stocks fall 1 percent, safe-havens gain broadly * Copper, zinc slide to 1-year low, oil also sharply lower * Yuan, Aussie dollar, Mexico peso, Taiwan dollar all slide * U.S. futures point to falls for Wall Street By Marc Jones LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - Stocks fell and metals prices slumped to their lowest in a year on Wednesday, as U.S. threats of tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods pushed the world’s two biggest economies ever closer to a full-scale trade war. The detailing overnight of U.S. President Donald Trump’s already-threatened 10-percent tariffs dampened hopes that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row. The clock now starts ticking on a two-month period of public comment before the levies get imposed. Trump has said he may ultimately target more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods - roughly the total amount of U.S. imports from China last year. Inevitably, Shanghai markets were hardest hit, with stocks there closing down almost 2 percent and the yuan weakening towards last week’s 11-month lows. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost more than 1 percent, as did Japan’s Nikkei as the yen received something of a safety bid. Europe’s already-weaker main bourses, extended losses after Trump kicked off a NATO summit in Brussels by accusing Germany of being a “captive” of Russia. “There is still a good six or seven weeks before these (tariffs) take effect so it is not like we are going to see these tomorrow, but it is definitely the next step in a trade war,” TD Securities global strategist James Rossiter said. “I’m curious to see what China does to retaliate in the coming days.” The concerns were also evident in currency markets. The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for China’s economic fortunes due to raw materials it sells there, fell 0.9 percent. South Korea’s won and Taiwan’s dollar both dropped about 0.7 percent while Mexico’s peso which also faces the threat of Trump ditching the NAFTA trade pact, lost 0.5 percent. It was industrial metals prices though that took the heaviest hit over worries that the dispute could ultimately dent China’s commodity-hungry economy. Copper, zinc and lead all slumped as much as 4 percent to their lowest levels in about a year. Copper was down 3 percent at $6,180.50. Nickel, tin and aluminum also dropped to multi-month lows. Trump’s latest move took the wind out of investors’ sails largely because the central scenario for many in the markets is that Washington will eventually step back from the escalating row and settle for some sort of compromise. The more it turns up the heat therefore, the more likely the tariffs get implemented, just like the 25-percent levies on $34 billion of Chinese and U.S. imports triggered on Friday. “There certainly is going to be pronounced risks mainly because we’ve now moved on to the tit-for-tat-for-tit phase of it,” Mizuho Bank’s head of economics and strategy Vishnu Varathan said. “This is going to drag on until they can all come to the table and agree to even the playing field. But the unpredictability of the situation continues to rattle the markets,” Varathan said. Washington had proposed the extra tariffs after efforts to negotiate a solution to the dispute failed to reach an agreement, senior administration officials said on Tuesday. Wall Street’s S&P 500 had closed at its highest level for almost six months but futures on the index and the Dow Jones were down 0.8-0.9 percent respectively , which pointed to a bumpy restart later. Morgan Stanley told clients that the approaching U.S. earnings season could also trigger a new wave of risk aversion if firms start warning of slower earnings growth and the rising threat to profitability caused by trade tariffs. The yen, often sought in times of political tensions and market turmoil, gained against a number of peers. The dollar pulled back from a near two-month peak of 111.355 to 111.20.  The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.1725 and the Australian dollar lost 0.8 percent to $0.74 . China’s yuan meanwhile dropped 0.7 percent against the U.S. currency to 6.7 per dollar and back towards an 11-month low of 6.73 plumbed last week. “We are buyers of typical safe haven currencies (such as yen and dollar) against high-beta or trade-oriented currencies (such as Korean won, Taiwan dollar and Malaysian ringgit),” Morgan Stanley said. Demand for assets that traditionally ride out turbulence saw the 10-year Treasury note yield fall 3 basis points (bps) to 2.840 percent. That was a pullback from a one-week peak of 2.875 percent scaled the previous day. Bond yields across most of Europe were 2 to 3 bps lower also. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield fell 2 bps to 0.30 percent with UK gilts more cautious as Brexit turmoil continue to batter the country’s ruling Conservative party. Oil prices were also hit by the trade war concerns. Brent fell more than $2 a barrel on the prospect of a demand drop and as Libya announced the reopening of a number of its major oil export terminals. It went as low as $76.80 before recovering slightly to $76.86. U.S. light crude, supported by a tight North American market, was down a more modest 75 cents at $73.36 a barrel.

2018-07-11,"OSLO (Reuters) - Molson Coors is stepping up efforts to fight global warming even though recent hot weather in Europe during the World Cup has lifted beer sales for one of the world’s biggest brewers, Chief Executive Mark Hunter said on Wednesday. The firm cut carbon emissions from its direct operations by 15 percent in 2017, he told Reuters, the first year of a program aimed at halving emissions by 2025 as part of a goal of limiting droughts, floods and more powerful storms. Molson Coors is also working to cut use of water and energy and aims for zero waste to landfills by 2025, he said of the firm’s “raising the bar on beer” project to protect the environment with sustainable growth. “It reduces our energy use pretty significantly, it reduces our water costs significantly. It really is win-win” for profitability and the environment, he said by telephone from Denver. Hunter said long-term disruptions to water supplies from climate change were a threat to crops including barley and hops, vital for beer.  Even so, hot weather has a flip side by making people thirstier. “The last 6-8 weeks in Europe have been very helpful,” Hunter said of scorching temperatures in many nations. “A World Cup is certainly helpful, but probably not as helpful as good, stable warm weather,” he said. England and Croatia play a World Cup semi-final later on Wednesday, seeking to meet France in the final.  Molson Coors produces Carling in England and Ozujsko in Croatia. He said the British brewery was self-sufficient in carbon dioxide, which puts the fizz in beer, despite shortages elsewhere in the country. He said Molson Coors was joining a U.N.-backed initiative by about 430 companies worldwide to set “science-based” targets, meant to match the overall goals of the Paris climate agreement, adopted in 2015 by 195 nations. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out of the Paris pact, doubting mainstream findings about the risks of warming.  By contrast, Molson Coors plans to halve emissions within its own operations by 2025, from 2016 levels, and by 20 percent across its entire business. The firm produces beers including Coors Light, Blue Moon and Miller Lite.

2018-07-11,"OSLO (Reuters) - Molson Coors is stepping up efforts to fight global warming even though recent hot weather in Europe during the World Cup has lifted beer sales for one of the world’s biggest brewers, Chief Executive Mark Hunter said on Wednesday. The firm cut carbon emissions from its direct operations by 15 percent in 2017, he told Reuters, the first year of a program aimed at halving emissions by 2025 as part of a goal of limiting droughts, floods and more powerful storms. Molson Coors is also working to cut use of water and energy and aims for zero waste to landfills by 2025, he said of the firm’s “raising the bar on beer” project to protect the environment with sustainable growth. “It reduces our energy use pretty significantly, it reduces our water costs significantly. It really is win-win” for profitability and the environment, he said by telephone from Denver. Hunter said long-term disruptions to water supplies from climate change were a threat to crops including barley and hops, vital for beer.  Even so, hot weather has a flip side by making people thirstier. “The last 6-8 weeks in Europe have been very helpful,” Hunter said of scorching temperatures in many nations. “A World Cup is certainly helpful, but probably not as helpful as good, stable warm weather,” he said. England and Croatia play a World Cup semi-final later on Wednesday, seeking to meet France in the final.  Molson Coors produces Carling in England and Ozujsko in Croatia. He said the British brewery was self-sufficient in carbon dioxide, which puts the fizz in beer, despite shortages elsewhere in the country. He said Molson Coors was joining a U.N.-backed initiative by about 430 companies worldwide to set “science-based” targets, meant to match the overall goals of the Paris climate agreement, adopted in 2015 by 195 nations. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out of the Paris pact, doubting mainstream findings about the risks of warming.  By contrast, Molson Coors plans to halve emissions within its own operations by 2025, from 2016 levels, and by 20 percent across its entire business. The firm produces beers including Coors Light, Blue Moon and Miller Lite.

2018-07-11,"* NOC says operations will resume within hours * Standoff threatened to keep 850,000 bpd offline * NOC head calls for more transparency on spending (Adds details, background) By Ayman al-Warfalli and Aidan Lewis BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS, July 11 (Reuters) - Libya’s Tripoli-based National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Wednesday that four export terminals were being reopened after eastern factions handed over the ports, ending a standoff that had shut down most of the country’s oil output. Production and export operations would be restored “within the next few hours”, an NOC statement said, though the restart at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, where workers were evacuated and storage tanks damaged in fighting last month, was expected to be gradual. Eastern factions had effectively blockaded exports from the territory they control since last month, saying too much oil revenue processed through Tripoli was going to armed groups based in western Libya, including their rivals. The disruption had threatened to keep offline as much as 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Libyan oil, from previous production of a little over 1 million bpd. It also risked deepening a wedge between rival political and military alliances based in eastern and western Libya since disputed elections four years ago, and complicating U.N.-led efforts to end years of turmoil following the country’s 2011 uprising. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports were shut when armed opponents of eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar attacked them on June 14. The assault was repelled a week later, but eastern officials aligned with Haftar blocked the internationally recognised NOC in Tripoli from reentering the ports and stopped loadings at Zueitina and Hariga terminals, saying they would take control of exports through a parallel NOC based in the east. NOC Tripoli announced the ports had been restored to its control early on Wednesday, allowing it to lift force majeure, a legal waiver on contractual obligations, at all four terminals. It commended Haftar’s Libyan National Army for “putting the national interest first” by handing them back. Eastern oil facilities guards and the head of the parallel NOC, Faraj Said, confirmed the ports were reopening, although Said told Reuters that Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, which have been damaged in repeated rounds of fighting, required maintenance. “The ports of Zueitina and Hariga are now open for any tankers carrying a contract. Ras Lanuf and Es Sider need some maintenance,” he said. Over the past two weeks eastern factions had come under intense international pressure to end the stoppage, according to diplomatic sources. In an apparent concession to the east, the internationally recognised Government of National Accord in Tripoli called late on Tuesday for the formation of an international committee that could review the spending of rising oil revenues. NOC Tripoli Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said the debate over fair distribution of oil revenues was “at the heart of the recent crisis”. “The real solution is transparency, so I renew my call on the responsible authorities, the ministry of finance and central bank, to publish budgets and detailed public expenditure,” he was quoted as saying in the NOC statement.

2018-07-11,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court sentenced five mining executives to up to 22 years in jail on Wednesday for their role in the coal mine disaster in May 2014 that killed 301 people, the ruling showed. The deaths were caused by a fire that swept through the mine in the town of Soma, 480 km (300 miles) south of Istanbul. It was Turkey’s worst industrial disaster and the world’s biggest mining disaster this century. Critics said the accident, which triggered mass protests, showed the government was too close to industry bosses and was insensitive, after Tayyip Erdogan, who was prime minister at the time and is now president, said the disaster was part of the profession’s “destiny.” Mine operator Soma Holding denied negligence, while the government said existing mining safety regulations were sound. Soma Holding’s general manager and technical manager were jailed for 22 years in prison, according to the ruling seen by Reuters. Two other company officials were jailed for nearly 19 years and the chairman was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The court sentenced nine other employees to shorter jail terms and acquitted 37 of the 51 defendants who had faced charges ranging from “killing with probable intent” to “criminally negligent manslaughter”. The deaths were caused by carbon monoxide spread through the mine by the fire. Workplace accidents have become more common in Turkey, where rapid growth in the past decade has seen a construction boom and a scramble to meet soaring energy and commodities demand. Critics say worker safety standards have not kept pace. Turkey has a poor mining safety record, particularly its in its coal mines. Hundreds of miners are killed by accidents in the industry each year. The government tightened work safety rule and imposed tougher penalties for breaches in 2014, six months after the Soma disaster. New measures include financial penalties and prison terms for those found liable in fatal accidents.

2018-07-11,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran declined by 15.9 percent in June, the first month after the United States said it would reimpose sanctions on the country, according to data from shipping and industry sources. In June, India imported 592,800 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran compared to 705,200 bpd in May, the data showed. The sources declined to be identified. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, has asked refiners to look for alternative oil supplies as the nation may have to drastically cut imports from Tehran to comply with the renewed U.S. sanctions.  The United States in May said it would reimpose the sanctions after withdrawing from a 2015 agreement with Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany, and Britain, where Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of earlier sanctions. Lower purchases by private refiners dragged down India’s June imports from Iran although state refiners stepped up purchases. State refiners, accounting for about 60 percent of India’s nearly 5 million bpd of refining capacity, lifted about 10 percent more Iranian volumes in June compared to May, at about 454,000 bpd, the data showed.      Indian state refiners had cut oil imports from Iran in the 2017/18 financial year because of a dispute over the development rights for an Iranian natural gas field.     However, the state refiners had drawn plans to raise imports in the current fiscal year starting in April after Iran offered free shipping and an extended credit period of 60 days.     In April to June 2018, the first quarter of this fiscal year, India’s oil imports from Iran rose by about 24 percent to about 647,000 bpd from the previous quarter, the data showed. Imports by state refiners during the period more than doubled to about 413,400 bpd from 191,700 bpd, the data showed.

EWP issued a tender on Tuesday seeking to import 30,000 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) with a maximum sulphur content of 0.3 percent for late July arrival, according to the utility’s website. “We are seeking to buy low sulphur fuel oil preemptively to meet the government’s emission standards and would keep buying low-sulphur fuel oil,” said an EWP source who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media. EWP plans to buy a total of 80,000 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel oil in August, the source added. EWP typically imports high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) with a maximum sulphur content of 2.5 percent. It last imported LSFO cargoes in 2012 and 2013, the source said. The utility last purchased a cargo of HSFO in early-April. The latest LSFO import requirement is occurring amid increased cooling demand during the summer. Korea Western Power Co, which also runs a fuel oil power plant, has no plans so far to lower the specifications for their fuel oil purchases or to issue a new fuel oil tender, said a source at the utility who asked not to be named since they are not authorised to talk to the media.

2018-07-11,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria plans to decide by year-end which fighter jets to use for its air defence in the future, the defence minister said on Wednesday. Mario Kunasek, a member of the far-right Freedom Party which entered government with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives in December, decided in February to re-assess the previous government’s decision to end a $2 billion Eurofighter jet programme early. A commission, tasked with examining options for Austria’s air defence, has delivered its report and on that basis a decision will be taken, Kunasek said on ORF radio.          “It will still take some time to discuss details,” Kunasek said. He said this included the financing of the purchase.  “My inhouse experts tell me that we need a decision by the end of the year,” he said when asked when to expect a decision. Kunasek’s Social Democratic predecessor Hans Peter Doskozil  launched an unprecedented legal battle against Airbus and the Eurofighter consortium in 2017, accusing them of fraud and wilful deception in connection with a 2003 Eurofighter order. He then announced that Austria would end its Eurofighter jet programme early and replace the aircraft with a cheaper alternative fleet of aircraft.      The consortium, which includes Airbus, Britain’s BAE Systems and Italy’s Leonardo, have denied the accusations. But Kunasek said in February that he did not feel bound by his predecessor’s decision, and on Wednesday did not give a preference for a manufacturer in a possible signal that Airbus still stood a chance.   The commission has previously said it has received new price information for Swedish and American jets, which will be taken into account.

2018-07-11,"(Adds quotes) By Jeff Mason BRUSSELS, July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump launched a sharp public attack on Germany on Wednesday for supporting a Baltic Sea gas pipeline deal with Russia, saying Berlin had become “a captive to Russia” and he criticised it for failing to raise defence spending more. Trump, meeting reporters with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, before a NATO summit in Brussels, said it was “very inappropriate” that the United States was paying for European defence against Russia while Germany, the biggest European economy, was supporting gas deals with Moscow. Trump was due to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the summit later in the day and will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday. Berlin has given political support to the building of a new, $11-billion pipeline to bring Russian gas across the Baltic Sea called Nord Stream 2, despite qualms among other EU states. However, Merkel insists the project is a private commercial venture and is not funded by German taxpayers. “When Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia,” Trump said to Stoltenberg. “We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia. “We’re protecting Germany, we’re protecting France, we’re protecting all of these countries. And then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where they’re paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia. “So we’re supposed to protect you against Russia and you pay billions of dollars to Russia and I think that’s very inappropriate,” Trump said at the residence of the U.S. ambassador in Brussels. “Germany will have almost 70 percent of their country controlled by Russia with natural gas. You tell me, is that appropriate?,” he asked, while Stoltenberg listened. At one point, the former Norwegian prime minister pointed out that the NATO allies in Europe disagreed among themselves on ways to reduce the continent’s reliance on Russian gas. “Germany is totally controlled by Russia, cause they are getting 60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline.” Trump renewed his call for other NATO allies to pay in more to the Western alliance after years in which U.S. taxpayers have, he said, borne an “unfair” share of military spending. “I think these countries have to step it up, not over a 10 year period, they have to step it up immediately. Germany is a rich country, they talk about increasing it a tiny bit by 2030. Well they could increase it immediately, tomorrow, and have no problem,” Trump said. “If you look at it, Germany is a captive of Russia. They got rid of their coal plants, they got rid of their nuclear, they’re getting so much of their oil and gas from Russia. I think it is something NATO has to look at. It is very inappropriate.” (Reporting by Jeff Mason; writing by Alastair Macdonald; editing by Richard Balmforth)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nato-summit-pipeline/update-1-trump-lashes-germany-over-gas-pipeline-deal-calls-it-russias-captive-idUKL8N1U71I0,11 Jul 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump

2018-07-11,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The float of Viva Energy, led by global energy trader Vitol, has been priced at the bottom of an indicated range, valuing the Australian oil refiner and marketer at A$4.86 billion (2.71 billion pounds), two fund managers said on Wednesday. The Viva Energy initial public offering, Australia’s biggest in nearly four years, follows a strong pick up in IPOs in the first half of this year that marked the busiest period for Australian issuers since early 2007. Viva’s IPO was priced at A$2.50 a share, the sources said, on condition of anonymity as the details were not public. Institutions had been asked to bid within A$2.50 and A$2.65. The company declined to comment. It is likely to announce on Thursday the pricing and how much stake the Vitol-led partnership will retain in Viva upon listing. The shares will debut on the Australian stock exchange on Friday. Viva Energy was built from Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) former refinery in Geelong near Melbourne and a network of about 1,165 petrol stations in Australia that Vitol [VITOLV.UL] bought in a $2.6 billion deal in 2014. Vitol and its unnamed partners have since spent over A$1 billion improving the business, including buying Shell’s jet fuel operations in Australia, and are now looking to cash in. Fund managers who took part in the Viva IPO - run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and UBS (UBSG.S) - said it was reasonably priced and appeared to have received good demand. “It’s a good company. The industry dynamics are favourable and it’s run by a capable management team,” said an analyst with a Sydney-based fund manager. Ahead of the IPO launch last month, institutional investors had committed to buy about A$1.2 billion worth of Viva shares, which at A$2.50 apiece would be half the stock on offer. However some fund managers said while the Viva IPO was more attractive than other recent floats by private vendors, such as Spotless (SPO.AX), they did not see much growth in the business or preferred Viva’s rival Caltex Australia (CTX.AX). “It’s kind of utility-like. For that there are better opportunities elsewhere,” said John Grace, portfolio manager at Ausbil Dexia. At A$2.50 a share, Viva would be priced at 13.1 times forecast net profit for the year to June 2019, just a slight discount to Caltex that is trading on a forward earnings multiple of 13.5, according to Thomson Reuters data. One factor that fund managers preferred in Caltex was that it owned its petrol station sites, unlike Viva Energy.  Vitol spun off Viva’s sites into a listed property trust, Viva Energy REIT (VVR.AX), last year, reaping the benefit for itself. Shareholders in Caltex stand to gain similar benefits if Caltex were to spin off its sites into a property trust.

2018-07-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The top Chinese steelmaking city of Tangshan has ordered steel mills, coke producers and utilities to cut output further this summer, according to a document from the city government, the latest step to curb smog in one of the country’s most polluted areas. The move to deepen cuts in emissions will last for six weeks from July 20 until Aug. 31, according to the document, which was reviewed by Reuters. That will be in addition to 10-15 percent capacity cuts imposed from March to November. The document did not instruct factories to cut output by a certain amount, but told the city’s local districts to set their own detailed plans for curbing production by July 13. The curbs mark one of the latest steps in Beijing’s ‘war on pollution’ as it pushes to clear the country’s notoriously polluted skies. “Sintering machines and blast furnaces will be major targets of production cuts in the steel sector and could be at as much as 50 percent depending on emission levels at mills,” an official at the environment department of Tangshan’s government told Reuters by phone. He declined to be identified as he is not authorized to talk to media. Sintering is a process where iron ore is heated into a mass as a precursor to making hot metal. Factories located outside the city center that have completed steps such as “environmental upgrades” will not need to cut production by as much as some other sites, according to the document. Tangshan produced 91.2 million tonnes of crude steel in 2017, accounting for 11 percent of the country’s total steel output. Analysts at industrial data provider SMM expect the latest restrictions in Tangshan to reduce production by up to 150,000 tonnes of hot metal a day. Production curbs will also be imposed on other industries that consume large amounts of power or cause relatively high levels of emissions such as the cement and glass sectors, the government said in the document. The city aims to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 31 percent, nitrogen dioxide emissions by 21 percent and carbon monoxide emissions by 24 percent by the end of August compared to average emission levels in the first-half of 2018.

2018-07-11,"NEW DELHI, July 11 (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran declined by 15.9 percent in June, the first month after the United States said it would reimpose sanctions on the country, according to data from shipping and industry sources. In June, India imported 592,800 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran compared to 705,200 bpd in May, the data showed. The sources declined to be identified. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, has asked refiners to look for alternative oil as the nation may have to drastically cut imports from Tehran to comply with the renewed U.S. sanctions. The United States said it would reimpose the sanctions after withdrawing from a 2015 agreement with Iran, Russia, China and several Western European countries where Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of earlier sanctions.

2018-07-11,"TOKYO, July 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with Brent dropping by more than $1, after the United States said it would consider requests for waivers from sanctions due to snap back into place on Iranian crude exports. Brent crude futures were down $1.10, or 1.4 percent, at $77.76 a barrel by 0112 GMT. U.S. crude was down 68 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $73.43. Both contracts had posted gains earlier in the previous session after industry data showed inventories fell more than expected last week in the United States. Washington will consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions it will put into effect in November to prevent Iran from exporting oil, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday. “There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief from that. We’ll consider it,” Pompeo said, according to the text of an interview in Abu Dhabi with Sky News Arabia released by the U.S. State Department. He did not identify any countries. Washington had earlier told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures, with no exemptions. The U.S. pulled out of a multinational deal in May to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Later on Tuesday, after arriving in Brussels for a NATO summit, Pompeo stressed the need to keep up pressure on Iran in coordination with allies. He also planned to reassure allies about alternative oil supplies. Efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers have led to a tighter oil market after a persistent glut. With the impending sanctions on OPEC member Iran and supply disruptions from Canada to Libya, prices have risen and sparked fears of shortages, amid rising demand. U.S. crude inventories fell last week by 6.8 million barrels, according to data from industry group, the American Petroleum Institute. That decline was larger than expected, causing crude futures to gain in post-settlement trading. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that crude stocks fell on average by 4.5 million barrels, ahead of government data at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday.

2018-07-11,"TRIPOLI, July 10 (Reuters) - Libya’s central bank (CBL) said on Tuesday the country had earned 15.6 billion Libyan dinars ($11.4 billion) in oil revenue in the first six months of the year, accounting for more than 93 percent of total income and more than double the 6.8 billion dinars earned from oil in the first half of 2017. Total spending was 16.88 billion dinars, a little more than total revenue of 16.7 billion, the Tripoli based CBL said in a statement. Figures released by the CBL serve only as a rough guide to overall spending in Libya as the country has been politically and economically divided since 2014, with a rival central bank operating in the eastern town of Bayda. That has thrown the economy into crisis, contributing to a liquidity crisis and a sharp drop in living standards. Oil revenues - which have been boosted by higher production and rising prices - and most salary payments have continued to be processed through the CBL in Tripoli, and the two central banks are meant to be using a single, joint budget this year. The Tripoli CBL said public salary payments made up 66 percent of spending in the first half of the year, and subsidies 19 percent. Salary payments would rise by 4.5 billion dinars in 2018 due to the inclusion of salaries under the eastern government, it said. The CBL also listed spending in dollars, including an allocation of $2.09 billion for the National Oil Corporation (NOC) and $2.7 billion in family allowances. The allowances are a mechanism for trying to inject dollars into the market and reduce the gap between a fixed official exchange rate of 1.4 dinars to the dollar and the black market rate of around 7 dinars. With oil production and prices rising since last year, the Tripoli CBL and the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital have been under pressure to increase transparency about how Libya’s oil money is spent. Eastern factions have complained that too much goes to Tripoli’s powerful militias and to the east’s armed rivals, the stated reason that eastern officials shut down oil exports from several terminals last month, blocking most of Libya’s oil production. On Tuesday the GNA appealed to the U.N. Security Council to form a technical committee that could “review the expenditure, revenues and transactions of the central banks in Tripoli and Bayda”. The Tripoli CBL said it would welcome such a move. “The central bank declares its full readiness to cooperate with any committee in this regard,” it said.
