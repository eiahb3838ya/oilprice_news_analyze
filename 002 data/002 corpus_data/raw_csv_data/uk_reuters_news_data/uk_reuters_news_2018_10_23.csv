2018-10-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices plunged about 5 percent on Tuesday to two-month lows as a sell-off in global equity markets raised worries about demand growth and after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed, easing concerns ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 4.3 percent, or $3.39, to settle at $76.44 a barrel after plunging 5 percent to $75.88, the lowest since Sept. 7. U.S. crude CLc1 ended the session at $66.43 a barrel, down $2.93, after falling 5.2 percent to a session low of $65.74, the lowest level since Aug. 20. If U.S. crude drops below $65, a psychologically important figure, that could trigger further technical selling, traders said. Both contracts notched the biggest percentage drop since July. In post-settlement trade, prices extended losses as data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a large increase in U.S. crude inventories. [API/S] “The severity of the drop is pretty striking, but in today’s trading world we have these kind of days a little more often. Now we have to wait and see if this continues to spiral out of control,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. Oil followed Wall Street’s early sell-off, founded on worries over profit growth and concern about Italy’s budget that have sent investors scrambling out of stocks of late. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS at one point shed more than 2 percent and hit its lowest point since September 2017. “Concerns about what’s going on in the stock markets and the worries about economic growth has spilled over into the oil markets,” McGillian said, adding that investors will be watching closely to see if the increase in Saudi Arabia’s output materializes quickly.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told a conference in Riyadh the oil market was in a “good place” and he hoped oil producers would sign a deal in December to extend cooperation to monitor and stabilise the market. “We will decide if there are any disruptions from supply, especially with the Iran sanctions looming,” Falih said. “Then we will continue with the mindset we have now, which is to meet any demand that materializes to ensure customers are satisfied.” Falih said he would not rule out the possibility that Saudi Arabia would produce between 1 million and 2 million barrels per day (bpd) more than current levels in future. U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil begin on Nov. 4 and Washington has said it wants to stop all of Tehran’s fuel exports, but other oil producers are pumping more to fill any supply gaps. The oil market has been concerned that Saudi Arabia might cut crude supply in retaliation for potential sanctions over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Falih said on Monday there was no intention of doing that. Economist Intelligence Unit energy analyst Peter Kiernan said it would be self-defeating for Saudi Arabia to cut oil supply, as it would risk losing market share to other exporters while losing its reputation as a stable player in the market. UBS analysts expect oil demand growth to slow to 1.2 million bpd in 2019, on higher oil prices and weaker economic growth, slightly above the long-term average, adding that demand is forecast to be flat in OECD countries, with China and India continuing to drive growth.  Meanwhile, Russia’s oil production is currently 150,000 bpd higher than the October 2016 level, the baseline for the global oil production deal, TASS news agency quoted Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying. South Korea’s crude imports from Iran fell to zero in September, data from state-run Korea National Oil Corp showed.  However, U.S. crude oil production has climbed by almost a third since mid-2016, and the rising output could help to offset the loss of exports from Iran. U.S. crude inventories were expected to have risen for the fifth straight week last week, according to a Reuters poll ahead of weekly data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) report on Wednesday morning. Data from API showed crude inventories rose 9.9 million barrels last week to 418.4 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.7 million barrels.

2018-10-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street indexes fell in Tuesday’s volatile session though they had pared losses sharply by the closing bell as investors looked for bargains, but oil dropped sharply on demand worries. After falling as much as 2.3 percent in the morning, the S&P 500 gradually regained ground as the day wore on.     Oil prices plunged about 5 percent to two-month lows as the equities sell-off raised worries about demand growth and Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed, easing concerns ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Benchmark U.S. Treasury prices rose, sending yields to their lowest levels in almost three weeks as declining stocks worldwide fed demand for low-risk debt.  The U.S. dollar recovered some of its early losses in the afternoon as the stock sell-off eased, but the greenback remained down against other safe-haven currencies. On top of geopolitical worries and Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York, cited an uncertain growth outlook amid a U.S.-China trade war. “There’s the question of impact on global growth from tariffs and the ongoing trade war. (U.S.) President Trump and (Chinese) President Xi have agreed to meet during the G20 summit, but that’s post-election, Pursche said. “It’s clear that nothing is going to happen for three to four weeks.” But after hitting a low of 2,691.43 around 10:20 a.m. ET (1420 GMT), the S&P gradually revived though trading was volatile. “Earnings as a whole have been good. ... The market doesn’t appear overly expensive. It’s setting up to be a good buying opportunity,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, adding that he bought stocks on Tuesday.  “We’ve had what we think is a temporary correction in a bull market. Typically, you’ll see two or three corrections that are 5 to 10 percent on average per year.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 125.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,191.43, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.19 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,740.69 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 31.09 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,437.54. Of the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors, energy .SPNY was the biggest percentage decliner, last down 2.7 percent due to the tumble in oil futures.  U.S. crude CLc1 fell 4.4 percent to $66.30 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $76.39, down 4.3 percent on the day. Pressure mounted on Saudi Arabia over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said intelligence and security institutions have evidence Khashoggi’s death at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month was planned. He dismissed attempts by Riyadh to blame the “savage” killing on rogue operatives. U.S. President Donald Trump had said Monday he was not satisfied with what he heard from Saudi Arabia about the death but did not want to lose investment from Riyadh.

2018-10-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, was doing a good job and could be nominated to permanently take on the role. “He’s acting, but he’s doing well, so maybe he won’t be so acting so long,” Trump said at an event alongside Wheeler. Wheeler took the reins at EPA after the agency’s former head, Scott Pruitt, resigned in July following a slew of ethical controversies that included his first-class travel, round-the-clock security detail, and expensive office equipment.  Pruitt had aggressively moved to roll back Obama-era climate regulations and other environmental protections to unfetter the oil and coal mining industries. In Wheeler, Trump has seen another strong supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry, but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that plagued Pruitt. Wheeler had worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant.  He has said that he is “not at all ashamed” of his lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, the focus of criticism by environmentalists. Wheeler also lobbied for utility Xcel Energy Inc (XEL.O) and consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N), and International Paper Co (IP.N), according to his public disclosures. He has been in the job in an acting capacity for more than 100 days, one of the longest tenures for an acting chief at the agency in decades. The next permanent EPA administrator must be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.  Wheeler has said that EPA, under his leadership, would take the same course as under Pruitt, prioritize cleaning up industrial Superfund sites - areas contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup due to a risk to health and/or the environment -  and financing investments in water infrastructure.

2018-10-23,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said he would fulfill a promise to impose a carbon tax on provinces unwilling to combat climate change, prompting instant protests from a voter-rich part of the country. Trudeau, whose ruling Liberals face an election in October 2019, told a news conference that all the money collected would be returned directly to taxpayers in the four provinces without plans to curb the emission of greenhouse gases. Starting in April 2019 carbon pollution will initially cost C$20 ($15.27) a tonne, rising by C$10 a year until it reaches C$50 in 2022. Ottawa unveiled the proposal in 2016. “Putting a price on pollution is the best way to fight climate change,” said Trudeau. Official data regularly shows that Canada has little chance of meeting its climate change goals of reducing emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Canada’s Conservatives, the largest opposition party in the federal Parliament, say they will scrap the levy if they take power next year.  Party leader Andrew Scheer, who has yet to unveil his own climate change plan, dismissed the tax as “an election gimmick.” The new tax will have the most impact in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, where the new right-of-center Conservative government of Premier Doug Ford says it will take Ottawa to court over the plan. “The Trudeau carbon tax will force our seniors to pay more for home heating ... (and) make parents pay more to fill up their car when they drive their children to and from soccer practice,” Ford tweeted. Trudeau’s chances of retaining power next year depend largely on Ontario, where the Liberals already hold most of province’s seats in the national Parliament. Ford moved to end Ontario’s cap-and-trade program in July on the grounds it was a “cash grab”. In energy-rich Alberta, the left-leaning government looks set to lose an election next year to a right-wing party that also opposes a carbon tax. The new levy will also be imposed in Manitoba and Saskatchewan as well as New Brunswick. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe told reporters that life in the province” is going to cost a whole lot more now”. Catherine Abreu of Climate Action Network Canada welcomed the news, saying Ottawa “has done what is necessary to get this important tool in play while easing any financial burden it may have on Canadians”.

2018-10-23,"MEXICO CITY, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Mexico’s president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday criticized state-run Pemex’s plan to import U.S. light crude from refiner Phillips 66 , calling it a sign of the country’s failed economic policies. Pemex is set to begin crude imports in November, for the first time in over a decade. It needs them to feed Mexico’s main refinery, which is working below capacity due to a lack of light oil. The purchase of 1.4 million barrels of U.S. Bakken crude will follow a tender awarded earlier this week to Phillips 66. Up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude imports are planned for the last quarter of 2018. “This announcement ... is another example of the great failure of neo-liberal economic policies in the last 30 years,” Lopez Obrador said on Twitter. Once he takes power in December, Lopez Obrador could force Pemex to halt the imports, which would likely impact domestic refining and boost the need for other kinds of imported fuel. The issue has divided opinion among his allies. One of his economic advisers, Abel Hibert, said earlier this month that crude imports could continue as a way to increase processing levels at Mexico’s refineries, even after Lopez Obrador takes office. “I think Pemex has good reason to do it due to current market conditions,” he told local media. Mexico’s light crude output has declined faster than expected this year, hit by operational problems at the Xanab oilfield. Pemex chief executive Carlos Trevino has said the company’s goal of producing 1.95 million bpd of crude this year will not be met, and that the 2019 target is also likely to be missed. If Pemex does not start crude imports for its refining network, purchases of finished fuel, especially gasoline, would grow again to satisfy Mexico’s consumption of about 1.5 million bpd, analysts have said. Lopez Obrador’s main plan for the oil industry involves building a new mid-size refinery to boost fuel production while reducing crude exports with the final goal of halting them. He has criticized his predecessor’s opening of the oil and gas industry to foreign investment, but has not given details of how he would reverse the country’s dwindling crude production. Rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch earlier this month said cutting oil exports would imply a significant cash flow sacrifice for Pemex, whose main source of revenue is crude exports. Fitch changed Pemex’s outlook to negative from stable.

2018-10-23,"(Refiles to remove extraneous word from headline) PARIS, Oct 23 - The French government will present its 2018-28 energy strategy next month instead of at the end of this month, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday. The long-awaited plan (PPE) will outline how and by when France will reduce the share of nuclear energy in electricity generation, currently at about 75 percent, and is a crucial factor in the investment planning of state-owned utility EDF , which operates France’s 58 nuclear reactors. “There is no delay. We are just taking our time to consider fundamental issues such as climate change and energy prices because the decisions we make will commit the country for decades,” the source said, adding that the government aims to present the plan in coming weeks, probably in November. French daily Le Figaro reported on its website that the PPE would be presented mid-November, possibly on Nov. 12, by French President Emmanuel Macron. A 2015 law voted by the previous socialist government set a target to reduce the share of nuclear to 50 percent by 2025, but Macron last year dropped a campaign promise to respect that deadline. His popular environment minister Nicolas Hulot resigned in August in protest over what he said was Macron’s lack of focus on the environment, saying nuclear energy was a “useless folly”.

2018-10-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - James Dyson, the billionaire British inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, has chosen to build his electric car in Singapore to be close to Asian customers, supply chains and a highly skilled workforce. The 71-year-old entrepreneur, who backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, already manufactures products such as hair dryers, air purification systems and bladeless fans in Asia, while the company’s research and development remains in Britain. Dyson said last year that a 400-strong, British-based engineering team had been secretly working for more than two years on a $2.6 billion project to build an electric car. The company, one of Britain’s biggest manufacturing success stories, has not shown any designs for its electric vehicle, although James Dyson has said it will not be like anything else on the market and will not be a “very cheap”. Dyson, who is not working with established car companies on the project, had said the vehicle would be made close to suppliers and its potential biggest markets, namely in Asia. “The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on supply chains, access to markets, and the availability of the expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions,” Dyson Chief Executive Jim Rowan said after Singapore was chosen on Tuesday. Dyson already employs 1,100 people making 21 million digital electric motors every year in Singapore. It said it would build a new two-storey manufacturing facility in the city state, scheduled for completion in 2020, with the first cars rolling off production lines a year later. Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: “Singapore used to assemble cars until the 1980s. Now we will manufacture cars again, except this time greener, better, and more high tech!”  Carmakers are stepping up investment in electric vehicles in response to ever-tightening emissions restrictions and penalties on the use of internal combustion engines, with some countries already promising outright bans.  Dyson is looking to exploit its ability in solid-state battery technology and electric motors that are found in its innovative vacuum cleaners and other products. James Dyson told reporters last year that his ambition to take on the car makers was triggered when the industry dismissed his idea to use the cyclonic technology that revolutionised vacuum cleaners to clean diesel exhaust emissions in the 1990s. The inventor was a prominent backer of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and has argued that Britain’s future lies in building close ties with fast-growing markets in Asia, and not Europe. Singapore is a densely populated city-state and one of the world’s most expensive places to own a car.  It controls vehicle population through a system of bidding for the right to own and use a vehicle for a limited number of years. Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla (TSLA.O), criticised Singapore for not being supportive of electric vehicles earlier this year. But the city state has trade agreements with China and Japan and Dyson CEO Rowan said the comparatively high cost base would be offset by its technology expertise and focus.   “It is therefore the right place to make high-quality technology loaded machines, and the right place to make our electric vehicle,” he said.     Dyson started its work on the electric car in Wiltshire, western England, where it is investing 200 million pounds ($260 million) in new buildings and a testing track at its campus. The privately-owned company reported a 40 percent rise in turnover to 3.5 billion pounds last year and a 27 percent rise in earnings to 801 million pounds, with 73 percent of the growth coming from Asia.

2018-10-23,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco aims to allocate some 2-3 million barrels per day of its crude oil production to petrochemicals, CEO Amin Nasser said on Tuesday, a sign the state energy group is hedging its bets against a possible demand slowdown. Aramco has been boosting its investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, as it sees growth in chemicals central to its downstream expansion strategy. The company is working on buying a stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the world’s fourth largest petrochemical maker, as part of plans to become a leader in the chemical industry, Nasser told an investment conference in Riyadh. But anti-trust regulations abroad will mean that the company’s planned acquisition of a controlling stake in SABIC will take time, he said, noting that SABIC has a presence in 50 countries around the world. Aramco hired JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to advise on a potential acquisition of as much as 70 percent stake in SABIC, currently held by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, sources told Reuters in July.  Nasser said the Saudi Arabian government was still committed to an initial public offering of Aramco, while the timing depended on market conditions and other factors. He added that Aramco could not list while the SABIC deal was ongoing. Nasser also said bankers had not expressed any concerns about a recent rise in Saudi funding costs ahead of the company’s potential acquisition of the SABIC stake. The cost of insuring against a Saudi sovereign default over the next five years touched 100 basis points last week for the first time since June, showing how the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has damaged sentiment toward the country. Asked whether bankers raised any concerns about the death of Khashoggi or whether it would cause higher funding costs for the deal, Nasser said: “None whatsoever.” “Aramco is well positioned financially,” Nasser told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference in Riyadh. “So far we have no issue to finance any of our projects. I don’t anticipate seeing any issues in financing.” He also said it would take Aramco three months to reach maximum oil production capacity of 12 million bpd, if needed. Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from some 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030. Aramco pumps around 10.7 million bpd of crude oil.

2018-10-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States cannot stop Iranian oil exports by imposing sanctions on Tehran, Iran’s oil minister said on Tuesday, warning that such restrictions will ensure the market remains volatile. Washington plans new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector from Nov. 4 with the aim of stopping the country’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and bringing Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile program. “As long as America targets Iran, one of the biggest crude producers, with sanctions, the volatility in the oil market will continue,” Tasnim news agency quoted Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh as saying. “Iranian oil exports cannot be stopped,” Zanganeh said. Zanganeh reiterated his Monday remarks that Iranian oil output cannot be replaced by that of other oil-producing countries if Tehran is hit by U.S. sanctions. Zanganeh said in an interview on the state television: “We will spare no effort to resist the cruel U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also said “the animosity of the current U.S. government towards Iran and the Iranians is unprecedented,” but added that Washington would fail to achieve its goals. Rouhani was quoted by Tasnim news agency as saying: “Iran will smoothly overcome the problems Americans have created in recent months.” Nov. 4, is also the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, when Iranian students in coordination with radical clerics took 90 hostages and held 52 of them captive for more than a year. Iran celebrates the occasion every year as tens of thousands march in rallies across the country and chant slogans against the United States. “The U.S. government is trying to turn the Nov. 4 into a bitter day for Iranian nation so they suffer, but it will fail,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in an interview with Reuters on Sunday, dismissed concerns that oil prices LCOc1 could rise, saying the market had already factored in the supply losses. Iran’s regional rival, U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, says Riyadh has the capacity to increase output to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 10.7 million bpd.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday it would continue to meet customer demand for crude despite looming U.S. sanctions that are expected to reduce oil exports from Iran. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia and Iran are members, agreed in June to boost supply to make up for the expected disruption to Iranian exports.

2018-10-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must act quickly to allow year-round sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends if President Donald Trump aims to keep a campaign promise to corn farmers.  Trump announced during a trip to Iowa this month his intention to lift the summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline to help corn growers stung by slumping prices.  The EPA has since said it will finish deliberations on a proposal to lift the ban by May, a timeline the administration hopes will put the rule in place before summer. But Grassley said that was too slow. “EPA ought to speed it up. Otherwise it is going to look like the President wasn’t serious in his announcement,” he told a weekly conference call. “We don’t need a lot of bureaucratic red tape with something that has been discussed in Washington for four to five years, and discussed... specifically with EPA and face-to-face with the President for about a year,” he said. Trump’s announcement encouraged farmers eager to expand the market for corn-based ethanol, and was seen as a political victory for Trump ahead of congressional elections in November.  The EPA’s ban on summer E15 sales was initially intended to reduce smog, but academic studies have concluded that the ban is ineffective at improving air quality.  Trump’s move, however, is likely to face pushback from the oil industry, which has long opposed the rule change since  it would cut into its share of the petroleum market. The industry has threatened to sue over the issue. Some industry experts say the administration will ultimately need an act of the Congress to change the rule. EPA acting chief Andrew Wheeler, however, rejected that idea earlier this month, saying the agency has the authority to move ahead alone.

2018-10-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Friday it has withdrawn a regulation proposed in the last days of the Obama administration that aimed to tighten health and safety compliance rules for uranium miners. On Jan. 19, 2017 - a day before Donald Trump took office as president - the EPA had proposed standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by uranium in-situ recovery (ISR) activities, with a primary focus on groundwater protection and restoration. On Friday, the EPA said existing rules were enough for the protection of public health and safety from radiological and non-radiological hazards associated with uranium and thorium ore processing. The decision is the latest by the Republican Trump administration to roll back environmental rules promoted by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. EPA’s acting administrator Andrew Wheeler said the proposed rule change would have imposed “significant burdens” on uranium producers. “The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has regulated in situ uranium recovery for nearly 40 years. The agency has never found an instance of ground water contamination that would be addressed by this rule,” said Senate Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, a Republican. The National Mining Association (NMA) hailed the decision. The rule “failed to articulate a risk that justified the rulemaking, ignored the need for a realistic cost-benefit analysis, and underestimated compliance costs and impacts to small businesses,” NMA President Hall Quinn said.

Benchmark U.S. Treasury prices rose, sending yields to their lowest levels in almost three weeks as tumbling equity markets worldwide fed investor demand for low-risk debt. The dollar index fell slightly, and oil prices fell after Saudi Arabia said it could supply more crude quickly if needed, reassuring investors ahead of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s crude exports that start next month. Shares of U.S. industrial heavyweights 3M Co and Caterpillar Inc tumbled after 3M posted its biggest sales miss in 2 years and cut its forecast while Caterpillar disclosed weak order backlog and an increase in manufacturing costs. “People are getting hysterical, taking these little dots and drawing universal trend lines,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago, citing worries about a potential global slowdown. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 368.06 points, or 1.45 percent, to 24,949.35, the S&P 500 lost 45.22 points, or 1.64 percent, to 2,710.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 153.49 points, or 2.06 percent, to 7,315.14. “The stock market has everyone’s attention. The dollar/yen is moving almost tick-to-tick with stocks,” said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut. “Markets are starting to wonder if the good times generated from Trump’s tax cuts and deregulation are in the rear view mirror and what’s ahead is fallout from protectionist policies, and that has started to eat into corporate earnings,” he added. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 1.6 percent after hitting its lowest point since December 2016. China’s main stock indexes resumed a downward spiral a day after the blue-chip index posted its biggest gain in nearly three years, hit by investor pessimism about economic prospects and risks posed by shares pledged for loans. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.05 percent and hit its lowest point since Sept 2017. Investors were anxious about the economic ramifications of Saudi Arabia’s isolation after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said intelligence and security institutions have evidence Khashoggi’s death at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month was planned. He dismissed attempts by Riyadh to blame the “savage” killing on rogue operatives. U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he was not satisfied with what he heard from Saudi Arabia about the death but did not want to lose investment from Riyadh. “A quick Google search reveals hundreds of U.S. companies that could be impacted if this thing spins completely out of control,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York in a research note that pointed to defense companies being particularly vulnerable. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 20/32 in price to yield 3.1185 percent, from 3.194 percent late on Monday, while the 30-year bond last rose 37/32 in price to yield 3.3175 percent, from 3.381 percent.

2018-10-23,"(Reuters) - U.S. Silica Holdings (SLCA.N) missed analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as fewer oil well completions hit demand for its frac sand, and said it expected substantial price and margin recovery only in the second quarter of 2019. The company’s shares slumped as much as 17 percent to a near six-year low. A tight pipeline capacity in the top shale region of Permian has hampered efforts by U.S. producers to capitalize on the recent jump in crude oil prices, which was also reflected in the latest quarterly reports from oilfield service providers. Fracking sand supplied by U.S. Silica is used in hydraulic fracturing where it is pushed into wells under high pressure to free oil and gas trapped in shale rocks. The company said revenue from its oil and gas proppants business, its biggest, rose about 5.6 percent to $302.5 million in the third quarter, a steep decline from the 38 percent the company posted in the preceding quarter. “Frac sand fundamentals will continue to deteriorate near-term,” Tudor Pickering & Co analyst George Leary said. “They need to focus on executions, cost cutting, and we’d like to see them shut in some higher cost frac sand mines,” he said.  Supply-demand gap is expected to tighten in 2019, with a substantial rebound in pricing and margin by the second quarter of the year, company executives said on a conference call. The company’s net income fell to $6.3 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $41.3 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter included a charge of $7 million related to the acquisition of EP Minerals.  U.S. Silica bought EP Minerals, a producer and supplier of industrial minerals, for $750 million to help weather the softness in the frac sand market. Excluding items, U.S. Silica earned 44 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimates of 59 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. Total revenue rose 22.7 percent to $423.2 million, but came in below expectation of $467.9 million. The company’s shares regained some ground and were down 11 percent at $13.96 in late-morning trading.

2018-10-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The global economic outlook is deteriorating, with a broad range of asset prices and real-time economic indicators pointing to either a slowdown in growth or an outright recession occurring in 2019. South Korea’s KOSPI-100 equity index has now fallen by almost 19 percent over the last year, the fastest rate of decline since the financial crisis of 2008/09, in a warning sign for investors and commodity traders. The KOSPI-100 has correlated closely with the growth in international trade, given the South Korean economy’s strong export orientation, so the sharp decline suggests trade growth will slow sharply in the months ahead. Germany’s DAX index, another share market heavily exposed to international trade, has also fallen by more than 14 percent over the last year, its worst performance since early 2016, and before that 2011. Even in the United States, which is much more closed to international trade and has reported the strongest economy and stock market in 2017/18, there are signs the bull run is running out of momentum. The broad S&P 500 equity index is up just 7 percent compared with the end of October 2017, the smallest year-on-year increase for almost two years, and far below its peak of 24 percent at the start of 2018. The stimulus of corporate tax reductions which went into effect at the start of the year is beginning to fade and more U.S. businesses are struggling with a rising exchange rate, tariffs and slower revenue growth. Revenue growth at U.S. corporations is slowing, with a significant number of S&P500 firms reporting disappointing sales in the third quarter (“Bull market’s latest hurdle: slowing sales growth”, WSJ, Oct. 21). The U.S. Treasury yield curve remains close to inversion, with rates on 10-year paper just 26 basis points above 2-year notes, a signal that has often preceded a slowdown in growth or recession in the past. The U.S. dollar remains close to its highest value for a quarter of a century against a trade-weighted basket of the currencies of U.S. trading partners. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OKoiAg) The combination of a rising interest rates, a flattening yield curve, falling share prices and a strengthening dollar represents a significant tightening of financial conditions, not just in the United States but around the world. The OECD’s composite leading indicator has fallen to its lowest in almost two years and is at a level that is consistent with a slowdown in economic momentum. Rising oil prices, especially for consuming countries outside the United States, have added to the pressure on many emerging markets. U.S. freight movements also indicate the rate of growth is easing after accelerating consistently for two years between the middle of 2016 and mid-2018. U.S. rail freight movements are still rising but a slightly slower rate than in the first half of the year. Truck tonnage growth has seen an even sharper slowdown since peaking in June. Total freight movements by road, rail, barge, pipeline and air were about 4.5 percent higher in August than at the same point a year ago, down from a peak of more than 8 percent in June. On their own, any of these financial and real indicators could be dismissed as due to idiosyncratic factors, but in combination, when they all point in the same direction, they point to a loss of momentum in the global economy. The latest Reuters’ quarterly poll of more than 500 economists found the global outlook for 2019 had worsened for the first time (“Global growth outlook for 2019 dims for the first time”, Reuters, Oct. 22). At this point it is impossible to know whether the slowdown will take the form of a moderation in the rate of growth (a “growth recession”) or an actual decline in activity (an “outright recession”). Deep recessions such as the one which accompanied the financial crisis in 2008/09 are uncommon and unlikely to be repeated this time around. Most recessions since 1945 have involved either a mild slowdown in the rate of growth or a very small and short-lived decline in economic activity. But most indicators now point to significantly slower growth next year than in 2017/18.

2018-10-23,"ACCRA (Reuters) - UK-based Tullow Oil (TLW.L) aims to ramp up its production in Ghana to 180,000 barrels per day by the end of the year, following successful drilling of additional wells, its Ghana head said on Tuesday.  It is currently producing around 170,000 bpd, Kweku Awotwi  said.  Tullow is confident of sustaining peak production from its two oilfields in Ghana, using “significant” near-field resources and will leverage additional exploration acreage to grow its Ghana business, Awotwi told an investor briefing in Accra. Tullow is lead operator of Ghana’s flagship offshore Jubilee field with peak output of 120,000 barrels per day, and the Tweneboa Enyenra Ntomme field which has estimated capacity of up to 80,000 barrels a day. “We are close to getting to plateau production and we are excited about the potentials,” Awotwi said, adding that five new wells would come onstream over the next six months.  Kosmos Energy (KOS.N) (KOS.L), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), Ghana National Petroleum Corp and Petro SA also have stakes in the two fields, which have estimated combined reserves of around 1.5 billion barrels.

2018-10-23,"HAGEN, Germany (Reuters) - Nissan’s Leaf became the first electric vehicle (EV) to secure regulatory approval as an energy backstop for Germany’s electricity grid, the Japanese carmaker said on Tuesday, something it hopes will attract corporate fleet customers. So-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is a connection between the EV and the grid through which power can flow from the grid to the vehicle and vice-versa. That potentially enables car owners to sell energy to the network, while utilities could use electric cars as a backstop if demand rises. Nissan said it would initially target corporate clients with fleets of more than 60 electric vehicles, adding that services based on V2G technology would be offered in Germany from next year onwards. There will be 280 million electric vehicles by 2040, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency, compared with more than 3 million last year. “We strongly believe in an emission-free future,” Guillaume Pelletreau, Vice President and Managing Director, Nissan Center Europe, said. “Leaf batteries could make an important contribution to energy transition in Germany and a sustainable future.” The initiative was also supported by Daimler-backed The Mobility House, local utility Enervie and German transmission system operator Amprion, which is co-owned by RWE and infrastructure investors including Munich Re, Swiss Life and Talanx. Nissan is relying on the CHAdeMO charging standard, which has been jointly developed by several Japanese companies as a competitor to Tesla’s supercharger system and the European-backed Combined Charging System (CCS). That puts Nissan at odds with European carmakers, including BMW and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), who are pushing to have the CCS, which is also capable of V2G services, established. “Nissan is ahead for now but other technologies, including Tesla’s supercharger can theoretically do the same thing,” said Thomas Raffeiner, chief executive and founder of The Mobility House. Nissan has so far sold about 370,000 electric vehicles and, along with top shareholder Renault, has been very active in exploring how car batteries can be integrated into the wider power system. While a mass uptake of EVs is expected to put a major strain on the power grid and require billions of euros in infrastructure investments, car batteries have already proven that they can become part of the network.

2018-10-23,"ISTANBUL/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkey warned Greece on Tuesday it would not tolerate a shift in Greece’s maritime border, drawing a sharp rebuke from Athens that it would decide when and how it exercises its sovereign rights. The statements from both sides came a few days after Greece’s former foreign minister said Greece planned to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles to the west of the country. Territorial waters are a sensitive issue between the two neighbours and NATO allies, who are separated by the Aegean Sea and have been at odds over airspace, ethnically split Cyprus and offshore mineral rights for decades.  Turkey has previously warned it could not preclude military action to defend its interests. Former Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, who resigned last week, said on Saturday that Athens planned to extend its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea, which flanks the west coast of the country. The planned measure would not affect the Aegean region, off Greece’s eastern and southern coasts. Turkey’s foreign ministry, however, said that it had noted previous statements from Athens of plans for the gradual expansion of Greek territorial waters. “It is not possible to tolerate steps where there is no bilateral agreement on the Aegean where the two countries have mutual shores,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a statement. In Athens, a foreign ministry spokesman said Greece’s rights would not be dictated by third parties. “The extension of the coastal zone is a legal and inalienable sovereign right of Greece, in accordance with international law,” he said.  “The relevant decision for an extension is exclusively up to Greece, which has the right to extend its territorial waters whenever, and as, it sees fit.”  Turkey’s statement recalled a 1995 declaration of the Turkeish parliament which had authorised action, not excluding military action, to safeguard Turkish interests.  “(Parliament’s) declaration...dated 8 June 1995 has the necessary political warning in this context and it still maintains its validity today,” the Turkish statement added.

2018-10-23,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Shoprite Holdings, South Africa’s biggest supermarket chain, said on Tuesday it would pay customers for reusing its newly introduced recyclable bag as it joined domestic rivals in efforts to curb plastic pollution. Supermarkets have come under increased pressure to cut their use of plastic as images of littered oceans and beaches become commonplace, shocking both consumers and shareholders. South Africa does not have a law banning plastic bags. However, to reduce littering and discourage customers from buying them, South Africa increased the plastic bag levy in April by 50 percent to 12 cents per bag. Shoprite said every time a customer reuses its new 100 percent recycled and recyclable plastic bag, which retails for 3 rand ($0.2088), at Shoprite and Checkers stores, they will get 50 cents off their grocery purchase. “Changing consumer behavior by rewarding customers for re-using bags is a critical part of the retailer’s efforts to reduce plastic waste,” it said in a statement. The retailer added that packaging of all broccoli, cauliflower, baby marrows, patty pans, baby gems, squash variety and fruit packs will switch to fully biodegradable and comfortable containers from early November. Shoprite’s move comes weeks after department store chain Woolworths Holdings said it will remove single-use plastic bags from one of its stores during a six-month trial period. Last Tuesday, supermarket chain Pick n Pay said it had removed all plastic straws from checkouts and will soon completely phase them out from cold-drink kiosks and replace them with paper straws, joining a growing number of companies that have said they will do away with disposable plastic straws. The U.N. Environment Program estimates that some 8 million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the ocean every year - the equivalent of dumping a garbage truck full of plastic every minute - killing birds and marine life and compromising the ocean ecosystem. It wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries, including China, France, Rwanda and Italy, have taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption.

2018-10-23,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and U.S. ExxonMobil (XOM.N) plan to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in a consortium with Indian and Japanese partners, spreading the estimated $15 billion cost, two sources familiar with the talks said. The four companies - Rosneft, Exxon, Japan’s SODECO and India’s ONGC Videsh (ONGC.NS)(ONVI.NS) - are partners in the Sakhalin-1 group of fields that will supply the gas, but Exxon and Rosneft had initially planned to build the LNG plant without the other consortium members. As well as spreading the costs among more stakeholders, the broader involvement of the participants may mitigate sanctions risk. Initially, Rosneft and Exxon unveiled their joint plans to build an LNG production site in Russia’s Far East to President Vladimir Putin in 2013. But production of the super-cooled, seaborne gas has so far failed to materialize for many reasons, including international sanctions against Moscow for its role in the Ukraine conflict. LNG production itself is not subject to sanctions, but Russian companies have limited access to financial markets due to the restrictions. Exxon had to leave most of its other new joint projects with Rosneft due to the West’s punitive measures against Moscow. Two sources - one person close to Exxon, and a high-ranking Rosneft executive not authorized to speak publicly - said both firms are committed to carrying out the LNG plant project within the framework of the Sakhalin-1 agreement.  Sakhalin-1, a hydrocarbon project, is led by Exxon with a 30 percent stake. Twenty percent belongs to Rosneft, with the rest split between SODECO (30 percent) and ONGC Videsh (20 percent).  “No one is interested in financing such a project alone,” the source close to Exxon said. Asked how the LNG plant deal would be structured, the senior Rosneft executive said: “It will be Sakhalin-1.” The sources did not say how the financing of the LNG plant would be shared between the participants.  The source close to Exxon said a decision whether to go ahead with the LNG project was expected in 2019, otherwise the project risked losing its market amid growing competition.   Currently, two LNG plants, Novatek’s (NVTK.MM) Yamal LNG and Gazprom’s (GAZP.MM) Sakhalin-2, are producing the frozen gas in Russia, which has set an ambitious target of more than doubling its global LNG market share to 20 percent in the next decade. Sakhalin-1 is pumping close to 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, a record high, as well as natural gas that it has been unable to sell abroad. Gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from Russia. Sakhalin-1 has to pump most of the gas back into the ground, while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region. Decade-long talks with Gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results. Rosneft, ONGC and SODECO declined to comment. The Russian Energy Ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment. “The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,” an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to Reuters questions. Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive, said in June that the LNG plant would be built just across the Tatarsky strait in the port of De Kastri in Russia’s Khabarovsk region, where Rosneft already has an export terminal for Sakhalin-1 oil.  Sechin said then that the plant’s annual capacity was seen at 6 million tonnes of LNG, with supplies aimed at starting in 2025. Gazprom’s Sakhalin-2 has an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes.      The source close to Exxon confirmed the technical plans for the plant and said the project partners are considering the option of laying a gas pipe along the existing oil pipeline from Sakhalin-1 to the LNG plant in De Kastri.

2018-10-23,"* World shares near one-year low, Europe’s near two-year low * Asian shares ex-Japan fall 2 pct, hit 1-1/2 year low * Markets wait for Turkey’s version of Saudi journalist killing * Italy’s budget fight with EU dents Italian bonds, euro * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - World shares slid towards their lowest level in a year on Tuesday, as negative drivers from fatigued earnings and Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic isolation to a brewing spat over Italy’s finances piled on the pressure. Wall Street looked set to for another jolt lower when it reopens but it was heavy selloffs in both Asia and Europe , which was heading for a fifth day of uninterrupted falls, that did the main damage. The tech sector posted the worst performance after Swiss-listed chipmaker AMS plunged 25 percent as its outlook triggered alarm bells, but there was a broader force at play. The pan-European STOXX 600 was near a two-year low with almost half of its stocks now in bear-market territory — down 20 percent from their peak. Germany’s DAX dropped to late 2016 lows, MSCI’s world share index was just two points of a one-year low while Wall Street’s S&P 500 was set to test the lower limits of its 200-day moving average again. “This is quite an important period now because we have tried to rally a few times and haven’t really managed it,” said Natwest Markets’ head of global strategy James McCormick. There has been a spike in U.S. bond yields similar to earlier in the year, “but the macro picture for equities is more challenging now,” he added, pointing to fading synchronization in global growth as well a stronger dollar. That strength kept the euro pinned near a two-month low at at $1.146 before a European Commission meeting that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of demanding changes to Italy’s recently laid out budget plans. Italian bond traders were biding their time amid reports of some conciliatory moves from Rome’s coalition but the spat has also bred doubts about the European Central Bank plans to possibly raise its interest rates next year. Questions about the future of Britain’s prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, relented just a enough to help sterling claw higher but the mood remained distinctly ‘risk off’ regardless. That helped strengthen the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell. “The prospect of a normalisation of (ECB) monetary policy was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now going to crumble,” Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said. U.S. stock index futures were pointing to a more than 1 percent fall for Wall Streets main markets later. Digger maker Caterpillar’s shares fell 5.4 percent in premarket moves after it blamed U.S. tariffs for rising costs, while 3M slumped 7 percent after missing analysts estimates. Markets were also digesting Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s comments on the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month. “Intelligence and security institutions have evidence showing the murder was planned.... Pinning such a case on some security and intelligence members will not satisfy us or the international community,” Erdogan told Turkey’s parliament, though he did not reveal a smoking gun in the form of recordings that some reports had hinted at. Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil exporter, faces international pressure to provide all the facts about an incident that has raised a global storm and added the threat of sanctions against the kingdom to a list of market concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing, but expressed reluctance to punish the kingdom economically. Investors worry that may lead to Saudi retaliation through crude oil, although a Saudi pledge to play a “responsible role” and keep markets supplied held down crude prices on Tuesday. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $79.51 a barrel, down 0.4 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.12 a barrel, dropping 0.35 percent. Asia’s overnight tumble gave back some of the ground the region had clawed back over the last two sessions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asian shares dropped 2 percent to a 1 1/2-year low, with declines in many of the region’s heavyweight bourses even more pronounced. South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng both fell 3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.7 percent. “We’ve got a few negative factors when market sentiment was already fragile,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. “And earnings from some Japanese companies were weaker than expected, with some starting to blame trade wars.” The yen gained 0.4 percent amid the risk-off mood to 112.42 to the dollar. The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday’s 21-month low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade on expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs.

2018-10-23,"SURABAYA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s second-largest city has come up with a novel way to encourage its residents to recycle waste: giving free bus rides in exchange for used plastic bottles. Under the scheme launched by Surabaya in April, commuters can ride red city buses by dropping off plastic bottles at terminals or directly ‘paying’ a fare with bottles. A two-hour bus ticket costs 10 plastic cups or up to five plastic bottles, depending on their size, which the city hopes will help it meet an ambitious target of becoming free of plastic waste by 2020. Surabaya is the first city in Indonesia to implement this scheme. “Garbage, like plastic bottles, piles up in my neighborhood, so I brought it here so the environment is not only cleaner but also to help ease the workload of garbage collectors,” said Surabaya resident Linda Rahmawati. City data shows that 15 percent, or nearly 400 tonnes, of Surabaya’s daily waste is plastic. A bus can collect up to 250 kg (550 lb) of plastic bottles a day, or roughly 7.5 tonnes in a month, the data shows. After collection, labels and bottle caps are removed from the waste and it is auctioned off to recycling companies. Money earned from the auction goes toward running the bus operations and to fund green spaces in the city, located on the eastern tip of Java, Indonesia’s main island. The world’s fourth-most populous country is home to the largest expanse of tropical rainforest in Asia, but also struggles with grid-locked traffic in its congested cities. “Indonesia is one of the biggest contributors in the world for plastic waste, and through this initiative, we hope to raise public awareness on the environment, especially issues that relate to plastic trash,” said Irvan Wahyu Drajad, the head of Surabaya’s transportation department. Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, is estimated to be the world’s second-largest contributor of plastic pollutant in the oceans after China, according to a 2015 study published in “Science” journal. Another Surabaya resident also welcomed the scheme. “We can reduce trash so it doesn’t pile up at home because we can just bring them in and make good use of it. It is a win-win situation,” said Sulastri, who, like many Indonesians, uses one name.

2018-10-23,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s killing of a journalist and the ramping up of U.S. sanctions against Iran have added a layer of uncertainty to crude oil markets, creating a dilemma as to whether these events are real price drivers or just temporary noise. The death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul has generated a constant stream of headlines, often with contradictory messages for the outlook for oil supply and prices. Examples included a veiled Saudi threat to restrict its oil production in response to any sanctions over the killing, and a suggestion that U.S. President Donald Trump is soft-pedalling Khashoggi’s death to support his Saudi allies and increase his leverage over them to boost the kingdom’s crude output. While it is the job of the media to pursue the story and all related angles, the twists and turns of the tale ultimately do little to illuminate the likely path of the crude oil market. Oil analysts are often reluctant to partake in political discussions, preferring the relative safety of supply and demand fundamentals, trusting that these will eventually overcome what they hope are temporary influences. But perhaps the better approach would be to stand back and try to dispassionately look at the likely reasonable outcomes of the killing of Khashoggi. The death, according to the available details, seems either premeditated, state-sanctioned murder or the result of heavy-handed incompetence that resulted in Khashoggi being killed. Either way, the likely result is condemnation and action by Western countries, and a trial of sorts of the perpetrators, all against the backdrop of trying to avoid placing blame on Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. What does this mean for the oil market? Most likely very little beyond what is already happening. The Saudis will continue to try and increase production and meet the demand needs of consuming countries that are being forced to cut back their purchases of Iranian crude. And while the Khashoggi killing may generate anger at the brazen Saudi cover-up attempt, and raise concerns about the real-world consequences of Trump’s continual characterisation of the media as the “enemy of the people”, it’s likely that for oil the outcome will be business as usual. The likelihood that Saudi Arabia will try to increase its oil output, however, doesn’t answer the question of whether this will be enough to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. U.S. sanctions against Iran ratchet up early next month, and the Trump administration’s stated goal is to reduce the Islamic republic’s exports to zero. Nobody believes this is likely. The issue, though, is how much less oil Iran will supply to the world market, and can this be made up elsewhere. Tracking Iran’s exports has become more challenging in recent weeks as the country’s oil tankers have taken to switching off their tracking monitors. It does seem likely that Iran’s exports are around 2 million barrels per day (bpd), which is about 700,000 to 800,000 bpd below potential. It also seems clear that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the largest producer, has so far been unable to make up for the reduction in Iranian supplies. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, including Russia, would pump roughly an extra 1 million bpd following an agreement in June to raise supplies to offset any losses caused by sanctions on Iran. An internal document prepared by OPEC’s Vienna headquarters for a technical panel meeting on Friday showed, however, that OPEC members, excluding Nigeria, Libya and Congo, pumped only an extra 428,000 bpd in September compared to May. This suggests the market may well be short of oil, if U.S. sanctions force more buyers to avoid Iranian crude. Once again, politics is playing a part in this process, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin giving seemingly contradictory statements in an interview with Reuters in Jerusalem on Oct. 21. Mnuchin said it would be harder for buyers to obtain waivers to continue buying Iranian crude than it was under sanctions put in place during the administration of President Barrack Obama. But he also said the loss of Iranian cargoes was already priced into the market and he didn’t expect oil costs to rise in the wake of next month’s re-imposed sanctions. If, though, Iranian crude supplies are severely curtailed, it’s likely Mnuchin will discover that the market is currently only priced for the current reduction in Tehran’s oil shipments. Relying on a boost in oil output from other places, such as U.S. shales, ignores differences in crude qualities and won’t necessarily help ease the loss of Iranian medium to heavy sour grades. Overall, as disturbing as the killing of Khashoggi is, the impact on the oil market will likely be muted, as it isn’t in the interest of anyone to provoke a disruption. Meanwhile, the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran has yet to be quantified, and may come down to a “who blinks first” scenario, as successfully re-imposed restrictions on the trade of Iranian barrels would likely increase prices and cause pain to the United States and its oil-consuming allies.

2018-10-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Bank of Kunlun Co, the key Chinese conduit for transactions with Iran, is set to halt handling payments from the Islamic Republic under pressure of imminent U.S. sanctions against the country, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Kunlun, the main official channel for money flows between China and Iran, has verbally informed clients that it will stop accepting yuan-denominated Iranian payments to China from Nov. 1, said the sources, who include external loan agents and business officials who trade with Iran. The bank, controlled by the financial arm of Chinese state energy group CNPC [CNPC.UL], had already quietly suspended euro-denominated payments from Iran in late August, the four sources said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Kunlun did not respond to an emailed request seeking comment. A CNPC spokesman declined comment. It was not immediately clear how long the suspension of services will last and how Chinese businesses still selling goods or services to Iran would be able to receive payment. It was also not clear whether the bank’s services settling China’s payments for Iranian oil purchases would be affected.  China is the top buyer of Iranian oil and nearly all of its oil payments go through Kunlun. China had been buying some $1.5 billion worth of oil each month from Iran as recently as September. But state refiners have since October been scaling back oil purchases from Iran to comply with looming U.S. sanctions, oil industry sources have said.     The previously unreported moves by Kunlun highlight the mounting pressure Beijing faces as Washington reimposes sanctions targeting Iran’s financial and oil sectors from early November. “A Kunlun account manager told us payments from Iran made after that date will be rejected and returned,” said one of the sources, an agent who serves as a go-between for the bank and corporate borrowers.  “Whether and when to resume the services depends on the international situation after the sanctions start on Nov. 5,” said another one of the sources, a businesswoman, citing a WeChat message from her trade agent recounting what she had heard from Kunlun. The agent urged her in the message to hurry up payment collections, the person said. The new round of U.S. sanctions aims to force Tehran to stop its involvement in regional conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq and halt its ballistic missile programme, after President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear plans. China has said it is opposed to any unilateral sanctions and has defended its commercial ties with Tehran.   Kunlun was established in 2006 as a city commercial bank in Karamay, an oil-producing hub in China’s far-western Xinjiang region. CNPC became its major shareholder in 2009 through a capital injection in a bid to expand its oil financing business. Kunlun is now 77.09 percent owned by CNPC Capital 000617.SZ, the bank’s latest annual report shows. Early this decade, Kunlun was chosen by Beijing as its main bank to process billions of dollars in oil payments to Iran, shielding other banks from penalties under Western sanctions that ran between 2010 and 2015. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Kunlun in 2012 for conducting business with Iran and transferring money to an entity linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. The lender has nearly 30,000 corporate clients, largely state-owned enterprises and oil firms, its annual report said. One of its flagship products is called “Yi Lu Tong”, meaning “Iran Connect”, the bank said in its annual report.   The 2012 U.S. sanctions barred Kunlun from directly accessing the U.S. financial system. Most of the bank’s transactions are conducted in yuan and euros. Two of the sources said Kunlun’s moves to suspend euro settlement in August and yuan starting next month were triggered by U.S. sanctions. They did not give further details.     “We were told that from Nov. 1 Kunlun would no longer receive payments from Iran. That basically means Iran will have to stop importing from China,” said an executive with an eastern China-based manufacturer that exported electronic components to Iran until recently. China’s exports to Iran totalled $16.4 billion in 2016, the latest year for which data is available, while imports totalled $14.8 billion in 2016, down one-third from the record $24.3 billion in exports and $27.5 billion in imports posted in 2014, according to data from China’s National Statistical Bureau.  Most of what China imports from Iran is oil. Kunlun had 317.5 billion yuan ($46 billion) in assets at the end of last year, and reported annual revenue at 5.4 billion yuan and net profits of 2.97 billion yuan.

2018-10-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking documents from Glencore (GLEN.L) about intermediary companies that the commodities firm has worked with in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Venezuela and Nigeria, sources familiar with the matter said. The investigation is not directed at Glencore’s own activities or its senior executives, two sources told Reuters, giving no further detail about the type of information sought. “The investigation focuses on intermediaries,” one source familiar with the probe said. A banker working with Glencore also said the focus was on three intermediary firms. In mining and other extractive industries, intermediaries are firms or individuals paid a fee by producers, buyers or both for services such as brokering deals. Glencore said on July 3 it had been subpoenaed for documents relating to its business in the three countries since 2007, sending its shares down 13 percent and leaving investors guessing about the direction of the investigation. The Switzerland-based firm had said the subpoena related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money-laundering statutes but did not indicate the Department of Justice was focused on intermediaries or give further details. Glencore, which said on July 11 it would cooperate with the U.S. authorities after receiving the subpoena, declined to offer additional comment for this article. The Department of Justice declined to comment. A third source, who was familiar with the Nigerian element of the probe but not other areas, said the Department of Justice wanted Glencore to hand over documents related to associates of former Nigerian oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke, namely the owners of Nigeria-based Atlantic Energy Holdings. The U.S. authorities are investigating alleged bribery of the former minister and alleged money-laundering by her associates, who include Olajide Omokore and Kolawole Aluko, according to U.S. court documents seen by Reuters. Glencore was a buyer of oil from Atlantic Energy Brass Development, a subsidiary of Atlantic Energy Holdings, which was owned by Omokore and Aluko. Glencore declined to comment on its oil dealings with Atlantic Energy. A lawyer representing both Atlantic Energy and Omokore also declined to comment. A lawyer for Alison-Madueke requested Reuters send questions by email, but did not respond when that email was sent. A lawyer for Aluko could not be identified, as court documents did not name a representative and other lawyers involved in the case could not offer guidance. Nigeria’s government referred requests for comment to the justice minister, who is also attorney general. He did not respond to requests for comment. For Congo, the U.S. authorities were seeking documents from Glencore relating to Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, while for Venezuela they wanted documents from Glencore relating to Miami-based trading firm Helsinge Inc, the first source and the banker said. The sources declined to disclose any more information about the probe into these two intermediaries. Gertler, who was a partner in Glencore’s cobalt and copper mines in Congo until 2017, could not be reached for comment. His spokesman in London declined to comment.  Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende said Gertler had business in Congo and that any investigation into his activities had nothing to do with the government. For Venezuela, Helsinge acted as an intermediary for Glencore’s fuel sales to state energy firm PDVSA, according to PDVSA’s internal trade documents seen by Reuters. Helsinge did not respond to telephone or email requests for comment about the Department of Justice probe. A spokesman for PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2018-10-23,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia signed deals worth more than $50 billion in oil, gas, infrastructure and other sectors at an investment conference in Riyadh on Tuesday, officials there said.  Details were announced at the Future Investment Initiative, held in Riyadh in the face of boycotts by Western political figures, international bankers and executives that were prompted by the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Companies involved in the deals included commodities trader Trafigura, Total (TOTF.PA), Hyundai (011760.KS), Norinco 000065.SZ, Schlumberger, Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), state television said.  Swiss-based Trafigura said it had signed a deal for a joint venture partnership with Riyadh-based Modern Mining Holding Co.  The multi-billion dollar venture would develop a copper, zinc and lead integrated smelting and refining complex in Ras Al-Khair Mineral City, Trafigura said. This was part of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 to develop its mining sector and plug the “midstream”, it added. Saudi Aramco said it had signed agreements with 15 international partners worth more than $34 billion. The deals include an agreement to build an integrated petrochemical complex and downstream park in the second phase of the SATORP refinery, jointly held by Saudi Arabia’s Aramco and Total; and investments in retail petrol stations also by Aramco and Total.  Saudi Arabia’s transport minister signed an agreement for the second phase of the Haramain high-speed railway with a Spanish consortium, state television channel al-Ekhbariya said on its Twitter account.

2018-10-23,"(Adds quotes) RIYADH, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it would continue to meet customer demand for crude despite looming U.S. sanctions that are expected to reduce oil exports from Iran. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at an investment conference in Riyadh that the oil market was in a “good place” and he hoped oil producers would sign a deal in December to extend cooperation to monitor and stabilise prices. Benchmark Brent crude oil hit an intraday low of $78.32 a barrel, down $1.51, following Falih’s comments. U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil begin on Nov. 4 and Washington has said it wants to stop all of Tehran’s fuel exports. “We have to continue to monitor the market in the next two to three months,” Falih said. “We will decide if there are any disruptions from supply, especially with the Iran sanctions looming. Then we will continue with the mindset we have now, which is to meet any demand that materialises to ensure customers are satisfied.” Oil prices have rallied this year on expectations that the sanctions will strain supplies by lowering shipments from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest oil producer. Falih said he would not rule out that Saudi oil output would be 1-2 million barrels per day higher than current levels in future as oil demand growth is expected to keep rising. He did not mention a timeline for this. The minister also said that if oil supply continues to build up, “we will have the mechanism to reconvene ... and bring supply and demand in balance and to prevent inventories from growing”. “It is a very unpredictable situation from supply in particular, but demand also has its uncertainties with the trade frictions,” he said. He said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies hoped to extend their cooperation on oil supply when they meet in December in Vienna. “It will become an open-ended agreement to continue to monitor (the oil market) and stabilise it,” Falih said.

Selling escalated from Wall Street into a heavy selloff in Asia before hitting Europe, which was facing a fifth day of uninterrupted declines. The tech sector posted the worst performance after chipmaker AMS plunged 17 percent as its outlook triggered alarm bells, but there was a broader force at play. The pan-European STOXX 600 was near a two-year low with almost half of its stocks now in bear-market territory — down 20 percent from their peak. Germany’s DAX also fell to late 2016 lows, London’s FTSE was down near April lows, and MSCI’s world share index was just two points of a one-year low. “This morning weaker stocks in Asia raised some eyebrows and overall sentiment is suffering from trade tensions, Italy to Brexit; a concoction of concerns,” said ING strategist Benjamin Schroeder. The euro also fell towards a two-month low and Italian bonds struggled before a European Commission meeting that could see Brussels take the unprecedented step of demanding changes to Italy’s recently laid out budget plans. That has bred some doubt about the European Central Bank raising interest rates next summer, leaving the euro at $1.4390 . Doubts about Britain’s prime minister, mired in a stalemate over Brexit, kept the pressure on sterling. All that contributed to the risk-averse mood, with the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthening while higher-yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell. “The prospect of a normalisation of (ECB) monetary policy was the main reason why the euro was able to appreciate over the past year. However, there is a rising risk that this support is now going to crumble,” Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen said. Markets were also waiting for Turkey’s president to reveal his country’s take on the killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month. Saudi Arabia, a top crude oil exporter, faces international pressure to provide all the facts about an incident that has raised a global storm and added the threat of sanctions against the kingdom to a list of market concerns. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing, but expressed reluctance to punish the kingdom economically. Investors worry that may lead to Saudi retaliation through crude oil, although a Saudi pledge to play a “responsible role” and keep markets supplied held down crude prices on Tuesday. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $79.51 a barrel, down 0.4 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.12 a barrel, dropping 0.35 percent. Asia’s overnight tumble gave back some of the ground the region had clawed back over the last two sessions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asian shares dropped 2 percent to a 1 1/2-year low, with declines in many of the region’s heavyweight bourses even more pronounced. South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng both fell 3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.7 percent. “We’ve got a few negative factors when market sentiment was already fragile,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. “And earnings from some Japanese companies were weaker than expected, with some starting to blame trade wars.” The yen gained 0.4 percent amid the risk-off mood to 112.42 to the dollar. The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday’s 21-month low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade on expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs.

2018-10-23,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s top steelmaker POSCO (005490.KS) posted its highest quarterly profit since 2011 and said it expected sales revenue for all of 2018 to be lifted by higher steel prices.  The world’s fifth-largest steelmaker raised its revenue outlook for the full-year to 64.8 trillion won ($57.0 billion) from its previous forecast of 64.1 trillion won in July, POSCO said in its filing on Tuesday.  Steel prices SRBcv1 in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer of the construction material, have risen nearly 20 percent this year, supported by disruptions to output from policies aimed at tackling pollution and excess capacity.  Looking ahead, Kim Gwang-soo, executive vice president of POSCO, told an earnings’ call with analysts that steel prices are expected to stay strong in the fourth quarter on solid demand, helping the company’s fourth-quarter profit remain firm.  “An increase in (China’s) steel production in the third quarter and lower-than-expected steel production cuts have weighed on prices ... but demand is expected to grow in the fourth quarter and China will reduce its steel production even though the cut may be smaller (than last year),” Kim said.  In September, China’s daily steel output hit a record high of 2.7 million tonnes on average, as mills in the world’s top producer ramped up production ahead of government-led winter production curbs to fight air pollution.  Production restrictions set by China’s top steelmaking city Tangshan, however, were seen as less strict this year than last year as the Chinese government allowed local governments to set their own output curbs.  POSCO’s consolidated operating profit rose 36 percent to 1.5 trillion won for July-September, versus 1.1 trillion won a year earlier, the steelmaker said.  The profit jump was higher than an average estimate of 1.4 trillion won from 11 analysts, according to Refinitiv data.  POSCO’s revenue in the third quarter rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier to 16.4 trillion won, beating the analysts’ estimate of 16 trillion won.

2018-10-23,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s killing of a journalist and the ramping up of U.S. sanctions against Iran have added a layer of uncertainty to crude oil markets, creating a dilemma as to whether these events are real price drivers or just temporary noise. The death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul has generated a constant stream of headlines, often with contradictory messages for the outlook for oil supply and prices. Examples included a veiled Saudi threat to restrict its oil production in response to any sanctions over the killing, and a suggestion that U.S. President Donald Trump is soft-pedalling Khashoggi’s death to support his Saudi allies and increase his leverage over them to boost the kingdom’s crude output. While it is the job of the media to pursue the story and all related angles, the twists and turns of the tale ultimately do little to illuminate the likely path of the crude oil market. Oil analysts are often reluctant to partake in political discussions, preferring the relative safety of supply and demand fundamentals, trusting that these will eventually overcome what they hope are temporary influences. But perhaps the better approach would be to stand back and try to dispassionately look at the likely reasonable outcomes of the killing of Khashoggi. The death, according to the available details, seems either premeditated, state-sanctioned murder or the result of heavy-handed incompetence that resulted in Khashoggi being killed. Either way, the likely result is condemnation and action by Western countries, and a trial of sorts of the perpetrators, all against the backdrop of trying to avoid placing blame on Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. What does this mean for the oil market? Most likely very little beyond what is already happening. The Saudis will continue to try and increase production and meet the demand needs of consuming countries that are being forced to cut back their purchases of Iranian crude. And while the Khashoggi killing may generate anger at the brazen Saudi cover-up attempt, and raise concerns about the real-world consequences of Trump’s continual characterisation of the media as the “enemy of the people”, it’s likely that for oil the outcome will be business as usual. The likelihood that Saudi Arabia will try to increase its oil output, however, doesn’t answer the question of whether this will be enough to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. U.S. sanctions against Iran ratchet up early next month, and the Trump administration’s stated goal is to reduce the Islamic republic’s exports to zero. Nobody believes this is likely. The issue, though, is how much less oil Iran will supply to the world market, and can this be made up elsewhere. Tracking Iran’s exports has become more challenging in recent weeks as the country’s oil tankers have taken to switching off their tracking monitors. It does seem likely that Iran’s exports are around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), which is about 700,000 to 800,000 bpd below potential. It also seems clear that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the largest producer, has so far been unable to make up for the reduction in Iranian supplies. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, including Russia, would pump roughly an extra 1 million bpd following an agreement in June to raise supplies to offset any losses caused by sanctions on Iran. An internal document prepared by OPEC’s Vienna headquarters for a technical panel meeting on Friday showed, however, that OPEC members, excluding Nigeria, Libya and Congo, pumped only an extra 428,000 bpd in September compared to May. This suggests the market may well be short of oil, if U.S. sanctions force more buyers to avoid Iranian crude. Once again, politics is playing a part in this process, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin giving seemingly contradictory statements in an interview with Reuters in Jerusalem on Oct. 21. Mnuchin said it would be harder for buyers to obtain waivers to continue buying Iranian crude than it was under sanctions put in place during the administration of President Barrack Obama. But he also said the loss of Iranian cargoes was already priced into the market and he didn’t expect oil costs to rise in the wake of next month’s re-imposed sanctions. If, though, Iranian crude supplies are severely curtailed, it’s likely Mnuchin will discover that the market is currently only priced for the current reduction in Tehran’s oil shipments. Relying on a boost in oil output from other places, such as U.S. shales, ignores differences in crude qualities and won’t necessarily help ease the loss of Iranian medium to heavy sour grades. Overall, as disturbing as the killing of Khashoggi is, the impact on the oil market will likely be muted, as it isn’t in the interest of anyone to provoke a disruption. Meanwhile, the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran has yet to be quantified, and may come down to a “who blinks first” scenario, as successfully re-imposed restrictions on the trade of Iranian barrels would likely increase prices and cause pain to the United States and its oil-consuming allies.

Selling in Asia erased gains made in rally of the previous two sessions, which were led by China stimulus hopes, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropping 2.2 percent. Declines in many regional benchmark indexes also exceeded 2 percent. European shares are likely to come under pressure with France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX set to pierce their 2018 lows. Spread-betters see CAC falling 0.6 percent and Dax 0.9 percent. Britain’s FTSE is seen falling 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng both fell 3 percent while Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.7 percent. MSCI’s index for the region including Japan hit the lowest level since May 2017. “We’ve got a few negative factors when market sentiment was already fragile,” said Hiroyuki Ueno, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management. “And earnings from some Japanese companies were weaker than expected, with some starting to blame trade wars.” U.S. stock futures dropped 1.0 percent in Asia. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 0.43 percent as investors kept a wary eye on earnings amid global growth worries. Enthusiasm over some upbeat results was tempered by the growing political uncertainty around the world. “In short, the world seems to be getting into chaos,” said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey, but expressed reluctance to punish the kingdom economically. While Saudi Arabia has sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the killing, many officials have cast doubt on Riyadh’s narrative. Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Turkey, have pressed Saudi Arabia to provide all the facts. An immediate market focus is on Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who said he will release information about the investigation in a speech on Tuesday. Any signs of instability in Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer and a big investor in financial markets, could have wide-ranging repercussions. “Saudi Arabia is involved with many big investment projects. Now we could see some of them held up because of this,” an executive at a Japanese asset management firm. In Europe, Italy told the European Commission on Monday it would stick to its contested 2019 budget plans in defiance of EU fiscal rules. The European Commision will decide on its response on Tuesday. The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.1440, edging near its Oct. 9 low of $1.14325, its lowest level since mid-August. Although Italian bond prices rose on relief after Moody’s did not slap on a negative outlook as the market had feared, yields remained elevated, with 10-year bonds rates more than 3 percentage points above benchmark German bonds. The British pound lost 0.2 percent to $1.2940, hovering just above this month’s low of $1.2922 on fears the Irish border issue and disagreements within Britain’s ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge. The yen gained 0.4 percent on risk-off mood to 112.42 to the dollar. The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday’s 21-month low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade on expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs. Chinese shares also lost steam after two days of strong gains following guidance from Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, to major investors to support the sagging stock market. “Any stimulus by China should be viewed not as a boost but as a cushion against a slowing economy against external headwinds,” said analysts at DBS in Singapore. “This reality was better reflected in the Chinese yuan which continued to trade weaker against the central parity in both the onshore and offshore markets.” Oil prices fell after Saudi Arabia pledged to play a “responsible role” in energy markets, although sentiment remained nervous in the run-up to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports that start next month. Saudi Arabia has pledged to keep markets supplied despite its increasing isolation over Khashoggi’s killing, easing fears Riyadh may use oil production as a diplomatic weapon.

The market has unexpectedly weakened this month for cargoes loading in December, with most grades ranging from light-sour Murban from Abu Dhabi to Qatar’s Land and Marine crude trading at discounts to their respective price markers. That is in sharp contrast to last month, when spot premiums for November cargoes hit multi-year highs as buyers scaled back on Iranian oil imports ahead of U.S. sanctions on Tehran that start from Nov. 4.

The sources, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media, said Saudi Aramco was increasing Arab Extra Light supplies to some refiners in northern Asia. That comes after other sources previously told Reuters that Aramco is supplying buyers in India with 4 million barrels more oil. Aramco does not typically comment on commercial transactions. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Kuwait Petroleum Corp have also both launched new crude grades that will add a total of about 170,000 barrels per day of light oil supply. “There is ample supply of light sour crude - Arab Extra Light, ADNOC grades and (Kazakhstan’s) CPC Blend,” said a second trader with a North Asian refiner. The arbitrage for crude produced in the Atlantic Basin and the United States to Asia has also opened after Brent’s premium to Dubai swaps DUB-EFS-1M narrowed and as grades such as CPC Blend trade at deep discounts, traders said. BFO-CPC Despite the supply, Asia’s actual spot demand was lower than expected, the first trader said, because of a lower appetite from Japanese refiners after operations at their plants were hit by typhoons and an earthquake in September and October. “Our utilisation rate is not so high currently, so our spot purchases are at a minimum quantity,” said a Japanese oil buyer. Refiners such as Idemitsu Kosan Co and JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp are resuming operations at their plants in Hokkaido and Osaka after some units were shut for a month.

2018-10-23,"ROTTERDAM, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In Rotterdam, ships from around the world cruise in and out of Europe’s busiest port, a bustling industrial hub that employs almost 200,000 people and produces 20 percent of the Netherlands’ climate-changing gases. As Rotterdam tries to cut its emissions - in line with global goals to curb global warming - shipping emissions are a particular challenge, not least because many fall outside the targets set by the Paris Agreement to curb climate change. But the city’s bustling port is starting to take them on. It has introduced financial incentives for fume-belching ships and other port facilities to invest in renewable power, with the aim of slashing the port’s carbon dioxide emissions from shipping and industry by 49 percent by 2030. By 2050, emissions would fall 90 percent, in line with national targets, according to the plan. The goals fit alongside new efforts by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) - the United Nations body that regulates shipping - to cut shipping emissions, which were not part of the Paris Agreement. The IMO in April, under pressure from low-lying island states, for the first time set a target of slashing emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050, compared to 2008. Such efforts will have implications beyond Rotterdam, with 90 percent of global goods transported by ship and international shipping responsible for 2.2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions - the same total as Germany, according to the IMO. “Every sector needs to do its bit to contribute to the fight against climate change,” Natasha Brown, a spokeswoman for the IMO, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Rotterdam is one of more than 25 cities, from Seoul to Medellin, that have pledged to buy only zero-emission buses by 2025 and take other steps to make major areas of their city zero emission zones by 2030. Each is going about achieving the goal in its own way. But because cities account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the U.N., and consume more than two-thirds of the world’s energy, whether they succeed or fail will have a huge impact on whether the world’s climate goals are met. In Rotterdam, greening port facilities that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels - and home to five large oil refineries - is a first big task. “Doing nothing is not an option,” said Caroline Kroes, programme lead of the energy transition strategy at the port. But making port facilities greener must be combined with efforts to cut global shipping emissions, she said. “The Paris Agreement is not possible if anyone stays behind. Everyone will have to move and change,” Kroes told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at her office in Rotterdam. In a bid to encourage cleaner shipping, the port has introduced financial incentives for low- or zero-carbon vessels, including an Environmental Ship Index, which began measuring the emissions of individual ships last year. Since July 2017, all ships that dock at Rotterdam port have received a score out of 100 based on how much nitrogen oxide and sulphur oxide they emit - and carbon dioxide was added to the mix this year. Using the index, the port offers discounts on port costs to the cleanest ships. Making ships and port processes more efficient also is key to slashing emissions, Kroes said. “Improving efficiency means you need less fuel, so you save costs and reduce emissions at the same time,” she said. One way that is happening is by better coordinating ship arrivals and departures, to cut waiting time. This year the port launched Pronto, a digital platform where shipping companies and service providers can exchange information about their port visits. That information exchange alone is expected to reduce waiting times for ships and cut emissions by up to 20 percent, according to Leon Willems, a port spokesman. If ships on average spent 12 hours less in harbour, climate-changing emissions from their visits would fall by 35 percent, according to a study released this month by the Port of Rotterdam Authority. Fully electric sea ships are not yet on the horizon in the Netherlands, as they are still costly to make and infrastructure to service them on shore is not yet in place, Kroes said. But vessels that operate on rivers and other inland water bodies in the Netherlands are moving in that direction. This year the port of Rotterdam formed a partnership with Skoon Energy B.V., a Dutch startup that helps existing ships switch from fossil fuel engines to electric propulsion. The startup builds rechargeable battery packs, known as Skoonboxes, that can be fitted on combined diesel-electric vessels. The port is helping the company establish a network of charging hubs for the swappable batteries. More and more companies are investing in hybrid-fuel ships, with both electric engines and diesel generators, in order to cut their costs and their emissions, Skoon Energy founder Peter Paul van Voorst told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We see people switching (to hybrid vessels) for various reasons: efficiency, reliable quality of the fuel and sustainability. It is a no-brainer to have a clean ship. It’s a better business case,” van Voorst said in a telephone interview. Among those making the switch is Dutch company Damen Shipyards Group, which is trying out the Skoonboxes over the next few months aboard the 110-metre diesel-electric M.S. Borelli, a vessel that transports containers between the ports of Rotterdam and Hengelo, a city in the eastern Netherlands. “The Skoonbox, accompanied with a network of charging hubs, will allow for full electric sailing. It is one of many ways to shift the shipping industry towards clean solutions,” said Solco Reijnders, programme manager for innovation at Damen Shipyards. He said he “would not be surprised that in 10-15 years (much of) the shipping industry has shifted to completely emissions-free operations”. Reaching the International Maritime Organization’s targets to cut shipping emissions will be costly, and take investment from both governments and private, experts said. “Building onshore infrastructure is definitely the government’s responsibility. Ports are not going to build this, as it is incredibly expensive,” said Johan de Jong, international relations manager at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands. A bit of help may be on the way. In 2018, the Dutch government allocated 1.25 million euros ($1.4 million) for innovative shipping projects, and in 2019 it is expected to unveil a new ‘Green Deal’ to promote sustainable shipping. But more economically viable solutions are needed to encourage ship owners and operators to adopt low- or zero-carbon practices, van Voorst said. “It is up to the renewable energy side to become a cheaper alternative,” he said. “That is what it eventually comes down to: Is it cheaper to go clean or go dirty?” (Reporting by Isabelle Gerretsen, Editing by Laurie Goering.

Selling in the region erased gains made in the previous two sessions’ rally, which were led by China stimulus hopes, with the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropping 1.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi fell as much as 2.5 percent and was on course to hit a 1-1/2-year low. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 2.3 percent. U.S. stock futures dropped 0.8 percent in early Tuesday trade. On Monday the S&P 500 lost 0.43 percent as investors kept a wary eye on earnings amid global growth worries. Enthusiasm over some of the upbeat results was also tempered by the growing political uncertainty around the world. “In short, the world seems to be getting into chaos,” said Akira Takei, bond fund manager at Asset Management One. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was not satisfied with what he had heard from Saudi Arabia about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at its consulate in Turkey. Trump has expressed reluctance to punish the Saudis economically. But while Saudi Arabia has sought to shield its powerful crown prince from the killing, many officials have cast doubt on Riyadh’s narrative. Several countries, including Germany, Britain, France and Turkey, have pressed Saudi Arabia to provide all the facts. An immediate market focus is on Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who said he will release information about the investigation in a speech on Tuesday. Any signs of instability in Saudi Arabia, a major oil producer as well as a big investor in financial markets, could have wide-ranging repercussions. “I would think this issue could drag on for some time,” said Asset Management One’s Takei. In Europe, Italy told the European Commission on Monday it would stick to its contested 2019 budget plans in defiance of EU fiscal rules. The European Commision will decide on its response on Tuesday. The euro traded at $1.1466, having lost 0.44 percent the previous day to edge near its Oct. 9 low of $1.14325, its lowest level since mid-August. Although Italian bond prices rose on relief after Moody’s did not slap on a negative outlook as the market had feared, European stock markets were less enthused. France’s CAC closed at the lowest level in more than a year while Italian shares hit 1-1/2-year lows and Spanish shares ended at their weakest level since late 2016. The British pound stood at $1.2965, hovering just above this month’s low of $1.2922 on fears the Irish border issue and disagreements within Britain’s ruling Conservatives over Brexit could see Prime Minister Theresa May face a serious leadership challenge. The yen eased to 112.82 per dollar, touching its lowest levels in about two weeks. The yuan was little changed but stood near Monday’s 21-month low of 6.9445 per dollar in the onshore trade on expectations China will pursue looser monetary policy to cope with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on tariffs. Chinese shares also lost steam after two days of strong gains following guidance from Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, to major investors to support the sagging stock market. “Any stimulus by China should be viewed not as a boost but as a cushion against a slowing economy against external headwinds,” said analysts at DBS in Singapore. “This reality was better reflected in the Chinese yuan which continued to trade weaker against the central parity in both the onshore and offshore markets.” Oil prices fell on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia pledged to play a “responsible role” in energy markets, although sentiment remained nervous in the run-up to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports that start next month. Saudi Arabia has pledged to keep markets supplied despite its increasing isolation over Khashoggi’s killing, easing fears Riyadh may use oil production as its diplomatic weapons. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $79.60 a barrel, down 0.3 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.22 a barrel, dropping 0.2 percent.

2018-10-23,"SINGAPORE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Tuesday as Saudi Arabia pledged to play a “responsible role” in energy markets, although sentiment remained nervous in the run-up to U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports that start next month. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were trading at $79.87 a barrel at 0120 GMT, 4 cents above their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.41 a barrel, up 5 cents from their last settlement. U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports are due to kick off on Nov. 4, with Washington pressuring governments and companies worldwide to fall in line and cut imports from the Middle Eastern nation. Top crude oil exporter Saudi Arabia has pledged to keep markets supplied despite its increasing isolation over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. There has been concern that just as markets tighten on the back of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, Saudi Arabia could cut crude supply in retaliation for potential sanctions against it over the Khashoggi killing. “Iran oil sanctions and Jamal Khashoggi’s saga are clear examples of the indisputable role geopolitics play in oil, and this is expected to impact oil price and volatility at a time when markets are just about balanced,” U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said in a note to clients. Dismissing such concerns, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday that “there is no intention” for such action, and that Saudi Arabia would play a “constructive and responsible role” in world energy markets. In the financial industry, traders have been curbing their exposure to oil markets by shutting long positions in crude futures, with fund managers cutting their combined positions by a total of 187 million barrels in the last three weeks, according to exchange and regulatory data.

2018-10-23,"(Repeats Oct. 22 column with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OD02A9 By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers accelerated their profit-taking in crude oil and refined fuels last week, as confidence in the previous price rally faltered and the market fell. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 133 million barrels in the week to Oct. 16. Fund managers have cut their combined position by a total of 187 million barrels in the last three weeks after earlier raising it by 196 million barrels in the previous five weeks. Funds now hold a net position equivalent to 912 million barrels, the lowest since Aug. 21 and before that September 2017, and far below previous peaks of 1.4 billion in April and almost 1.5 billion in January. Liquidation of old long positions again led the change last week (-119 million barrels) while the number of new short positions increased only slightly (+14 million barrels). Portfolio managers reduced their net long positions in Brent (-66 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-37 million), U.S. gasoline (-15 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-9 million). The combined reduction in net long positions was the largest in any one week since the middle of July and before that the middle of February (tmsnrt.rs/2OD02A9). As a result, the ratio of bullish long positions to bearish short ones slipped below 8:1, down from a recent high of more than 12:1 at the end of September. While most of the adjustments came from the long side of the market, fund managers boosted short positions in NYMEX WTI by 16 million barrels. The one-week increase in NYMEX WTI short positions was the largest for 52 weeks and took the total number of short positions to its highest level since November 2017. Fund managers’ NYMEX WTI short positions have jumped by 35 million barrels over the last seven weeks, in what is starting to look like the start of the first new short-selling cycle for over a year. Lingering concern about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s exports and the availability of crude oil has helped to keep many fund managers long. But doubts about the state of the global economy and the outlook for oil consumption in 2019 are weighing on oil prices as well as equities. Saudi Arabia’s international position has weakened after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside its consulate in Istanbul, leaving it reliant on goodwill of the United States. The prospect of diplomatic isolation makes it more likely Saudi Arabia will pump extra oil and try to keep prices lower than before to protect relations with the United States. Even before the Khashoggi crisis, the White House had made clear that it expects Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to compensate for the loss of exports from Iran and keep prices below $80 per barrel. Finally, with spot prices and calendar spreads coming under pressure, the incentive for fund managers to realise some profits after the previous rally has sharpened, and the liquidation has become self-fulfilling. From a positioning perspective, the hedge fund community’s stance now appears less lopsided than at the end of September. Some of the liquidation risk that was hanging over the market has been removed because it has already been realised. But fund managers are still fairly long of crude and refined products and the fundamental outlook appears more uncertain than before.

2018-10-23,"LONDON, Oct 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The rapid consumption of raw materials must be curbed to cut waste and carbon emissions, the United Nations and global think-tanks have urged, with resource consumption set to almost double by 2060, especially in developing economies. In the 20th century, the world mined 34 times more construction materials than ever before, the International Resource Panel (IRP) and the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) said in a report on Tuesday. “We are using the planet’s resources at a faster rate than they can be replenished, while polluting our seas, air and countryside with the waste from our consumption habits,” head of U.N. Environment Erik Solheim said in a statement. Governments, cities and companies have been under increased pressure in recent years to cut down on waste, including plastic, and to reach ambitious climate goals. In 2015, countries signing the Paris Agreement to curb global warming set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F). Yet with two-thirds of people set to be living in cities by 2050, according to U.N. estimates, the use of raw materials is predicted to nearly double by 2060. The huge appetite for metals, sand, coal and other natural materials will see consumption of natural resources rise to 167 gigatonnes in 2060 from 90 gigatonnes today, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) think-tank said on Monday. A booming construction sector in fast-growing economies like India has lead to a surge in illegal sand-mining, where poor labourers risk all by diving into rivers to extract sand. The climate-changing emissions released by the extraction and use of these materials will also nearly double to 50 gigatonnes by 2060, from 28 gigatonnes today, the OECD added. But under a “circular economy” model, reusing these raw materials or repairing industrial products, like heavy machinery or car parts, would drastically cut down on waste, and slash carbon emissions by up to 99 per cent in some sectors, according the IRP and UNEP report. It would also boost green jobs and technology, and reduce the need to extract raw materials, the report added. Currently, re-manufacturing accounts for about 2 per cent of production across the U.S and Europe, the report said. “The traditional manufacturing model, where we make, use, and then dispose of a product is both wasteful and polluting,” U.N. Environment’s Solheim said in the report released at the World Circular Economy Forum in Japan. ""If we re-think this, and move towards a more circular model, where a product is used and then re-used, we retain the value of the materials and resources used to make that product,"" Solheim added.
