2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over global oil pricing and pipeline constraints are hanging over the energy sector as U.S. companies begin to report quarterly results, with many producers' shares trading lower on the year.    Third-quarter profits for oil producers generally should be higher than a year ago, because the average price per barrel was up about 44 percent over the same period last year. But oil prices on Friday registered their third straight weekly decline, extending a slide on concerns that slower global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade war could dent demand.     U.S. crude CLc1 is on track for a decline of roughly 8 percent for the month, while the S&P 500 energy index .SPNY is down 12.2 percent so far in October compared with the benchmark S&P 500's .SPX 8.8 percent decline. [.N]    U.S. crude prices CLc1 averaged $69.43 a barrel in the third quarter, up sharply from $48.20 a year earlier. Analysts expect this helped boost S&P 500 energy companies' quarterly earnings 102.9 percent, the biggest expected year-over-year growth among sectors, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.    That would be the biggest expected year-over-year percentage growth of any sector for the quarter. Still, some investors say it may not be enough to reverse the trend in shares given trade and other worries.    ""I expect earnings will be good because the last quarter's prices were good,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.     But, ""it has been very difficult for these companies to forecast pricing because it has been so volatile,"" he said.     Companies that provide drilling and other work for U.S. producers have blamed a near-term slowdown in services demand due to pipeline and other constraints, particularly in the West Texas shale fields.     While U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil exports could support prices in the coming months, top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia have been signalling they expect to increase production, which should limit increases.    Upcoming earnings reports, with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) both due Nov. 2, could reflect those issues. Exxon is down nearly 9 percent for the month to date, while Chevron also is down almost 9 percent.    ""We've seen oil prices sell off here throughout the correction we've had in the broad market. The concern in the sell-off is clearly global growth, and that's immediately reflected in oil prices,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.    UBS analysts expect oil demand to grow more slowly in 2019, on higher oil prices and weaker economic growth. Another producer, Hess Corp (HES.N), is due to report Wednesday, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer, beat analysts’ estimates for profit in the third quarter when it reported Thursday, citing higher oil prices but also cost cuts. Recent losses aside, some equity strategists consider oil to be in a bullish cycle and expect prices to rise further over the next year.    Energy shares have sharply underperformed oil prices so far this year, suggesting there is room for shares to rise further.     For graphic on U.S. crude oil prices and energy ETF, click tmsnrt.rs/2RbYUQA “People are still thinking we’re at $40 a barrel oil. We’re not,” said Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which owns shale producer Diamondback Energy (FANG.O) and other names.     “People are misjudging the balance between supply and demand,” said Lutts, who sees oil prices heading towards $80 to $90 a barrel within a year. U.S. crude settled at $67.59 on Friday.    Even with the recent selloff, U.S. oil prices CLc1 are up roughly 11 percent for the year to date, while the S&P 500 energy index is down about 8 percent for 2018 and market leader Exxon is down about 7 percent. Some money managers also consider energy shares to be more attractive buys now, with investors fleeing high-flying technology and Internet names in the recent stock market sell-off and seeking value-oriented names.  Others say it is still too soon for a bullish call on energy. “To get a sustained move in oil stocks, where they consistently outperform other sectors and where the sector is actually growing as a component of the S&P 500, you need a lot of things like the supply constraint and global growth. We’re not there right now,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world tumbled on Friday while U.S. Treasury prices rose along with demand for safer bets as better-than-expected U.S. economic data did little to ease anxiety over disappointing corporate profits and trade wars. Wall Street closed above its session lows, but earnings reports from Amazon.com and Alphabet, issued late Thursday, rekindled a rush to dump technology and other growth sectors. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.19 percent. The global index went 13.7 percent below its Jan. 26 record close and clocked its fifth straight week of consecutive losses for the first time since May 2013. With equities whip-sawing each day in reaction to the last big earnings beat or miss, investors braced for more volatility through the remainder of the U.S. earnings season and ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm congressional elections.  “Once the elections and earnings are out of the way we’ll have a calmer market but not necessarily a big move up,” said Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago.  “Investors are anxious about 2019 earnings. They know 2018 is going to be phenomenal.” he said. “There’s been a lot of panic selling. One of the things you don’t want to do is buy or sell based on emotion ... The volatility is incredible.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 296.24 points, or 1.19 percent, to 24,688.31, the S&P 500 lost 46.88 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,658.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 151.12 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,167.21. There was some support from data that showed third-quarter U.S. economic growth slowing less than expected as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years. But while U.S. Treasury yields initially rose after the data, stock market volatility caused them to reverse course and fall to a three-week low. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to yield 3.0793 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Thursday. The U.S. dollar slid alongside stocks after rising to a two-month high in morning trade after the GDP data. The dollar index fell 0.35 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.1406. Doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.52 percent versus the greenback at 111.83 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2834, up 0.15 percent on the day. European and Asian stocks had led the way lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.77 percent and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped one percent, hitting its lowest level since February 2017.  Bear markets - a price drop of 20 percent or more from recent peaks - have increased across indexes and individual stocks since the start of this year.

2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, supported by expectations that sanctions on Iran would tighten global supplies, but futures posted a weekly drop as a slump in stock markets and concerns about trade wars clouded the fuel demand outlook. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 73 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $77.62 a barrel. The global benchmark marked a weekly loss of about 2.7 percent and is down about $10 in three weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, to end at $67.59 a barrel. It posted a weekly loss of about 2.3 percent. Prices got some support when two sources said on Friday Iraq will stop trucking crude oil from its northern Kirkuk oil field to Iran in November to comply with U.S. sanctions. Washington has said it wants to reduce Iranian oil sales to zero, although this looks unlikely. Still, many buyers, including Iran’s biggest customer, China, appear to be falling in line, forcing Tehran to store unsold oil on tankers. “If you move forward and see people playing by the rules, which I don’t believe ever really happens, you’ll see supply come off and we could run into an issue later,” said Michael McAllister, director of equity research at MUFG Securities. A global collapse in equities has weighed on oil markets.  Financial markets have been roiled by the U.S.-China trade war, a rout in emerging market currencies, rising interest rates and economic concerns in Italy. There are also signs of a slowdown in global trade, with container and bulk freight rates dropping. “If global demand contracts more than we think, that doesn’t bode well for oil demand. GDP and oil demand are pretty well-correlated,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. The recent market turmoil and forecasts for an increase in supply have caused investors to pull back on bets on higher oil prices. Hedge funds cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude to the most in more than a year, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures. Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said on Thursday oil markets could face oversupply. “The market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks,” Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles. U.S. crude production is soaring, boosted by technological advances. Output this year is forecast to break the annual record in 1970. [EIA/M] U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a third straight week, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. Declining productivity in some shale fields has forced companies to drill more to keep output growing.

2018-10-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 20 U.S. states and several major cities on Friday urged the Trump administration to abandon a proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and strip California of the ability to impose its own vehicle emissions rules. The states, including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, called the Trump administration proposal “unlawful” and “reckless” in a 143-page document reviewed by Reuters ahead of its filing later Friday. The states have vowed to sue if regulators move forward with the proposal. Also joining the effort are the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco which argue the proposal “would deal a substantial blow in the fight against climate change.” Separately, a group representing major automakers on Friday including General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) said it urged “the federal government to set achievable future standards that continue to advance environmental and energy goals while recognizing marketplace realities.” Automakers do not back freezing the standards. They are pressing California and the federal government to retain nationwide emissions rules and avoid a prolonged legal battle. Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said Friday it “believes strong standards - on the order of 5 percent per year annual improvement - paired with policy incentives that support a transition to future vehicle electrification, can provide a balanced solution.” The proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards has set up a major battle between the Trump administration and California over whether the largest U.S. state, which has made reducing greenhouse gas emissions a major priority, will continue to have authority to oversee vehicles. In separate comments filed Friday, California said the proposal “would worsen air quality for the most vulnerable, waste billions of gallons of gasoline, forfeit our best chance to fight climate change and result in years of uncertainty in the marketplace.” California Governor Jerry Brown said at a news conference Friday that President Donald Trump was “taking steps to destroy the American automobile industry” and called him “a one-man demolition derby.” He suggested that if automakers stopped building fuel-efficient cars “they’ll be working for Chinese companies.” Acting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the federal government was still waiting for a formal counter-proposal from California. “It is my hope that we can continue to work together and reach one national standard,” he said in a statement.  California Air Resources Board Chief Mary Nichols said the federal government had not moved off its initial proposal. “We remain open to talking to them,” she said Friday. Friday marked the deadline for the filing of comments on the administration’s proposal, which details a number of potential alternatives. The Trump plan’s preferred alternative would freeze standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day by the 2030s but reduce automakers regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. The proposal would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles. The Obama administration had adopted rules that call for a nearly 5 percent annual increase in fuel efficiency requirements over that period. The Trump administration argues the new rules will save up to 12,700 motorists lives over the coming decades because they lower the price of new vehicles, prod people into buying safer newer vehicles faster and result in motorists driving less because gas-guzzling vehicles will cost more to operate. A memo released in August from the EPA said some officials believed the plan would actually increase traffic deaths from 2036 through 2045 because of increasing vehicle travel.

2018-10-26,"(Adds quotes, background) By Gavin Jones ROME, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday gave Italy’s final approval to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), a gas transport project which had been strongly contested by the 5-Star Movement, one of the two parties in the ruling coalition. “It’s no longer possible to intervene in this project, which was planned by previous governments and carries contractual constraints,” Conte said in a statement. Interrupting the process would involve “unsustainable costs of tens of billions of euros,” he said, adding that “the accords signed in the past take us down a path with no way out.” TAP, the last leg of the $40 billion Southern Gas Corridor that will bring Azeri gas to Italy, is due to start pumping gas in 2020 but local opposition to the project has raised concern that work at the Italian end may not be completed in time. The 4.5 billion euro ($5.13 billion) TAP is viewed as strategic by the European Union as it moves to wean itself off its dependency on Russian gas. Grassroots opposition revolved around alleged environmental risks and the fear the pipeline could discourage tourism in Italy’s southern Puglia region where it is due to arrive after crossing the Adriatic sea. Ahead of an election in March the 5-Star Movement, which campaigns on an environmentalist platform, had promised to halt the project, but Conte said this was no longer possible. “We have done everything we could,” he said, including a lengthy cost-benefit analysis, “but now the time has come to take the necessary decisions.” Earlier on Friday the environment ministry said it had found no legal irregularities in the pipeline project, after assessing complaints brought by the local community. At a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington in July, Conte said he was aware of the strategic nature of the pipeline. The Trump administration is keen to see the project completed on time. Matteo Salvini, head of the right-wing League which governs with 5-Star, welcomed Conte’s announcement, saying work on the pipeline should now go ahead to ensure “lower energy costs for Italian firms and families.” Conte is close to 5-Star but is not affiliated to either of the ruling parties. TAP shareholders are BP, Socar, Snam, Fluxys , Enagas and Axpo.

2018-10-26,"(Adds details, quotes from YPF CEO) By Eliana Raszewski and Hugh Bronstein BUENOS AIRES, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Argentina’s state-controlled oil company, YPF, will significantly boost oil and gas production, investing between $4 billion and $5 billion per year through 2022, Chief Executive Daniel Gonzalez told Reuters on Friday. It plans to raise production by between 5 percent and 7 percent per year, with the largest increase in the Vaca Muerta formation, one of the world’s largest reserves of shale oil and gas. The company intends to invest $3.6 billion on infrastructure in Vaca Muerta over the next five years, Gonzalez said, adding that the company is looking to speed up shale oil and gas extraction, with 1,700 wells drilled by 2023. YPF shares jumped 4.3 percent to 562.35 pesos ($15.20) per unit in afternoon trade, after having traded down 2.5 percent earlier in the day. “Crude oil is going to grow, I would say twice as fast as natural gas for us in the next five years,” Gonzalez said. “Having said that, crude oil production will be seven times what it is today and shale gas will be four times what it is today in five years. So there will be a significant growth in unconventional (shale) production,” he said. The company also plans to begin exporting gas to Chile, and investing in offshore exploration in the Argentina’s Gulf of San Jorge, on the southern Atlantic coast. Gonzalez said the plans would allow YPF to double its dividends every year over the next three years. “We are going to do that in a very disciplined way, reducing our debt significantly, increasing our dividends and more importantly generating cash that we can invest in new ventures. All of this growth can be financed organically by the company, by markets and our cash generation,” Gonzalez said. YPF said it will also double its electricity generation capacity, and that 20 percent of that electricity would come from renewable sources by 2023. While YPF is the leading investor in Vaca Muerta, the Argentine government has tried to spur investment in the region with a labor agreement to incentivize competition among oil and gas drillers, construction companies and mid-stream service providers.

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a third week in a row for the first time since June, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years, as declining productivity in some shale fields force companies to drill more to keep output growing. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 26, bringing the total count to 875, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count rose 12 in October, the biggest monthly increase since drillers added 34 rigs in May. That was also the first time the count increased for four months in a row since July 2017, but the increases from July through to September where marginal as new drilling largely stalled due to pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there decreased by one this week to 489. Last week, the Permian count rose to its highest since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 737 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. On Friday, U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading around $67.60 per barrel, putting the contract on track to fall for a third week in a row after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply despite upcoming Iran sanctions due to begin on Nov. 4. [O/R] So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.24 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Data from the U.S. government shows output from new wells in the Permian has mostly declined over the past couple of years. New oil well production per rig in the Permian reached a high of 759 barrels per day (bpd) in August 2016. Since then, that new well output was expected to decline to just 595 bpd in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) productivity report last week. That means energy firms must drill more wells just to get the same amount of oil out of the ground. Even though the number of wells drilled last month in the Permian rose to its highest since December 2014, completions are not keeping up, causing the number of wells drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) in the basin to rise to a record high. Technical challenges could slow growth shale oil production in the next 12 to 18 months, the chief executive of Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services provider, said on Tuesday. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 19 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017.     Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,068 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,023. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - Phillips 66 (PSX.N) beat analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit on Friday, as it benefited from higher refining margins, sending shares of the independent oil refiner up as much as 5.4 percent in late-afternoon trading. Margins for most independent U.S. refiners, which processes heavy crude from countries such as Venezuela and Canada to diesel, gasoline and other products, have been boosted as U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened to more than $10 a barrel. The spread has widened on transportation constraints, that has made Canada’s oil cheaper than U.S. crude.     “What’s working for refiners in the U.S. are the wide Canadian crude differentials. If (you) can purchase and process Canadian crudes, (you) have an advantage,” Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland said.  On an adjusted basis, earnings from the company’s refining business, its biggest, rose 75 percent to $959 million while realized refining margins rose to $13.36 per barrel compared with $10.49 per barrel, a year earlier.     Phillips 66’s pipeline business also showed upbeat results as adjusted earnings from the unit more than doubled. “We see opportunities for further midstream infrastructure buildout including pipelines, export facilities,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said on a post-earnings call.   The refiner’s utilization rate, the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, reached 108 percent in the quarter against a 98 percent utilization rate, in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated earnings rose to $1.49 billion from $823 million. The company’s adjusted earnings rose to $1.46 billion, or $3.10 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $858 million, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $2.48 per share on an adjusted basis, according to Refinitiv data.

2018-10-26,"Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a third week in a row for the first time since June, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years, as declining productivity in some shale fields force companies to drill more to keep output growing. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 26, bringing the total count to 875, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count rose 12 in October, the biggest monthly increase since drillers added 34 rigs in May. That was also the first time the count increased for four months in a row since July 2017, but the increases from July through to September where marginal as new drilling largely stalled due to pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 737 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. On Friday, U.S. crude futures were trading around $67.60 per barrel, putting the contract on track to fall for a third week in a row after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply despite upcoming Iran sanctions due to begin on Nov. 4. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.24 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Data from the U.S. government shows output from new wells in the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field, has mostly declined over the past couple of years. New oil well production per rig in the Permian reached a high of 759 barrels per day (bpd) in August 2016. Since then, that new well output was expected to decline to just 595 bpd in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) productivity report last week. That means energy firms must drill more wells just to get the same amount of oil out of the ground. Even though the number of wells drilled last month in the Permian rose to its highest since December 2014, completions are not keeping up, causing the number of wells drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) in the basin to rise to a record high. Technical challenges could slow growth shale oil production in the next 12 to 18 months, the chief executive of Schlumberger NV, the world’s largest oilfield services provider, said on Tuesday. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 19 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,068 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,023. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - Cabot Oil and Gas (COG.N) on Friday forecast a higher-than-expected free cash flow for 2019 and promised bigger returns to investors, sending its shares up about 8 percent. The Houston, Texas-based company estimated free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $700 million for the next year, ahead of Refinitiv estimates of about $468 million. Cabot said it plans to distribute greater than 50 percent of that money to shareholders annually through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  The company hiked its quarterly dividend by 17 percent to 7 cents per share, the third increase in payout in 18 months. Cabot said it expected 2019 production to grow 20 to 25 percent, compared with this year’s estimate of 7 to 8 percent. Some analysts said the forecast was on the “light side”, but was in line with the company’s long-term strategy to conserve cash.  “We felt like we were prudent in dialing back our ‘19 guidance,” said Chief Executive Dan Dinges on a call with analysts.  The company, which gets bulk of its revenue from natural gas assets in the Marcellus shale basin, said average production rose 10 percent to 2.03 billon cubic feet (bcf) in the third quarter. Sales price of natural gas, excluding hedges, rose nearly 17 percent to $2.36 per thousand cubic feet. Producers in the Marcellus, which runs through many states in the U.S. Northeast, have been able to benefit from higher gas prices in the Midwest and Gulf Coast, thanks to more pipelines coming into operation in the shale region that have helped move out the gas. In contrast, Permian producers have been weighed down by supply bottlenecks that have pressured realized prices. On an adjusted basis, Cabot earned 25 cents per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of 28 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Cabot’s net income rose to $122.3 million, or 28 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $17.6 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. The company booked a gain of $25.66 million in the quarter related to sale of some assets. Operating revenue rose 42 percent to $545.2 million. Cabot’s shares were trading up at $23.05 when the broader markets were down. The shares have lost about 19 percent of their value since the start of this year.

2018-10-26,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will stop trucking crude from its northern Kirkuk oilfield to Iran in November to comply with sanctions imposed on its neighbour by the United States, five sources familiar with Iraqi oil export operations said on Friday. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East. Last year Iraq began to ship crude from Kirkuk to Iran for use in its refineries, and Iran agreed to deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports. Currently, Iraq is exporting less than 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Iran via truck, the sources told Reuters. “Kirkuk oil trucking to Iran will be halted in November in line with the American sanctions against Iran. (State oil marketer) SOMO plans to sell 30,000 bpd from a small oilfield near Mosul as of November as an alternative. SOMO issued the tender on Thursday,” one source said. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran in May and reimpose sanctions has put Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s incoming government in a difficult position as the country’s economy is closely intertwined with neighbouring Iran. Abdul Mahdi said on Thursday that Iraq would prioritise its own interests and independence when it comes to helping the U.S. enforce the sanctions but Washington has said there will be consequences for countries that do not respect the sanctions. “The U.S. has been putting pressure on Iraq to suspend shipments of oil to Iran and to resume Kurdish oil flows towards Turkey. If Turkey gets more oil from Iraq, it will be more difficult for Ankara to argue it needs a U.S. waiver to continue buying Iranian oil,” a source familiar with Iraqi oil export operations told Reuters. Former prime minister Haider al-Abadi’s outgoing federal government agreed a deal in mid-October with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to resume exporting crude to Turkey’s Ceyhan port via the KRG, the sources said. The deal is subject to final approval by Abdul Mahdi and Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban, they added. “Kurdish authorities reached a deal with Abadi’s government to resume Kirkuk exports and it was decided that the final say should be left to the new government and oil minister to sign a final deal,” one source said. Two oil officials with the North Oil Company (NOC) confirmed to Reuters that the federal government and the KRG had reached a deal but that Abdul Mahdi’s signature is needed before it becomes final. Meanwhile, SOMO announced a tender on Thursday to sell small quantities of heavy crude from the northern Qayyara oilfield for export by road tankers. SOMO invited companies to submit bids by Nov. 4, right around when new sanctions against Iran come into effect. U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry said last month The Trump administration was not considering a release from the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to offset the impact of looming Iran sanctions, and will instead rely on big global producers to keep the market stable.  He said up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil could reach markets if Iraq allows it to flow from the Kurdistan region in the north. Late last year, Iraq began diverting output from Kirkuk oilfields to local refineries to boost fuel production and help free up more oil for exports from southern oilfields. Exports from Kirkuk’s oilfields were halted after an Iraqi military offensive to retake the disputed territories which had come under Kurdish control in 2014 following a failed Kurdish independence referendum opposed by Baghdad.

2018-10-26,"JOHANNESBURG, Oct 26 (Reuters) - France’s EDF Group has taken a 50 percent stake in UK off-grid power company BBOXX’s operation in Togo with an eye to extending the partnership to other African countries, the two companies said on Friday. Big European power utilities are increasingly exploring off-grid technology as a way of expanding their renewables footprint and growing their customer bases beyond their stagnating home markets. “By teaming up with BBOXX in Togo, the EDF Group has embarked on a new stage of development of its off-grid activities in Africa,” said Valerie Levkov, EDF’s senior vice-president for Africa and the Middle East. EDF has already set up joint ventures with Tanzania-based Off-Grid Electric in Ivory Coast and Ghana. French rival Engie acquired Uganda-based Fenix International last year. French oil major Total has also partnered with off-grid startups, while Italian utility Enel and Germany’s E.ON are investing in solar mini-grid companies. BBOXX was set up in 2010 and has since sold 150,000 of its solar home systems, which allow customers without access to a reliable grid to power lights and small appliances. The company has set a target to provide electricity to 20 million people by 2020. “Working with global partners like EDF shows our commitment to scaling up, mobilising greater investment, generating meaningful impact and powering the economic development of some of the world’s least developed communities,” BBOXX CEO Mansoor Hamayun said in the statement announcing the tie-up. EDF’s backing will help speed up deployment of BBOXX products and the French utility has a big research division working on improving battery performance, the two companies said. Global revenues from pay-as-you-go solar home systems were $150 million to $200 million in 2016 but should jump to between $6 billion and $7 billion in 2022, according to GOGLA, an independent off-grid industry association. In Africa, the expansion in mobile money platforms has helped propel off-grid startups like BBOXX into new markets like West Africa.

2018-10-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Environmental activists Greenpeace have teamed up with three families to sue the German government with the aim of forcing it to meet climate protection goals earlier than it had planned, magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. The case, brought by Greenpeace on behalf of the three German families, alleges that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, by failing to tackle climate change with sufficient urgency, was infringing their right to life and health. The filing mirrors a recent case in the Netherlands, where an appeals court handed down a binding ruling ordering The Hague to cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned. The Dutch government said it would abide by the ruling. In 2007, Berlin committed to cutting emissions of greenhouses gases by 40 percent from their 1990 levels by the end of this decade, but the latest government program says the 2020 goal will be met “only to the extent possible”, with a 32 percent cut thought an achievable goal. “The government has simply abandoned their 2020 goal,” said Roda Verheyen, the group’s advocate.  The three plaintiffs, all families of organic farmers, say their farms and livelihoods are endangered by climate change, with pest attacks, harvest failures and ill-health in their livestock costing them and their children money. According to their claim, this further infringes their freedom to exercise a profession as well as their property rights. “We can no longer accept the inaction of the government,” Greenpeace’s climate expert Anike Peters told the magazine. “Especially when it would be possible to achieve the climate protection goals.” Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-climatechange/climate-inaction-violates-our-rights-say-activists-in-germany-case-idUKL8N1X653Q,26 Oct 2018,"Environmental activists

2018-10-26,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is taking steps to limit imports of plastic waste, which has flooded the country since China stopped taking in foreign scrap for recycling, housing minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said on Friday. The Southeast Asian nation will phase out imports of all types of plastic - including “clean” plastic - in three years, the minister said. Malaysia has become the top destination for plastic waste exporters such as the United States and Britain, having received nearly half a million tonnes from its top 10 source-countries between January and July. The trigger was a Chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year. China took 7 million tonnes of plastic scrap last year. At a news conference on Friday, Zuraida said Malaysia would stop issuing new permits for importing plastic waste. It already had a three-month freeze on imports that ended this week.  “We will limit the import of plastic waste from developing countries. So we will limit the imports to only from the United States, Europe and Japan, for quality plastics,” said the minister, who oversees the waste management department.   The United States, the world’s top exporter of plastic waste, sent 178,238 tonnes of it to Malaysia between January and July, nearly twice as much as it sent to the second top destination, Thailand, according to the United Nations trade database and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Britain sends a quarter of its waste to Malaysia. Dozens of factories have opened up in Malaysia to handle plastic waste, many without an operating license, using low-end technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal, Reuters reported on Thursday.

Wall Street plunged after earnings reports from Amazon.com and Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks. Both stocks had risen sharply on Thursday in advance of their earnings. European and Asian stocks led the way lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.26 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.40 percent. The global index was more than 14 percent below its record closing high reached on Jan. 26 and was set for its fifth straight week of losses, which had not happened since May 2013. Markets had only a temporary reprieve after data showed third-quarter U.S. economic growth slowing less than expected as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years. While U.S Treasury yields initially rose after the data, stock market volatility caused them to reverse course and fall to a three-week low of 3.074 percent as stocks dropped. “Yields are down today not because of the GDP report but because of stock market volatility. It’s a global flight to safety,” Collin Martin, fixed income director at the Schwab Center for financial research, in New York. “Overall the (GDP) number beat expectations,” he added, but “when you dig a little deeper there were some pros and cons.” Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 16/32 in price to yield 3.0774 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Thursday. The U.S. dollar slid alongside stocks after having risen to a two-month high in morning trade after the GDP data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 339.24 points, or 1.36 percent, to 24,645.31, the S&P 500 lost 48.88 points, or 1.81 percent, to 2,656.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 165.65 points, or 2.26 percent, to 7,152.68. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies after the U.S. data. The dollar index fell 0.17 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.1382. While a strong greenback benefits U.S. assets, it also raises the cost of imports and exports, which hurts growth. The net effect tends to be neutral. “Unless you are willing and able to push down your currency at the same time that you’re erecting your tariffs, the currency move is going to offset the tariffs,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets The Japanese yen strengthened 0.75 percent versus the greenback at 111.57 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2832, up 0.13 percent on the day. Doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped one percent, erasing gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. Bear markets - a price drop of 20 percent or more from recent peaks - have increased across indexes and individual stocks since the start of this year. Oil prices were headed for a third weekly loss after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply and the slump in stock markets and concern about trade clouded the outlook for fuel demand. U.S. crude rose 0.01 percent to $67.34 per barrel and Brent was last up 0.4 percent to $77.22 on the day. Spot gold added 0.7 percent to $1,239.95 an ounce.

2018-10-26,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, plans to more than double its investments in Saudi Arabia after it is included in the fund’s reference index soon, Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad said on Friday. The fund currently has Saudi assets worth 6.9 billion crowns ($825 million), spread over 42 companies including banks, petrochemicals and healthcare firms. The fund’s reference index, the FTSE, will include Saudi Arabia in the coming year. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has provoked an international outcry and calls for trade with Riyadh to be limited. “We invest in companies, not countries. Our investments in companies based in Saudi Arabia will not be changed based on political developments,” Slyngstad told Reuters. “Generally speaking, we are not set up to assess political risk.” Earlier, the $970 billion fund said it would ask the 9,000 companies in which it invests to ensure their board members had sufficient expertise, time and independence. The fund, which funnels Norway’s revenues from oil and gas production, owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares. It has in recent years become a more active shareholder as it has grown in heft.   While some of the demands put forward on Friday are not new for the fund - such as opposing CEOs who sit as chairs of their companies - others are, such as requiring industry expertise from directors. A majority of independent board members should have “fundamental industry insight” and at least two of the independent members should have worked in the company’s industry, said the fund.    “It is really ... industry expertise which is an issue that has been under-communicated from investors,” said Slyngstad. “The strong desire to have a profitable company by having a board who knows the business.” He declined to name specific sectors where he thought board industry expertise was lacking, but said: “There has been a focus on the financial sector, also from regulators, which we will reinforce from our point of view.  “But this is a broader issue than just the financial sector,” he added. “We have seen quite differing practice in different sectors and different countries.  “This is a signal that ... we will try to look at these issues more quantitatively, to see where we can find the major issues with regards to countries and sectors.” The position papers will form the basis of the fund’s position for how it votes on the boards of companies. “It will be a starting point for how we will vote,” Chief Corporate Governance Officer Carine Smith Ihenacho told reporters earlier. Asked whether the fund would divest from reluctant companies, on these issues, she said: “It will be a basis for voting, dialogue and engagement.” Directors should also ensure they have enough time to fulfil their obligations to the boards on which they serve, said the fund.  In practice, that means board members of listed companies should not serve on more than five boards at one time and the chair of a leading company should generally not chair the board of another company, it said.  In the third quarter, the fund made a return of 2.1 percent, helped by rising North American stocks. It still returned 0.2 percentage points less than the a benchmark index set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry.    “The market development was affected by expectations of differing economic growth and uncertainty about the effects of increased trade barriers,” Slyngstad said.

2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Worries over global oil pricing and pipeline constraints are hanging over the energy sector as U.S. companies begin to report quarterly results, with many producers' shares trading lower on the year.    Third-quarter profits for oil producers generally should be higher than a year ago, because the average price per barrel was up about 44 percent over the same period last year. But oil prices on Friday registered their third straight weekly decline, extending a slide on concerns that slower global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade war could dent demand.     U.S. crude CLc1 is on track for a decline of roughly 8 percent for the month, while the S&P 500 energy index .SPNY is down 12.2 percent so far in October compared with the benchmark S&P 500's .SPX 8.8 percent decline. [.N]    U.S. crude prices CLc1 averaged $69.43 a barrel in the third quarter, up sharply from $48.20 a year earlier. Analysts expect this helped boost S&P 500 energy companies' quarterly earnings 102.9 percent, the biggest expected year-over-year growth among sectors, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.    That would be the biggest expected year-over-year percentage growth of any sector for the quarter. Still, some investors say it may not be enough to reverse the trend in shares given trade and other worries.    ""I expect earnings will be good because the last quarter's prices were good,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.     But, ""it has been very difficult for these companies to forecast pricing because it has been so volatile,"" he said.     Companies that provide drilling and other work for U.S. producers have blamed a near-term slowdown in services demand due to pipeline and other constraints, particularly in the West Texas shale fields.     While U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil exports could support prices in the coming months, top exporters Saudi Arabia and Russia have been signalling they expect to increase production, which should limit increases.    Upcoming earnings reports, with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) both due Nov. 2, could reflect those issues. Exxon is down nearly 9 percent for the month to date, while Chevron also is down almost 9 percent.    ""We've seen oil prices sell off here throughout the correction we've had in the broad market. The concern in the sell-off is clearly global growth, and that's immediately reflected in oil prices,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.    UBS analysts expect oil demand to grow more slowly in 2019, on higher oil prices and weaker economic growth. Another producer, Hess Corp (HES.N), is due to report Wednesday, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the world’s largest independent oil and gas producer, beat analysts’ estimates for profit in the third quarter when it reported Thursday, citing higher oil prices but also cost cuts. Recent losses aside, some equity strategists consider oil to be in a bullish cycle and expect prices to rise further over the next year.    Energy shares have sharply underperformed oil prices so far this year, suggesting there is room for shares to rise further.     For graphic on U.S. crude oil prices and energy ETF, click tmsnrt.rs/2RbYUQA “People are still thinking we’re at $40 a barrel oil. We’re not,” said Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which owns shale producer Diamondback Energy (FANG.O) and other names.     “People are misjudging the balance between supply and demand,” said Lutts, who sees oil prices heading towards $80 to $90 a barrel within a year. U.S. crude settled at $67.59 on Friday.    Even with the recent selloff, U.S. oil prices CLc1 are up roughly 11 percent for the year to date, while the S&P 500 energy index is down about 8 percent for 2018 and market leader Exxon is down about 7 percent. Some money managers also consider energy shares to be more attractive buys now, with investors fleeing high-flying technology and Internet names in the recent stock market sell-off and seeking value-oriented names.  Others say it is still too soon for a bullish call on energy. “To get a sustained move in oil stocks, where they consistently outperform other sectors and where the sector is actually growing as a component of the S&P 500, you need a lot of things like the supply constraint and global growth. We’re not there right now,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world tumbled on Friday while U.S. Treasury prices rose along with demand for safer bets as better-than-expected U.S. economic data did little to ease anxiety over disappointing corporate profits and trade wars. Wall Street closed above its session lows, but earnings reports from Amazon.com and Alphabet, issued late Thursday, rekindled a rush to dump technology and other growth sectors. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.19 percent. The global index went 13.7 percent below its Jan. 26 record close and clocked its fifth straight week of consecutive losses for the first time since May 2013. With equities whip-sawing each day in reaction to the last big earnings beat or miss, investors braced for more volatility through the remainder of the U.S. earnings season and ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. midterm congressional elections.  “Once the elections and earnings are out of the way we’ll have a calmer market but not necessarily a big move up,” said Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager for BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago.  “Investors are anxious about 2019 earnings. They know 2018 is going to be phenomenal.” he said. “There’s been a lot of panic selling. One of the things you don’t want to do is buy or sell based on emotion ... The volatility is incredible.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 296.24 points, or 1.19 percent, to 24,688.31, the S&P 500 lost 46.88 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,658.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 151.12 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,167.21. There was some support from data that showed third-quarter U.S. economic growth slowing less than expected as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years. But while U.S. Treasury yields initially rose after the data, stock market volatility caused them to reverse course and fall to a three-week low. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to yield 3.0793 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Thursday. The U.S. dollar slid alongside stocks after rising to a two-month high in morning trade after the GDP data. The dollar index fell 0.35 percent, with the euro up 0.28 percent to $1.1406. Doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.52 percent versus the greenback at 111.83 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2834, up 0.15 percent on the day.

2018-10-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, supported by expectations that sanctions on Iran would tighten global supplies, but futures posted a weekly drop as a slump in stock markets and concerns about trade wars clouded the fuel demand outlook. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 73 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $77.62 a barrel. The global benchmark marked a weekly loss of about 2.7 percent and is down about $10 in three weeks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, to end at $67.59 a barrel. It posted a weekly loss of about 2.3 percent. Prices got some support when two sources said on Friday Iraq will stop trucking crude oil from its northern Kirkuk oil field to Iran in November to comply with U.S. sanctions. Washington has said it wants to reduce Iranian oil sales to zero, although this looks unlikely. Still, many buyers, including Iran’s biggest customer, China, appear to be falling in line, forcing Tehran to store unsold oil on tankers. “If you move forward and see people playing by the rules, which I don’t believe ever really happens, you’ll see supply come off and we could run into an issue later,” said Michael McAllister, director of equity research at MUFG Securities. A global collapse in equities has weighed on oil markets.  Financial markets have been roiled by the U.S.-China trade war, a rout in emerging market currencies, rising interest rates and economic concerns in Italy. There are also signs of a slowdown in global trade, with container and bulk freight rates dropping. “If global demand contracts more than we think, that doesn’t bode well for oil demand. GDP and oil demand are pretty well-correlated,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. The recent market turmoil and forecasts for an increase in supply have caused investors to pull back on bets on higher oil prices. Hedge funds cut their bullish bets on U.S. crude to the most in more than a year, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures. Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said on Thursday oil markets could face oversupply. “The market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks,” Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles. U.S. crude production is soaring, boosted by technological advances. Output this year is forecast to break the annual record in 1970. [EIA/M] U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a third straight week, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said.

2018-10-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 20 U.S. states and several major cities on Friday urged the Trump administration to abandon a proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and strip California of the ability to impose its own vehicle emissions rules. The states, including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, called the Trump administration proposal “unlawful” and “reckless” in a 143-page document reviewed by Reuters ahead of its filing later Friday. The states have vowed to sue if regulators move forward with the proposal. Also joining the effort are the District of Columbia, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco which argue the proposal “would deal a substantial blow in the fight against climate change.” Separately, a group representing major automakers on Friday including General Motors Co (GM.N), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) said it urged “the federal government to set achievable future standards that continue to advance environmental and energy goals while recognizing marketplace realities.” Automakers do not back freezing the standards. They are pressing California and the federal government to retain nationwide emissions rules and avoid a prolonged legal battle. Honda Motor Co (7267.T) said Friday it “believes strong standards - on the order of 5 percent per year annual improvement - paired with policy incentives that support a transition to future vehicle electrification, can provide a balanced solution.” The proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards has set up a major battle between the Trump administration and California over whether the largest U.S. state, which has made reducing greenhouse gas emissions a major priority, will continue to have authority to oversee vehicles. In separate comments filed Friday, California said the proposal “would worsen air quality for the most vulnerable, waste billions of gallons of gasoline, forfeit our best chance to fight climate change and result in years of uncertainty in the marketplace.” California Governor Jerry Brown said at a news conference Friday that President Donald Trump was “taking steps to destroy the American automobile industry” and called him “a one-man demolition derby.” He suggested that if automakers stopped building fuel-efficient cars “they’ll be working for Chinese companies.” Acting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the federal government was still waiting for a formal counter-proposal from California. “It is my hope that we can continue to work together and reach one national standard,” he said in a statement.  California Air Resources Board Chief Mary Nichols said the federal government had not moved off its initial proposal. “We remain open to talking to them,” she said Friday. Friday marked the deadline for the filing of comments on the administration’s proposal, which details a number of potential alternatives. The Trump plan’s preferred alternative would freeze standards at 2020 levels through 2026 and hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day by the 2030s but reduce automakers regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. The proposal would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles. The Obama administration had adopted rules that call for a nearly 5 percent annual increase in fuel efficiency requirements over that period. The Trump administration argues the new rules will save up to 12,700 motorists lives over the coming decades because they lower the price of new vehicles, prod people into buying safer newer vehicles faster and result in motorists driving less because gas-guzzling vehicles will cost more to operate. A memo released in August from the EPA said some officials believed the plan would actually increase traffic deaths from 2036 through 2045 because of increasing vehicle travel.

2018-10-26,"(Adds quotes, background) By Gavin Jones ROME, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday gave Italy’s final approval to the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), a gas transport project which had been strongly contested by the 5-Star Movement, one of the two parties in the ruling coalition. “It’s no longer possible to intervene in this project, which was planned by previous governments and carries contractual constraints,” Conte said in a statement. Interrupting the process would involve “unsustainable costs of tens of billions of euros,” he said, adding that “the accords signed in the past take us down a path with no way out.” TAP, the last leg of the $40 billion Southern Gas Corridor that will bring Azeri gas to Italy, is due to start pumping gas in 2020 but local opposition to the project has raised concern that work at the Italian end may not be completed in time. The 4.5 billion euro ($5.13 billion) TAP is viewed as strategic by the European Union as it moves to wean itself off its dependency on Russian gas. Grassroots opposition revolved around alleged environmental risks and the fear the pipeline could discourage tourism in Italy’s southern Puglia region where it is due to arrive after crossing the Adriatic sea. Ahead of an election in March the 5-Star Movement, which campaigns on an environmentalist platform, had promised to halt the project, but Conte said this was no longer possible. “We have done everything we could,” he said, including a lengthy cost-benefit analysis, “but now the time has come to take the necessary decisions.” Earlier on Friday the environment ministry said it had found no legal irregularities in the pipeline project, after assessing complaints brought by the local community. At a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington in July, Conte said he was aware of the strategic nature of the pipeline. The Trump administration is keen to see the project completed on time. Matteo Salvini, head of the right-wing League which governs with 5-Star, welcomed Conte’s announcement, saying work on the pipeline should now go ahead to ensure “lower energy costs for Italian firms and families.” Conte is close to 5-Star but is not affiliated to either of the ruling parties. TAP shareholders are BP, Socar, Snam, Fluxys , Enagas and Axpo.

2018-10-26,"(Adds details, quotes from YPF CEO) By Eliana Raszewski and Hugh Bronstein BUENOS AIRES, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Argentina’s state-controlled oil company, YPF, will significantly boost oil and gas production, investing between $4 billion and $5 billion per year through 2022, Chief Executive Daniel Gonzalez told Reuters on Friday. It plans to raise production by between 5 percent and 7 percent per year, with the largest increase in the Vaca Muerta formation, one of the world’s largest reserves of shale oil and gas. The company intends to invest $3.6 billion on infrastructure in Vaca Muerta over the next five years, Gonzalez said, adding that the company is looking to speed up shale oil and gas extraction, with 1,700 wells drilled by 2023. YPF shares jumped 4.3 percent to 562.35 pesos ($15.20) per unit in afternoon trade, after having traded down 2.5 percent earlier in the day. “Crude oil is going to grow, I would say twice as fast as natural gas for us in the next five years,” Gonzalez said. “Having said that, crude oil production will be seven times what it is today and shale gas will be four times what it is today in five years. So there will be a significant growth in unconventional (shale) production,” he said. The company also plans to begin exporting gas to Chile, and investing in offshore exploration in the Argentina’s Gulf of San Jorge, on the southern Atlantic coast. Gonzalez said the plans would allow YPF to double its dividends every year over the next three years. “We are going to do that in a very disciplined way, reducing our debt significantly, increasing our dividends and more importantly generating cash that we can invest in new ventures. All of this growth can be financed organically by the company, by markets and our cash generation,” Gonzalez said. YPF said it will also double its electricity generation capacity, and that 20 percent of that electricity would come from renewable sources by 2023. While YPF is the leading investor in Vaca Muerta, the Argentine government has tried to spur investment in the region with a labor agreement to incentivize competition among oil and gas drillers, construction companies and mid-stream service providers.

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a third week in a row for the first time since June, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years, as declining productivity in some shale fields force companies to drill more to keep output growing. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Oct. 26, bringing the total count to 875, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI For the month, the rig count rose 12 in October, the biggest monthly increase since drillers added 34 rigs in May. That was also the first time the count increased for four months in a row since July 2017, but the increases from July through to September where marginal as new drilling largely stalled due to pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there decreased by one this week to 489. Last week, the Permian count rose to its highest since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 737 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. On Friday, U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading around $67.60 per barrel, putting the contract on track to fall for a third week in a row after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply despite upcoming Iran sanctions due to begin on Nov. 4. [O/R] So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.24 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Data from the U.S. government shows output from new wells in the Permian has mostly declined over the past couple of years. New oil well production per rig in the Permian reached a high of 759 barrels per day (bpd) in August 2016. Since then, that new well output was expected to decline to just 595 bpd in November, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) productivity report last week. That means energy firms must drill more wells just to get the same amount of oil out of the ground. Even though the number of wells drilled last month in the Permian rose to its highest since December 2014, completions are not keeping up, causing the number of wells drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) in the basin to rise to a record high. Technical challenges could slow growth shale oil production in the next 12 to 18 months, the chief executive of Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services provider, said on Tuesday. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 19 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017.     Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,068 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,023. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - Phillips 66 (PSX.N) beat analysts’ estimates for third-quarter profit on Friday, as it benefited from higher refining margins, sending shares of the independent oil refiner up as much as 5.4 percent in late-afternoon trading. Margins for most independent U.S. refiners, which processes heavy crude from countries such as Venezuela and Canada to diesel, gasoline and other products, have been boosted as U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened to more than $10 a barrel. The spread has widened on transportation constraints, that has made Canada’s oil cheaper than U.S. crude.     “What’s working for refiners in the U.S. are the wide Canadian crude differentials. If (you) can purchase and process Canadian crudes, (you) have an advantage,” Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland said.  On an adjusted basis, earnings from the company’s refining business, its biggest, rose 75 percent to $959 million while realized refining margins rose to $13.36 per barrel compared with $10.49 per barrel, a year earlier.     Phillips 66’s pipeline business also showed upbeat results as adjusted earnings from the unit more than doubled. “We see opportunities for further midstream infrastructure buildout including pipelines, export facilities,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland said on a post-earnings call.   The refiner’s utilization rate, the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, reached 108 percent in the quarter against a 98 percent utilization rate, in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated earnings rose to $1.49 billion from $823 million. The company’s adjusted earnings rose to $1.46 billion, or $3.10 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $858 million, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier.

Even though the number of wells drilled last month in the Permian rose to its highest since December 2014, completions are not keeping up, causing the number of wells drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) in the basin to rise to a record high. Technical challenges could slow growth shale oil production in the next 12 to 18 months, the chief executive of Schlumberger NV, the world’s largest oilfield services provider, said on Tuesday. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 19 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.7 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,068 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,023. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - Cabot Oil and Gas (COG.N) on Friday forecast a higher-than-expected free cash flow for 2019 and promised bigger returns to investors, sending its shares up about 8 percent. The Houston, Texas-based company estimated free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $700 million for the next year, ahead of Refinitiv estimates of about $468 million. Cabot said it plans to distribute greater than 50 percent of that money to shareholders annually through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  The company hiked its quarterly dividend by 17 percent to 7 cents per share, the third increase in payout in 18 months. Cabot said it expected 2019 production to grow 20 to 25 percent, compared with this year’s estimate of 7 to 8 percent. Some analysts said the forecast was on the “light side”, but was in line with the company’s long-term strategy to conserve cash.  “We felt like we were prudent in dialing back our ‘19 guidance,” said Chief Executive Dan Dinges on a call with analysts.  The company, which gets bulk of its revenue from natural gas assets in the Marcellus shale basin, said average production rose 10 percent to 2.03 billon cubic feet (bcf) in the third quarter. Sales price of natural gas, excluding hedges, rose nearly 17 percent to $2.36 per thousand cubic feet. Producers in the Marcellus, which runs through many states in the U.S. Northeast, have been able to benefit from higher gas prices in the Midwest and Gulf Coast, thanks to more pipelines coming into operation in the shale region that have helped move out the gas. In contrast, Permian producers have been weighed down by supply bottlenecks that have pressured realized prices. On an adjusted basis, Cabot earned 25 cents per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of 28 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Cabot’s net income rose to $122.3 million, or 28 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $17.6 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. The company booked a gain of $25.66 million in the quarter related to sale of some assets. Operating revenue rose 42 percent to $545.2 million. Cabot’s shares were trading up at $23.05 when the broader markets were down. The shares have lost about 19 percent of their value since the start of this year.

2018-10-26,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq will stop trucking crude from its northern Kirkuk oilfield to Iran in November to comply with sanctions imposed on its neighbour by the United States, five sources familiar with Iraqi oil export operations said on Friday. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East. Last year Iraq began to ship crude from Kirkuk to Iran for use in its refineries, and Iran agreed to deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports. Currently, Iraq is exporting less than 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Iran via truck, the sources told Reuters. “Kirkuk oil trucking to Iran will be halted in November in line with the American sanctions against Iran. (State oil marketer) SOMO plans to sell 30,000 bpd from a small oilfield near Mosul as of November as an alternative. SOMO issued the tender on Thursday,” one source said. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran in May and reimpose sanctions has put Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi’s incoming government in a difficult position as the country’s economy is closely intertwined with neighbouring Iran. Abdul Mahdi said on Thursday that Iraq would prioritise its own interests and independence when it comes to helping the U.S. enforce the sanctions but Washington has said there will be consequences for countries that do not respect the sanctions. “The U.S. has been putting pressure on Iraq to suspend shipments of oil to Iran and to resume Kurdish oil flows towards Turkey. If Turkey gets more oil from Iraq, it will be more difficult for Ankara to argue it needs a U.S. waiver to continue buying Iranian oil,” a source familiar with Iraqi oil export operations told Reuters. Former prime minister Haider al-Abadi’s outgoing federal government agreed a deal in mid-October with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to resume exporting crude to Turkey’s Ceyhan port via the KRG, the sources said. The deal is subject to final approval by Abdul Mahdi and Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban, they added. “Kurdish authorities reached a deal with Abadi’s government to resume Kirkuk exports and it was decided that the final say should be left to the new government and oil minister to sign a final deal,” one source said. Two oil officials with the North Oil Company (NOC) confirmed to Reuters that the federal government and the KRG had reached a deal but that Abdul Mahdi’s signature is needed before it becomes final. Meanwhile, SOMO announced a tender on Thursday to sell small quantities of heavy crude from the northern Qayyara oilfield for export by road tankers. SOMO invited companies to submit bids by Nov. 4, right around when new sanctions against Iran come into effect. U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry said last month The Trump administration was not considering a release from the U.S. emergency oil stockpile to offset the impact of looming Iran sanctions, and will instead rely on big global producers to keep the market stable.  He said up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil could reach markets if Iraq allows it to flow from the Kurdistan region in the north. Late last year, Iraq began diverting output from Kirkuk oilfields to local refineries to boost fuel production and help free up more oil for exports from southern oilfields. Exports from Kirkuk’s oilfields were halted after an Iraqi military offensive to retake the disputed territories which had come under Kurdish control in 2014 following a failed Kurdish independence referendum opposed by Baghdad.

2018-10-26,"JOHANNESBURG, Oct 26 (Reuters) - France’s EDF Group has taken a 50 percent stake in UK off-grid power company BBOXX’s operation in Togo with an eye to extending the partnership to other African countries, the two companies said on Friday. Big European power utilities are increasingly exploring off-grid technology as a way of expanding their renewables footprint and growing their customer bases beyond their stagnating home markets. “By teaming up with BBOXX in Togo, the EDF Group has embarked on a new stage of development of its off-grid activities in Africa,” said Valerie Levkov, EDF’s senior vice-president for Africa and the Middle East. EDF has already set up joint ventures with Tanzania-based Off-Grid Electric in Ivory Coast and Ghana. French rival Engie acquired Uganda-based Fenix International last year. French oil major Total has also partnered with off-grid startups, while Italian utility Enel and Germany’s E.ON are investing in solar mini-grid companies. BBOXX was set up in 2010 and has since sold 150,000 of its solar home systems, which allow customers without access to a reliable grid to power lights and small appliances. The company has set a target to provide electricity to 20 million people by 2020. “Working with global partners like EDF shows our commitment to scaling up, mobilising greater investment, generating meaningful impact and powering the economic development of some of the world’s least developed communities,” BBOXX CEO Mansoor Hamayun said in the statement announcing the tie-up. EDF’s backing will help speed up deployment of BBOXX products and the French utility has a big research division working on improving battery performance, the two companies said. Global revenues from pay-as-you-go solar home systems were $150 million to $200 million in 2016 but should jump to between $6 billion and $7 billion in 2022, according to GOGLA, an independent off-grid industry association. In Africa, the expansion in mobile money platforms has helped propel off-grid startups like BBOXX into new markets like West Africa.

2018-10-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Environmental activists Greenpeace have teamed up with three families to sue the German government with the aim of forcing it to meet climate protection goals earlier than it had planned, magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday. The case, brought by Greenpeace on behalf of the three German families, alleges that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government, by failing to tackle climate change with sufficient urgency, was infringing their right to life and health. The filing mirrors a recent case in the Netherlands, where an appeals court handed down a binding ruling ordering The Hague to cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned. The Dutch government said it would abide by the ruling. In 2007, Berlin committed to cutting emissions of greenhouses gases by 40 percent from their 1990 levels by the end of this decade, but the latest government program says the 2020 goal will be met “only to the extent possible”, with a 32 percent cut thought an achievable goal. “The government has simply abandoned their 2020 goal,” said Roda Verheyen, the group’s advocate.  The three plaintiffs, all families of organic farmers, say their farms and livelihoods are endangered by climate change, with pest attacks, harvest failures and ill-health in their livestock costing them and their children money. According to their claim, this further infringes their freedom to exercise a profession as well as their property rights. “We can no longer accept the inaction of the government,” Greenpeace’s climate expert Anike Peters told the magazine. “Especially when it would be possible to achieve the climate protection goals.” Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-climatechange/climate-inaction-violates-our-rights-say-activists-in-germany-case-idUKL8N1X653Q,26 Oct 2018,"Environmental activists

2018-10-26,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is taking steps to limit imports of plastic waste, which has flooded the country since China stopped taking in foreign scrap for recycling, housing minister Zuraida Kamaruddin said on Friday. The Southeast Asian nation will phase out imports of all types of plastic - including “clean” plastic - in three years, the minister said. Malaysia has become the top destination for plastic waste exporters such as the United States and Britain, having received nearly half a million tonnes from its top 10 source-countries between January and July. The trigger was a Chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year. China took 7 million tonnes of plastic scrap last year. At a news conference on Friday, Zuraida said Malaysia would stop issuing new permits for importing plastic waste. It already had a three-month freeze on imports that ended this week.  “We will limit the import of plastic waste from developing countries. So we will limit the imports to only from the United States, Europe and Japan, for quality plastics,” said the minister, who oversees the waste management department.   The United States, the world’s top exporter of plastic waste, sent 178,238 tonnes of it to Malaysia between January and July, nearly twice as much as it sent to the second top destination, Thailand, according to the United Nations trade database and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Britain sends a quarter of its waste to Malaysia. Dozens of factories have opened up in Malaysia to handle plastic waste, many without an operating license, using low-end technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal, Reuters reported on Thursday.  Minister Zuraida said authorities would take action to shut down illegal plants.  Reporting by Liz Lee and Joseph Sipalan; Writing by A.

Wall Street plunged after earnings reports from Amazon.com and Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks. Both stocks had risen sharply on Thursday in advance of their earnings. European and Asian stocks led the way lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 1.26 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.40 percent. The global index was more than 14 percent below its record closing high reached on Jan. 26 and was set for its fifth straight week of losses, which had not happened since May 2013. Markets had only a temporary reprieve after data showed third-quarter U.S. economic growth slowing less than expected as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partially offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years. While U.S Treasury yields initially rose after the data, stock market volatility caused them to reverse course and fall to a three-week low of 3.074 percent as stocks dropped. “Yields are down today not because of the GDP report but because of stock market volatility. It’s a global flight to safety,” Collin Martin, fixed income director at the Schwab Center for financial research, in New York. “Overall the (GDP) number beat expectations,” he added, but “when you dig a little deeper there were some pros and cons.” Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 16/32 in price to yield 3.0774 percent, from 3.136 percent late on Thursday. The U.S. dollar slid alongside stocks after having risen to a two-month high in morning trade after the GDP data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 339.24 points, or 1.36 percent, to 24,645.31, the S&P 500 lost 48.88 points, or 1.81 percent, to 2,656.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 165.65 points, or 2.26 percent, to 7,152.68. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies after the U.S. data. The dollar index fell 0.17 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.1382. While a strong greenback benefits U.S. assets, it also raises the cost of imports and exports, which hurts growth. The net effect tends to be neutral. “Unless you are willing and able to push down your currency at the same time that you’re erecting your tariffs, the currency move is going to offset the tariffs,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets The Japanese yen strengthened 0.75 percent versus the greenback at 111.57 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2832, up 0.13 percent on the day. Doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped one percent, erasing gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. Bear markets - a price drop of 20 percent or more from recent peaks - have increased across indexes and individual stocks since the start of this year. Oil prices were headed for a third weekly loss after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply and the slump in stock markets and concern about trade clouded the outlook for fuel demand.

2018-10-26,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, plans to more than double its investments in Saudi Arabia after it is included in the fund’s reference index soon, Chief Executive Yngve Slyngstad said on Friday. The fund currently has Saudi assets worth 6.9 billion crowns ($825 million), spread over 42 companies including banks, petrochemicals and healthcare firms. The fund’s reference index, the FTSE, will include Saudi Arabia in the coming year. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has provoked an international outcry and calls for trade with Riyadh to be limited. “We invest in companies, not countries. Our investments in companies based in Saudi Arabia will not be changed based on political developments,” Slyngstad told Reuters. “Generally speaking, we are not set up to assess political risk.” Earlier, the $970 billion fund said it would ask the 9,000 companies in which it invests to ensure their board members had sufficient expertise, time and independence. The fund, which funnels Norway’s revenues from oil and gas production, owns 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares. It has in recent years become a more active shareholder as it has grown in heft.   While some of the demands put forward on Friday are not new for the fund - such as opposing CEOs who sit as chairs of their companies - others are, such as requiring industry expertise from directors. A majority of independent board members should have “fundamental industry insight” and at least two of the independent members should have worked in the company’s industry, said the fund.    “It is really ... industry expertise which is an issue that has been under-communicated from investors,” said Slyngstad. “The strong desire to have a profitable company by having a board who knows the business.” He declined to name specific sectors where he thought board industry expertise was lacking, but said: “There has been a focus on the financial sector, also from regulators, which we will reinforce from our point of view.  “But this is a broader issue than just the financial sector,” he added. “We have seen quite differing practice in different sectors and different countries.  “This is a signal that ... we will try to look at these issues more quantitatively, to see where we can find the major issues with regards to countries and sectors.” The position papers will form the basis of the fund’s position for how it votes on the boards of companies. “It will be a starting point for how we will vote,” Chief Corporate Governance Officer Carine Smith Ihenacho told reporters earlier. Asked whether the fund would divest from reluctant companies, on these issues, she said: “It will be a basis for voting, dialogue and engagement.” Directors should also ensure they have enough time to fulfil their obligations to the boards on which they serve, said the fund.  In practice, that means board members of listed companies should not serve on more than five boards at one time and the chair of a leading company should generally not chair the board of another company, it said.  In the third quarter, the fund made a return of 2.1 percent, helped by rising North American stocks. It still returned 0.2 percentage points less than the a benchmark index set by the Norwegian Finance Ministry.    “The market development was affected by expectations of differing economic growth and uncertainty about the effects of increased trade barriers,” Slyngstad said.

2018-10-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Friday it wants the Trump administration to back a nationwide program to boost sales of zero emission vehicles like electric cars, even as the government has proposed ending California’s ability to require more clean vehicles. GM says a nationwide program modeled on California’s effort could result in 7 million electric vehicles, or EVs, on U.S. roads by 2030. The largest U.S. automaker said the requirements would not apply if “battery cost or infrastructure targets are not practicable within the time frame.” GM product chief Mark Reuss told reporters that governments and industries in Asia and Europe “are working together to enact policies now to hasten the shift to an all-electric future. It’s very simple: America has the opportunity to lead in the technologies of the future.” A national mandate also would create jobs and reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and “make EVs more affordable,” Reuss added. GM also wants the program to offer incentives for electric autonomous and ride-sharing vehicles. GM has said it plans to offer 20 EVs globally by 2023. The Trump administration in August proposed reversing Obama administration fuel rules and freezing standards at 2020 model year levels through 2026. The administration has proposed barring California from setting its own emissions requirements or requiring more zero emission vehicles. The administration is also considering eliminating all emissions compliance credits that automakers receive for building EVs. Other automakers, including Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), did not comment on GM’s proposal. The Trump administration and California officials did not immediately comment but one environmental group called the GM proposal “a distraction.” Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles and fuels at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said automakers should focus on maintaining the Obama era rules that call for hiking fuel efficiency requirements at about 5 percent annually through 2026. Automakers and others have until Friday to file comments on the administration’s proposed emissions revisions. Major automakers say they do not support freezing requirements. California wants 15.4 percent of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles. Nine other states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, have adopted those requirements. In January, California Governor Jerry Brown set a target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030.    A nationwide ZEV plan would give automakers more flexibility to meet a single nationwide target, rather than specific state sales requirements, GM said. California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols said last month the state will “continue to insist on cars that produce fewer emissions, including millions more zero-emission vehicles.” The Trump administration criticizes California’s ZEV mandate, saying it requires automakers to spend tens of billions of dollars developing vehicles that most consumers do not want, only to sell them at a loss.

2018-10-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations shipping agency pushed back this week on any phased entry for tougher marine fuel rules and further tightened regulations that will come into force in 2020.  The International Maritime Organization will prohibit ships from using fuels with sulfur content above 0.5 percent from Jan. 1, 2020, compared with 3.5 percent today, unless they are equipped with so-called scrubbers to clean up sulfur emissions. Ships found in breach of the new rules will face fines or the risk of impoundment by IMO member states. The shipping and oil-refining industries are scrambling to prepare for the shift and have made large investments to comply with the new standards since they were set in 2016. Oil companies expect a jump in demand for cleaner distillates, mainly diesel, at the expense of fuel oil that would become largely redundant.     Last week, Washington said it backed a phase-in of the 2020 rules to protect consumers from any price spikes in heating and trucking fuels, although it did not seek a delay. Some shipping associations together with the Bahamas, Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands had proposed an “experience-building phase”, which gained support from Washington, leading to widespread market speculation in recent days about a possible review of the regulatory time frame. A discussion of their proposal in London this week at the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee, MEPC 73, failed to advance after the chair of the session said it was too vague.   The paper’s backers were told they could submit more concrete proposals at the next MEPC in May 2019 - especially focused on data collection and fuel oil quality.  That time frame would, however, leave little time realistically before the regulations kick in for any potential review.  The IMO has reiterated that there will be no delay in implementing the rules.     A U.S. Coast Guard official said on Thursday that Washington sought a “pragmatic” approach and would seek to develop proposals with like-minded countries for the May 2019 meeting. Some analysts including Rapidan Energy Group have suggested that major stakeholders including flag carriers were working to push back the global sulfur ban.  They also suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was likely to oppose the 2020 start date as it would cause a significant diesel, distillate and heating oil price spike in the winter of a U.S. presidential election year. “Many saw MEPC 73 as the last chance to delay or soften implementation and the fact that both proposals were rejected strongly suggests that IMO 2020 will enter the market as expected on Jan. 1, 2020,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a note on Friday.   The IMO on Friday adopted a ban on ships carrying high-sulfur marine fuel unless they have special equipment on board, further tightening regulations.  This latest amendment, which comes into force on March 1, 2020, makes it illegal for ships to carry high-sulfur fuel “for combustion purposes, for propulsion or operation on board” without scrubbers, which was not codified in the main regulation.     “The amendment does not change in any way the entry into force date of the 0.50 percent limit from Jan. 1, 2020. It is intended as an additional measure to support consistent implementation and compliance and provide a means for effective enforcement by states, particularly port state control,” the IMO said on Friday. Roger Strevens, chair of the Trident Alliance - a coalition of shipping companies that has pushed for enforcement of the sulfur rules - said Friday’s adoption was “an unmistakable signal” of the IMO’s commitment to “full and effective implementation”. “The focus now shifts to preparation, both on the part of the industry and of the enforcement authorities,” Strevens said.

2018-10-26,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) flagged on Friday the likelihood of a share buyback next year after cash flow in the third quarter jumped and profits rose six-fold to beat expectations. In a conference call with analysts, finance chief Massimo Mondazzi said a buyback was a priority, providing market conditions remained stable. Over the last year the world’s top oil and gas companies have come under growing pressure to return more cash to shareholders as profits and oil prices get back on track after a three-year crunch. “The trajectory is positive ... our aspiration is for a progressive dividend with a buyback, on condition our leverage stays below 20 percent,” Mondazzi said. Eni has said it could buy back shares providing its leverage ratio - debt to equity - is below 20 percent on a stable basis. In the third quarter, the ratio was below that level and Mondazzi said he expected it to be well below that mark in the final quarter too. “We’ll inform the market in our strategy update in March,” he added. In July, Shell (RDSa.AS) launched a $25 billion share buyback, months after French peer Total (TOTF.PA) began its own $5 billion program.   Eni’s adjusted net profit in the third quarter rose to 1.39 billion euros ($1.6 billion) from 0.23 billion euros a year earlier, boosted by firmer oil prices. That was above analysts’ consensus forecast provided by the company of 1.02 billion. It also reported a surprise profit at its Gas & Power division, where it raised its adjusted operating profit guidance for the year to 550 million euros from 400 million. “It was a strong beat with good cash flow generation,” a Macquarie analyst said in a note, adding lower production growth for 2018 was largely expected. Eni cut its output target for the year to 3 percent growth from a previous 4 percent due to lower local gas demand in Libya, Venezuela and Ghana.  But it said the lower volumes would have a negligible impact on cash flow. The state-controlled company has one of the strongest discovery records in the industry in recent years after two giant gas finds in Mozambique and Egypt. It is ramping up production at its Zohr field offshore Egypt, where it is now targeting 3.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas per day by the end of 2019 from a previous 2.7 bcf. Eni said talks with partner Naturgy (NTGY.MC) over re-opening their Damietta LNG facility in Egypt were at an advanced stage and the plant should begin working again next year.  At 1430 GMT, Eni shares were up 0.6 percent at 15.06 euros.

2018-10-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - France, Europe’s biggest grain producer, announced aid on Friday for farmers hit by the severe drought that has afflicted the country since the summer, along with much of northern Europe. The government will tap an agricultural disaster fund for farmers as part of a broader aid package unveiled by Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume during a visit to eastern France, where he met grain and livestock producers. Unusually hot and dry summer weather parched land, dried up rivers and ravaged crops across France, parts of Germany and Scandinavia, leaving water levels extremely low. Autumn harvests of crops such as maize and sugar beet have been badly hit, while dry soils threaten to hamper planting for the next season..  Rain forecast for coming days in parts of the country offers little respite, as meteorologists and farmers say several weeks of heavy rainfall are needed to compensate for the accumulated shortages. The rainfall deficit continued into September, when it stood at 70 percent, according to forecaster Meteo France. A resulting scarcity of hay and pasture is likely to force farmers to sell more animals, the Confederation Paysanne farm union warned on Friday - which in turn will “have an impact on the price of the already weak meat market”. Even before the drought, financial strains were blamed for suicides among French farmers reportedly averaging one a day. Aid payments will be bolstered by a further 15 million euros  ($17 million) in tax breaks on social charges paid by farmers, under the measures announced on Friday. Beyond farming, historically low water levels on the Rhine river are hampering vessels’ movements and squeezing supplies of important industrial commodities in northwestern Europe. Other major transport rivers including the northeastern Meuse and southeastern Rhone have recorded low flow rates. French utility EDF said on Friday low water levels had forced it to reduce output from its Fessenheim 2 nuclear reactor, which is cooled by water from the Rhine.

2018-10-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - British shale gas company Cuadrilla said it has paused fracking at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire, northwest England, after a small tremor was detected. The company had restarted fracking for natural gas at the site just weeks ago after its activities at a nearby site were halted seven years earlier for causing tremors Hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. The British government, keen to cut its reliance on imports as North Sea supplies dry up, tightened regulation of the industry and gave consent earlier this year for Cuadrilla to start fracking at two wells Preston New Road.     It introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if any seismic activity of a 0.5 magnitude or above is detected. Cuadrilla said on Friday the micro seismic event it detected early on Oct. 26 had a magnitude of 0.76, so it would temporarily pause activities under the traffic light system.  “Operations have now paused for the next 18 hours during which seismicity levels will continue to be measured,” Cuadrilla said in a statement.  The company said the event was well below anything that would be felt on the surface and was only detected due to the sensitive monitoring system it has put in place. “All the relevant regulators were informed without delay and we have verified that the well integrity is intact,” Cuadrilla said. It said it expects to resume fracking on Oct. 27. Cuadrilla, 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone, said earlier this month it expects to spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells to test flow rates to determine whether full-scale gas extraction would be viable.

2018-10-26,"SOFIA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Bulgaria may launch a tender to choose a strategic investor for its Belene nuclear power project by the end of the year if the parliament gives its approval to the plan, Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova said on Friday. The Balkan country lifted a six-year ban on a 2,000 megawatt (MW) plant at Belene in June and asked the energy minister to come up by the end of October with a procedure to choose a strategic investor for the project estimated to cost at least 10 billion euros  ($11.3 billion). Bulgaria has paid more than 620 million euros to Russia’s state nuclear giant Rosatom for scrapping the project but also received nuclear equipment for two 1,000 MW reactors and has to decide what to do with it. The government has said it does not want to commit more public funds, extend state or corporate guarantees for any loan, or offer preferential power purchase prices for Belene. “The procedure is in its final stages. If the parliament approves it, the choice of a strategic investor can start by the end of the year,” the energy ministry quoted Petkova as saying at a meeting with Rosatom’s chief executive Alexey Likhachev in Moscow. Likhachev has said his company would assess seriously any option to participate in the project, the ministry said. Chinese state nuclear company CNNC is also interested in the project. Bulgaria has invited France’s Framatome, a unit of state controlled utility EDF, to take part. The Balkan country cancelled the project on the Danube River in 2012, after failing to find investors and facing pressure from Washington and Brussels to limit its energy dependence on Russia, which was under contract to build the nuclear plant. Critics of the project, first launched in 1981, argue the investment does not justify the benefits and that the project has been a source of corrupt practices for decades. $1 = 0.8815 euros

2018-10-26,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Biofuel producer and oil refiner Neste (NESTE.HE) is “on the crest of a wave”, its CEO said after the company set a December deadline for an investment decision on a new Singapore plant and posted quarterly results that sent its shares up by 9 percent. The Finnish company, which produces diesel and other fuels from renewable materials at plants in Singapore and Rotterdam, reported bigger than expected third-quarter profit thanks to progress at its renewables operation.  “Renewable products exceeded the previous year’s performance as a result of a favourable market and successful margin optimisation,” CEO Matti Lievonen said in a statement. Third-quarter core operating profit rose to 395 million euros ($449 million) from 350 million euros in the same period last year, surpassing the consensus forecast of 356 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. [nL8N1X351S] Neste said it was on track for a “very strong” full year, though maintenance shutdowns will squeeze profit in the remainder of the year. “This is a very strong result, especially in renewables ... they clearly succeeded in sales, production and raw material purchases in that business,” said OP Bank analyst Henri Parkkinen, who has a “reduce” rating on the stock. Neste, which also has two conventional oil refineries in Finland, is looking for future growth in renewable jet fuels and said it would make a final decision in December over its plan to build a new biofuel plant in Singapore. “We will decide in December,” Lievonen told Reuters “We have been working on the investment constantly and spent tens of millions preparing.” The company had previously said it would make a final investment decision by the end of 2018. [nL8N1OC3WI] “Based on what’s happening in the renewables market, that investment has always looked justified,” said OP Bank’s Parkkinen. Neste CEO Lievonen says the company’s strategy has been further supported by the much-publicised recent report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).[nL8N1WO02N] “We haven’t been affected (by the IPCC report) because we have been on the crest of a wave the whole time.

2018-10-26,"PARIS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - The head of French energy market regulator CRE said on Friday  there were too many players in the retail electricity sector and it was likely to consolidate as competition intensifies. There were around 40 commercial retail electricity suppliers including former monopoly EDF as of the end of June, according to CRE’s quarterly report published in September. Jean-François Carenco said in an interview with Le Monde newspaper the number of suppliers was still increasing. “This is one of my concerns,” he said. “We must better control the arrival of new suppliers in the market. There are now too many actors, and consolidation will necessarily take place.” The French retail electricity market has seen the arrival of energy giant Total, which launched its own offering a year ago, then acquired Direct Energie for $1.7 billion in April. Consumer goods retailers Leclerc and Casino have also launch offerings, selling electricity to French households. Other players include energy group Engie, Italy’s Eni, Sweden’s Vattenfall, and Spain’s Iberdrola. EDF still dominates the market with a share of around 80 percent of the residential electricity market. However, the state-controlled utility is loosing around 100,000 customers every month to other suppliers, according to CRE. Carenco said new entrants could find it difficult to unseat EDF given 65 percent of final electricity bills are made up of fixed costs, including transport and taxes. He said some suppliers offering a discount of up to 20 percent to EDF’s fixed regulated tariff could be selling at a loss and it would be hard for them to be profitable.

European shares tracked U.S. stock futures lower after Alphabet and Amazon’s earnings missed expectations, further sapping risk appetite as European earnings also disappointed. The leading index of euro zone stocks fell 1.7 percent. Germany’s DAX was also down 1.7 percent and France’s CAC 40 down 2.1 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1.3 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down half a percent after trading began in Europe. It was set for its fifth straight week of losses, its worst losing streak since May 2013. “Expectations for U.S. company earnings are quite high, so whenever they are not being met, the reactions are quite severe,” said Miraji Othman, credit strategist at BayernLB. “We have grown used to solid numbers, 18 percent revenue growth, 25 percent revenue growth and so on. The valuations have become quite ambitious.” S&P E-mini futures slumped 1.2 percent and Nasdaq futures were down 2.2 percent, potentially setting up a rough session for U.S. markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped one percent, erasing gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. The Chinese yuan slid past a key level, refocusing attention on slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. The MSCI Asia index has been bruised by a sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest losing streak since 2015. It has fallen more than four percent this week. Chinese shares were pulled lower and the yuan fell past 6.96 to the dollar, touching its weakest level against the dollar since December 2016. The blue-chip index lost 0.7 percent and the Shanghai Composite was 0.2 percent lower. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 1.1 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 3.13 percent. Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market slid 1.75 percent. The Kospi had earlier touched its lowest level since December 2016. Australian shares ended flat. Japan’s Nikkei stock index closed 0.4 percent lower, ending the week down 5.98 percent. Financial markets have been whipsawed in recent sessions amid concern over global growth created by Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a mixed bag of U.S. corporate earnings, Federal Reserve rate increases and an Italian budget dispute. Bear markets - a price drop of 20 percent or more from recent peaks - have increased across indexes and individual stocks since the start of this year. “The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China’s economy will continue to struggle,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a note to clients. “As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.” In currency markets, the euro fell after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank’s 2.6 trillion-euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program would end this year and interest rates might rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union’s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.3 percent lower at $1.1345. The dollar was off 0.3 percent against the yen at 112.04 . The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.1 percent higher at 96.788. Traders expect a strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product data on Friday, which could see the dollar strengthen. “Today’s robust U.S. GDP will illustrate to the market the deep division between the U.S. and the euro zone when it comes to growth performance,” said Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen. The British pound fell to its lowest in two months against the dollar, as doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. U.S. Treasury yields fell as equity markets plunged. The 10-year yield fell to 3.0849 percent compared with its U.S. close of 3.136 percent on Thursday. Oil prices headed for a third weekly loss after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply and the slump in stock markets and concern about trade clouded the outlook for fuel demand. U.S. crude dipped 1.37 percent to $66.43 a barrel. Brent crude fell 1.1 percent to $76.07 per barrel. Spot gold ticked up 0.3 percent to $1,235.52 per ounce.

2018-10-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is on track to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by the amount agreed under a global climate pact, the European Commission said on Friday, a target EU lawmakers argue should be even tougher to slow global warming. Earlier this year, the EU adopted legislation to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent by 2030 from 1990 levels. It also raised its renewable energy and energy efficiency targets for 2030 to 32 percent and 32.5 percent respectively. “If these agreed EU-level policies are fully implemented, EU emissions are estimated to be cut by around 45 percent by 2030,” the European Commission said in a statement. “This would already be more than the EU has subscribed to under the Paris Agreement and reaffirms the commitment to be at the forefront of global climate action,” it added. On Thursday, EU lawmakers voted to press EU countries and the European Commission to harden their stance on environmental action ahead of international climate talks to set out a “rulebook” of the Paris Agreement in Poland in December. EU lawmakers, in a non-binding resolution, called for concrete targets, recommending countries set national targets of at least 55 percent by 2030 to help limit the Earth’s long-term temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Commission said member states are currently working on national energy and climate plans which should close the gap between national planned measures and what is needed at the EU level. They will submit their draft plans to the Commission at the end of this year. Overall over the past four years EU emissions have fallen three percent, although the period between 2016 and 2017 saw a rise of 0.6 percent, mainly in transport and industry, the Commission says. With the policies already in place, EU emissions are projected to decrease by 30 percent by 2030, it says.

2018-10-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - With 63 percent of MSCI’s global index now in a “bear” market, world stocks look oversold but global equity funds nevertheless attracted inflows of $8.5 billion over the past week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. World stocks are heading for their fifth straight week of losses and look set for their worst month in around seven years. The U.S. S&P500 is a whisker off losing all its gains for the year amid fears that slowing world growth and trade conflicts will erode company profits. BAML data - based on analysis of numbers from Boston-based flows tracker EPFR Global covering the week to Wednesday - showed that after weeks of equity selling, 1,742 of 2,767 global stocks had fallen 20 percent off peaks, putting them into a so-called bear market. In emerging markets, the figure was as high as 919 out of 1,150 stocks - 80 percent of the total - while of 1,899 New York stocks, 1,164 or 61 percent, were in the “bear” bracket. But emerging equity funds took in $2.6 billion, the highest inflow in seven months, while Japanese funds received $5.3 billion. U.S. shares too absorbed $1.8 billion but Europe has posted outflows in 32 of the past 33 weeks.  BAML said despite big market falls recently and signs of investor buying interest, it was too soon “to flip from bearish to bullish”.  “Big picture explanation - it’s late-cycle and Fed is tightening. Cyclical explanation - peak positioning, peak profits, peak policy stimulus = peak prices in 2018,” the bank’s analysts added. But noting that 70 percent of world stocks had been in bear territory in 2011, they said if the selloff turned out not to be a harbinger of recession, it could signal an excellent entry point in the coming weeks or months. But pain continued to be felt on bond markets with a fifth week of outflow, losing $7.2 billion. Investment-grade as well as junk debt lost money, shedding $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion respectively, while emerging bonds saw $1.1 billion outflows. BAML noted that the annualised near-10 percent loss on U.S. Treasuries and 4 percent on investment grade bonds would be the third-largest since 1970.

2018-10-26,"(Updates, adds detail, quotes, more data) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - With 63 percent of MSCI’s global index now in a “bear” market, world stocks look oversold but global equity funds nevertheless attracted inflows of $8.5 billion over the past week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday. World stocks are heading for their fifth straight week of losses and look set for their worst month in around seven years . The U.S. S&P500 is a whisker off losing all its gains for the year amid fears that slowing world growth and trade conflicts will erode company profits. BAML data - based on analysis of numbers from Boston-based flows tracker EPFR Global covering the week to Wednesday - showed that after weeks of equity selling, 1,742 of 2,767 global stocks had fallen 20 percent off peaks, putting them into a so-called bear market. In emerging markets, the figure was as high as 919 out of 1,150 stocks - 80 percent of the total - while of 1,899 New York stocks, 1,164 or 61 percent, were in the “bear” bracket. But emerging equity funds took in $2.6 billion, the highest inflow in seven months, while Japanese funds received $5.3 billion. U.S. shares too absorbed $1.8 billion but Europe has posted outflows in 32 of the past 33 weeks. BAML said despite big market falls recently and signs of investor buying interest, it was too soon “to flip from bearish to bullish”. “Big picture explanation - it’s late-cycle and Fed is tightening. Cyclical explanation - peak positioning, peak profits, peak policy stimulus = peak prices in 2018,” the bank’s analysts added. But noting that 70 percent of world stocks had been in bear territory in 2011, they said if the selloff turned out not to be a harbinger of recession, it could signal an excellent entry point in the coming weeks or months. But pain continued to be felt on bond markets with a fifth week of outflow, losing $7.2 billion. Investment-grade as well as junk debt lost money, shedding $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion respectively, while emerging bonds saw $1.1 billion outflows. BAML noted that the annualised near-10 percent loss on U.S. Treasuries and 4 percent on investment grade bonds would be the third-largest since 1970.

EDF use water from the Rhine river as coolant for the plant, France’s oldest, which has two 900 MW reactors. EDF could not be reached for comment on the situation. The Rhine is at historically low levels and this has disrupted the movements of vessels. The drought has also led to low water levels and a low flow rate at the Meuse river in northeast France, and the Rhone river in the southeast, prompting power production curbs at reactors. EDF said on Thursday that electricity generation at its 3,600 megawatts (MW) Tricastin nuclear plant could be restricted from Oct. 27 due to the forecast flow rate of the Rhone, where it draws water to cool the reactors.

2018-10-26,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Global stocks slid lower on Friday and were set for their worst week in more than five years, as anxiety over corporate profits added to fears about global trade and economic growth. European shares tracked U.S. stock futures lower after Alphabet and Amazon’s earnings missed expectations, further sapping risk appetite as European earnings also disappointed. The leading index of euro zone stocks fell 1.5 percent. Germany’s DAX was down 1.7 percent and France’s CAC 40 down 1.8 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent after trading began in Europe. It was set for its fifth straight week of losses, its worst losing streak since May 2013. “Expectations for US company earnings are quite high, so whenever they are not being met, the reactions are quite severe,” said Miraji Othman, credit strategist at BayernLB. “We have grown used to solid numbers, 18 percent revenue growth, 25 percent revenue growth and so on. The valuations have become quite ambitious.” S&P E-mini futures slumped 0.84 percent, potentially setting up a rough session for U.S. markets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.9 percent, erasing gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. The Chinese yuan slid past a key level, refocusing attention on slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. The MSCI Asia index has been bruised by a sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest losing streak since 2015. It has fallen more than 4 percent this week. Chinese shares were pulled lower and the yuan fell past 6.96 to the dollar, touching its weakest level against the dollar since December 2016. The blue-chip index was down 0.6 percent and the Shanghai Composite was 0.2 percent lower. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 1.1 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 3.13 percent. Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market slid 1.75 percent. The Kospi had earlier touched its lowest level since December 2016. Australian shares ended flat. Japan’s Nikkei stock index closed 0.4 percent lower, ending the week down 5.98 percent. Financial markets have been whipsawed in recent sessions amid concern over global growth created by Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a mixed bag of U.S. corporate earnings, Federal Reserve rate increases and an Italian budget dispute. Bear markets - a price drop of 20 percent or more from recent peaks - have increased across indexes and individual stocks since the start of this year. “The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China’s economy will continue to struggle,” analysts at Capital Economics said in a note to clients. “As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.” MIND THE GAP In currency markets, the euro fell after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank’s 2.6 trillion-euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program would end this year and interest rates might rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union’s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1365. The dollar was off 0.3 percent against the yen at 112.04 . The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.05 percent lower at 96.629. Traders expect a strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product data on Friday, which could see the dollar strengthen. “Today’s robust U.S. GDP will illustrate to the market the deep division between the U.S. and the euro zone when it comes to growth performance,” said Commerzbank analyst Thu Lan Nguyen. The British pound was near seven-week lows against the dollar on Friday and three-week lows against the euro, as doubt grew about whether the UK and the European Union can clinch a Brexit deal. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that Brexit talks were on hold because Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet was not close enough to agreement on how to proceed. U.S. Treasury yields fell as equity markets plunged. The 10-year yield fell to 3.0920 percent compared with its U.S. close of 3.136 percent on Thursday. Oil prices headed for a third weekly loss after Saudi Arabia warned of oversupply and the slump in stock markets and concern about trade clouded the outlook for fuel demand.

2018-10-26,"* 180-cst crack to Dubai highest in 15 years * 380-cst barge crack to Brent at 13-month high * Falling crude prices boosting margins * Narrowing supplies due to refinery upgrades, outages * U.S. sanctions on Iran also to disrupt supply By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Asian fuel oil refining margins climbed to a near record high on Friday, boosted by falling crude oil prices and tightening supplies of the fuel amid refinery upgrades and looming U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports next month. “Cracks have strengthened recently mostly due to weaker crude prices which are down by almost $10 per barrel since the start of the month,” said Nevyn Nah, an analyst at consulting firm Energy Aspects. Weaker crude oil prices tend to improve margins because of the lower cost for raw materials. Supplies of fuel oil, the residue oil left after initial crude processing in a refinery, have constricted this year. The oil product is mainly used to power large ships and for electricity generation. Refineries have cut their fuel oil output after upgrades ahead of stricter emissions regulations for ship fuel in 2020 and as exports of Iranian fuel oil, a major producer and exporter of the residual fuel, have dropped before the U.S. sanctions start on Nov. 4. “Secondary units upgrades in Europe and South Korea, loss of low-viscosity Iranian supplies which is vital for blending West of Suez material,” have all contributed to the stronger fuel oil margins, said Nah. Refinery disruptions from key producers such as Venezuela and Mexico have also tightened the availability of fuel oil. The Singapore 180-centistoke (cst) fuel oil refining margin, or crack, for November was at $1.43 a barrel above Dubai crude oil during afternoon trade on Friday, data on Refinitiv Eikon showed. The last time the front-month fuel oil crack was at a wider premium was in March 2003. The more actively traded crack for barges of 380-cst fuel in Europe versus Brent crude has also soared. “The barge crack yesterday shot up pretty sharply to about minus $5.75 a barrel,” said a Singapore-based fuel oil broker. The front-month 380-cst barge crack is now at its highest since September 2017, Refinitiv data showed. Fuel oil typically trades at a discount to crude oil because it is a residual by-product. Oil prices on Friday were heading for a third weekly loss amid growing concerns of oversupply amid a slump in global equities and trade. From 2020, International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will ban ships from using fuel oil with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with so-called scrubbers to clean up sulphur emissions. The new regulations have forced the oil refining and shipping industries to prepare for the shift by making large investments to comply with the new standards.

2018-10-26,"(In Oct. 25 column, corrects attribution in paragraph 24. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OMUNht By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has so far resisted pressure to soften or postpone the implementation of new regulations requiring ships to use bunker fuels with a lower sulphur content from the start of 2020. That has prompted warnings from some analysts that the regulations will squeeze the availability of low-sulphur diesel and jet kerosene required by trucks, trains, aircraft, farmers and industry, resulting in big price increases. The regulations and any associated rise in fuel prices will occur in the run up to the next U.S. presidential election so there is considerable political sensitivity around the timing and cost of the changes. But most IMO members are confident there will be enough low-sulphur fuel available to meet the needs of both the shipping industry and other users of middle distillates without an unacceptable spike in prices. From Jan. 1, 2020, ships will be required to use fuel oil containing no more than 0.5 percent sulphur, down from a maximum of 3.5 percent at present, and an actual average of around 2.5 percent. Ships operating in emission control areas in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, most of the coast of Canada and the United States, and parts of the Caribbean are already subject to a lower limit of 0.1 percent, which will not change. Reduced sulphur limits for the rest of the world were originally approved by IMO members in 2008 and the deadline was reconfirmed following a fuel availability assessment in 2016. A detailed study of the fuel market commissioned by the IMO before it confirmed the deadline examined multiple scenarios for marine fuel consumption and production at the end of the decade. The study concluded that “in all scenarios the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels … to meet demand for these products while also meeting demand for non-marine fuels”. Capacity increases in crude distillation as well as sulphur-removing hydrocracking and hydroprocessing would be enough to meet increased demand for low-sulphur distillates and fuel oil (“Assessment of fuel oil availability”, CE Delft, 2016). Others in the industry have been less sanguine about the availability of sufficient low-sulphur fuel for both marine and inland users and warned about price increases. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency assessed the new regulations would divert around 200,000-250,000 barrels per day of low sulphur distillate from other uses to the shipping industry. The agency warned diesel prices might have to rise by as much as 20-30 percent to achieve the necessary consumption reduction in other sectors (“Oil 2018: analysis and forecasts to 2023”, IEA, March 2018). This week, the agency presented a less worrying scenario to the IMO, suggesting diesel availability may be “less stretched” owing to slower global growth and a shift away from diesel in key economies. Diesel demand is slowing in Europe and may be hitting a plateau in China while slower trade growth will also ease some pressure on diesel markets (“An analysis of the IMO 2020 sulphur limit”, IEA, Oct 2018). Even so, airlines have started to warn the switch will put upward pressure on jet fuel prices next year (“Airlines face rising fuel costs, blame cruise ships”, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 22). And some major shipping flag states, including the United States, worried about the impact on fuel costs, have been lobbying for “an experience-building phase” that would inform the implementation of the sulphur cap (“U.S. seeks late change to sulphur-cap rules”, Financial Times, Oct. 23). The global shipping industry accounted for 46 percent of heavy fuel oil and 5 percent of gasoil used worldwide in 2012. Under IMO rules, ship owners have two routes to comply with the reduced sulphur caps: switch consumption to fuels containing less sulphur or install exhaust gas cleaning systems commonly known as scrubbers. Installing scrubbers involves a large upfront cost of several million dollars per ship but will allow them to continue burning cheaper high-sulphur fuel oil (capital investment to lower operating costs). Switching consumption to lower-sulphur fuels avoids upfront costs but locks owners into buying more expensive fuels, lowering capital investment but raising operating costs. The IMO’s consultants forecast that around 3,800 ships would be fitted with scrubbers by the start of January 2020. They predicted most ship owners would leave installations until 2018/19 to delay capital costs as late as possible and avoid incurring costs until they could take advantage of discounted high-sulphur fuel oil. These forecasts appear reasonably accurate. By 2020, around 4,000 ships will be fitted with scrubbers, on the most recent estimate. A total of 1,850 vessels have already been fitted with scrubbers, according to a report issued by Norwegian consulting firm DNV GL on Oct. 10. Some 716 scrubbers were installed or confirmed this year, nearly double the 368 reported in 2017, it said. The number is forecast to soar to 1,735 in 2019 and remain at similar rates into 2020. Vessels that do not install scrubbers, will be required to buy fuel certified as containing less than 0.5 percent sulphur from Jan. 1, 2020, and will likely be banned from carrying any fuel over this limit after March 1. One option will be to buy heavy fuel oil with reduced sulphur content. Another will be to switch to low-sulphur marine gasoil. A third will be to switch to a blended fuel designed to bring average sulphur levels under the cap. All these options are likely to add to the fuel bills for ship owners, which they will seek to pass on to charterers and freight companies. But the main concern focuses on how many ship owners will switch to using marine gasoil, which is essentially the same product as road diesel, distillate fuel oil, and jet fuel. Large-scale switching will put ship owners in direct competition with motorists, haulage firms, railroads, farmers, airlines and the heating oil industry for the same molecules, pushing up prices for all of them. Because so much distillate is used in industry and freight transportation, distillate consumption is heavily geared towards the economic cycle. Distillate markets have been relatively tight in 2018 and were expected to tighten further in 2019 assuming the economic expansion continues. As the IEA notes, however, there has recently been some shift away from diesel among European motorists following the emissions cheating scandal and consumption growth may also be moderating in China. More importantly, the global economic and trade cycle shows increasing signs of maturity and may move into a more moderate phase over the next 12 months. Refiners have also undertaken extensive expansions and upgrades to reduce their production of high-sulphur residuals and increase output of IMO-compliant fuel oil and gasoil. Having made expensive investments, many refiners and bunkering firms have urged the IMO to press ahead with the introduction of the new sulphur cap. There are still concerns about the potential impact on gasoil availability and prices in 2020. In 2008, gasoil prices moved briefly to a premium of almost $40 per barrel over Brent, in part because of concerns about availability. So far, gasoil cracks for fuel delivered in January 2020, the first month after the sulphur cap is introduced, have risen from a recent low of $12 per barrel to almost $19. The discount for high-sulphur fuel oil delivered in January 2020 has widened from $16 in August 2017 to around $33 (tmsnrt.rs/2OMUNht). The big margin between gasoil and high-sulphur fuel prices is necessary to ensure at least some vessel owners switch to scrubbers. The risk of future price spikes cannot be ruled out. But so far, the price mechanism appears to be working as intended.

2018-10-26,"* High freight rates pushing cargoes to Europe instead of Asia * Six LNG tankers floating cargoes in Singapore, Malaysia -traders * H-Energy, KOMIPO seek mid-term supply cargoes By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas fell to an over two-month low this week amid increased supply and lower demand especially in Japan which is expecting a warmer-than-usual winter and the restart of nuclear reactors. High freight rates are also weighing on Asian demand, with deliveries of LNG heading to northwest Europe instead. December spot LNG LNG-AS fell to $10.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since Aug. 10. Bids and offers were far apart, while the price spread between December and January was estimated at about $1 per mmBtu. Illustrating the tepid demand, a fleet of half-a-dozen tankers carrying unsold LNG has been floating in Singapore and Malaysian waters for up to two weeks, traders said this week. The ships are carrying a total of around 1 million cubic metres of LNG, worth more than $200 million at current spot market prices. The LNG cargoes were purchased ahead of the northern hemisphere winter season in a strategic move but are now failing to find buyers, several traders told Reuters. Falling appetite for LNG in Japan, the largest importer of the commodity globally, will contribute to slower Asian demand-growth as gas is replaced by nuclear energy. A court in Japan on Friday paved the way for Shikoku Electric Power Co to restart its only operable nuclear reactor, rejecting a lawsuit from residents to close the unit. Japan is expected to have about 9 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity online by this winter compared with 3.5 GW last winter, FGE said earlier this week. Companies from China, whose gasification push last winter helped push up spot prices to 2014 highs, have also been securing term supplies to meet anticipated demand increases instead of waiting until winter to procure LNG, which is weighing on spot prices. With freight rates soaring to 6-year peaks, near record-high LNG deliveries are heading to Europe. Ports in northwest Europe will have received 2.6 million tonnes of LNG by the end of the month, the highest for any time of the year since Refinitiv Eikon shipping data began in 2013. Focus this week was on mid-term deals with companies from South Korea and India issuing tenders. South Korea’s Korea Midland Power Co Ltd (KOMIPO) is seeking up to 20 cargoes for delivery over five years from 2020, while sources said India’s H-Energy is looking 17 cargoes for delivery over 2019 to 2022. On the supply front, Cheniere Energy expects to see the first LNG from its Corpus Christi project soon, a senior executive said earlier this week.

2018-10-26,"(Reuters) - Glencore Plc on Friday reported a 12 percent rise in copper production so far this year, while cobalt production rose 44 percent, boosted by the restart of Katanga’s processing operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The London-listed miner and commodities trader, which posted record half-year earnings in August, said then it had been facing higher costs and weak prices for cobalt and other byproducts.  Glencore’s copper production rose by 116,600 tonnes to 1,063,100 tonnes from the start of this year and cobalt output jumped 8,700 tonnes to 28,500 tonnes. Rival Anglo American on Tuesday said its copper production rose 17 percent, helped by an overall increase in productivity as each employee has been 5 percent more productive this year than in 2017. Other major miners reporting this month - BHP Billiton Plc and Rio Tinto Plc  - have signaled lower output in copper, needed for an anticipated increase in electric vehicle manufacturing. Glencore’s share price, which has underperformed the top global miners, has also been pressured by higher costs in the Democratic Republic of Congo because of a recent new mining code, and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation. The company reiterated its full-year marketing guidance would come in at the top half of its $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion long-term range. However, it cut its full-year expectation for oil production by 300,000 barrels to 4.6 million barrels, due to a one-month unplanned stoppage at its Mangara field in Chad.

2018-10-26,"HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s Dalian Wanda Group is exploring a partial sale of its Hollywood film studio and the full sale of its sports assets in its latest push to reduce offshore holdings under pressure from Beijing, sources familiar with the matter said. Deals for the assets would essentially reduce the conglomerate’s overseas holdings to a handful of property developments - also reported to be on the block, according to The Real Deal, a U.S. property news website. The company, led by billionaire Wang Jianlin, once had dreams of developing a China-Hollywood film nexus, had a stake in top-flight Spanish football club Atletico Madrid and owned prime property developments in Sydney and London. Wanda paid $3.5 billion (2.7 billion pounds) in early 2016 for Hollywood studio Legendary Entertainment, maker of “Pacific Rim” and “The Great Wall”. It is now exploring the sale of a minority stake, two sources with direct knowledge said, similar to Wanda’s recent stake sale in AMC Entertainment (AMC.N), the world’s largest cinema operator, a two-part deal that ostensibly gave U.S. private equity group Silver Lake a stake of up to 22 percent via convertible bonds and saw Wanda give up majority control. New management at Legendary Entertainment has helped clean up its balance sheet and boosted its pipeline of TV and film content, one of the sources said. The people declined to be named as the information is confidential.  Wanda said that the report of the sales were “seriously inconsistent with the facts.” A representative for Legendary declined to comment. Wanda is also considering the sale of its sports marketing firm Infront Sports & Media as well as World Triathlon Corp (WTC) - owner of the Ironman Triathlons - the people said, cautioning the plans are not final and could change. In December last year, Wanda asked a group of investment banks to look into the potential for listing the sports assets, potentially in Hong Kong. The group has since received offers for the businesses from a number of private equity firms, including CVC Partners. But Wanda considered the offers too low, according to two of the people, who said the unit could yet push for a listing. CVC declined to comment. Wanda could also sell its remaining stake of 38 percent in AMC Entertainment for the right price, the people said. Wanda first bought AMC in 2012 for $2.6 billion, and floated the company in 2013, when it retained a stake of about 60 percent, before entering into the deal with Silver Lake in September. Under that deal, the private equity firm holds the right of first refusal on certain future sales of AMC shares by Wanda. AMC, which operates more than 1,000 movie theatres globally, did not respond to a request for comment. Wanda’s retrenchment began after Beijing launched a crackdown in mid-2017 on what it viewed as irrational acquisitions by some Chinese conglomerates. The group rapidly offloaded $9 billion in domestic hotels and tourism assets to fellow Chinese property developers but has taken longer to cut back its international holdings. In February, it sold its 17 percent stake in Atletico Madrid and this year has already disposed of prime property developments in London, Sydney and Australia’s Gold Coast. Wanda is now focussing on core domestic businesses, notably its commercial property arm, financial unit, and Wanda Cinema Line Corp, China’s largest cinema operator, said one of source.

2018-10-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total raised its production growth target for 2018, after a new record output and high oil prices during the third quarter enabled it to report its highest net income in a quarter since 2012. “Total’s third quarter adjusted net income increased by 48 percent from last year to $4 billion, while oil prices increased 44 percent to $75 per barrel supported by supply tensions and the geopolitical context,” said Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne in a statement. The net income figure was above an average analyst forecast of $3.75 billion. With Brent crude oil prices at around $80 per barrel at the start of the fourth quarter, Total said its exploration and production business will continue to profit thanks to the expected growth in output. European peer Eni had earlier lowered its production growth target for the year after profits in the third quarter rose to beat expectations. Total’s production rose 8.6 percent to 2.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d), a new record output in a quarter, supported by the start-up of production at the Kaombo project in Angola and the ramp-up of projects such as Yamal LNG in Russia. Analysts had expected oil and gas production in the third quarter at 2.7 Mboe/d.   The launch of other plans such as its Ichthys liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, and increased production from Moho Nord in Congo and Fort Hills in Canada, enabled Total to raise its output target to around 8 percent in 2018 from over 7 percent previously. Production will also be boosted in the coming months by the launch of a third train at Yamal LNG in Russia, the start-up of the 200,000 barrels per day Egina in Nigeria, the Tempa Rossa oil field in Italy, and a second train at Ichthys LNG. In the downstream segment, Total said that although its European refining margin remained volatile, those downstream businesses generated $4.8 billion in cash flow in the first nine months of the year and was in line to hit 2018 objectives. The firm maintained its savings target for the year, and adjusted its capital investments to $16 billion from $16 to $17 billion previously, while Total added it would pay a third quarter dividend of 0.64 euros per share.

The gloom enveloping Asia was at odds with a bounce on Wall Street overnight, highlighting fragile investor confidence, as shares of tech titans Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc fell sharply after the closing bell on disappointing earnings. In Friday’s Asian session, S&P E-mini futures slumped 0.88 percent, setting up a potentially rough session for U.S. markets which had crumbled on Wednesday on concerns about earnings and sent global equities into a tailspin. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.04 percent, erasing tiny gains made in the opening hour and hitting its lowest level since February 2017. Not helping was a slide in the Chinese yuan past a key level, refocusing market attention on slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest economy. Shares in Europe are seen following Asia down, with London’s FTSE expected to open 0.9 percent lower, Germany’s DAX off 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 down 1.2 percent, according to David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. “There’s no question that the weight of sentiment has been building,” said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut in Brisbane, highlighting in particular rising geopolitical tensions including Brexit, and “internal financial tension” in China. “All of these things added up to the volatility hitting a boiling point... and I don’t’ think at the moment people should be trying to catch the falling knife,” he said. The MSCI Asia index has been bruised by a heavy sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest such streak since 2015. It has fallen more than 4 percent this week. Chinese shares were pulled lower amid the generally dismal mood, and as the yuan fell past the psychologically important 6.96 level to the dollar, touching its lowest levels against the greenback since December 2016. The blue-chip index was down 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite was 0.51 percent lower in afternoon trade. Chinese shares have been hit by volatility this week amid a string of official announcements and measures aimed at supporting the markets following a recent plunge. The heavy sell-off has raised concerns about risks posed by about $620 billion worth of shares pledged for loans. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 1.05 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 2.94 percent. Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market slid 1.8 percent. The Kospi had earlier touched its lowest level since December 2016. In Australia, shares ended flat at the end of a see-saw day. Japan’s Nikkei stock index closed 0.4 percent lower after a volatile session, ending the week down 5.98 percent. Financial markets have been whipsawed in recent sessions on concerns over global growth as investors fretted over Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a mixed bag of U.S. corporate earnings, Federal Reserve rate hikes and Italian budget woes. A slowdown in China has been particularly worrying for policy makers and investors, hitting asset markets from stocks to currencies and commodities. Friday’s fresh 22-month low for the yuan adds to the myriad of negative factors roiling investors. Analysts at Capital Economics sounded a cautious note, suggesting that the bounce in the S&P 500 index on Thursday was only temporary as investors worries about the economic outlook worsen. “The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China’s economy will continue to struggle,” the analysts said in a note to clients. “As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.” Investors will get a chance to check the U.S. economic pulse later Friday when the government releases third-quarter GDP data. ANZ analysts highlighted weak U.S. core durable goods data as suggesting that “investment is not taking off, even with the apparent tailwind from tax cuts and USD repatriation.” “This indicates that the boost to GDP growth from the fiscal stimulus could be fairly transitory,” the analysts said. In currency markets, the euro fell, extending weakness after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank’s 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union’s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.1 percent lower at $1.1363. The dollar was off 0.2 percent against the yen at 112.18 . The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.05 percent lower at 96.633. U.S. Treasury yields fell as equity markets plunged. The 10-year yield fell to 3.1018 percent compared with its U.S. close of 3.136 percent on Thursday. Oil prices gave up ground, heading for their third weekly loss after earlier rising on signals from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister that there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles. U.S. crude dipped 1.07 percent to $66.61 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.83 percent to $76.25 per barrel. Spot gold ticked up 0.07 percent to $1,232.44 per ounce.

2018-10-26,"WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Friday it wants the Trump administration to back a nationwide program to boost the sale of zero emission vehicles like electric cars, even as the government has proposed ending California’s ability to require more clean vehicles. GM says a nationwide program modeled on California’s effort could result in 7 million electric vehicles, or EVs, on U.S. roads by 2030. The largest U.S. automaker said the requirements would not apply if “battery cost or infrastructure targets are not practicable within the time frame.” GM product chief Mark Reuss told reporters that governments and industries in Asia and Europe “are working together to enact policies now to hasten the shift to an all-electric future. It’s very simple: America has the opportunity to lead in the technologies of the future.” A national mandate also would create jobs and reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and “make EVs more affordable,” Reuss added. GM has said it plans to offer 20 EVs by 2023 globally. The Trump administration in August proposed reversing Obama administration fuel rules and freezing standards at 2020 model year levels through 2026. The administration also proposed barring California from setting its own emissions requirements or requiring more zero emission vehicles. The administration is also considering eliminating all emissions compliance credits that automakers receive for building EVs. Automakers and others have until Friday to file comments on the proposed emissions revisions. Major automakers say they do not support freezing requirements. California wants 15.4 percent of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles. Nine other states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, have adopted those requirements. In January, California Governor Jerry Brown set a target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030. A nationwide ZEV plan would give automakers more flexibility to meet a single nationwide target, rather than specific state sales requirements, GM said. California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols said last month the state will “continue to insist on cars that produce fewer emissions, including millions more zero-emission vehicles.” The Trump administration criticizes California’s ZEV mandate, saying it requires automakers to spend tens of billions of dollars developing vehicles that most consumers do not want, only to sell them at a loss.

2018-10-26,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan -0.7 pct * China shares swing from gains to losses and back * Amazon, Alphabet earnings disappoint * Euro falls after Draghi reaffirms end of asset purchase program By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped again on Friday morning, deepening this week’s markets rout, after disappointing results from Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com heightened concerns over the outlook for U.S. corporate earnings, global trade and economic growth. The wobbly start for regional bourses came despite a bounce on Wall Street overnight, which was helped by bargain-hunting and positive earnings from Microsoft Corp. Those gains were put into perspective, however, as shares of both Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc fell sharply after the closing bell on disappointing earnings. Predictably, the Nasdaq futures turned down 1 percent and S&P E-mini futures fell 0.8 percent, underscoring broad worries about U.S. corporate earnings, and the outlook for the economy, which triggered a plunge on Wall Street on Wednesday and sent global markets into a tailspin. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.69 percent, erasing tiny gains made in the opening hour. The index has been bruised by a heavy sell-off in the past several days, and is on course for its fifth weekly loss - its longest such streak since 2015. It has fallen more than 3 percent this week. Shares in China moved in and out of the black in choppy trade, with the blue-chip index down 0.39 percent and the Shanghai Composite off less than 0.1 percent. Chinese shares have been hit by volatility this week amid a string of official announcements and measures aimed at supporting the markets following a recent plunge. The heavy sell-off has raised concerns about risks posed by about $620 billion worth of shares pledged for loans. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 0.55 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 1.9 percent. Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market fell 1.7 percent, deepening losses after the Kospi closed at its lowest level since January 2017 on Thursday. Chipmaker SK Hynix was down 1.24 percent after falling 3 percent on Thursday, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd was 5.58 percent lower. In Australia, shares turned down 0.31 percent after gaining modestly at the start. Japan’s Nikkei stock index also snapped back into the red after pushing up in early deals, last trading down 0.22 percent after tumbling 3.7 percent on Thursday. Financial markets have been whipsawed in recent sessions on concerns over global growth as investors fretted over Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a mixed bag of U.S. corporate earnings, Federal Reserve rate hikes and Italian budget woes. A slowdown in China has been particularly worrying for policy makers and investors, hitting asset markets from stocks to currencies and commodities. Analysts at Capital Economics sounded a cautious note, suggesting that the bounce in the S&P 500 index on Thursday was only temporary as investors worries about the economic outlook worsen. “The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China’s economy will continue to struggle,” the analysts said in a note to clients. “As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.” Investors will get a chance to check the U.S. economic pulse later Friday when the government releases third-quarter GDP data. ANZ analysts highlighted weak U.S. core durable goods data as suggesting that “investment is not taking off, even with the apparent tailwind from tax cuts and USD repatriation.” “This indicates that the boost to GDP growth from the fiscal stimulus could be fairly transitory,” the analysts said. In currency markets, the euro edged lower, extending weakness after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank’s 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union’s economic and political future. The single currency was 0.03 percent lower at $1.1371. The dollar was off 0.11 percent against the yen at 112.29 . The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was 0.04 percent lower at 96.636. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 3.1092 percent compared with its U.S. close of 3.136 percent on Thursday. Oil prices gave up some ground after earlier rising on signals from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister that there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles. U.S. crude dipped 0.74 percent at $66.83 a barrel. Brent crude fell 0.49 percent to $76.51 per barrel. Spot gold was down slightly at $1,230.90 per ounce.

Singapore refining margins DUB-SIN-REF, the benchmark profits for Asian oil processors, rose to $7.99 a barrel on Aug. 15, the highest since margins rebounded in July, supported by rising demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The profits from refining a barrel of benchmark Dubai crude into fuel currently stands at $5.23 a barrel. Asian gasoil margins hit their highest in more than three years on Wednesday, pushed higher by lower supplies in region and expectations for increased gasoil demand as consumers move to meet stricter marine fuel regulations. “The seasonal demand growth and limited capacity expansions in Asia Pacific will further boost the refining margin,” the refiner, whose top shareholder is Saudi Aramco, said in an earnings statement. The company said heating oil demand will increase refining margins as winter approaches. S-Oil posted a 42.9 percent decline in operating profit to 316 billion won ($277.67 million) for the July-September period, due to reduced inventory-related gains and despite improved refining margins. Operating profit was down from 553 billion won in the same period a year earlier. The company also said its new residue fuel oil and olefin plants, known as the residue upgrading complex and olefin downstream complex (ODC), are expected to begin commercial operations in November. The new units will churn out 405,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of polypropylene, 300,000 TPA of propylene oxide, and 21,000 barrels per day of gasoline. “Commercial operations of the RUC-ODC project are expected to contribute to Q4 earnings .... (their) stable operations are secured at maximum designed capacity,” company treasurer Shin Kwan-bae said in a call with analysts. Shares of S-Oil were down 3.5 percent by 0207 GMT after the earnings announcement, while the wider market was 1.1 percent lower.

2018-10-26,"TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Friday and were heading for a third weekly loss after Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said the market could be heading into oversupply, as growth concerns took a hit with a slump in global equities this week. Brent crude futures were down 45 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $76.44 a barrel by 0140 GMT. The global benchmark is heading for a weekly loss of 4.2 percent. U.S. crude was down 56 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $66.77 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark is heading for a 3.4 percent loss this week. Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said on Thursday the oil market could face oversupply in the fourth quarter. “The market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks,” Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said there could be a need for intervention to reduce oil stockpiles after increases in recent months. Falls in stock markets have roiled oil prices this week as Wall Street had its biggest daily decline since 2011 Financial markets have been hit hard by a range of worries, including the U.S.-China trade war, a rout in emerging market currencies, rising borrowing costs and bond yields, as well as economic concerns in Italy. U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose last week for the fifth consecutive week, while gasoline and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said this week. Supporting the bearish mood was a report that showed rising inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery hub for U.S. crude futures. Cushing crude stocks rose to 33 million barrels on Tuesday, up almost 1.8 million barrels from the previous week, traders said, citing a report by market intelligence firm Genscape.

2018-10-26,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OMUNht By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has so far resisted pressure to soften or postpone the implementation of new regulations requiring ships to use bunker fuels with a lower sulphur content from the start of 2020. That has prompted warnings from some analysts that the regulations will squeeze the availability of low-sulphur diesel and jet kerosene required by trucks, trains, aircraft, farmers and industry, resulting in big price increases. The regulations and any associated rise in fuel prices will occur in the run up to the next U.S. presidential election so there is considerable political sensitivity around the timing and cost of the changes. But most IMO members are confident there will be enough low-sulphur fuel available to meet the needs of both the shipping industry and other users of middle distillates without an unacceptable spike in prices. From Jan. 1, 2020, ships will be required to use fuel oil containing no more than 0.5 percent sulphur, down from a maximum of 3.5 percent at present, and an actual average of around 2.5 percent. Ships operating in emission control areas in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, most of the coast of Canada and the United States, and parts of the Caribbean are already subject to a lower limit of 0.1 percent, which will not change. Reduced sulphur limits for the rest of the world were originally approved by IMO members in 2008 and the deadline was reconfirmed following a fuel availability assessment in 2016. A detailed study of the fuel market commissioned by the IMO before it confirmed the deadline examined multiple scenarios for marine fuel consumption and production at the end of the decade. The study concluded that “in all scenarios the refinery sector has the capability to supply sufficient quantities of marine fuels … to meet demand for these products while also meeting demand for non-marine fuels”. Capacity increases in crude distillation as well as sulphur-removing hydrocracking and hydroprocessing would be enough to meet increased demand for low-sulphur distillates and fuel oil (“Assessment of fuel oil availability”, CE Delft, 2016). Others in the industry have been less sanguine about the availability of sufficient low-sulphur fuel for both marine and inland users and warned about price increases. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency assessed the new regulations would divert around 200,000-250,000 barrels per day of low sulphur distillate from other uses to the shipping industry. The agency warned diesel prices might have to rise by as much as 20-30 percent to achieve the necessary consumption reduction in other sectors (“Oil 2018: analysis and forecasts to 2023”, IEA, March 2018). This week, the agency presented a less worrying scenario to the IMO, suggesting diesel availability may be “less stretched” owing to slower global growth and a shift away from diesel in key economies. Diesel demand is slowing in Europe and may be hitting a plateau in China while slower trade growth will also ease some pressure on diesel markets (“An analysis of the IMO 2020 sulphur limit”, IEA, Oct 2018). Even so, airlines have started to warn the switch will put upward pressure on jet fuel prices next year (“Airlines face rising fuel costs, blame cruise ships”, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 22). And some major shipping flag states, including the United States, worried about the impact on fuel costs, have been lobbying for “an experience-building phase” that would inform the implementation of the sulphur cap (“U.S. seeks late change to sulphur-cap rules”, Financial Times, Oct. 23). The global shipping industry accounted for 46 percent of heavy fuel oil and 5 percent of gasoil used worldwide in 2012. Under IMO rules, ship owners have two routes to comply with the reduced sulphur caps: switch consumption to fuels containing less sulphur or install exhaust gas cleaning systems commonly known as scrubbers. Installing scrubbers involves a large upfront cost of several million dollars per ship but will allow them to continue burning cheaper high-sulphur fuel oil (capital investment to lower operating costs). Switching consumption to lower-sulphur fuels avoids upfront costs but locks owners into buying more expensive fuels, lowering capital investment but raising operating costs. The IMO’s consultants forecast that around 3,800 ships would be fitted with scrubbers by the start of January 2020. They predicted most ship owners would leave installations until 2018/19 to delay capital costs as late as possible and avoid incurring costs until they could take advantage of discounted high-sulphur fuel oil. These forecasts appear reasonably accurate. By 2020, around 4,000 ships will be fitted with scrubbers, on the most recent estimate by Norwegian consulting firm DNV GL. A total of 1,850 vessels have already been fitted with scrubbers, according to a report issued by the firm on Oct. 10. Some 716 scrubbers were installed or confirmed this year, nearly double the 368 reported in 2017, it said. The number is forecast to soar to 1,735 in 2019 and remain at similar rates into 2020. Vessels that do not install scrubbers, will be required to buy fuel certified as containing less than 0.5 percent sulphur from Jan. 1, 2020, and will likely be banned from carrying any fuel over this limit after March 1. One option will be to buy heavy fuel oil with reduced sulphur content. Another will be to switch to low-sulphur marine gasoil. A third will be to switch to a blended fuel designed to bring average sulphur levels under the cap. All these options are likely to add to the fuel bills for ship owners, which they will seek to pass on to charterers and freight companies. But the main concern focuses on how many ship owners will switch to using marine gasoil, which is essentially the same product as road diesel, distillate fuel oil, and jet fuel. Large-scale switching will put ship owners in direct competition with motorists, haulage firms, railroads, farmers, airlines and the heating oil industry for the same molecules, pushing up prices for all of them. Because so much distillate is used in industry and freight transportation, distillate consumption is heavily geared towards the economic cycle. Distillate markets have been relatively tight in 2018 and were expected to tighten further in 2019 assuming the economic expansion continues. As the IEA notes, however, there has recently been some shift away from diesel among European motorists following the emissions cheating scandal and consumption growth may also be moderating in China. More importantly, the global economic and trade cycle shows increasing signs of maturity and may move into a more moderate phase over the next 12 months. Refiners have also undertaken extensive expansions and upgrades to reduce their production of high-sulphur residuals and increase output of IMO-compliant fuel oil and gasoil. Having made expensive investments, many refiners and bunkering firms have urged the IMO to press ahead with the introduction of the new sulphur cap. There are still concerns about the potential impact on gasoil availability and prices in 2020. In 2008, gasoil prices moved briefly to a premium of almost $40 per barrel over Brent, in part because of concerns about availability. So far, gasoil cracks for fuel delivered in January 2020, the first month after the sulphur cap is introduced, have risen from a recent low of $12 per barrel to almost $19. The discount for high-sulphur fuel oil delivered in January 2020 has widened from $16 in August 2017 to around $33 (tmsnrt.rs/2OMUNht). The big margin between gasoil and high-sulphur fuel prices is necessary to ensure at least some vessel owners switch to scrubbers. The risk of future price spikes cannot be ruled out. But so far, the price mechanism appears to be working as intended.
