2019-01-24,"(Adds details, Portuguese community) LISBON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said on Thursday the only way for Venezuela to overcome its political crisis is by holding free elections. Speaking to reporters after the government’s weekly cabinet meeting, Santos Silva also called for the restoration of Venezuela’s parliament. “We request that the liberty and integrity of all members of parliament be restored,” he said, adding that it is time for President Nicolas Maduro to “understand that time is up”. Portugal has a special interest in Venezuela because there are an estimated 200,000 Portuguese living there and more than a million descendents of Portuguese emigrants. “Portugal has to guarantee the safety of the Portuguese community living there,” said Santos Silva, offering the country’s help “to facilitate the internal policy process”. Late last year, as social strife started in Venezuela, Lisbon encouraged Portuguese to return home, including opening a special 50 million euro credit line to business owners who considered coming back. In Venezuela, the opposition was seeking on Thursday to maintain pressure on an isolated Maduro after congress chief Juan Guaido swore himself in as interim head of state with the support of nations around the region.

2019-01-24,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Thousands of Belgian school children skipped classes on Thursday to flood Brussels in an unprecedented protest against global warming and pollution, vowing to miss school once a week until the government takes action. Students banging drums and carrying signs decrying man-made climate change gathered around the European Parliament. Police said the 35,000-strong gathering was the biggest turnout of recent times for a student protest in the Belgian capital, which is also home to European Union institutions. “If we skip every Thursday, if we don’t go to school, the big people in our country and in the world will see that this is a problem,” said high school student Joppe Mathys.  Another student held a sign saying: “Be part of the solution, not the pollution.”  A nine-year-old girl, who gave her name only as Lalla and was with her teacher, said it was time people stopped driving cars and walked and cycled instead.  “Dinosaurs thought they had time too,” read one banner. Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere said the student demonstration was the biggest in recent memory. Broad protests started across Belgium on Dec. 2 with a “Claim the Climate” march, when over 65,000 demonstrators called for Belgian and European leaders to adopt ambitious climate policies in line with goals set by the Paris agreement in 2015.  That demonstration came before the COP24 U.N. climate summit in Poland, where a report was released ranking Belgium 31 out of 60 on the 2019 Climate Change Performance Index, or a “medium” performance in implementing the Paris agreements.  Brussels has been regularly ranked as one of the most congested cities in western Europe in recent years due to Belgium’s high population density and large number of commuters. That is also a mark of shame for a capital where the EU sets European climate policies. Across the EU, road congestion costs the bloc one percent of its annual economic output, or 100 billion euros (87 billion pounds) per year, according to the European Commission.

2019-01-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices this year will be influenced primarily by the health of the global economy, which is why prices have closely tracked equity and bond markets in recent months. U.S. shale production growth, the policy of OPEC and its allies, U.S. sanctions on Iran, and the threat of sanctions on Venezuela may all have an impact on the price of a barrel. But that impact will be secondary and it is more likely to be crude prices that determine what happens with U.S. shale, OPEC+ policy and U.S. sanctions. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TbHKnA) Predict what will happen to the global economy and the movement of oil prices in 2019 should become clear (“Weakening global expansion amid growing risks”, International Monetary Fund, Jan. 21). Business sentiment is buckling under pressure from the deteriorating relationship between the United States and China, as well as tightening financial conditions in the form of higher borrowing costs and falling equity prices. The global economic expansion has been losing momentum since the middle of last year, and there are signs the slowdown has worsened in recent months, with risks skewed to the downside. So oil consumption, especially middle distillates such as diesel, which are closely linked to freight transportation and industrial activity, is likely to grow more slowly in 2019. Lower crude prices and the introduction of new pollution regulations on shipping fuels will offset some of the implied slowdown, but consumption growth is still set to slacken. The extent of the slowdown depends on whether global growth starts to accelerate again, settles into an extended soft patch, or falls into an outright recession. The difference between each of these three scenarios amounts to several hundred thousand barrels per day (bpd) of consumption growth, dwarfing all other influences on oil prices in 2019. Much will depend on whether the United States and China can successfully de-escalate their economic conflict and whether financial conditions (including equity prices, yield curves and credit availability) ease. U.S. production of crude, lease condensates and gas liquids surged by more than 2 million bpd in 2018, the largest one-year increase reported in any single country in the history of the oil industry. The frenzied shale boom coupled with signs of slowing consumption growth and unexpectedly generous U.S. sanctions waivers on Iran’s oil exports to push the market towards a large surplus in the fourth quarter. The result has been a sharp drop in prices which has already prompted OPEC, and especially its principal member Saudi Arabia, to cut production sharply. Lower prices are also expected to moderate the growth in U.S. shale production this year and next, albeit after a delay, as the industry completes the large number of new wells started during the 2018 boom. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts growth in petroleum liquids supply will slow from 2.22 million bpd in 2018 to 1.73 million bpd in 2019 and 1.24 million bpd in 2020. But the speed and depth of any slowdown in U.S. shale production is uncertain and likely to depend critically on what happens to prices and thus the economy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have announced plans to cut their combined production by 1.2 million bpd to prevent the oil market from becoming oversupplied. The group’s early and aggressive production cuts appear to have removed much of the near-term surplus in the oil market and boosted sentiment. Hedge funds and other money managers have stopped selling futures and options linked to Brent crude and European gasoil and become small buyers of both since the start of the year. Spot Brent prices have found a floor above $60 per barrel, up from $50 in late December, and the structure of futures prices has swung from contango to level and even a small backwardation in the front-month. Higher spot prices and firmer calendar spreads have caused some OPEC policymakers to conclude the market rebalancing process is over. But if the global economy falls into an extended soft patch or even a recession, OPEC and its allies will probably have to make further cuts to prevent a surplus re-emerging. Likewise, if U.S. shale production does not slow as quickly as anticipated, OPEC+ will come under pressure to cut output further. On the other hand, if the economy grows strongly, and/or shale production slows sharply, the resulting market tightening will encourage OPEC+ to unwind some of its output restraints. Like the shale producers, OPEC’s production policy will ultimately be contingent on the health of the global economy and the rate of oil consumption growth in 2019. The United States has pledged progressively to tighten sanctions on Iran’s oil exports after the White House decided to pull out of the nuclear agreement reached in 2015. The first phase of sanctions has proved less aggressive than expected after the United States granted generous waivers to some of Iran’s largest customers in Asia. The White House seems to have responded to concerns about the lack of spare capacity in the oil market to replace exports lost from Iran and the resulting upward pressure on oil prices. U.S. policymakers have proved sensitive to the impact of higher oil prices on fuel costs for motorists and the state of the economy. But the initial waivers were granted for only six months so they will have to be extended, narrowed or terminated by May. Oil market analysts have speculated about whether the next round of waivers will be tougher or if they will be terminated completely. In practice, the last round provides a route-map for U.S. decision-making. White House decisions will be conditional on the availability of spare capacity and prices, which in turn makes them dependent on the state of the oil market and the economy. If the global economy remains sluggish, OPEC is still restricting output, and oil prices remain relatively low, the White House may take the opportunity to narrow the waivers or remove them altogether. If the global economy is accelerating, OPEC is unwinding its production cuts, and oil prices are rising again, the White House is likely to be less aggressive. The same considerations apply to possible U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports, which are likely to be contingent on the anticipated impact on prices and the availability of replacement capacity. In Venezuela’s case, there is an additional complication because there are few alternatives to the country’s heavy and diesel-rich crudes. Venezuela’s heavy crude cannot be replaced by light U.S. shale production. If the United States decides to impose primary and/or secondary sanctions on Venezuela’s exports, alternative supplies will have to come from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq. Spare capacity in these countries may not be enough to cover for tough sanctions on both Iran and Venezuela at the same time while leaving enough to absorb further shocks. Like everything else, the severity of sanctions on Iran and Venezuela depends on the state of the oil market and the economic outlook. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2019-01-24,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has approved the start of a 1.9 trillion ruble ($29 billion) modernization plan for domestic power plants, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday. Power is one of the most competitive sectors in Russia, with state players, private investors and firms such as Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI) (ENRU.MM), Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE) and Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE).   The 2022-2031 modernization covers 41 gigawatts, a sixth of Russia’s existing power plant capacity, and will replace an earlier state-backed program where investors were given the opportunity to build the new capacity.  Investors will bid to take part in selected upgrades and granted 16-year agreements with customers who will pledge to pay higher prices in exchange to the access to the capacity.  Moscow will require them to use Russia-produced equipment for the upgrades which would involve replacement of turbines, boilers, steam-power units, among other parts, in “up to 100 percent” of cases, Novak told reporters.  Using Russian equipment may be a challenge. Russia began building two power stations in Crimea to provide electricity to the peninsula which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, but the facilities became embroiled in a row over sanctions. German engineering firm Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has said Russia clandestinely delivered several of its turbines to Crimea, despite European sanctions which ban the supply of energy technology to Crimea.  Russia’s energy ministry says the turbines were not from Siemens, but were modernized turbines that were the work of Russian specialists and were Russian equipment. Russia partially launched both power stations in Crimea last year but has delayed the timing for them to reach full capacity.  Tekhnopromeksport, the engineering firm building the plants, said last month it had requested the full launch be pushed back until spring, citing issues with the supply of equipment and problems with subcontractors and infrastructure.  Russia wants the new program to be a catalyst for local producers, including subsidiaries of foreign firms, to create domestic versions of the global power sector equipment, cutting Moscow’s reliance on Western suppliers.

The CBI case is the latest twist in a saga that has dogged ICICI and its former chief executive for months and was instrumental in her decision to step down at the Indian bank last October. The agency alleges that ICICI Bank, under Kochhar, sanctioned “high value” loans to Videocon Industries, violating the bank’s lending policies, in exchange for an investment by the consumer electronics company’s owner in a business headed by Kochhar’s husband. In the first information report (FIR), a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, the CBI said it might also investigate current and former ICICI group officials, including CEO Sandeep Bakshi, who were a part of the loan sanctioning committee. The CBI also filed a case against Venugopal Dhoot, the managing director of the Videocon group and two of Videocon’s subsidiaries. Former CEO Kochhar has been accused of cheating ICICI of 17.3 billion rupees ($243.2 million), now classed by the bank as non-performing assets. The CBI accused Kochhar of dishonesty and “abusing her official position” by sanctioning the loan to Videocon. The FIR said that Kochhar, through the bank’s sanctioning committee, extended credit lines worth 32.5 billion rupees to various entities of the Videocon group in breach of lending policies prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India. The CBI also alleges that Dhoot made a 640 million rupee investment in Nupower Renewables, a company headed by Kochhar’s husband. Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot were not immediately reachable for comment. ICICI Bank did not respond to requests for comment and Videocon officials were not reachable for comment. Earlier in the day the CBI raided multiple locations owned by Videocon Industries and Nupower, a CBI source said.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When the global oil industry held its biggest annual gathering this week in the Swiss town of Davos, it had two key topics on its agenda - climate change and pressure from investors. The conclusion of the discussions was worrying for those present - pressure is rising and the industry is losing a battle not to be seen as one of the world’s biggest evils. The answer? Lure investors with higher returns and raise the PR game. “There is no doubt - and there is a consensus coming here in various meetings in Davos - that our industry is literally under siege and the future of oil is at stake,” said Mohammed Barkindo, secretary-general of oil producer group OPEC. “The industry needs to come together and respond positively with facts and figures. We are not shying away from the fact that we have not been able to communicate well,” Barkindo said. The industry gathered on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, holding a series of closed-door meetings. The chief of oil giant Chevron, Michael Wirth, held discussions with bosses from BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, Total and Aramco for the first time as U.S. companies joined European and Middle Eastern peers in debating climate change. Darren Woods, head of the biggest U.S. oil firm, Exxon Mobil, was absent. The climate change debate has split the oil industry over the past decade. While U.S. majors took an initially soft approach towards global warming, Shell had urged that the industry be held responsible not only for its own emissions, but also for those of consumers. Linked to that debate was pressure from investors urging the oil industry to help tackle climate change, with some pension funds including that of Norway saying they would stop investing in the stocks of oil companies. The oil industry has repeatedly tried to explain that if it stops investing in new projects, the world will face an energy shortage and price spikes because renewables and nuclear energy cannot meet rising energy demand as the global population grows. “How do you get the hearts and minds of investors back? That is a real challenge for our industry,” said John Hess, the founder of independent U.S. producer Hess Corp. He said investor frustration with the oil industry was manifested by the fact that the share of energy companies in the S&P index had shrunk to 5.5 percent, from 16 percent 10 years ago. “We will have to compete against other industries in the S&P to create the value proposition that makes us more attractive. A new paradigm is coming up which is to generate free cash and share some of this cash with investors,” he said. The U.S. oil industry has been booming in recent years but investors have been frustrated by heavy debts and a lack of free cash flow and dividends. However, even European oil majors such as Shell and BP, which pay billions of dollars in dividends, have struggled to remain popular with investors. “We need to engage with policymakers and the public to understand the huge task we have ahead,” Hess said. BP chief Bob Dudley said the industry needed to explain the challenge of producing and making energy affordable for an increasing global population, which will see energy use rising 30 percent by 2040. “You cannot just tax energy-intensive industries and not the users of energy and think you’re going to solve the problem. People need to use less energy. Philosophically, trying to look at emissions across the entire value chain is critical,” Dudley told Reuters. The head of state-run Saudi oil giant Aramco, Amin Nasser, said investors would ultimately differentiate between cleaner and more polluting companies. Aramco wants to list its stock sometime after 2021 in what could become the world’s largest initial public offering. Nasser said the latest research by Stanford University found Aramco was the cleanest major oil company in the world thanks to zero gas flaring and modern field technology. He said oil companies could help cut emissions by end users but should not ultimately be responsible for them. “We have to look at what we control. I have control of what I send to the grid in Saudi Arabia. But we do not have control over factories in Europe,” Nasser said. “However, it doesn’t mean we don’t care about end users. As a company we are looking at what we can do to increase the efficiency of end users,” he said. Aramco invests in research to make cars more efficient, increase mileage per gallon and the use of hydrogen in cars. It recently acquired high-end rubber producer Arlanxeo to help reduce tyre friction. “We need to boost efficiency or get rid of CO2 by technology,” Nasser said.

2019-01-24,"PARIS (Reuters) - French liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports soared last year as Australia, the U.S. and Russia brought more LNG to world markets, French gas network operator GRTgaz said on Thursday.  In 2018, France imported 117 terawatt hours (TWh) of LNG, the highest level in seven years, as shipments rose 13 TWh or 45 percent at the Montoir LNG terminal in Brittany and 2 TWh or 25 percent at the Dunkirk terminal in northern France. Imports at the Fos terminal on the Mediterranean coast were unchanged.  “LNG has come back,” said GRTgaz director Thierry Trouve told reporters.  Trouve said that new LNG gasification plants in Australia and the U.S. - as well as shipments from Russia’s Yamal plant - had reduced the price difference between LNG in Europe and Asia, as well as between LNG and pipeline gas. “While all this new LNG may not necessarily come to France - we saw no shipments from Australia, for instance - it means that more LNG from the Middle East comes to Europe,” he said.  French gas imports through pipelines - mainly from Norway, the Netherlands and Russia - in 2018 fell slightly by 7 TWh to 447 TWh, he said.  Gas transit shipments to Switzerland and Italy, at 33 TWh, were the highest in six years as problems with a German pipeline meant that more gas went via French pipes, but shipments to Spain were down 12 TWh or 27 percent. Trouve said this illustrated why French and Spanish energy regulators earlier this week rejected the STEP project to boost cross-Pyrenees gas interconnection capacity.  “For years, the Spanish argued this project would save France and Europe from a Ukraine crisis as gas from Spain would provide security of supply for the rest of Europe,” Trouve said.  He said the cross-Pyrenees flow of gas was mostly from north to south and that in the south-north direction the pipelines were not saturated.  “We don’t see the need for this project,” he added. French gas consumption fell five percent to 442 terawatt hour (TWh) in 2018 compared with the previous year due to high temperatures and less use of gas-fired power generators.  Industrial gas demand rose for the fifth year in a row as more industries switched from oil and coal power generation to gas, GRTgaz said, adding that conversion to gas power generation represented 2.5 TWh of consumption.

2019-01-24,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Top German carmakers and industrial companies are looking to acquire regional licences to run 5G mobile networks, as they plan futuristic connected factories that could help Europe’s largest economy keep its export edge in the digital era. The federal network regulator, the BNetzA, will offer regional licences on relatively easy terms for spectrum in the 3.8 Gigahertz and 26 Gigahertz range. This is suited, for example, to building dedicated networks for industrial complexes and research campuses that German companies are developing under the Industrie 4.0 drive to modernise and automate manufacturing. 5G offers data-transmission speeds up to 100 times faster than existing 4G LTE networks, as well as ultra-low latency - or reaction times. It’s also superior to existing local networks that run on Wifi. The allocation of regional licences will run alongside what is expected to be a competitive nationwide 5G licence auction that could see the entry of a fourth operator in the form of 1&1 Drillisch, a unit of United Internet. Submissions are due on Friday.  “We can’t wait for the network operators to be ready - we are in the midst of Industrie 4.0,” said a spokesman for Siemens, the industrial conglomerate based in Munich. Here is an overview of companies that say they plan to apply for a regional 5G licence: VOLKSWAGEN (VOWG_p.DE) - the world’s largest carmaker by volume is planning to apply for 5G spectrum so that it can run networks “inside the factory fence”. Volkswagen’s premium car unit Audi is already working with Swedish network equipment supplier Ericsson to test a 5G laboratory that is exploring networked, digital production methods. DAIMLER - the luxury carmaker says it will apply for a regional licence. In partnership with a network provider, it will deploy 5G with a view to implementing “smart” production methods through which equipment and machinery can communicate directly at high speeds and with low latency. BASF - the German chemicals giant will apply for a local 5G licence as part of its drive to digitalise production. The company has 600,000 networked sensors and other devices at its main production facility in Ludwigshafen on the Rhine, a figure the company says could easily rise tenfold. “That’s why we need 5G,” said a spokeswoman. In addition, staff are being issued with tablets and virtual-reality goggles to guide them on maintenance jobs - another use that works better with 5G. ROBERT BOSCH [ROBG.UL] - the privately-held automotive supplier will apply for local licences, subject to conditions, to power its production facilities. These would connect robots, automatic transport systems and other production aids such as augmented or virtual reality. Bosch is reviewing whether to run its own 5G networks or to do so with vendor partners. SIEMENS - the industrial conglomerate says it is interested in acquiring regional 5G licences, for example for its Siemennstadt production facility in Berlin or its plant in Erlangen. 5G is vital to make it possible for the machinery and equipment to communicate directly. Here Siemens offers a platform called Mindsphere that can manage and analyse industrial processes and propose ways to improve efficiency.

2019-01-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Thursday after a choppy trading day, while U.S. Treasuries were in demand after the European Central Bank chief said economic growth was likely to be weaker than expected and with the United States was far from a China trade deal. Demand increased for safe-haven assets with U.S. Treasury 10-year yields hitting a one-week low, due to anxiety about slowing global growth and trade. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC Washington was “miles and miles” from resolving trade issues with China. [US/] The euro touched its lowest point against the dollar in six weeks after ECB President Mario Draghi left interest rates unchanged, saying near-term data is likely to be hit by fallout from factors including China’s slowdown and Brexit. On top of the U.S.-China trade war and its global effects investors also worried about the economic impact of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, now in its 34th day. “A lack of meaningful progress on the government shutdown and trade talks with China and global growth concerns off the ECB President’s talk this morning are suggestive of the muted market we’re seeing today,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago. With so much uncertainty, Larson said a market pause seems appropriate since the S&P 500 has recouped roughly half the ground it lost in a late 2018 sell-off. [.N]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.38 points, or 0.09 percent, to 24,553.24, the S&P 500 gained 3.63 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,642.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.70 points, or 0.68 percent, to 7,073.46. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.22 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. Earlier data showed last week’s applications for U.S. unemployment benefits falling to a more than 49-year low though claims for several states including California were estimated. While the data was encouraging, Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Delaware said it was only a matter of time before a continued shutdown would do “irreparable damage” to the economy. The shutdown and U.S.-China trade war are adding pressure to global economies, he said. Two bills to end the partial U.S. government shutdown - one backed by Republicans and one by Democrats - failed to win enough votes in the Senate as lawmakers eyed other potential compromises to end the impasse with the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.38 points, or 0.09 percent, to 24,553.24, the S&P 500 gained 3.63 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,642.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.70 points, or 0.68 percent, to 7,073.46. Nasdaq was supported by strength in chipmaker and airline stocks after earnings reports.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent on the day. The euro was 0.7 percent lower against the dollar at $1.13, after falling as low as $1.129, its weakest since Dec. 14.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was up 0.43 percent at 96.538.

2019-01-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on the U.S. nuclear power regulator approved a stripped down safety rule on Thursday that removes the need for  nuclear plants to take extra measures based on recent science to protect against hazards such as floods and earthquakes.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a board with three Republican seats and two Democratic seats, approved the rule on a 3-2 vote along party lines. Dissents are rare on the NRC and the two members who hold Democratic seats strongly disagreed with the approval.  They said the Republican decision could allow plants to avoid protections against risks of natural disasters that have become apparent with science methods that have evolved since most plants were built about 40 years ago.    A draft rule that included the measures was formed following the 2011 nuclear disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant that was damaged by an earthquake and tsunami, forcing more than 160,000 people from their homes. The draft was presented to the commission in 2016. Commissioner Jeff Baran, a Democrat, said NRC staff had included the extra safety measures in the draft after years of work, but Republicans had jettisoned them.  “Instead of requiring nuclear power plants to be prepared for the actual flooding and earthquake hazards that could occur at their sites, the NRC will allow them to be prepared only for the old out-of-date hazards typically calculated decades ago when the science of seismology and hydrology was far less advanced than it is today,” Baran said after the vote. Stephen Burns, a registered independent whom former President Barack Obama appointed to a Democratic seat on the commission, also voted against the measure.  NRC Chairman Kristine Svinicki, a Republican, said after the vote that the commission’s work since 2011 has resulted in “tangible safety improvements at every U.S. nuclear power plant.” Svinicki said that although the Democrats were concerned that the rule ignores flooding and earthquake hazards, “in the view of the commission majority this is not the case.” Regulations already in place already address the issues, she added. A nuclear power safety advocate said new information showed that plants may experience bigger floods and earthquakes than they are now required to withstand, and that it is possible the commission will not require nuclear plants that face greater hazards to make upgrades.  “Nuclear plants must be protected against the most severe natural disasters they could face today - not those estimated 40 years ago,” said Edwin Lyman, acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

2019-01-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The partial U.S. government shutdown is threatening to delay the roll-out of new vehicle models in the United States by stalling required certifications from the Environmental Protection Agency, automakers said. The shutdown, at 34 days the longest in history, has left over 800,000 federal agency workers without pay and had an impact on everything from access to national parks to airline security screening to the release of economic data. Some 95 percent of EPA staff has been furloughed, including those at the lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan, responsible for verifying emissions data for new automotive models to ensure they comply with clean air laws. GM has not yet had any vehicle launch delays but “like other automakers, we are currently awaiting decisions in the certification process for a few model year 2019 and 2020 vehicles,” spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said at the Detroit Auto Show last week that the shutdown had delayed final certification of FCA’s new RAM 3500 heavy-duty pickup truck, one of its most profitable segments. Ford Motor Co officials said some vehicles could be delayed if the government shutdown goes another 30 days.     “As the shutdown continues, these certification delays will affect U.S. vehicle production. Consumers will also not have access to the latest technologies and sales could decline as a result,” industry trade group Global Automakers told Reuters. The EPA declined to comment. Former acting administrator of the EPA, Stanley Meiburg, noted the agency’s certification process was central to discovering Volkswagen’s past efforts to cheat on emissions. Automakers tend to seek certifications well in advance of releasing them to the market - meaning a delayed certification does not always impact the roll-out schedule. But the issue could become more serious if the shutdown lingers for much longer, Meiburg said.  “Any disruptions to this part of the process will disrupt the entire supply chain,” he said. Republican President Donald Trump has refused to sign any legislation to fund an array of government agencies unless it includes $5.7 billion (£4.4 billion) for his proposed wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.  Democrats argue that a wall is costly, and there are better ways to shore up national security and curb illegal immigration.

2019-01-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose by 1 percent on Thursday, boosted by the U.S. threat of sanctions on Venezuela, but gains were capped by record high gasoline inventories and an unexpected big build in crude stocks in the United States. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 51 cents to settle at $53.13 a barrel, a 0.97 percent gain. Brent crude futures fell 5 cents to settle at $61.09 a barrel.  Washington signaled it could impose sanctions on Venezuela’s crude exports as Caracas descends further into political and economic turmoil. The threat to reduce supplies supported futures prices. The United States, the top importer of Venezuelan crude, is seeking to ensure that the OPEC member’s oil revenue goes to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who swore himself in as interim president, and to cut off money from President Nicolas Maduro, a top U.S. official said on Thursday. “The breakdown in diplomatic relations was interpreted as upping the possibility of a U.S. sanction on Venezuelan oil that would likely force U.S. refiners to seek alternative supplies at higher prices, hence the WTI gains,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Venezuelan oil is predominantly heavy crude, which requires extensive refining. It is frequently blended with lighter crudes to give refiners higher-value products. With Iran already crippled by U.S. sanctions, a drop in Venezuelan exports could squeeze global supply further.  Geneva-based Petro-Logistics said on its website that Iranian crude and condensate exports in December “fell steeply” from November to less than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) due to U.S. sanctions - lower than some other estimates. Both Brent and WTI are both backed by light, sweet crudes, and are not directly linked to Venezuelan oil. But concern about the supply of heavy crudes is apparent in the U.S. physical market, where the price for Mars Sour, a medium crude, shot to its highest since early 2011. Two of the world’s biggest commodities trading houses, Glencore and Mercuria Energy Group, predict more oil price volatility in coming months due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran. Weighing on oil futures, U.S. crude inventories sharply rose by 8 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday, versus forecasts for a decline of 42,000 barrels. Gasoline stocks rose for the eighth straight week to a record 259.7 million barrels, as demand for the motor fuel over the past four weeks fell 0.1 percent from a year ago.  “The report was rather bearish, punctuated by the large crude oil inventory increase,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management. “Gasoline demand remains anemic.”  Worries about the longer-term outlook for global economic growth, and therefore demand for crude, has pressured oil prices. Persistent concerns about the U.S-China trade war as well as slower world growth forecasts have kept investors wary.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - When the global oil industry held its biggest annual gathering this week in the Swiss town of Davos, it invited banking bosses and fund managers to discuss two key topics - climate change and pressure from investors.  The conclusion of the discussions was worrying for those present - pressure is rising and the industry is losing a battle not to be seen as one of the world’s biggest evils. The answer? Lure investors with higher returns and raise the PR game. “There is no doubt - and there is a consensus coming here in various meetings in Davos - that our industry is literally under siege and the future of oil is at stake,” said Mohammed Barkindo, secretary-general of oil producer group OPEC. “The industry needs to come together and respond positively with facts and figures. We are not shying away from the fact that we have not been able to communicate well,” Barkindo said. The industry gathered on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, holding a series of closed-door meetings. The chief of oil giant Chevron, Michael Wirth, had discussions with bosses from BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, Total and Aramco for the first time as U.S. companies joined European and Middle Eastern peers in debating climate change. Darren Woods, head of the biggest U.S. oil firm, Exxon Mobil, participated in the meeting via telephone.  The meetings were also attended by John Flint, chief of HSBC, Ron Mock, president of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and executives from investment firms Canyon Partners and ValueAct, two sources present at the discussions said. The climate change debate has split the oil industry over the past decade.  While U.S. majors took an initially soft approach toward global warming, Shell had urged that the industry be held responsible not only for its own emissions, but also for those of consumers. Linked to that debate was pressure from investors urging the oil industry to help tackle climate change, with some pension funds including that of Norway saying they would stop investing in the stocks of oil companies. The oil industry has repeatedly tried to explain that if it  stops investing in new projects, the world will face an energy shortage and price spikes because renewables and nuclear energy cannot meet rising energy demand as the global population grows. “How do you get the hearts and minds of investors back? That is a real challenge for our industry,” said John Hess, the founder of independent U.S. producer Hess Corp. He said investor frustration with the oil industry was manifested by the fact that the share of energy companies in the S&P index had shrunk to 5.5 percent, from 16 percent 10 years ago. “We will have to compete against other industries in the S&P to create the value proposition that makes us more attractive. A new paradigm is coming up which is to generate free cash and share some of this cash with investors,” he said. The U.S. oil industry has been booming in recent years but investors have been frustrated by heavy debts and a lack of free cash flow and dividends. However, even European oil majors such as Shell and BP, which pay billions of dollars in dividends, have struggled to remain popular with investors. “We need to engage with policymakers and the public to understand the huge task we have ahead,” Hess said.  BP chief Bob Dudley said the industry needed to explain the challenge of producing and making energy affordable for an increasing global population, which will see energy use rising 30 percent by 2040. “You cannot just tax energy-intensive industries and not the users of energy and think you’re going to solve the problem. People need to use less energy. Philosophically, trying to look at emissions across the entire value chain is critical,” Dudley told Reuters. The head of state-run Saudi oil giant Aramco, Amin Nasser, said investors would ultimately differentiate between cleaner and more polluting companies.  Aramco wants to list its stock sometime after 2021 in what could become the world’s largest initial public offering. Nasser said the latest research by Stanford University found Aramco was the cleanest major oil company in the world thanks to zero gas flaring and modern field technology. He said oil companies could help cut emissions by end users but should not ultimately be responsible for them. “We have to look at what we control. I have control of what I send to the grid in Saudi Arabia. But we do not have control over factories in Europe,” Nasser said. “However, it doesn’t mean we don’t care about end users. As a company we are looking at what we can do to increase the efficiency of end users,” he said. Aramco invests in research to make cars more efficient, increase mileage per gallon and the use of hydrogen in cars. It recently acquired high-end rubber producer Arlanxeo to help reduce tire friction. “We need to boost efficiency or get rid of CO2 by technology,” Nasser said.

2019-01-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued $72 million in civil penalties to polluters last year, the lowest level in at least two decades when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis of agency data. Environmental advocates called the level of fines a symptom of the Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda. The EPA rejected that assertion and said it was using “all the tools” at its disposal to deter pollution. The analysis, conducted by President Barack Obama’s former EPA assistant administrator, Cynthia Giles, and first reported by the Washington Post, showed civil fines for polluters during 2018 at $72 million, the lowest level since at least 1994. Over the previous 20 years, EPA had issued a wide range of fine totals, ranging from a low of $86 million in 2007 to over $6 billion during Obama’s final year in office - a massive outlier because of a settlement the EPA finalized with BP (BP.L) over its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The median level of the EPA’s annual fines during that period was about $155 million, according to the data, which Giles shared with Reuters on Thursday. The Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group, blasted the EPA’s performance on enforcement under Republican President Donald Trump, saying it reflected the administration’s pro-fossil-fuel and de-regulation agenda. Trump was elected partly on a promise to revive the U.S. coal industry and boost oil and gas drilling, and he has been working to undo Obama-era environmental protections. “President Trump promised to reduce EPA to little tidbits during his campaign, so it should be no surprise to see enforcement of environmental laws he’s never liked decline on his watch,” Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former director of civil enforcement at the EPA. The EPA said it was not giving polluters any breaks, and cited a recent $305 million settlement with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU.N) over emissions violations. “Let there be no mistake — EPA enforcement will continue to correct non-compliance using all the tools at its disposal, including imposing civil penalties to maintain a level playing field and deter future misconduct,” said Susan Bodine, assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.

2019-01-24,"(Reuters) - A renewed nuclear arms race, rising greenhouse gas emissions and the emergence of state-sponsored disinformation campaigns have left the modern world as close to annihilation as it was at the height of the Cold War, atomic scientists said on Thursday. The Doomsday Clock, created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists as an indicator of the world’s susceptibility to apocalypse, remained at two minutes to midnight for a second year running in what the scientists called a dangerous “new abnormal.” “Though unchanged from 2018, this setting should be taken not as a sign of stability but as a stark warning to leaders and citizens around the world,” the Chicago-based group said in a statement. Humanity’s two simultaneous existential threats of nuclear war and climate change were exacerbated during the past year by the “increased use of information warfare to undermine democracy around the world,” the group said. “In many forums, including particularly social media, nationalist leaders and their surrogates lied shamelessly, insisting that their lies were truth, and the truth ‘fake news,’” it said. Since the election of U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016, the clock has closed in on midnight in successive 30-second moves in 2017 and 2018, in part because of escalating tensions with North Korea over its nuclear program. The last time the clock was as close to midnight as it has been in the past two years was in 1953, when the U.S.-Soviet arms race escalated as Moscow tested a hydrogen bomb in August after the detonation of an American H-bomb the previous November. Despite a softening of barbed rhetoric between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the past year, the group saw rising threats in nuclear-armed nations’ programs of “‘nuclear modernization’ that are all but indistinguishable from a worldwide arms race.” On climate, the group said carbon dioxide emissions resumed an upward climb in the past two years. To turn back the clock, it recommended steps including fortifying and extending U.S.-Russian nuclear treaties with limits on modernization programs, adopting safeguards to prevent peacetime military incidents along NATO countries’ borders, citizen demands for action on climate change and multilateral talks to discourage the misuse of information technology.  The bulletin was founded by scientists who helped develop the United States’ first atomic weapons. When the clock was created in 1947, it was set at seven minutes to midnight.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The global solar power industry is about to lose a major competitive windfall as prices of Chinese-made solar panels begin to recover after a collapse last year, the leader of one of the world’s top manufacturers said on Thursday. “The party if definitely over,” said Eric Luo, president of China’s GCL System Integration Technology Co, a top-10 maker of solar panels, feeding the fastest-growing renewable power sector. Solar panel prices tumbled around 30 percent last year after China, the world’s largest producer, cut subsidies to shrink its bloated solar industry, pushing smaller manufacturers to the brink of collapse. To raise cash and stay afloat, manufacturers cleared inventory and diverted sales offshore, sending prices into a downward spiral - offering up a windfall for solar power generators and investors in solar farms. Luo, speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos this week, said GCL’s vertically integrated business model cushioned it from the downturn in prices as its solar farms benefited from cheaper panels. The pain will mostly be felt by smaller Chinese producers, which lack international supply chains, triggering industry consolidation or forcing them to close, he added. Luo said solar panel prices were already stabilizing and he expected them to rebound by 10 to 15 percent as the Chinese industry consolidates over the next year or two. Given panels represent close to half of a solar farm’s installation costs, that threatens to eat into the returns of investors. China is home to almost a third of the world’s cumulative installed solar capacity and its manufacturers dominate the industry, despite being slapped with anti-dumping tariffs and getting caught up more recently in the U.S.-China trade war. In September, the European Union ended restrictions on the sale of Chinese solar panels but Washington continues to impose an anti-dumping duty. They are also subject to President Donald Trump’s more recent hike to general tariffs on Chinese imports. GCL still counts the United States as a major market but is expanding rapidly in other markets, following in the wake of Beijing’s huge Belt and Road international development program, Luo said, adding that overseas business would account for 75 percent of GCL’s solar panel shipments this year. At home, Luo said China was rapidly nearing the point where the solar industry could operate without any form of subsidy. He said northwest China, where sun was more plentiful and land less expensive, had already reached that milestone. Most of the rest of the country would follow this year, before the age of subsidies ends completely in 2020, he said. “If you need subsidies (at that point), you just stop.”   Editing by Elaine Hardcastle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/davos-meeting-solar-gcl/davos-party-is-over-for-dirt-cheap-solar-panels-says-china-exec-idUKL3N1ZO4R6,24 Jan 2019,"The global solar

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Two of the world’s biggest commodities trading houses, Glencore and Mercuria Energy Group, predict more oil price volatility in coming months due to concerns about supplies from OPEC members Venezuela and Iran. The United States has reimposed sanctions on Iran, driving down Iranian oil exports, and has threatened to impose sanctions on Venezuela, whose oil producing has been sliding amid political turmoil and an economic crisis. “I would expect more volatility because of Venezuela. There is speculation about potential U.S. sanctions which could impact flows,” Mercuria Chief Executive Marco Dunand at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “If you add to Venezuela uncertainty about Iranian sanctions waivers, volatility should come back,” he said. Washington has granted temporary sanctions waivers, mainly to Asian nations, to allow them to continue importing some Iranian oil. Dunand said he expected oil prices to trade above $60 a barrel and said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would try to prevent them rising above $80. “OPEC is trying to work under a fairly narrow price band where consumers and producers are happy,” he said. Benchmark Brent crude was trading around $61 on Thursday. Glencore’s head of oil, Alex Beard, said he expected oil inventories to build in the first half of 2019 but to drawdown in the second half of 2019. “A lot will depend on Iranian waivers,” he said. “Saudi Arabia and Russia did a good job to manage the market last year.” Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/davos-meeting-oil-volatility/davos-oil-traders-see-more-price-volatility-on-venezuela-iran-idUKL8N1ZO6RA,24 Jan 2019,"Two of the world's

A nuclear power safety advocate said new information showed that plants may experience bigger floods and earthquakes than they are now required to withstand, and that it is possible the commission will not require nuclear plants that face greater hazards to make upgrades. “Nuclear plants must be protected against the most severe natural disasters they could face today - not those estimated 40 years ago,” when many plants were built, Edwin Lyman, acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said.

2019-01-24,"LAGOS (Reuters) - The leading female candidate in Nigeria’s presidential election said on Thursday she had withdrawn from the race weeks ahead of the poll to help build a coalition to provide a viable alternative to the country’s two main parties.  Former government minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in 2014, said on Twitter that she had been in talks for three months with other candidates about a coalition. Nigeria’s presidential election is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16. The main candidates in the race to head Africa’s top oil producing country are the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president who is representing the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP).    “I have decided to step down from the presidential race and focus on helping to build a coalition for a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the 2019 general,” said Ezekwesili in a tweet. Ezekwesili was not considered to be among the frontrunners in the race. Analysts see Buhari and Abubakar as the only genuine contenders due to the financial power and patronage networks provided by their parties.  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) later said it was “impossible” for a candidate to withdraw at this stage. “The last day for withdrawal by candidates or replacement of withdrawn candidates by political parties was 17th November, 2018. Therefore, the deadline for Ezekwesili or any candidate in that category to withdraw or be replaced has passed,” said INEC spokesman Rotimi Oyekanmi.  Ezekwesili was the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria, a little known party. Following her announcement the party said it would support Buhari’s re-election bid. The PDP ruled from 1999, when civilian rule began, until Buhari’s 2015 election win with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. The main contenders ahead of February’s poll have been in the public eye for decades - Buhari was a military ruler in the 1980s and Abubakar was vice president from 1999-2007.  Ezekwesili, a former government minister, is known more recently for her work as co-founder of ‘Bring Back Our Girls’, a campaign which seeks to raise awareness about some 270 girls who were kidnapped from their school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 by Boko Haram. Many of the girls managed to escape in the hours following their abduction or have been released in the last few years, but about 100 are still missing and their condition is unknown.

2019-01-24,"(Adds Erdogan quote, updates dateline) ANKARA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan phoned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to offer support, and said on Thursday he was shocked that Washington had backed the opposition leader’s move to declare himself interim leader. Socialist Maduro described Juan Guaido’s move a day earlier as a coup attempt. U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Guaido, as did Canada and right-leaning Latin American governments. “You will respect the results of elections. Trump’s remarks shocked me, as someone who believes in democracy,” Erdogan told a news conference in Ankara. “I called Maduro on the way back from Russia. I told (him) very clearly ‘Never allow anti-democratic developments. Stand tall’,” he said. Turkey has a long history of coups, most recently a failed putsch in 2016, thwarted by Erdogan supporters who took to the streets to fight the putschists. About 250 people were killed. Economic and political ties between Ankara and Caracas have grown stronger, with Erdogan criticising sanctions against Venezuela during a visit there last month, without directly mentioning the United States or President Donald Trump. Erdogan flew back on Wednesday night from a visit to Russia, which has also come out in support of Maduro. On Wednesday, Trump said he would use “the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy” after recognising Guaido as interim president and calling Maduro “illegitimate”. Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the United States and other Latin American countries have constantly meddled in Venezuela’s internal affairs. “There is an elected president and on the other hand the head of congress declares himself de facto president. Some countries recognised this. This may cause chaos,” Cavusoglu told the A Haber news channel. Many Turks voiced support for Maduro on social media using the hashtag, #WeAreMaduro. One posted an image of Maduro picking up a small Turkish flag and another one of him holding the flag of a historic Turkish clan. “You’re not alone, big-hearted man. Turkey is with you,” another wrote.

Speaking to reporters after the government’s weekly cabinet meeting, Santos Silva also called for the restoration of Venezuela’s parliament. “We request that the liberty and integrity of all members of parliament be restored,” he said, adding that it is time for President Nicolas Maduro to “understand that time is up”. Portugal has a special interest in Venezuela because there are an estimated 200,000 Portuguese living there and more than a million descendents of Portuguese emigrants. “Portugal has to guarantee the safety of the Portuguese community living there,” said Santos Silva, offering the country’s help “to facilitate the internal policy process”. Late last year, as social strife started in Venezuela, Lisbon encouraged Portuguese to return home, including opening a special 50 million euro credit line to business owners who considered coming back.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 24 (Reuters) - If you somehow missed the news about the killing of journalist  Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents and the global outcry that ensued, you might think Saudi Arabia is the darling of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The kingdom has sent one of its strongest delegations ever to the Swiss mountain resort and packed its top executives’ agendas with meetings with international peers. It has even managed to secure top Western businessmen for a panel debate on ‘Next Steps for Saudi Arabia’, where French oil major Total’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne and Morgan Stanley’s boss James Gorman will be sitting next to the Saudi finance and economy ministers. The Davos gathering in the Swiss Alps is a chance for the Saudis to try to put behind them months of intense criticism over the murder of Khashoggi, a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. His killing by a team of Saudi operatives provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of the crown prince, previously admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive. At Davos, the signs are that the damage control is working. Swiss President Ueli Maurer said on Wednesday his country has moved on, and wanted to build strong relations with Riyadh, a rich, oil-producing kingdom that is itself a major global investor. “We have long since dealt with the Khashoggi case... We have agreed to continue the financial dialogue and normalise relations again,” Maurer told Swiss news agency SDA. Western allies including some U.S. politicians have called on Riyadh to hold those responsible for the Khashoggi murder accountable. The Saudi public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects, as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis for a generation. So there had been doubts about Saudi Arabia’s status at Davos. After all, a number of A-list global investors stayed away from the Crown Prince’s annual Future Investment Initiative conference in October, overshadowed by the Saudi journalist’s death. Then, at a summit of the G20 big economies in Buenos Aires, leaders appeared to ignore Prince Mohammed on stage during the “family photo,” even if many went on to have closed-door bilateral meetings with him afterwards. But at Davos, the Saudi delegation had dozens of meetings and no Western investor pulled out, Saudi economy minister Mohammad Al Tuwaijri told Reuters on Wednesday. “On a day-to-day basis in Saudi Arabia it is business as usual. Our job as government is to make sure infrastructure, legal in particular, is stable. This transformation journey hopefully will attract investors,” Tuwaijri said. He said the probe into the killing needed time. The message he would take back to the crown prince was to “listen to the investors’ feedback”. Finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told CNBC it was “very unfortunate, what happened to Jamal” but also suggested to wait for the probe’s results and the trial. He also said the fact that a $7.5 billion Saudi bond was heavily oversubscribed earlier this month showed investors were regaining confidence. Latest Saudi data will show new foreign direct investment licences doubled last year from 377 in 2017, a Saudi government source said. The World Economic Forum has chosen two state Saudi companies – Aramco and Sabic - to be among its 100 strategic partners in 2019. Oil giant Aramco also plans to issue a mega bond this year and is looking to acquire gas assets in the United States, its chief executive told Reuters. In the future, Aramco still plans to list its stock sometime in 2021 in what could become the world’s largest initial public offering. One panel on press freedom in Davos discussed the murder of Khashoggi but no Saudi officials were seen attending it. Bill Browder, a critic of Vladimir Putin, who successfully pushed through some of the harshest U.S. sanctions against Russia for the killing of his lawyer, known as the Magnitsky Act, said the same sanctions should be applied to Saudi Arabia. “Until Mohammed bin Salman bears responsibility for this crime, there cannot be business as usual with Saudi Arabia,” Browder told Reuters.

Financial spreadbetters expect London’s FTSE Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to dip marginally when they open, with investors awaiting news from the European Central Bank’s first policy review of the year. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei average eased 0.1 percent. “There is no new news to buy, and there are no fresh triggers to sell. Investors are staying on the sidelines,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 climbed 0.5 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, taking positive cues from financial firms’ profits and the approval for a new technology board in Shanghai. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index rose 0.3 percent. On Wednesday, Wall Street ended slightly higher after a spate of upbeat earnings reports, including International Business Machines, but lingering concerns about trade tensions and the longest U.S. government shutdown ever limited the advance. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview the U.S. economy could see zero growth in the first three months if the partial government shutdown lasts for the whole quarter. Japan’s manufacturing growth stalled in January as export orders fell at the fastest pace in 2-1/2 years, a preliminary business survey showed Thursday, offering the latest sign of slower growth hitting a major developed economy. More companies warned of weakening demand in China, including South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc, the world’s second-biggest memory chipmaker, and Hyundai Motor. Analysts at Capital Economics warned that China’s economic slowdown looks set to be of a similar scale to that in 2015-16, though there are some significant differences so far, most notably less downward pressure on the yuan and no signs of major capital outflows. “Against a backdrop of various concerns about other economies, weakness in China adds to reasons to expect a marked global slowdown,” they wrote in a note. “Since China makes up 19 percent of the world economy, the slowdown this year compared to last will knock 0.2 percentage points off global growth.” President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States was doing well in trade talks with China, saying that China “very much wants to make a deal.” But sources familiar with the talks say the two sides are still far apart on key, structural elements critical for a deal. “Above all, (investors) are wary there’s a possibility that the economic slowdown will go on amid the uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade tension,” said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit. “In such circumstances, the likelihood is becoming a little bigger that a situation remains where it’s hard to buy stocks and the yen is likely to strengthen.” The ECB is widely expected to stay on hold at a policy meeting that ends later on Thursday, but may acknowledge a sharp slowdown in growth, raising the prospect that any further policy normalisation could be delayed. The ECB’s meeting will come a day after the Bank of Japan cut its inflation forecasts on Wednesday but maintained its massive stimulus programme, with Governor Haruhiko Kuroda warning of growing risks to the economy from trade protectionism and faltering global demand. The U.S. Federal Reserve will hold its first policy meeting of 2019 next week, with investors hoping for more clues on how patient it will be before raising interest rates again. Fed officials have left little doubt in recent weeks that they want to stop raising rates - at least for a while. In currency markets, the dollar was last off 0.1 percent against the yen, changing hands at 109.70 yen per dollar. , also in thin trade. The greenback hit a year-to-date high of 110.00 yen against the Japanese currency after the BOJ kept its policy on hold the previous day. Sterling hit a fresh 11-week high against the dollar, rising to $1.3094, on bets that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided if parliament exerts greater control over the process. The euro was basically flat at $1.1383. It has lost more than 1.5 percent since climbing to a three-month high of $1.1570 on Jan. 10. The Australian dollar suffered a setback when a hike in mortgage rates by one of the country’s major banks added to the case for a cut in official rates, even as domestic job data showed a still solid labour market. The Aussie dollar skidded to $0.7100, unwinding all of a data-inspired jump to $0.7168. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.746 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.755 percent on Wednesday. In commodity markets, oil prices declined on Thursday amid lingering concerns over slowing global economic growth that may limit fuel demand and after a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 0.5 percent to $52.38 a barrel, while Brent crude futures were last down 0.4 percent at $60.87. Gold held steady, supported by a softer dollar.

Benchmark palm prices will average 2,375 ringgit ($574.09) a tonne in 2019, up 3 percent from 2,308 ringgit last year, according to the median estimate from a poll of 18 analysts and industry players including planters, millers and refiners. “The price outlook in 2019 should be slightly better than in 2018 as the trees need to rest,” said an Indonesian planter, who estimates the country’s output will peak between June and September. “Indonesia’s production has been very strong since mid-2017 and production may take a breather this year.” The median estimate of the 9 poll respondents who answered questions specifically on Indonesia’s palm sector pegged the nation’s production at 43 million tonnes in 2019. That would be up slightly from the Indonesia Palm Oil Association’s 42-million-tonne estimate for 2018, but would mark slower growth than last year’s jump from 36.5 million tonnes in 2017. Output in No.2 producer Malaysia will rise to 20 million tonnes in 2019, based on the median estimates of 10 participants. They forecast production would peak between October and November. That would be only a marginal rise from 19.5 million tonnes in 2018, which respondents said was due to factors such as the ageing of trees. Indonesia and Malaysia together account for nearly 90 percent of global palm production. Growing demand for palm from biodiesel producers is expected to support prices this year, with the Indonesian and Malaysian governments pushing the use of biofuels. Indonesia in September required all diesel fuel used in the country to contain biodiesel, while Malaysia is set to increase the amount of biological ingredients that fuel must contain. “Peak stocks won’t mirror last year’s highs due to better export demand, higher domestic consumption for biodiesel and lower 2019 production,” said the planter in Indonesia. Survey respondents expect demand in key export markets to rise this year, largely driven by top-buyer India where import duties have been cut. India reduced import taxes at the start of the year, though the rates are still higher than before an initial hike from last March. However, downward pressure on prices for rival oilseed soybeans amid the Sino-U.S. trade war could also drag on palm markets in 2019, some of the respondents said.

That would be up slightly from the Indonesia Palm Oil Association’s 42-million-tonne estimate for 2018, but would mark slower growth than last year’s jump from 36.5 million tonnes in 2017. Output in No.2 producer Malaysia will rise to 20 million tonnes in 2019, based on the median estimates of 10 participants. They forecast production would peak between October and November. That would be only a marginal rise from 19.5 million tonnes in 2018, which respondents said was due to factors such as the ageing of trees. Indonesia and Malaysia together account for nearly 90 percent of global palm production. Growing demand for palm from biodiesel producers is expected to support prices this year, with the Indonesian and Malaysian governments pushing the use of biofuels. Indonesia in September required all diesel fuel used in the country to contain biodiesel, while Malaysia is set to increase the amount of biological ingredients that fuel must contain. “Peak stocks won’t mirror last year’s highs due to better export demand, higher domestic consumption for biodiesel and lower 2019 production,” said the planter in Indonesia. Survey respondents expect demand in key export markets to rise this year, largely driven by top-buyer India where import duties have been cut. India reduced import taxes at the start of the year, though the rates are still higher than before an initial hike from last March. However, downward pressure on prices for rival oilseed soybeans amid the Sino-U.S. trade war could also drag on palm markets in 2019, some of the respondents said.

2019-01-24,"* Weak French, German data sends euro down ahead of ECB meeting * European stocks bolstered by tech gains, low rates hopes * Venezuelan debt steadies after anti-Maduro moves trigger rally * U.S. political uncertainty, global growth worries continue * Sterling edges off 11-week high * ECB policy decision due 1245 GMT, Draghi at 1330 GMT By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro retreated while stocks and bonds rallied on Thursday, as painful data from France and only modestly better readings from Germany set the tone for the European Central Bank’s first meeting of the year. Progress, or lack of it, in U.S.-China trade talks was also in focus, as were signs of a Brexit delay, while the Emerging-market bulls were still charging into Venezuela after a U.S. move against the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. The ECB left euro zone interest rates firmly in sub-zero territory but traders were waiting to see how much concern the central bank’s chief Mario Draghi shows at his 1330 GMT news conference after a blizzard of glum data. In France earlier, a survey showed business activity had pulled back at the fastest rate in more than four years in the face of weakening demand and the impact of anti-government protests. Germany’s services sector accelerated more than expected, but that was largely offset by the first contraction in manufacturing in more than four years. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.1350 , and while an upbeat tech sector helped stocks, it meant there would be plenty of concerned questions for European Central Bank  President Mario Draghi later. “At the moment their guidance (to raise interest rates later this year) isn’t really on track,” said JPMorgan Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager Seamus Mac Gorain, although he added it was probably still too early to change them dramatically. Traders were clearly expecting some comforting words at the upcoming Draghi news conference at 1330 GMT. Benchmark euro zone bond yields were lower across the board and France’s gloomy data had pushed its 10-year yield down to a six-month low of 0.61 percent. The main market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations also dropped to a seven-month low while futures prices pointed to modest gains for Wall Street main markets later. “We think the ECB might be changing its tone a little bit from saying the risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced to saying the risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside,” said Wouter Sturkenboom, chief investment strategist for EMEA and APAC, Northern Trust Asset Management. Overnight in Asia, the mood was also cautious. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3 percent, helped by modest gains in China. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.1 percent. China had taken positive cues from financial firms’ profits and the approval for a new technology board in Shanghai. Wall Street had also ended higher after upbeat earnings reports, including from IBM. However, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview that the U.S. economy might see zero growth in the first quarter if the partial government shutdown lasts the entire quarter. Japan’s subdued day had also come its export orders fell at the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years, confirming that slower growth is hitting another major developed economy. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday trade talks with China were going well and China “very much wants to make a deal.” But sources familiar with the talks say the two sides are still far apart on structural elements critical for a deal. Analysts at Capital Economics warned that China’s economic slowdown looks set to be of a similar scale to 2015-16, though there are some differences, notably less pressure on the yuan and no signs of major capital outflows. “Since China makes up 19 percent of the world economy, the slowdown this year compared to last will knock 0.2 percentage points off global growth,” they said. In currency markets, the dollar rebounded in European trading. It was at 109.74 yen after reaching its high for the year, 110.00 yen against the Japanese currency. Sterling eased off its 11-week high of almost $1.31 amid growing signs that Brexit was more likely to be delayed than the government risking leaving the European Union without a deal on March 29. The euro’s latest slide means it has now lost more than 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar since climbing to a three-month high of $1.1570 on Jan. 10. The Australian dollar also suffered a setback when one of the country’s major banks raised mortgage rates, bolstering the case for a cut in official rates. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.719 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.755 percent on Wednesday. Oil prices dropped amid concern over slowing global economic growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 0.6 percent to $52.27 a barrel. Brent crude futures were last down 0.7 percent at $60.69. Traders had reversed earlier price gains made on the potential for U.S. sanctions on Venezuela which has the potential to reduce supply. Venezuela’s dollar bonds had enjoyed their best day in years on Wednesday when the U.S. backing for opposition leader Juan Guaido spurred investor hopes for a turnaround in the impoverished country.

2019-01-24,"* Eskom struggling to recover from financial crisis * Ramaphosa has asked experts to come up with plan * Breaking up Eskom should encourage efficiencies By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Eskom could be split into three separate firms under proposals from experts President Cyril Ramaphosa has hired to help revive the ailing state power company, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Reforming Eskom is vital to get Africa’s most industrialised economy firing on all cylinders. It supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power but is drowning in debt. A Sustainability Task Team, picked by Ramaphosa, is due to report to the president next week, but shared its preliminary thoughts about Eskom with senior members of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at a two-day meeting that ended on Monday. One senior ANC source briefed by the task team said it proposed a “functional unbundling of Eskom,” which would involve separating it into three state-owned entities responsible for power generation, distribution and transmission. A second source who met the task team recently confirmed it favoured splitting up Eskom - a strategy which analysts say should encourage greater efficiency and transparency. Ramaphosa’s task team also told senior ANC members that Eskom, which has around 420 billion rand ($30 billion) of debt and is regularly cited as the biggest threat to the country’s public finances, needed another government bailout to survive, said the senior source, who asked not to be named. “The ANC recognises that there is a need for a serious turnaround strategy for Eskom. But it feels very strongly that it should not lead to privatisation or massive job losses,” the senior source said. Eskom’s debt pile was built up due to heavy staffing, stagnating power sales and rising coal costs that it has not been able to pass on to customers, analysts say. Cost overruns on building two major power plants have also hit its finances. Traders said leaks about the task team’s proposals, which were also reported in South Africa’s Business Day newspaper, pushed Eskom bonds higher on Thursday, with the 2023 and 2025 bonds hovering near five-month highs. Ramaphosa has made shoring up ailing state firms like Eskom a priority since replacing Jacob Zuma as president in February, but progress has been slow because of severe fiscal constraints. He also has to deal with divisions in the ANC over how to manage the economy and trade unions which want to avoid layoffs. Ramaphosa rejected a proposal by Eskom’s board of directors last year for the government to take 100 billion rand of the utility’s debt, saying other options needed to be looked at. He told the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that his government would release Eskom’s turnaround plan “in the next few weeks”. The task team’s members have agreed not to disclose their recommendations publicly, and Ramaphosa could choose to ignore their ideas. But analysts say action is needed as creditors are reluctant to lend more to Eskom without a credible rescue plan. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said he could not comment on the task team’s proposals. “The presidency will make formal pronouncements on this matter,” he told Reuters. $1 = 13.7998 rand

2019-01-24,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish wind power company Vestas (VWS.CO) presented a new platform on Thursday it says will enable customers to produce cheaper energy through turbines tailored for different wind conditions and locations.  The move is a response to a more competitive industry that is moving away from governments guaranteeing utilities generous fixed subsidised tariffs for power towards an auction-based system that favours those who can bid at the lowest price. “This is a more market-oriented approach,” Chief Executive Anders Runevad told Reuters in an interview. “There is a different logic now that we get into an auction market. EnVentus, the first new Vestas platform since 2011, will offer customers more flexibility than its existing 2 megawatt (MW) and 4 MW platforms, Vestas said. The company is also launching new V150-5.6 MW and V162-5.6 MW turbines to run on the EnVentus platform. New EnVentus-based turbines will be built from standardised modules that fit other turbines rather than from parts that only fit one platform. That will make manufacturing, servicing and upgrading the turbines simpler, Vestas said. Vestas, whose main rivals are General Electric (GE.N) and Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC), last month became the first to install 100 gigawatts of capacity globally. The wind power industry has been grappling with reduced subsidies in recent years and governments seeking more competitive contract tenders, increasing pressure on suppliers, turbine makers and wind farm developers to reduce costs. “We’ve gone from being a niche industry dependent on subsidy feed-in tariffs to an industry that can compete on more normal market conditions. And that ripples through the chain,” Runevad said. The EnVentus platform will lower the cost of energy produced throughout the lifespan of the turbine by as much as 30 percent, Vestas said. Asked whether the platform would allow Vestas to increase prices, Runevad said: “That remains to be seen. We have to wait and see what the competition is doing.” Vestas will publish 2018 results on Feb. 7.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - If you somehow missed the news about the killing of journalist  Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents and the global outcry that ensued, you might think Saudi Arabia is the darling of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The kingdom has sent one of its strongest delegations ever to the Swiss mountain resort and packed its top executives’ agendas with meetings with international peers. It has managed to secure top Western businessmen for a panel debate on ‘Next Steps for Saudi Arabia’, where French oil major Total’s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne and Morgan Stanley’s boss James Gorman spoke alongside the Saudi finance and economy ministers. The Davos gathering in the Swiss Alps is a chance for the Saudis to try to put behind them months of intense criticism over the murder of Khashoggi, a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. His killing by a team of Saudi operatives provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of the crown prince, previously admired in the West for pushing deep changes including tax reform, infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive. At Davos, the signs are that the damage control is working.       Swiss President Ueli Maurer said on Wednesday his country has moved on, and wanted to build strong relations with Riyadh, a rich, oil-producing kingdom that is itself a major global investor. “We have long since dealt with the Khashoggi case... We have agreed to continue the financial dialogue and normalize relations again,” Maurer told Swiss news agency SDA.  Western allies including some U.S. politicians have called on Riyadh to hold those responsible for the Khashoggi murder accountable. The Saudi public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects, as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis for a generation. So there had been doubts about Saudi Arabia’s status at Davos. After all, a number of A-list global investors stayed away from the Crown Prince’s annual Future Investment Initiative conference in October, overshadowed by the Saudi journalist’s death.  Then, at a summit of the G20 big economies in Buenos Aires, leaders appeared to ignore Prince Mohammed on stage during the “family photo,” even if many went on to have closed-door bilateral meetings with him afterwards. But at Davos, the Saudi delegation had dozens of meetings  and no Western investor pulled out, Saudi economy minister Mohammad Al Tuwaijri told Reuters on Wednesday. “On a day-to-day basis in Saudi Arabia it is business as usual. Our job as government is to make sure infrastructure, legal in particular, is stable. This transformation journey hopefully will attract investors,” Tuwaijri said. He said the probe into the killing needed time. The message he would take back to the crown prince was to “listen to the investors’ feedback”. Finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said it was “absolutely sad, what happened to Jamal Khashoggi” but also suggested to wait for the probe’s results and the trial. He also said the fact that a $7.5 billion Saudi bond was heavily oversubscribed earlier this month showed investors were regaining confidence. Mohammed El Kuwaiz, Chairman of the Saudi Capital Market Authority, said the murder of Khashoggi caused investors to pull back, but only temporarily. “Speaking not just as a government employee but as a Saudi citizen, everyone in Saudi has been absolutely horrified by what happened... But a country of 30 million people should not be held hostage by an event, no matter how heinous, particularly at this point in time when we have been working very hard to set a new course for the country,” Kuwaiz told Reuters. Latest Saudi data will show new foreign direct investment licenses doubled last year from 377 in 2017, a Saudi government source said. The World Economic Forum has chosen two state Saudi companies – Aramco and Sabic - to be among its 100 strategic partners in 2019. Oil giant Aramco also plans to issue a mega bond this year and is looking to acquire gas assets in the United States, its chief executive told Reuters. In the future, Aramco still plans to list its stock sometime in 2021 in what could become the world’s largest initial public offering. Pouyanne said he was carrying on with a $5 billion refining and petrochemical investment in Saudi Arabia and would also soon announce a new venture for petrol stations. “What is the alternative for a company like Total? To boycott Saudi Arabia? We are always against sanctions and boycotts. Who suffer from boycott and sanctions? It’s the normal people, the people on the street,” Pouyanne told the panel. Morgan’s Gorman also said investors wanted “clear light and transparency” about the murder which was “utterly unacceptable”. “You have to decide what process you play in a country which has had an incident versus the 30 million people who are going through an extraordinary reform,” said Gorman, whose bank has been present in Saudi Arabia for more over 40 years. Bill Browder, a critic of Vladimir Putin, who successfully pushed through some of the harshest U.S. sanctions against Russia for the killing of his lawyer, known as the Magnitsky Act, said the same sanctions should be applied to Saudi Arabia. “Until Mohammed bin Salman bears responsibility for this crime, there cannot be business as usual with Saudi Arabia,” Browder told Reuters.

2019-01-24,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s government is planning revisions of its oil and gas law with President Joko Widodo this week responding to a proposal initiated by parliament, calling for a plan to revive the ailing sector and boost the country’s energy independence. Widodo this week met with his senior cabinet members to craft a response to parliamentary proposals for a new law submitted in December.  The revisions should provide momentum for regulatory reforms to make the oil and gas sector more efficient, transparent, straightforward, sustainable and provide added value to the national economy, Widodo said according to a statement from the cabinet secretary issued late on Wednesday. Formerly an oil exporter and member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Indonesia’s crude output has plunged while its fuel demand has surged, making the country reliant on imports of gasoline and diesel.  The slump in oil and gas output has followed years of regulatory uncertainty. Recent pressure from the government on state-owned energy producer PT Pertamina to take over assets from oil majors like Chevron (CVX.N) and Total (TOTF.PA) has stoked concerns among foreign energy investors about the security of their projects. Indonesia has struggled to revamp its last set of oil and gas laws passed in 2001 and a parliamentary committee finally proposed a new law to the full body in December. Issues surrounding the oil and gas sector have long been a source of tension with foreign investors, and resolving these matters has proven challenging for Widodo, who is running for re-election in April. “The aim of this revision must not only be to push to increase oil and gas production, but also to support the strengthening of national capacities, strengthening domestic industries and investment in our human resources in the oil and gas industry,” according to a statement on the cabinet secretary’s website. Among the changes the parliament proposed and which Widodo and his cabinet will discuss with them is the creation of a new oil and gas business entity that will also serve as a regulator, called BUKMigas, according to a draft of the law reviewed by Reuters.  That agency will take over from the current upstream regulator SKKMigas and the downstream regulator BPHMigas. In addition to its regulatory role, BUKMigas will also be able to undertake work in oil and gas exploration and production. However, BPHMigas will still maintain oversight of pipeline fuel and gas transportation.        For the first time, Indonesia would have a state petroleum fund, bankrolled with revenue the government makes from oil and gas production as well as levies and bonuses, according to the draft. More talks about the proposed law will be held between Widodo’s government and the parliament. Late on Wednesday, Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry Legal Bureau Chief Hufron Asrofi told reporters that the government is compiling a list of problems with the current draft for discussion. According to a note on Indonesia’s oil and gas policy published this week by Fitch Solutions Macro Research, much work is still needed to attract investment to the oil and gas sector.  “When viewed in the context of intensifying competition for foreign direct investments across South and Southeast Asia, Indonesia remains at risk of falling behind, despite its impressive reserves profile and large market, if the tightening state grip over the sector is not loosened.” Reporting by Fergus Jensen and Wilda Asmarini; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/indonesia-energy-lawmaking/indonesia-embarks-on-overhaul-of-oil-gas-law-to-halt-output-slide-idUKL3N1ZO2EV,24 Jan 2019,"Indonesia's government is

2019-01-24,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is seeking advisers to arrange debt financing needed for the acquisition of a stake in Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE, banking sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The Saudi oil giant could borrow as much as $50 billion from international investors to fund the acquisition, sources previously told Reuters. A request for proposals was sent on Wednesday and banks are expected to make submissions by Monday, one of the sources said.  Aramco declined to comment. Aramco, the world’s top oil producer, plans to issue its first international bonds in the second quarter of 2019, likely worth about $10 billion, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said this month. The bond issuance could help finance the SABIC acquisition. Aramco is looking for advisers for an international bond issue and bank financing, one of the sources said. The debt is needed to back the purchase of all, or nearly all, of the 70 percent stake in SABIC held by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the kingdom’s top sovereign wealth fund. That implies a deal value of roughly $70 billion. Aramco is working with JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on the stake purchase, sources previously told Reuters.

2019-01-24,"MUMBAI, Jan 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indian authorities are imposing a new fee and stricter laws to rein in groundwater use, as the world’s biggest extractor struggles to find ways to conserve the fast dwindling resource. The Water Conservation Fee for use for drinking, and domestic and commercial purposes is due to take effect from June 1, even as several states tighten laws around extraction. But conservationists and campaigners say these efforts will fail unless the government also separates water rights from land ownership, and empowers communities to manage and use groundwater, and recharge aquifers. “The approach so far has been: this is my land, so the water below it is mine, and I can use as much of it as I want,” said Himanshu Kulkarni of the Advanced Center for Water Resources Development and Management, an advocacy group. “But we need to think of groundwater as a common pool resource and look at it from a rights perspective,” he said. India is the world’s largest user of groundwater, drawing about 250 cubic kilometres per year, or more than a fourth of the global total, according to the World Bank. More than 60 percent of the country’s irrigated agriculture and 85 percent of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater, the World Bank estimates. With a growing population, rising demand from agriculture and industry, and increasingly erratic monsoon rains, India is suffering the “worst water crisis in its history”, according to government think-tank NITI Aayog. About 600 million people - nearly half India’s population - face acute water shortage, with close to 200,000 dying each year from polluted water, NITI Aayog said in a report last year. A draft Groundwater Bill, 2017 proposed a new regulatory framework that recognised the fundamental right to water, the need for decentralised control and protection of aquifers, and sought to give control to local users. But the legislation was not passed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, and with national elections due by May, it has been relegated to the backburner. “Availability of water is an issue everywhere. But water management - which should be a raging election issue - is not, because we don’t pay a meaningful price for it,” said Mridula Ramesh, founder of the Sundaram Climate Institute in Madurai. “The Water Conservation Fee is a necessary first step,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. With its dependence on seasonal rainfall, India has long managed water with an elaborate network of canals, tanks and wells. Water was regarded as a communal resource that was managed by the community. This approach changed with the British, who imposed a centralised system, and the common law principle in the late 1800s, emphasising the rights of landowners to access water, according to Kulkarni. The conflation of the right to water with property ownership led to landowners treating groundwater as a private resource with no thought of its conservation, said Kulkarni, who helped draft the 2017 bill. The Green Revolution - launched by the government in the 1960s to increase food production - led to the widespread use of tubewells, which were heavily subsidised, resulting in faster depletion of groundwater for irrigation. India has built dams and plans to link rivers to ease availability, measures that are opposed by conservationists. The country is also entangled in disputes across the border, with its eastern and western neighbours - Bangladesh and Pakistan - accusing it of monopolising water flows. To the north and northeast, India fears a loss of water to upstream China, which plans a series of dams over the Tsangpo river, called the Brahmaputra as it flows into eastern India. A groundwater law was first introduced in India in the 1970s, and about a dozen states began introducing measures to control use from the 1990s. But the legislation has failed to tackle falling water tables, and lacks provisions to protect and conserve groundwater at the aquifer level, said Philippe Cullet, a professor of environmental law at the University of London’s SOAS. “Access to a source of groundwater has progressively become a source of power and economic gain,” said Cullet, who also helped draft the 2017 bill. “Groundwater is essentially a local resource, yet the present framework remains mostly top-down, and is incapable of addressing local situations adequately,” he said. Groundwater reserves are under pressure worldwide, with warmer temperatures affecting how quickly they replenish, resulting in an environmental “time bomb” for future generations, according to a study published this week. In India, the world’s second-most populous country, the crisis has serious implications for food security. Nearly 600 million people are at high risk of being unable to rely on surface water - including in the northwest and south, where much of India’s staple wheat and rice are grown, according to Washington D.C.-based World Resources Institute. Some states including Maharashtra are enacting tougher laws to regulate tubewells, prevent pollution, and limit the type of crops that can be grown in water-deficit areas. The conservation fee will charge users based on the amount of water extracted in resource-scarce areas. But the fee exempts agricultural users - the largest consumers of groundwater, and a key voter base. Helping farmers manage water can help limit crop failures from failed monsoons, said Kulkarni, whose organisation helped establish “pani panchayat” - or water village councils - that were popular in the 1970s. In these projects, farmers delinked land and water rights, and collectively managed harvesting and distributing surface water and groundwater. Individual wells were banned, as were water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and bananas. A similar farmer-led project in seven drought-prone districts of nearly one million people in Andhra Pradesh state was described by the World Bank as the “first global example of large-scale success in self-regulation of groundwater use.” “Ensuring the rights of the landless, community participation, equitable distribution, and sustainability of the resource is key,” said Kulkarni. ""It is a fairer, more democratic way to manage water, and prevents the kind of conflicts we now see over surface water."" (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Zoe Tabary.

2019-01-24,"BEIJING, Jan 24 (Reuters) - China said on Thursday it opposes outside interference in Venezuela and supports its efforts to protect its independence and stability. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called for all sides to calmly and reasonably find a peaceful solution. “China supports efforts made by the Venezuelan government to protect the country’s sovereignty, independence and stability,” Hua told a regular briefing in Beijing. “...I want to emphasize that outside sanctions or interference usually make the situation more complicated and are not helpful to resolving the actual problems.” Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, winning backing from Washington and parts of Latin America and prompting Nicolas Maduro, the country’s leader since 2013, to break off ties with the United States. China has lent over $50 billion to Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements over the past decade, securing energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. But the financing dried up as the South American country’s economy began spiralling downward in 2015, pressured by plummeting oil prices.

2019-01-24,"* Weak French, German data sends euro down ahead of ECB meeting * European stocks bolstered by tech gains, low rates hopes * Venezuelan debt steadies after anti-Maduro moves trigger rally * U.S. political uncertainty, global growth worries continue * Sterling edges off 11-week high * ECB policy decision due 1245 GMT, Draghi at 1330 GMT By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The euro retreated while stocks and bonds rallied on Thursday, as painful data from France and only modestly better readings from Germany set the tone for the European Central Bank’s first meeting of the year. Progress, or lack of it, in U.S.-China trade talks was also in focus, as were signs of a Brexit delay. Emerging-market bulls were charging in Venezuala after a U.S. move against the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. In France, a survey showed business activity pulled back at the fastest rate in over four years in the face of weakening demand and the impact of anti-government protests. Germany’s services sector accelerated more than expected, but that was largely offset by the first contraction in manufacturing in more than four years. The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.1350 , and while an upbeat tech sector helped stocks, it meant there would be plenty of concerned questions for European Central Bank  President Mario Draghi later. “At the moment their guidance (to raise interest rates later this year) isn’t really on track,” said JPMorgan Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager Seamus Mac Gorain, although he added it was probably still too early to change them dramatically. Traders were clearly expecting some comforting words. The ECB will keep its sub-zero interest rates on hold at 1245 GMT and Draghi holds a news conference at 1330 GMT. Euro zone bond yields fell across the board and France’s gloomy data pushed its 10-year yield down to a six-month low of 0.61 percent. The main market gauge of euro zone inflation expectations dropped to a seven-month low. Overnight in Asia, the mood was also cautious. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.3 percent, helped by modest gains in China. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.1 percent. China had taken positive cues from financial firms’ profits and the approval for a new technology board in Shanghai. Wall Street had also ended higher after upbeat earnings reports, including from IBM. However, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview that the U.S. economy might see zero growth in the first quarter if the partial government shutdown lasts the entire quarter. Japan’s subdued day had also come its export orders fell at the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years, confirming that slower growth is hitting another major developed economy. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday trade talks with China were going well and China “very much wants to make a deal.” But sources familiar with the talks say the two sides are still far apart on structural elements critical for a deal. Analysts at Capital Economics warned that China’s economic slowdown looks set to be of a similar scale to 2015-16, though there are some differences, notably less pressure on the yuan and no signs of major capital outflows. “Since China makes up 19 percent of the world economy, the slowdown this year compared to last will knock 0.2 percentage points off global growth,” they said. In currency markets, the dollar rebounded in European trading. It was at 109.70 yen after reaching its high for the year, 110.00 yen against the Japanese currency. Sterling eased off its 11-week high of almost $1.31 amid growing signs that Brexit was more likely to be delayed than the government risking leaving the European Union without a deal on March 29. The euro’s latest slide means it has now lost more than 1.5 percent against the U.S. dollar since climbing to a three-month high of $1.1570 on Jan. 10. The Australian dollar suffered a setback when one of the country’s major banks raised mortgage rates, bolstering the case for a cut in official rates. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.746 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.755 percent on Wednesday. Oil prices dropped amid concern over slowing global economic growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 0.5 percent to $52.38 a barrel. Brent crude futures were last down 0.4 percent at $60.87.

2019-01-24,"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The leader of Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, criticised U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday for making it “more difficult to work together in the world”. Asked about U.S. threats of sanctions against German companies involved in the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, Kramp-Karrenbauer told Bloomberg television: “I think that the manner in which the American administration conducts its politics - with a great deal of sanctions, with leaving a number of international agreements - this is not a good way of working with others.” Kramp-Karrenbauer, who succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of their Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in December, praised the chancellor for delivering a robust defence of multilateralism a day earlier at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Merkel, who has been German chancellor for 13 years, lauded compromise as a virtue in international relations in an address on Wednesday to global political and business leaders in Davos. Kramp-Karrenbauer, who joined Merkel on Thursday for a Davos breakfast meeting with leading women from politics and business, said negotiations, compromises and international rules that were adhered to had allowed world powers to achieve much in the past. “It is very difficult if one of the partners is now saying these rules no longer apply and they are leaving agreements,” she added, according to an English translation of her comments. “That makes it more difficult to work together in the world.” Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/davos-meeting-germany-usa/merkel-protege-criticises-trump-approach-to-diplomacy-idUKL8N1ZO2ND,24 Jan 2019,"The leader of

2019-01-24,"(Adds details, shares) Jan 24 (Reuters) - Premier Oil’s second appraisal well in the Zama project offshore Mexico showed more potential for oil, raising hopes of a huge discovery. Shares of Premier, which holds a 25 percent interest in the block alongside Talos Energy Inc and Sierra Oil and Gas, rose more than 4 percent in morning trading. The company said net-to-gross ratio, which represents the volume of rock that is able to store hydrocarbons, came in at 73 percent, higher than pre-drill estimates and topped its first appraisal well’s 63 percent ratio. “This is an excellent start to the Block 7 Zama appraisal programme in Mexico. It enhances our interpretation of the large Zama discovery and increases our confidence in our resource estimates,” Chief Executive Tony Durrant said. Premier said the reservoir quality was similar to that at Zama-1 and in line with expectations. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Round said the result was positive and that he expects this to “improve confidence around higher Zama volumes estimates.” However, the company said it did not hit oil in a deeper exploration prospect called Marte. Premier said it will now drill a secondary wellbore away from the original hole of the Zama-2 appraisal well, which was deepened to evaluate the high-risk Marte exploration prospect. Talos Energy said on Wednesday that the initial phase of the appraisal program was completed about 28 days ahead of schedule and 25 percent below initially projected costs.

2019-01-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) said on Thursday it had invested in Chinese start-up PowerShare, which links electric vehicle drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution. The PowerShare application, which is used in cities such as Shanghai, will help manage growing pressure on power grids as electric vehicles (EVs) usage surges in the coming decades. With China targeting sales of more than 7 million EVs by 2025, the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid, particularly at times of peak demand, will be crucial. BP’s investment is the latest in a string by the London-based oil and gas major and several of its rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), in EV charging as they target future low-carbon economies. Car producers, utility firms and energy companies have doubled down efforts in recent years to find ways to manage the expected surge in power demand. PowerShare helps drivers locate charging points and pay for the supply, while allowing suppliers to optimize to balance demand on the grid, depending on the time of day, for example between city centers and residential areas. “As more and more EVs come on, grid operators are concerned about mobile demand. PowerShare can monitor where vehicles are and where demand is in the system,” Graham Howes, managing director of BP Ventures in Asia, told Reuters. BP, which has invested in fast-charging battery docks and battery storage technologies, did not disclose the size of the investment in PowerShare, but its venturing business typically invests up to ten million dollars in one firm. “We wanted to find a technology that can cope with volume,” Howes said of PowerShare, which is BP Ventures’ first direct investment in China.

2019-01-24,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, winning backing from Washington and parts of Latin America and prompting socialist Nicolas Maduro, the country’s leader since 2013, to break relations with the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump formally recognised Guaido shortly after his announcement and praised his plan to hold elections. That was followed by similar statements from Canada and a slew of right-leaning Latin American governments, including Venezuela’s neighbours Brazil and Colombia. Lawmakers in Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela’s oil industry, provided support to its military, and  become a lender of last resort as the economy implodes,  denounced the declarations. Lower parliamentary house speaker Vyacheslav Volodin called the steps to remove Maduro illegal, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday. A second lawmaker, Franz Klinzevich, said Moscow could wind up its military cooperation with Venezuela if Maduro was ousted. In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said recognising a leader other than Maduro might cause “chaos”. In Paris, a presidency official said France was consulting with its European partners about the situation. At a rally on Wednesday in the east of the capital Caracas that drew hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, Guaido accused Maduro of usurping power. He promised to create a transitional government that would help the oil-rich nation escape its hyperinflationary economic collapse. “I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation,” 35-year old Guaido, the head of the opposition-run congress, told an exuberant crowd. Guaido’s declaration takes Venezuela into uncharted territory, with the possibility of the opposition now running a parallel government recognised abroad as legitimate but without control over state functions. In a televised broadcast from the presidential palace, Maduro accused the opposition of seeking to stage a coup with Washington’s support. “We’ve had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it! Here is a people willing to defend this land,” said Maduro, flanked by Socialist Party leaders.  Any change of government will rest on a shift in allegiance within the armed forces. So far, they have stood by Maduro through two waves of street protests and a steady dismantling of democratic institutions.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Venezuelan military to protect “the welfare and well-being of all Venezuelan citizens,” and said Washington would take “appropriate actions” against anyone who endangered the safety of U.S. personnel. The United States would conduct its diplomatic relations with Venezuela through “the government of interim President Guaido,” he said. Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said on Wednesday that the armed forces did not recognise a self-proclaimed president “imposed by shadowy interests ... outside the law.” Military top brass indicated their continued support for Maduro in tweets. In a potent symbol of Venezuelan anger, demonstrators in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz on Tuesday toppled a statue of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. They broke the statue in half and dangled part of it from a bridge. Maduro took power in 2013 after his mentor Chavez died. As the oil price sank and revenues dried up, the social welfare programs designed by Chavez faltered. Venezuela spiralled into its worst-ever economic crisis, with hyperinflation forecast to reach 10 million percent this year. But Maduro nevertheless started a second term on Jan. 10, following a widely-boycotted election last year that many foreign governments described as a sham. In the Chacao district of eastern Caracas, a traditional opposition bastion, a dozen protesters spoke of a renewed confidence in dislodging Maduro and predicted a new wave of demonstrations.  “The struggle will be long,” said Ciro Cirino on Altamira plaza, minutes after police on motorbikes charged a crowd of several thousand protesters, firing tear gas to disperse them. “The police push us back... and we keep going back. We are going to be here until there is a change,” said Cirino, a 35-year-old computer programmer. “We’re hungry. Look how skinny I am: there’s no food in my house,” said another protester holding a petrol bomb, who declined to give his name “We have to get rid of Maduro.” Some 3 million Venezuelans have fled abroad over the past five years to escape widespread shortages of food and medicine. Eight people have so far died across Venezuela in clashes with police this week, according to local officials and rights groups.  Venezuela’s constitution says if the presidency is determined to be vacant, new elections should be called in 30 days and that the head of the congress should assume the presidency in the meantime. However, the pro-government Supreme Court has ruled that all actions taken by the National Assembly congress are null and void and the government has jailed dozens of opposition leaders and activists for seeking to overthrow Maduro through violent street demonstrations in 2014 and 2017. As pressure mounts on Maduro both internally and externally, the Trump administration is considering sanctions on Venezuelan oil as soon as this week, according to sources.  The South American OPEC country has the largest crude reserves in the world and is a major supplier to U.S. refiners, though output is hovering near 70-year lows and reaction in the oil markets was muted on Wednesday. Local bonds rebounded, with Venezuela’s benchmark 2027 bond trading above 31 cents on the dollar for the first time since May 2018.

2019-01-24,"LAGOS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The leading female candidate in Nigeria’s presidential election said on Thursday she had withdrawn from the race weeks ahead of the poll to help build a coalition to provide a viable alternative to the country’s two main parties. Former government minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in 2014, said on Twitter that she had been in talks for three months with other candidates about a coalition. Nigeria’s presidential election is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16. The main candidates in the race to head Africa’s top oil producing country are the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president who is representing the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). “I have decided to step down from the presidential race and focus on helping to build a coalition for a viable alternative to the #APCPDP in the 2019 general,” said Ezekwesili in a tweet. Ezekwesili was not considered to be among the frontrunners in the race. Analysts see President Buhari and Abubakar as the only genuine contenders due to the financial power and patronage networks provided by their parties. The PDP ruled from 1999, when civilian rule began, until Buhari’s 2015 election win with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. The main contenders ahead of February’s poll have been in the public eye for decades - Buhari was a military ruler in the 1980s and Abubakar was vice president from 1999-2007. Ezekwesili, a former government minister, is a founder of the civil society organization Transparency International. She was considered for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her anti-corruption work. She is known more recently for her work as co-founder of ‘Bring Back Our Girls’, a campaign which seeks to raise awareness about some 270 girls who were kidnapped from their school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 by Boko Haram. Many of the girls managed to escape in the hours following their abduction or have been released in the last few years, but about 100 are still missing and their condition is unknown.
