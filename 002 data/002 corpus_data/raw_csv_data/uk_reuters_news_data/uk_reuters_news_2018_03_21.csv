2018-03-21,"(Recasts with extent outage; adds details, quote from grid operator) By Luciano Costa and Leonardo Goy SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, March 21 (Reuters) - A power outage struck large swaths of Brazil on Wednesday, affecting tens of millions of people, especially in the country’s northern and northeastern regions where the system remains “practically collapsed,” according to an official. The outage began at about 3:40 p.m. (1940 GMT) and had not been resolved by late evening, according to the country’s state grid operator. The blackout was due to the failure of a transmission line near the massive Belo Monte hydroelectric station, authorities said. Some 22.5 percent of the grid’s total output, or 18,000 megawatts, have been affected. “That line was inaugurated recently and was not yet operating at full capacity,” the country’s mining and energy minister, Fernando Coelho Filho, told journalists in Brasilia. “There was a surge in power ... and the line fell out of operation.” The transmission line that failed is the responsibility of state-run utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, commonly known as Eletrobras, and China State Grid Corp Ltd. Neither company responded to requests for comment. In the country’s poor north and northeast, the system had “practically collapsed,” Luiz Eduardo Barata, head of national grid operator ONS, told journalists. Elsewhere in the country the impact was less severe, he said, and service had been resumed in the country’s southern and southeastern region’s shortly after 4 p.m., where spotty outages were reported.

Temer made the announcement during an economic conference in Brasilia, saying that “the new tariffs ... will not be applied while we are talking on the issue.” A spokeswoman for the trade representative declined to confirm any decisions. “The president will make the final decisions on country exemptions,” she said. An exemption would require a presidential proclamation, which has not been made for any nations but Canada and Mexico.  Brazil is the No. 2 supplier of steel to the United States. “We have to treat our relations with the United States with great care, because they are our biggest trade partner after China,” Temer said last week at the World Economic Forum on Latin America.

2018-03-21,"(Adds Senator Markey urging energy secretary to inform Congress on the talks with Saudi Arabia) By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday to ensure that countries striking deals with Washington on sharing nuclear power technology abandon fuel-making activities that could be altered to make material for nuclear weapons. U.S. Representatives Ilea Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, and Brad Sherman, a Democrat, introduced the bill as officials from Saudi Arabia work with the administration of President Donald Trump on a deal that could relax safeguards on nuclear proliferation. The bill would reform current U.S. nuclear energy law to force countries in nuclear partnerships to renounce the pursuit of enrichment and preprocessing technologies and capabilities. The bill also requires a stronger approval process by Congress of civilian nuclear deals. Saudi Arabia has previously refused to sign any agreement with Washington that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium. Although the bill faces an uncertain future, it sends a message to both Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration that Congress could take steps against any deal that lacks the safeguards, which are known as “gold standard” of such agreements. Some lawmakers are concerned that if Saudi Arabia and other countries are allowed to enrich uranium that it could one day lead to a nuclear weapons race in the Middle East. “Congress must ensure that U.S. national security interests are not trumped by political concerns,” said Sherman. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill. Saudi Arabia said it needs nuclear power to move away from burning crude oil to generate electricity and to diversify its economy. Earlier this month its cabinet approved a national policy program that limits all nuclear activities to peaceful purposes. Still, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Sal man, told CBS in an interview on Sunday ahead of a trip to Washington that the kingdom will develop nuclear weapons if its arch-rival Iran does so. A deal could breathe some life into the U.S. nuclear power industry which is suffering from an abundance of cheap natural gas, a competing fuel for electricity, and ballooning safety costs. Rick Perry, the U.S. energy secretary, met in London early this month with Saudi officials to discuss the deal. Ros-Lehtinen and Sherman also sent a letter to Perry urging the Trump administration to seek for binding commitments against enrichment and preprocessing in its talks with Saudi Arabia. In addition, Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat, urged Perry to immediately brief Congress on his talks in London with Saudi officials, which also included at least one lawyer from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “Issues as critical as nuclear nonproliferation require engagement with Congress given their major implications for U.S. national security,” Markey said in the letter.

2018-03-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slid against major currencies, bond yields slipped, and stocks were mostly steady on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised its policy interest rate, and noted economic growth was strengthening, but left markets expecting only three rate rises this year.      The U.S. central bank as expected raised its policy rate to 1.50-1.75 percent, but disappointed currency traders who had bet it was prepared to raise rates four times this year as the jobs market approaches full employment. The U.S. dollar saw its largest one-day loss in two months against major currencies. The U.S. dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.693 points or 0.77 percent, to 89.678, its steepest one-day drop since Jan. 24 when it fell 1.0 percent. “It looks like a bit of a letdown even though the Fed’s overall outlook is hawkish because their economic outlook has strengthened,” said Minh Trang, senior foreign currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. “That’s why we are seeing a bit of a disappointment on the dollar side.”  U.S. Treasury yields ended slightly lower as Fed policymakers signaled that only three rate hikes may be needed this year, and not the four increases many had expected. There was “no change to 2018 and I think that’s why you have such a muted reaction,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. Two-year note yields US2YT=RR, which are highly sensitive to interest rate policy, jumped as high as 2.366 percent, the highest since September 2008, before falling back to 2.308 percent. Benchmark 10-year note yields US10YT=RR increased to 2.936 percent, the highest since March 12, before retracing to 2.894 percent. Concerns about rising U.S. Treasury bond issuance as the government faces a widening fiscal deficit after last year’s U.S. tax cuts has seen yields rise this year. U.S. stocks ended slightly lower, with major indexes giving up gains in choppy trade in the wake of the Fed statement, while a rise in oil prices helped energy stocks. “That’s a Fed that really feels good about the economy, not only this year but into next year,” said Jim Paulsen, Chief Investment Strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. “The initial response by equities was to go up because of the confidence the Fed seems to have in the economy. But with bond yields going up in anticipation of more hikes ..., that kind of scared the stock market again.” Concerns over the imposition of U.S. trade tariffs on metals and against China continue to weigh on financial markets.  “So far, we have seen low-level (trade) skirmishes, which are not material enough to affect the world economy. But if we see retaliation, and significant trade disruptions, it’s a different order of magnitude (which) could begin to affect global growth forecasts,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 44.96 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 24,682.31, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,711.93 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 19.02 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,345.29.7,345.29 World markets had traded lower earlier after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was planning counter-measures against U.S. trade tariffs. European shares fell and investors scurried for the safety of German government bonds and the Japanese yen.  A pan-European equity index  was off 0.2 percent after the WSJ report on China.  Shares of Facebook Inc (FB.O) edged 0.7 percent higher after two days of steep losses that had wiped some $50 billion off the value of shares of the social media company.  Those declines, caused by controversy over the alleged misuse of user data, filtered through the tech sector, with technology companies .SPLRCT in the benchmark S&P 500 index  down 2.0 percent for the week to date. Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil prices on Wednesday.  Crude oil hit a six-week high after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories, strong compliance on OPEC production cuts, and persistent concern related to the Iran nuclear deal.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose $2.05, or 3 percent, to settle at $69.47, nearly a 7-week high. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 gained $1.63, or 2.6 percent, to settle at $65.17, their highest since Feb. 2. The fall in the U.S. dollar after the Fed statement also helped to push gold prices up from a three week low.

2018-03-21,"(Updates to close of U.S. trading) By David Randall NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Concerns over further trade tariffs and a widely expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve left world stocks flat after a choppy session Wednesday as investors tried to balance out the effects of low inflation and higher trading costs on the global economy. Stocks had initially rallied and pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 200 points after the Fed raised benchmark U.S. interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, as expected, at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting and said growth in the U.S. economy continues to look strong. The Fed’s measures of inflation were little changed, helping reassure investors that the U.S. central bank may not raise rates more than three times this year. But stock prices began to come under selling pressure after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a later press conference that some participants in the Federal Open Market Committee said they had heard concerns about the effect of future trade tariffs on global growth. “A number of participants in the (committee) did bring up the issue of tariffs,” Powell said. “If I could summarize, what came out of it was, first, there’s no thought that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook.” However, “a number of participants reported that about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has come a concern going forward for that growth.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.96 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 24,682.31, the S&P 500 lost 5.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,711.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.02 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,345.29.7,345.29 The dollar index fell 0.79 percent, with the euro up 0.85 percent to $1.2344. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.07 percent. “So far, we have seen low-level (trade) skirmishes, which are not material enough to affect the world economy. But if we see retaliation, and significant trade disruptions, it’s a different order of magnitude (which) could begin to affect global growth forecasts,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. World markets had traded lower earlier after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was planning counter-measures against U.S. trade tariffs.

A pan-European equity index was off 0.2 percent after the WSJ report on China. The tech selloff was a serious setback to markets just as they recovered from an early-February selloff, Milligan said, noting tech had been “the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year.” The WSJ report on potential Chinese tariffs comes as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to announce on Friday up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods. He imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this month. This week’s meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies failed to defuse tensions, with the G20 saying only that it recognized the need for more “dialogue and actions.” Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 gained 2.6 percent after a surprise decline in U.S. oil inventories and as worries persisted over rising tensions in the Middle East.

2018-03-21,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas drillers bid on only a tiny fraction of Gulf of Mexico acreage offered on Wednesday in the largest lease sale in American history, a setback to the Trump administration’s efforts to rapidly pump up investment in the region. The Interior Department had offered up a record 77 million acres (31.2 million  hectares) for development in the Gulf - an area twice the size of Florida - with discounted royalty rates on the shallower tracts as part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump to ramp up fossil fuels output. But companies facing multi-billion dollar price tags to develop the acreage and tempted by better terms overseas bid on just 1 percent of the area up for grabs, winning with bids that averaged just $153 an acre - 35 percent below levels last year, and a fraction of those in the region in 2013 when oil prices were higher, according to the data. In all, the auction yielded $124.76 million in winning bids, slightly more than a smaller Gulf of Mexico auction last year, but a tenth of the amount pulled in during a much smaller lease sale in the Central Gulf in 2013.  The Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which administered the auction, characterized the results as robust: “I think we’re seeing continued consistent investment in the Gulf of Mexico,” BOEM spokesman Mike Celata said in a conference call with reporters, adding he forecast increasing oil and gas production from the region for years. He said 33 companies, including majors Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc, Chevron Corp, and Total SA, had placed 159 bids on 148 blocks. But critics of the administration called the unusually large lease sale ill-timed. U.S. crude oil and natural gas output is already smashing records thanks to improved drilling technology that has opened up cheaper onshore reservoirs, and Brazil and Mexico are also competing for drilling investment in their own deepwater acreage - often with better terms. “Offering a nearly unrestricted supply in a low demand market with a cut rate royalty and almost no competition is bad policy and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer resources,” the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank, said in a statement. William Turner, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the sales statistics were “on par with the all-time lows that we saw last year,” referring to a lease sale in 2017 that had yielded $121 million in winning bids. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had said ahead of the sale that the record-sized offering would be a “bellwether” of industry demand in the region, and billed the effort as a way to help the United States become more “energy dominant.” After the sale, Interior Assistant Secretary Joe Balash said: “Today’s lease sale is yet another step our nation has taken to achieve economic security and energy dominance.” “ALL-TIME LOWS?”     The U.S. government offers Gulf of Mexico leases annually, but usually in smaller regional batches. An auction in March 2017, for example, offered up 48 million acres in the Central Gulf of Mexico planning region.  Consultancy Wood Mackenzie had expected demand for the acreage to get a boost from higher oil prices compared with a year ago, and lower corporate taxes. But it pointed out interest would be tempered by competition from Latin America, and concerns over the impact that U.S. tariffs on steel imports could have on costs. The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore drillers, also sounded a note of caution. “The United States must continue to evaluate how to keep the Gulf of Mexico and other parts of the U.S. outer continental shelf attractive in light of competition from Brazil and Mexico,” it said in an emailed statement. Drillers have been trying to trim their Gulf of Mexico drilling costs in recent years to make certain projects there more competitive. BP, for example, has said its Mad Dog 2 platform will be economic with crude at just $40 a barrel. Current oil prices are over $65 a barrel. BP, which bid over $20 million on 27 parcels on Wednesday, structured its bids around its existing production platforms and areas it has already identified as being “highly prospective,” spokesman Jason Ryan said in a statement.  Still, many new projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico come with multi-billion dollar price tags and require major investment up front - making them a tough sell.  Some U.S. oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corp are focusing on new deepwater projects outside of the United States, where royalties and tax structures can be more favorable.  “In terms of Exxon, they have plenty of things to do in Guyana, so why bother getting too active in this round in Gulf of Mexico,” said Lysle Brinker, a research director at IHS Markit, noting Exxon’s absence from the bidding. In an effort to pump up interest, the Interior Department had cut the royalty rate companies must pay in shallow offshore waters by a third to 12.5 percent, and is considering cutting the rate for deeper waters too. The BOEM’s Celata pointed out that shallow-water tracts received 43 bids on Wednesday, an increase from past lease sales that he attributed to the lower royalty rates. The administration is eyeing further vast lease sales offshore in the future, having proposed opening up parts of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific - an idea that has faced pushback from several governors in U.S. coastal states. Democratic lawmakers have also warned the Interior Department not to extend the lower royalty rates to deepwater acreage, saying the move would short-change taxpayers.

2018-03-21,"(Adds names of companies sanctioned) By Lesley Wroughton and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on 15 South Sudanese oil operators that it said were important sources of cash for the government, an action aimed at increasing pressure on President Salva Kiir to end the country’s conflict and humanitarian crisis. The companies and government bodies would in future require special licenses to do business in the United States, the State Department said. “The South Sudanese Government, and corrupt official actors, use this revenue to purchase weapons and fund irregular militias that undermine the peace, security, and stability of South Sudan,” the department said in a statement. The groups on the list “are involved in activities that are contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States,” according to a related Department of Commerce document published on Wednesday. The South Sudanese government was not immediately available to comment. Washington has already placed sanctions on South Sudanese military and political figures, and in January imposed an arms embargo to halt the flow of weapons into the country, signaling that it had lost patience with South Sudan’s warring factions for ignoring ceasefires. Last year, the South Sudanese government said it planned to more than double oil production to 290,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 2017/2018. It is the most oil-dependent country in the world, with oil accounting for almost all of its exports and around 60 percent of gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. The Department of Commerce’s so-called Entity List does not freeze assets but requires that U.S. and foreign companies doing business with those on the list first obtain a license. The Commerce Department placed the South Sudan Ministry of Mining, the South Sudan Ministry of Petroleum, and state oil firm Nile Petroleum and associated companies on its list. The list includes Dar Petroleum Operating Company, an oil and gas consortium led by China National Petroleum Corp and Malaysia’s state-run oil and gas firm Petronas, the two largest oil firms operating in South Sudan. The restrictions also cover oil distributor Nyakek and Sons; Greater Pioneer Operating; Juba Petrotech Technical Services; Nigeria’s Oranto Petroleum, and Sudd Petroleum Operating. South Sudan has been wrecked by civil war since 2013 when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with those loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar. Since then, the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes.

2018-03-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil hit a six-week high on Wednesday, closing in on a 3-year peak set in late January, on a surprise decline in U.S. inventories, strong compliance on OPEC production cuts, and persistent concern related to the Iran nuclear deal.  Brent crude futures rose $2.05, or 3 percent, to settle at $69.47, nearly a 7-week high.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $1.63, or 2.6 percent, to settle at $65.17, their highest since Feb. 2. Those increases put both benchmarks into technically overbought territory for the first time since January, and boosted the premium of the Brent front-month over WTI to its highest since the start of February. Data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday morning showed a surprise 2.6 million barrel draw in crude inventories. Analysts had expected a 2.5 million barrel build. [EIA/S] “A few things happened,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, referring to the EIA data.  “Crude imports dropped by half a million barrels per day, that contributed to the draw. We saw refinery runs increase more than expected by around 400,000 barrels per day so that ate up a lot of crude. And exports were up slightly,” he said.  Oil also got a boost after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018. “On the back end of the Fed meeting, the dollar is getting under pressure, and that is going to work as a reverse correlation to crude oil prices,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.  A falling dollar versus a basket of other currencies makes commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies since they have to spend less to buy the same amount of the commodity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday its members and allies achieved record compliance in February to their deal to cut global supplies, lifting the market. Meanwhile, concerns that the United States could reimpose sanctions on Iran loom.  Energy consultancy FGE said new U.S. sanctions on Iran could result in a 250,000 to 500,000 bpd drop in its exports by year-end, compared with crude exports of roughly 2.0 million to 2.2 million bpd since early 2016, when sanctions were lifted. “Even though you do see signs that the market is lax on the physical side, do you go aggressively bearish when you have the potential for something happening between the U.S. and Iran?” Bearish concerns have largely been fuelled by surging U.S. crude output. Wednesday’s EIA data, in addition to showing inventory draws, also showed that weekly crude output had hit an all-time high.  “So far, the market is sort of ignoring the increase in production,” said Ritterbusch. “We now have production above 10.4 million bpd and it’s going to keep rising; and the market is eventually going to have to reckon with that,” he said.

2018-03-21,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Chevron attorney said in court on Wednesday that the company supports scientific conclusions that humans are causing climate change, a response to a lawsuit that accuses five major energy producers of misleading the public for years about their role in global warming. At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, Chevron attorney Theodore Boutrous also said that the scientific consensus about greenhouse gas emissions did not fully form until the past decade. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California sued Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and BP PLC last year, seeking an abatement fund to help the cities address flooding they say is a result of climate change. The companies argued in legal filings on Tuesday that the case should be dismissed, partly because Congress has given regulatory agencies, not the courts, authority over the production and emission of fossil fuels.  The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address climate change in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on climate change in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year. U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to the hearing to describe their views on “the best science now available” on global warming and rising sea levels. Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office 14 months ago, domestic climate change policy has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and said he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely. In court on Wednesday, Boutrous said Chevron supports a 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded it was “extremely likely” humans contribute to warming. However, Boutrous also said earlier IPCC reports were not as certain. The judge asked Boutrous if the other four companies agreed with his presentation, and Boutrous said he was only speaking for Chevron.  No attorneys for the other four companies answered questions at the hearing, though all generally acknowledge the reality of climate change. “I’m going to ask them at some point if they agree with everything you said,” Alsup said. All five companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for warming, which is caused by “billions” of parties and “complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.” Reporting by Dan Levine; editing by Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-climatechange-hearing/update-1-chevron-says-it-will-not-dispute-climate-science-in-u-s-lawsuit-idUKL1N1R312Y,21 Mar 2018,"A Chevron attorney said

2018-03-21,"(Adds quotes, detail) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, March 21 (Reuters) - NorthConnect, a planned private power cable between Norway and Scotland due to enter operations by 2023, could be cancelled as a result of Norway’s adoption of the EU’s latest energy legislation, the leader of the Norwegian parliament’s energy committee said on Wednesday. If the 2-billion-euro project is to go ahead, it would need to be transferred to state-owned grid Statnett, Espen Barth Eide also said, a day ahead of a vote in parliament regarding Norway’s adoption of the EU’s third energy package. “It will have to be transferred to Statnett,” Eide said. “It’s Statnett or nothing. Of course that will not automatically mean it will be built for sure. It will be evaluated.” Eide is a member of the main opposition Labour party, whose support is needed by Norway’s centre-right minority government to approve the latest EU energy legislation, required to maintain access and equal trade terms for its companies in the common market. Labour agreed to back the government on the vote but demanded concessions to secure Norway’s energy sovereignty, including allowing only state-owned power cables to be built. Norway’s influential energy unions have long lobbied against private cables, which were legalised under the previous government. Overturning that decision has been one of the Labour party’s promises before national elections last September. NorthConnect’s current owners are Norway’s Agder Energi , Lyse and E-CO as well as Sweden’s Vattenfall. Even if Statnett does take control of the project, the cable will be delayed, Eide said. “In any case, NorthConnect will come later than the original plan. It will be years. Firstly we will have to assess Statnett’s cables that are now under construction,” he said. Another Labour demand is postponing decisions to construct any future cables until Statnett completes two interconnectors it is currently building to Britain and Germany. After these are built, their impact will be evaluated and only then can the Norwegian state decide to proceed with any other cables, said Eide. There have been concerns that British plans for more power links with Europe to avert a looming electricity shortfall could be hindered if the country no longer has a say in European Union regulation of networks and power trading. Britain faces an energy supply crunch by the early 2020s as coal power stations close and its oil and gas production declines. To help boost supply, it plans new interconnectors with France, Denmark, Belgium and Norway to provide up to 14 gigawatts of additional capacity. Its current four interconnectors with Europe provide around 4 GW of capacity. But if Britain leaves the EU, it might have to leave the bloc’s rule-making internal energy market (IEM) which coordinates access to energy across the EU.

2018-03-21,"(Updates throughout following Fed meeting) By David Randall NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - A rise in oil prices to a six-week high and signs that U.S. inflation remains in check helped reverse a day-long decline in world equity markets Wednesday. The Federal Reserve raised benchmark U.S. interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, as expected, at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting and said growth in the U.S. economy continues to look strong. The Fed’s measures of inflation were little changed, helping reassure investors that the U.S. central bank may not raise rates more than three times this year. “The positive for the market is that the focus on future rate hikes seems more due to a Fed view of a better economy than necessarily inflation prevention. If the economy can grow with moderate inflation, that is certainly the ideal situation for stocks,” said Rick Meckler, president at LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 190.7 points, or 0.77 percent, to 24,917.97, the S&P 500 gained 15.12 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,732.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.91 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,395.21. World markets had traded lower earlier after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was planning counter-measures against U.S. trade tariffs. European shares fell and investors scurried for the safety of German government bonds and the Japanese yen. Shares of Facebook Inc rebounded 1 percent after two days of steep losses that had wiped some $50 billion off the value of shares of the social media company. Those declines, caused by uproar over the alleged misuse of user data, filtered through the tech sector, with technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 down 2 percent for the week to date. A pan-European equity index was off 0.2 percent after the WSJ report on China. The yen, typically bought during times of stress, rose to the day’s high versus the dollar around 106.26 yen. “So far, we have seen low-level (trade) skirmishes, which are not material enough to affect the world economy. But if we see retaliation, and significant trade disruptions, it’s a different order or magnitude (which) could begin to affect global growth forecasts,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The tech selloff was a serious setback to markets just as they recovered from an early-February selloff, Milligan said, noting tech had been “the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year.” The WSJ report on potential Chinese tariffs comes as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to announce on Friday up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods. He imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this month. This week’s meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the world’s 20 biggest economies failed to defuse tensions, with the G20 saying only that it recognized the need for more “dialogue and actions.” Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 gained 2.7 percent after a surprise decline in U.S. oil inventories and as worries persisted over rising tensions in the Middle East.

2018-03-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Mexico’s National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH)  urged the government on Wednesday to float a minority stake in national oil and gas firm Pemex on the Mexican stock exchange. Pemex controls the majority of hydrocarbon reserves in Mexico although the sector has been open to foreign investment in the past four years, but it lacks funds to properly explore and develop the assets, the regulator said. Juan Carlos Zepeda, president commissioner of CNH which is in charge of Mexico’s contracts with foreign energy firms, said constitutional changes were needed to allow a stake in Pemex to be sold while keeping the company under state control. “Allow Pemex to place shares in the market and raise capital,” he told Reuters in London, adding he expected a “more successful” IPO than the one by Brazil’s Petrobras in 2010. Petrobras raised $70 billion from its stake sale. Mexican President Enrique Nieto said in 2012, before he was elected, that Pemex could emulate the Petrobras IPO. But there has been little discussion of a sale since Mexico opened up the energy industry to private investment under its 2013 reforms. The front-runner in Mexico’s election in July, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been skeptical of Nieto’s energy reforms. “Regardless of the political party, regardless of the administration, ... there is no other alternative to make Pemex successful,” Zepeda said, adding Pemex “will keep deteriorating” if it did not raise capital in the market. Pemex’ production had fallen from about 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004 to about 1.9 million bpd now, Zepeda said, adding Pemex could exceed previous output peaks with more investment. “Pemex has all the reserves, the best exploration areas, but Pemex needs to move faster. Pemex needs to be able to invest more,” he said, adding Pemex would benefit from “farming out”, an industry term for offering stakes in blocks to other investors. “Pemex needs more capital to invest in its own projects,” the regulator said, adding Pemex needed to at least triple its annual capital spending that was now about $6.8 billion a year. Presidential-hopeful Lopez Obrador has said he would stop two oil and gas field auctions scheduled for July and September, if elected. Asked about those plans, Zepeda said the bidding process had already begun, adding: “Once you start the bidding process the only authority responsible for the bidding is CNH. So only CNH could stop the bidding process.”  Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Toby Chopra and Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex-ipo/update-2-mexico-regulator-wants-minority-stake-floated-in-state-oil-firm-pemex-idUKL8N1R35HL,21 Mar 2018,"* CNH says Pemex IPO needed regardless of election winner

2018-03-21,"* ILO experts to investigate allegations of labour violations * Complaint brought by Venezuela’s leading business group * Caracas government rejects inquiry, says it supports workers (Adds Venezuelan deputy labour minister remarks, new paras 3-4) GENEVA, March 21 (Reuters) - The International Labour Organization launched a commission of inquiry on Wednesday into complaints that Venezuela is violating standards including freedom of association and workers’ rights to organise, an ILO statement said. The rare decision by the United Nations agency’s governing body at a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday follows the cancellation of a high-level mission in January because the government excluded three of the nine trade unions that ILO officials had wanted to see. “We categorically express our disagreement to a commission of inquiry against our government,” Venezuela’s deputy labour minister, Jose Ramon Rivero, told the ILO. “We regret that Fedecamaras spokespeople are plotting, alongside an undemocratic wing of our country’s opposition to sabotage the municipal, regional and presidential elections on May 20.” Rivero was referring to a complaint brought in 2015 by the Fedecamaras business group, which has long been at odds with the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Fedecamaras said it was subjected to pressure and intimidation and that there was no dialogue with the authorities. A commission of three independent experts would examine allegations that the Venezuelan government had failed to comply with conventions on freedom of association, tripartite consultation and setting of minimum wages, an ILO statement said on Wednesday. Tripartite consultations refer to talks between a government and employers’ and workers’ groups. The complaint “alleges attacks, harassment, aggression and a campaign to discredit the employers’ organisation – Fedecamaras – its leaders and affiliates”, the ILO statement added. It also alleged a lack of consultation with Fedecamaras on laws and the adoption of “numerous increases to the minimum wage without consultation with employer and worker representatives”, it said. Venezuela’s socialist government has long touted its support of workers, regularly holding labour marches, changing legislation that had been in favour of employers and increasing the minimum wage. Maduro, a former bus driver, constantly refers to himself as Venezuela`s first “worker president”. However, a crippling economic crisis has left millions earning the equivalent of only a dollar or two a month, at the black market rate, and struggling to find food and medicine. The ILO governing body is composed of 28 governments, 14 employers’ representatives and 14 workers’ representatives. The last such ILO investigation involved Zimbabwe in 2008 and there have been only 12 in the past 60 years, including on forced labour under Myanmar’s military junta, ILO spokesman Hans von Rohland said.

2018-03-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Compliance with a global deal to cut oil supply hit a new high in February and an inventory glut is shrinking fast, a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee said, bringing producers close to the pact’s original aim. OPEC and its allies achieved 138 percent of pledged output reductions last month, OPEC said, up from 133 percent in January and the highest since the deal aimed at clearing a glut began in January 2017.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-OPEC producers have extended the pact until the end of 2018, even though OPEC sources say the market is now expected to balance between the second and third quarters. A rapidly shrinking glut will fuel debate over how long the curbs need to be in place, although top exporter Saudi Arabia has said it is too early to discuss an exit strategy. A ministerial panel meets to review the deal in April. “The committee stressed that all participating countries should strive to achieve or exceed full conformity with their voluntary production adjustments,” the OPEC statement said. “February continued the accelerated rebalancing path witnessed in recent months.” The supply cut’s original aim was to shrink oil inventories in developed economies to their five-year average. Stocks in February were 44 million barrels above that level, OPEC said, the closest the group has come to the target. “Stocks can now be considered as close to normal levels,” an OPEC source said.  The compliance figures reflect both high adherence by top exporter Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC countries, as well as an involuntary slide in production in Venezuela, whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis. OPEC’s deal has helped boost oil prices LCOc1, which topped $71 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014 and were above $69 on Wednesday, supported by a surprise decline in U.S. inventories. While developed-country oil stocks are dropping closer to the five-year average, OPEC is talking of adjusting the metric to give a more complete picture of the supply cut. The committee, which met at OPEC’s Vienna headquarters on Monday, discussed this issue but made no conclusions, sources familiar with the matter said. To get a broader picture, producers could look at a longer period than five years, or take into account inventories in other countries, floating storage and oil in transit, OPEC officials have said. The committee includes officials from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Algeria, plus non-OPEC Russia and Oman.

PetroChina paid a participation fee of 2.1 billion dirhams ($575 million) for the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession and a fee of 2.2 billion dirhams ($600 million) for the Lower Zakum concession, ADNOC said in a statement. In the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession, PetroChina joins France’s TOTAL and Italy’s Eni which were recently awarded a 20 percent and 10 percent stake respectively. In the Lower Zakum concession, CNPC joins an Indian consortium led by ONGC Videsh, Japan’s INPEX , TOTAL and Eni. ADNOC retains a 60 percent majority share in both concessions. “These agreements strengthen our growing relationship with ADNOC, and will help to meet China’s expanding demand for energy and contribute to asset portfolio optimization and profitability enhancement of PetroChina,” Wang Yilin, who is chairman of both PetroChina and CNPC, said in a statement. The 40-year agreements are backdated to March 9, 2018, ADNOC said. In February 2017, CNPC, China’s largest oil and gas producer, was awarded an 8 percent interest in Abu Dhabi’s onshore concession, operated by ADNOC Onshore. It also has a 40 percent stake in the Al Yasat concession with ADNOC. “Energy cooperation is an increasingly important aspect of the UAE’s relations with China, the No. 1 oil importer globally and a major growth market for our products and petrochemicals,” ADNOC Group Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed al Jaber said in the statement. The statement said the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession and the Lower Zakum concession had been created after splitting the former ADMA offshore concession, which expired on March 8, into three separate ones to maximise commercial values, broaden the partner base and enable greater market access.

2018-03-21,"BEIRUT/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran played a significant role in defeating Islamic State in the Middle East and has brought stability to most of the region, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday. Shi’ite Muslim Iran has been locked in a regional power struggle with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia that has spilled into the wars in Syria and Yemen, where they have backed opposing sides, and fuelled political rivalries in Iraq and Lebanon. Tehran has accused Riyadh of supporting the Sunni militant Islamic State, an accusation Saudi officials have denied.  “The Islamic Republic played a significant role in the defeat of takfiri groups in the region,” Khamenei said in a speech broadcast live on state TV. “The Islamic Republic brought stability to most of the region. These are huge achievements.” Officials in Iran use the term “takfiri” to refer to Sunni Muslim religious extremists such as Islamic State, which lost control over large tracts of Syria and Iraq to counter-attacking military forces over the past two years. Khamenei said U.S. policy had effectively created Islamic State and said Washington was incapable of fostering stability in the region. He cited the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, where American troops have fought the Sunni militant Taliban for more than 16 years, as an example. “(Americans) say they had a role in the defeat of Daesh,” Khamenei said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. “That’s a lie.” U.S. President Donald Trump gave a warm welcome to powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in Washington on Tuesday and criticised Iran’s involvement in the wider Middle East. Khamenei also said Iran does not interfere in the affairs of other countries in the region and only assists governments who ask for the Islamic Republic’s help. Tehran backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against mainly Sunni rebels and militants in Syria, and the dominant Houthi militia in Yemen.   Trump sent greetings on Monday to Iranians celebrating their New Year holiday, known as Nowruz, but used the message to lambast the Tehran leadership, particularly the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Trump said Tehran had spent more than $16 billion to prop up Assad and back militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to fight the Houthis and try to restore the internationally recognised government. During the meeting with Prince Mohammed on Tuesday, Trump held up charts to show the depth of Saudi purchases of U.S. military hardware, ranging from ships to missile defence to planes and fighting vehicles. Prince Mohammed has previously said that Iran’s regional ambitions should be thwarted inside the Islamic Republic. Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of a landmark 2015 agreement between six world powers and Tehran which limited Iran’s nuclear programme in return for a lifting of sanctions. U.S. sanctions against Iran will resume unless Trump issues new “waivers” to suspend them on May 12. The United States will not realise its objectives in the region, Khamenei said in his Nowruz speech. “Without a doubt, America will not achieve its goals in the region and we will achieve our goals with the help of God,” Khamenei said.

2018-03-21,"(Updates throughout with additional data and comments) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week as imports dropped and refining rates jumped, while gasoline and distillate inventories also declined, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell 2.6 million barrels in the week to March 16, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.6 million barrels. Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose 905,000 barrels, EIA said. U.S. crude futures extended gains after the report, and were up $1.26 a barrel at $64.80 by 10:58 a.m. EDT [1458 GMT). Brent crude increased $1.64 to $69.06 a barrel. “The report was supportive of prices, as a large jump up in the refinery utilization rate and lowered crude oil imports combined to cause a net drawdown,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. The bullish report was somewhat tempered by U.S. crude production, which climbed to a fresh record of 10.4 million barrels per day in the week. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 594,000 bpd. Refinery crude runs rose 410,000 bpd and refinery utilization rates jumped 1.7 percentage points to 91.7 percent of total capacity, EIA data showed. “Refinery runs continue to exude strength. They are nearly a million barrels per day higher than year-ago levels, led by Gulf Coast refining activity knocking on the door of 9 million barrels per day,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. Gasoline stocks fell 1.7 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.0 million-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 2.0 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.7 million barrels drop, the EIA data showed.

2018-03-21,"(Adds Facebook comment) NEW DELHI, March 21 (Reuters) - India’s information technology minister on Wednesday warned against any abuse of social media in elections, following reports that a British consultancy improperly accessed information on millions of Facebook users to target U.S. voters. India is due to hold a national election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and next. “Abuse of social media including Facebook cannot be allowed to impact the fairness of elections,” Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters. “In the wake of recent data theft from Facebook, let my stern warning be heard across the Atlantic, far away in California. Any covert or overt attempt to misuse social media including Facebook to influence India’s electoral process through undesirable means will neither be tolerated, nor be permitted.” Facebook said Prasad had raised several important questions and the company appreciates his attention to this matter. “We will continue to engage with the government on this matter. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peoples’ information and will take whatever steps are required that this happens,” the company said in a statement. British consultancy Cambridge Analytica has denied media accusations that it improperly accessed millions of Facebook users’ information and said it deleted the data after learning that it did not adhere to data protection rules. Facebook has said it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015. (Reporting by Krishna N.

2018-03-21,"NEW YORK, March 21, 2018 - World shares fell on Wednesday and the U.S. dollar eased off three-week highs as market participants awaited a likely increase in U.S. interest rates and guidance on how many more to expect for this year. Investors were also spooked by signs of a brewing global trade war after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was planning counter-measures against U.S. trade tariffs. European shares fell and investors scurried for the safety of German government bonds and the Japanese yen. U.S. stocks, which were roiled by a hefty selloff in technology shares this week, were down in early trading.. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.09 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,699.18, the S&P 500 lost 3.47 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,713.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,356.96. A selloff this week wiped some $50 billion off the value of shares of social media giant Facebook. That has left investors on edge as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise U.S. rates for the first time this year after a two-day policy meeting. The Facebook losses, caused by uproar over the alleged misuse of user data, filtered through the tech sector, with technology companies in the benchmark S&P 500 down 2 percent for the week to date. Facebook shares rose 0.2 percent in morning trading Wednesday. A pan-European equity index fell almost 0.3 percent, its early weakness accelerating after the WSJ report on China and a tech shares index reversing an early bounce. The yen, typically bought during times of stress, rose to the day’s high versus the dollar around 106.26. “So far, we have seen low-level (trade) skirmishes, which are not material enough to affect the world economy. But if we see retaliation, and significant trade disruptions, it’s a different order or magnitude, could begin to affect global growth forecasts,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The tech selloff was a serious setback to markets just as they recovered from an early-February selloff, Milligan said, noting tech had been “the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year.” MSCI’s all-country equity market index flatlined , and is now 6 percent off January’s record highs, pressured by the trade war fears and the possibility that the Fed will tighten policy more than expected. Emerging market stocks lost 0.10 percent. The U.S. central bank has raised borrowing costs five times since late 2015. Markets are pricing in three rate increases this year, but some worry policymakers might squeeze in a fourth, triggering a bond and equity selloff. Expectations of further rate hikes sent the dollar to nearly three-week highs on Tuesday, but it eased back a quarter percent against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, having lost almost half a percent this month. The WSJ report on potential Chinese tariffs comes as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to announce on Friday up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods. He imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month. This week’s meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies failed to diffuse tensions, with the G20 saying only that it “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions.” Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil, lifting Brent futures almost half a percent. U.S. crude rose 1.34 percent to $64.39 per barrel and Brent was at $68.47, up 1.56 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.8996 percent, from 2.881 percent late on Tuesday.

2018-03-21,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U pgrading Asia-Pacific’s biggest ports to cope with the effects of climate change will cost up to $49 billion, but the bill could be even higher if no action is taken, researchers said. Sustainability consultancy Asia Research and Engagement (ARE) analysed the risks to 53 of the region’s largest ports and estimated costs for them to adapt to rising sea levels and storm surges. Benjamin McCarron, managing director at ARE, predicted “increasing damage to ports” from storms and related stoppages in operations if measures are not taken to prepare for global warming impacts, including more extreme weather. “That kind of disruption would grow and continue,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ARE’s report - commissioned by international bank HSBC - covered ports in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, India, South Korea and Malaysia. It put the costs for those ports to adapt to climate change at between $31 billion and $49 billion. Japan’s Kitakyushu port faces the highest cost at $4.9 billion, the report said, while five of the region’s 10 largest ports by capacity could see bills of more than $1 billion each. Indonesia’s Cilacap could take steps to deal with climate change most cheaply at $65 million, the report said. It is more expensive to fix up ports with large areas covered by warehouses than those made up mainly of yards, which can be elevated relatively easily using concrete, said McCarron. Port owners should factor the report’s findings into their long-term plans and upgrades, while banks, insurance companies and other investors should question port operators about the resilience of their assets, he added. Incorporating climate protection at the design stage is cheaper than doing so once a port is built, McCarron said. The report also urged financial backers of new infrastructure, like China’s “Belt and Road” initiative, to ensure they include climate projections in construction plans to avoid higher costs in the future. ""This report is designed to start conversations amongst those who use and finance sea-ports in Asia by asking the multi-billion dollar question: Are you ready for climate change?""

2018-03-21,"BERLIN (Reuters) - PSA Group (PEUP.PA) published on Wednesday a production plan for Europe that excluded Germany, where the French carmaker remains  in talks with unions over the newly-acquired Opel business.  The maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars has repeatedly criticised high production costs at loss-making Opel, which it bought last year from General Motors (GM.N). Opel said separately that investments in new products would be made in Germany, but future spending required a deal with labour bosses to bring about “competitive structures.” PSA, Europe’s second-biggest carmaker by sales, said it would overhaul assembly of engines and transmissions across Europe as it moves to integrate Opel and respond to falling demand for diesel engined cars. Output of 3-cylinder turbo gasoline engines will be raised by doubling capacity at French sites in Douvrin and Tremery compared with 2016 levels, and by expanding production to Poland and Hungary, it said. With regulators setting ambitious goals to slash emissions and public debate about possible driving bans for older models, sales of diesel cars declined 8 percent in Europe last year, further reducing their market share. Automatic transmissions that to date have been assembled in Japan and China will from next year also be made in Valenciennes, France, PSA said.  Separately, a factory in Tremery, France, will be prepared to start making electric engines from next year and to increase that output further from 2021, it added. “The decisions taken today give further proof of the large potential that is implied with the integration of Opel/Vauxhall into PSA,” Opel chief executive Michael Lohscheller said.

2018-03-21,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s state oil company Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) did not make a commercial oil discovery in the Black Sea as the well they were drilling proved to be dry, a source close to the operations told Reuters on Wednesday.  Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin, has partnered with a number of foreign companies to develop Russia’s offshore regions, though western sanctions have forced some of its partners such as ExxonMobil (XOM.N) to suspend projects. Sechin has counted on the Black Sea as an area with high potential and any discovery would help send a message that the sanctions will not seriously hamper Rosneft’s global standing or cooperation with other global players.  But the well, “Maria-1”, which Rosneft and Eni started to drill in December, did not bring the desired results, a source close to operations said. Rosneft had planned a second well if the first showed hydrocarbon potential. “There will be nothing. Nothing was found,” the source familiar with the operation said. “Demobilisation (of equipment) has started.” Eni, which holds a 33.33 percent stake in the Zapadno-Chernomorskaya project, declined to comment.  In the Black Sea, Rosneft faces a technically challenging project. “Not a single well has been drilled in the deep water Russian offshore (in the Black Sea),” Sechin said back in December.   The ultra-deep-water prospecting and appraisal well was drilled using the Scarabeo-9 rig and Rosneft said this week it had a target depth of 6,126 metres. Contrary to previous statements when Rosneft has discovered oil, on Wednesday the company confirmed that drilling was complete and referred only to finding a “carbonate structure”. “As a result of the work, a unique carbonate structure... was discovered, which is a fractured reservoir that is highly likely to contain hydrocarbons,” Rosneft said, without giving details of how much or what type of hydrocarbons the structure may contain. “The obtained results inspire confidence in the discovery of large oil and gas deposits in the Russian area of the Black Sea,” Rosneft said, adding that it will now carefully study the material received by the drilling.   The wording contrasts with Rosneft’s statement following the completion of drilling on the first well in its Kara Sea project in September 2014. Back then, Rosneft reported it found oil and Sechin took a group of reporters and TV crews to the Kara Sea. Valery Nesterov, an analyst with Sberbank CIB, said that given there was no information about any oil flow from the “Maria-1” well, Rosneft may need additional drilling.  “The issue of carbonate structures is a high oil movement inside a layer,” Nesterov said. The high movement means that oil can migrate from one part of the structure to another and can be hard to track, if at all. According to ThomsonReuters tracking data, the Scarabeo-9 rig started to move to the Romanian port of Constanta on March 19 and is expected to arrive there on March 24.  Eni, in contrast to its global peers, does not yet have any oil producing projects in Russia and has teamed up with Rosneft in the Black Sea and the Barents Sea in Russia’s Arctic.    Nesterov said that it was important to note that Eni has not pulled out of the partnership with Rosneft, despite what he described as ‘not very active’ cooperation. “Eni does not announce the exit and this is positive,” he said.  Rosneft said last December that oil resources in the licence area in the Black Sea were estimated at over 570 million tonnes, or equal to more than two years of Rosneft’s current oil production.  The partnership has yet to begin drilling in the Barents Sea.

2018-03-21,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will prudently advance cooperation with the Philippines on joint oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea, China’s top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi said on Wednesday after meeting his Philippine counterpart. Any potential deals between Manila and Beijing on energy exploration in the disputed waterway should be agreed with a company and not the Chinese government, a senior Philippine official said earlier this month. China claims most of the South China Sea, a key trade route and home to areas that are believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas. Along with China, parts of the South China Sea are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. The two countries in February agreed to set up a special panel to work out how they can jointly explore offshore oil and gas in areas both sides claim, without needing to address the touchy issue of sovereignty. Speaking to reporters in Beijing after meeting Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, Wang said the South China Sea will be turned into a source of friendship and cooperation. “We will enhance maritime dialogue and pursue equal footed and friendly consultation and in a prudent and steady way advance cooperation on offshore oil and gas exploration,” Wang said, without giving details. However, pursuing a joint project would be extremely complex and sensitive, as sharing oil and gas reserves could be seen as endorsing the other countries’ claims. “The Philippines and China are finding a common legal framework to conduct joint exploration and surveys. And with our discussions today I’m confident that we will find a suitable legal framework for our differences,” Cayetano said. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has said China has proposed joint exploration that was “like co-ownership” and better than the two fighting over it. The Philippines suspended exploration in the Reed Bank in 2014 to pursue a legal challenge to China’s territorial claims. Included in a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague was a clarification of Manila’s sovereign right to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, within its 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. The Philippines, China’s CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK) and state-owned PetroVietnam jointly surveyed the Reed Bank from 2003 to 2008. The Philippines’ ties with China have warmed under Duterte, who has put aside territorial disputes in exchange for trade opportunities and pledged financing for infrastructure projects. Cayetano said Duterte would visit China next month to attend an economic forum on the southern island province of Hainan and meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.

2018-03-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is placing a big bet on petrol stations and convenience stores in China, India and Mexico as it looks to shore up profits during the electric car revolution. By 2025, the oil and gas giant plans to grow its global network of roadside stations by nearly a quarter to 55,000, targeting 40 million daily customers, Shell said in a statement on Wednesday.  It will add another 5,000 convenience stores selling coffee and snacks, with growth focused on rapidly growing economies in emerging markets. Shell, as well as rivals such as BP (BP.L), sees retail as a way to secure demand for the fuels it refines, as consumption could peak as early as by the end of the next decade due to the growth in electric vehicles. Already in 2017, marketing accounted for around a quarter of Shell’s earnings. “We plan to be leading through the energy transition,” Shell head of downstream John Abbott said in an investor presentation on Wednesday. Already one of the world’s biggest retailers with a well known brand, Shell expects earning from its marketing and commercial businesses to grow annually by 7 percent into 2025, when it will deliver $4 billion in earnings. Around half of the new petrol stations will be built in fast growing economies, mostly in China, India, Indonesia, Russia and Mexico, where Shell’s market share is smaller compared to local companies, Istvan Kapitany, Shell’s head of retail said. “These markets will produce half of the oil (demand) growth by 2025,” Kapitany said. The company is also rolling out a number of experimental initiatives to introduce electric battery chargers and hydrogen chargers to its traditional petrol stations, hoping to capture some of the growth in the non-combustion engines. The fuel marketing sector nevertheless faces a risk of overcrowding as many companies see growth potential there, warned Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.     “We are more sceptical on Shell’s plans in retail, as the market is fiercely competitive and the ongoing threat of EVs (electric vehicles) could put some of that earnings stream at risk.”  (Graphic: Shell earnings - reut.rs/2FZThQv) The Anglo-Dutch company said its downstream business, which includes refining, trading, marketing and chemicals, will  generate $6-$7 billion in organic free cash flow per year by 2020 based on a Brent crude oil price of $60 a barrel.  Free cash generation for the whole company is expected to reach $25-$30 billion over the same period. Shell delivered $15 billion in organic free cash flow in 2017.  By 2025, cashflow from downstream is expected to grow to $9-$12 billion.    (Graphic: Shell earnings - reut.rs/2G0GhtM) Downstream proved its importance during the oil industry’s downturn since 2014, providing the bulk of Shell’s profits as the price of crude collapsed. Shell has in recent years transformed its downstream business by selling some plants and upgrading others, helping the company ride out oil price fluctuations and shifts in demand. The company is also bracing for a world of “lower for longer” oil prices due to rising oil supplies, particularly from the United States. Shell and others cut tens of thousands of jobs, lowered spending and brought in new technology to simplify field designs and operations. Shell also said it plans to invest $7 billion to $9 billion a year across the business and expects to deliver a return on average capital employed of more than 15 percent.  Shell shares were down 0.2 percent by 1226 GMT, roughly in line with the broader energy index .SXEP.

2018-03-21,"* Upstream budget for 2018 at 26 bln rgt * Spending still half 2015 upstream budget * Petronas suspends sale of stake in SK316 gas block (Adds additional comments on upstream plans) By A. Ananthalakshmi KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Reuters) - Malaysian state energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) is increasing capital expenditure for upstream activities slightly in 2018 from last year, upstream chief executive Mohd Anuar Taib said on Wednesday. Petronas, like other oil majors, was hit by the plunge in oil prices from mid-2014 highs, but sharp cost cuts since then and a modest price recovery that began last year has helped the firm boost profits so it can spend more. Petronas allocated 26 billion ringgit ($6.6 billion) for upstream expenditure in 2018, Anuar said, adding this was slightly more than 2017 although he did not give a precise comparison. This is still little more than half the 48.7 billion ringgit spent on upstream activities in 2015. “We want the capital discipline. The challenge we have seen in the past is that when everybody starts going for activities at the same time, then the whole supply chain is stretched. That adds to the costs,” Anuar told reporters on the sidelines of the OTC Asia conference. He said Petronas would drill about 110 to 120 wells this year, and maintain exploration at 23 to 25 wells in Malaysia. Petronas was looking at exploration in Southeast Asia and wanted to develop assets in the region with partners, he said. The firm is also looking at growth opportunities in the Middle East, Anuar said, without giving details. Petronas won six of 19 Gulf of Mexico deepwater oil and gas blocks awarded in an auction this year, after previously picking up three other blocks in the area. Petronas, Malaysia’s only Fortune 500 company, is a key contributor to government coffers and is one of the country’s largest employers with a workforce of more than 50,000. After oil prices plunged from above $110 a barrel in mid-2014 to below $30 in early 2016, Petronas said it would slash spending by 50 billion ringgit in the following four years. It put several projects on hold and said it would sell some assets. Oil prices have since recovered some ground. Benchmark Brent was trading around $68 a barrel on Wednesday. Petronas kicked off a process last year to sell a stake of up to 49 percent, worth an estimated $1 billion, in the SK316 offshore gas block in the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak, Reuters reported. Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production, Total and some Japanese firms have expressed interest. PTT said earlier on Wednesday it was in a second round of bidding for the stake. But Anuar said on Wednesday the gas block stake sale process had been suspended, without explaining why. “We have stopped the divestment process,” he said. $1 = 3.9240 ringgit

Markets were also spooked by signs of a brewing global trade war - a Wall Street Journal report saying China was planning counter-measures against U.S. trade tariffs. European shares fell and investors scurried for the safety of German government bonds and the Japanese yen. And equity futures indicated that U.S. stocks, which have been roiled by a hefty selloff in technology shares this week, are set for another weak session. The selloff wiped some $50 billion off the value of social media giant Facebook, leaving investors on edge as the Federal Reserve prepares to raise U.S. rates for the first time this year. The Facebook losses, caused by uproar over the alleged misuse of user data, have filtered through the tech sector, with shares in Twitter falling more than 10 percent on Tuesday. A pan-European equity index fell almost 0.3 percent, its early weakness accelerating after the WSJ report on China and a tech shares index reversing an early bounce. The yen, typically bought during times of stress, rose to the day’s high versus the dollar around 106.26. “So far, we have seen low-level (trade) skirmishes, which are not material enough to affect the world economy. But if we see retaliation, and significant trade disruptions, it’s a different order or magnitude, could begin to affect global growth forecasts,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. The tech selloff is a serious setback to markets just as they recover from an early-February selloff, Milligan said, noting tech had been “the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year.” MSCI’s all-country equity index flatlined MIWD00000PUS>, and is now 6 percent off January’s record highs, pressured by the trade war fears and the possibility that the Fed will tighten policy more than expected. The U.S. central bank has raised borrowing costs five times since late 2015. Markets are pricing in three rate increases this year, but some reckon policymakers might squeeze in a fourth, triggering a bond and equity selloff. The 1800 GMT announcement will also be the first under new Fed chair Jerome Powell. “We might have significant changes in communication compared with what we’ve seen under (previous chair Janet) Yellen,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “The economic situation post-tax cuts also justifies a significant shift upwards in the dot plot,” he added, referring to fears the Fed’s de facto policy forecast chart will signal four rate rises rather than three because of the effects of U.S. tax reforms. Those expectations had sent the dollar to nearly three-week highs on Tuesday, but it eased back a quarter percent against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, having lost almost half a percent this month. The dollar’s weakness — it fell 10 percent last year —  is at least partly down to U.S. capital seeking to invest overseas amid robust world growth. Milligan said that would continue unless trade skirmishes started hurting the world economy or U.S. growth accelerated further. “To get the dollar higher, we will need a combination of the Fed being more aggressive and signalling more changes for 2019,” he said. The WSJ report on potential Chinese tariffs comes as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to announce on Friday up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods. He imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month. This week’s meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies failed to diffuse tensions, with the G20 said only it “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions”. The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars and most emerging currencies fell. The Aussie traded near three-month troughs against the dollar of $0.7679 and the Kiwi hit its lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar held at $1.3029 after dropping to $1.3124 on Monday, its weakest since mid-2017. The Mexican peso was up almost 1 percent against the dollar after reports the United States had dropped a demand that vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico should contain 50 percent U.S. content. Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil, lifting Brent futures almost half a percent. Copper prices in Shanghai fell to their lowest in almost six month, their fourth straight day of losses. The WSJ report fuelled some buying of German bonds, pushing the 10-year yield off the day’s highs. The yield was just one basis point higher on the day at 0.59 percent.

2018-03-21,"BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers backed draft rules on Wednesday to extend the bloc’s internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines such as Russia’s planned Nord Stream 2 link to Germany. Lawmakers on the European Parliament’s industry committee voted 41 votes to 13 in favour of the European Commission’s proposal, with 9 abstentions. The vote puts pressure on EU governments to also decide on a proposal on which they have so far failed to agree. The Commission’s proposal is supported by east European and Baltic countries, which fear the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline will undercut EU efforts to reduce dependence on Moscow and EU support for Ukraine by depriving it of gas transit fees. The pipeline’s backers, including Germany, oppose the rule change as an attempt to block what they see as a commercial project to pump 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year under the Baltic Sea. In its current form, the Nord Stream 2 project, fully owned by Russia’s gas export monopoly Gazprom, does not comply with the EU’s so-called third energy package rules. “It’s too difficult to find a compromise,” one EU diplomat said of the last round of talks among EU nations last week. “It’s likely it won’t go anywhere.” An EU legal opinion this month rejecting the proposal by the EU executive has fuelled such doubts. Jerzy Buzek, a Polish member of the European Parliament, who steered the file through the chamber, argued the rule change would create greater long-term investment predictability and improve competition. “Far too often, gas supply has been used as a political weapon,” Buzek said in a statement. “We cannot disarm the impure intentions of others but we can arm ourselves with full legal clarity and consistency of existing legislation.” The Commission last year proposed the changes to its gas directive to make all import pipelines subject to rules that require they not be owned directly by gas suppliers, apply non-discriminatory tariffs and make capacity available to third parties. EU officials say negotiations with Moscow may be needed over the pipeline, which begins outside EU jurisdiction on Russia’s shores. The draft endorsed by Parliament calls for European Union economic sanctions against third countries to be taken into account and any exemption for pipelines to be limited to five years and decided with the input of the Commission and affected member states. Five European energy firms are financing Nord Stream 2: German energy groups Uniper and Wintershall , Anglo-Dutch group Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie.

2018-03-21,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Uber has suspended road tests of self-driving vehicles after the first pedestrian was killed by one of its vehicles operating under autonomous computer control. Proponents of self-driving vehicles claim they would be safer, as well as more energy efficient, but those safety claims will now come under heightened scrutiny. In theory, self-driving vehicles should eliminate several major driver-related causes of road traffic accidents, including excessive speed, intoxication and inattention. But there are concerns about how self-driving vehicles will interact with unpredictable human drivers and pedestrians as well as unmapped hazards such as temporary road obstructions. There are also fears about how self-driving vehicles would cope with hacking or widespread disruption of their communications systems (“Too much sun could wreak havoc on driverless cars”, Bloomberg, March 16). The accident investigation into Sunday’s crash will mark an important test of the technology but also of the ability of politicians, regulators and the media to think about risk in an intelligent way. All transportation is fraught with risk and road transport is particularly dangerous even with a human behind the wheel (“Self-driving Uber cars kills Arizona woman crossing street”, Reuters, March 20). Every year, there are more than 6 million reported crashes involving motor vehicles in the United States, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Motor vehicle safety data”, BTS, 2017). In 2016, almost 40,000 people were killed in transport-related accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (“U.S. transportation fatalities 2015-2016”, NTSB, 2017). Of those, more than 95 percent were killed in accidents involving motor vehicles (37,461), dwarfing the number killed on the railroads (733), marine transport (730), aviation (412) and pipelines (16). Road traffic fatalities included nearly 6,000 pedestrians, over 5,000 motorcyclists and 840 pedal-cyclists (“Fatal motor vehicle crashes overview”, U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017). Road traffic crashes are the number one cause of death for young people between the ages of 8 and 24, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. And they are one of the top two causes of accidental death for people in all age groups (“Motor vehicle traffic crashes as a leading cause of death in the United States”, NHTSA, 2018). In a worrying trend, U.S. roads appear to have become more dangerous in the last few years, reversing the downtrend over the previous quarter of a century. The number of crashes, injuries and fatalities has been growing faster than highway traffic volumes since around 2015. Road deaths rose to 1.18 per 100 million miles driven in 2016 up from 1.15 in 2015 and a recent low of 1.08 in 2014. The trend among pedestrians has been particularly worrying, with fatalities surging by 9 percent in 2016 to the highest level since 1990. Many road accidents have been attributed in whole or part to driver misbehaviour. Alcohol was involved in more than 10,000 fatalities in 2016. Speed in more than 10,000. And distraction in more than 3,000. Driving is already relatively dangerous in the United States, so the question is whether self-driving vehicles increase or reduce the existing risks, not whether they can eliminate risk altogether. So far, self-driving vehicles have completed fewer than 10 million miles of on-highway tests (“Self-driving cars under scrutiny after pedestrian death”, Financial Times, March 19). Supporters and critics have long acknowledged the inevitability of a self-driving vehicle being involved in a serious accident, and eventually being the cause of a fatality. Some had hoped self-driving vehicles would log 100 million miles or more before the first fatal accident to prove they are safer. But that shows a misunderstanding of how statistics work, since the first fatal accident is as likely to occur on the first mile as on the 100-millionth mile (assuming the safety level remains constant). Until self-driving vehicles are tested on actual roads for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of miles it will not be possible to evaluate their safety relative to human-operated vehicles. The advent of self-driving vehicles poses complicated questions about safety but is no different from any other new technology. Every new technology is initially beset by accidents, and that has been particularly true in transportation, where early steam engines, automobiles and aircraft were all initially accident-prone. All federal safety regulation in the United States stems originally from the response to the problem of exploding steam boilers in the nineteenth century (“Bursting boilers and the federal power”, Burke, 1966). The advent of high-pressure steam engines on riverboats prompted a spate of explosions killing crew, passengers, and unlucky bystanders. Between 1818 and 1824, 47 lives were lost in 15 boiler explosions on steamboats. Between 1825 and 1830 there were 42 explosions killing 273 people. One particularly serious explosion aboard the steamboat “Helen McGregor” near Memphis reportedly killed 50-60 people. “The many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that portion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities of the country,” President Andrew Jackson wrote in his State of the Union message to Congress in 1833. “The fact that the number of those fatal disasters is constantly increasing, notwithstanding the great improvements which are everywhere made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances which have made in that branch of science, shows very clearly that they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence.” “That these evils may be greatly lessened, if not substantially removed, by means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly probable.” The eventual response after many years of delay was a system of safety regulation including boiler standards and inspections. The arrival of the internal combustion engine and the automobile generated a similar surge of accidents among drivers and pedestrians and a legal and regulatory response. Early aircraft, too, were far more prone to mechanical failure or pilot error than has been the case in recent years. But no one would now suggest steam boilers, automobiles or aircraft are simply too dangerous to be practical - any more than in future people will think self-driving vehicles are too dangerous. In every case of new technology, safety lessons have been learned through a painful process of trial and error that has unfortunately cost lives. Self-driving vehicles will be no different. The challenge is to introduce sensible and balanced safety regulations while encouraging continued development of a technology that has potential to save lives and bring a range of other benefits. That requires a very transparent approach from the technology companies and a calm and reasoned response from politicians, regulators and journalists.

2018-03-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain intends to remain in Europe’s emission trading system (ETS) until at least the end of its third trading phase running from 2013-2020, Britain’s energy minister said on Wednesday. The status of Britain’s participation in the scheme following the country’s exit from the European Union in March 2019 had been unclear until now. Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said it had yet to be formally agreed with European lawmakers but the government wanted to provide certainty for companies covered by the scheme until at least the end of phase three. She was speaking to members of the cross-party EU Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, in the upper house of parliament. Britain is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases in Europe and as a result its utilities and industry are among the largest buyers of permits in ETS, which charges power plants and factories for every ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit. Companies from these sectors have urged Britain to stay in the scheme until the end of the current trading phase to avoid disruption, but are divided over Britain’s longer term participation in the scheme. Perry said Britain is committed to using a price on carbon as a means to reduce emissions but would use the country’s exit from the European Union to “take the opportunity to see if there are other opportunities” to achieve this. Rules of the ETS are set by the European Parliament, and enforced by the European Court of Justice, and industry experts have said it could be politically difficult to justify staying within the scheme. Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, such as those produced by fossil-fuel-based power plants, by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.

President Muhammadu Buhari presented a 2018 budget of 8.612 trillion naira, the country’s biggest ever, to lawmakers in November and was targeting Jan. 1, 2018 for its passage. But government agencies and department had been slow in defending their spending plan before lawmakers, which prompted the president to intervene. Dogara said the budget would be laid out on April 19 and passed the following week. Both houses of parliament had agreed to the dates, he added. Last year’s budget - passed in May 2017 - was delayed for months due to disagreements between lawmakers and the presidency, cutting the supply of government money and deepening an economic crisis. The budget was also delayed in 2016. Nigeria’s upper house of parliament is set to decide on Wednesday whether to end a political stalemate and confirm Buhari’s nominations for members of the central bank’s interest rate-setting committee. This would pave the way for the committee’s first meeting since the beginning of the year.

2018-03-21,"(Repeats to widen distribution with no changes) By Corina Pons and Chen Aizhu CARACAS/BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - China is likely to extend an agreement proving crisis-stricken Venezuela with favorable loans repayment terms but will not lend fresh funds to President Nicolas Maduro’s government, according to sources in Caracas and Beijing familiar with the situation. During a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into the OPEC member’s coffers through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America. But the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms when a fall in oil prices  and declining crude output pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. Though unwilling to throw Venezuela a financial lifeline, the state-run China Development Bank (CDB) will likely extend next month a grace period begun in 2016 that allows Venezuela to make only interest payments on its loans, the sources said. However, China has ignored several requests for new funding. “Given Venezuela’s falling oil production, it’s natural for Chinese banks not to renew loans,” said one Chinese oil industry source who asked not to be identified. A second oil industry source, asked if the conditions would be tightened, cited a Chinese proverb, saying China would not “drop stones on somebody who has fallen into a well.” Venezuela still owes China $19.3 billion, according to one Venezuelan finance industry source who has tracked the information via contacts in both countries. Some $10.4 billion of that is owed under the $20 billion Large Volume Long Term fund signed in 2010. A further $8.4 billion remains outstanding under the Joint China Venezuela Fund via three tranches of $4 billion to $5 billion each, according to the source. China’s policy is not to lend new funds until old loans have been paid off - which cannot happen under the interest-only scheme created in April 2016 because the outstanding balance does not change. CDB President Zheng Zhijie, asked by Reuters if the bank was having second thoughts about financing Venezuela given its situation, said: “We’ve done our assessment of its political and economic situation. We’re just monitoring now.” However, one Beijing-based diplomatic source familiar with Chinese thinking on Venezuela said China increasingly sees Maduro as similar to former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who was pushed out after 40 years in power that dragged his once-prosperous country into hyperinflation and economic crisis. China would have no concern about abandoning Maduro as it did Mugabe when he was ousted, the source said, but does not expect China to take an active role in pushing him out. “China looks at Venezuela as another Zimbabwe: a poor return on its investment,” he said. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment. China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that bilateral cooperation was proceeding smoothly at present, adding that: “China will continue to carry out pragmatic cooperation with Venezuela.” Prominent Chinese ratings agency Dagong Global Credit Rating Co in November put Venezuela’s sovereign debt on negative watch in a scathing review that warned of high default risks on bonds, which are not linked to financing arrangements with Beijing. “Venezuela lacks the ability to create wealth on its own while debt repayment sources are highly fragile, thus a low solvency,” Dagong wrote. Sanctions levied by the government of U.S. President Donald Trump have left Venezuela unable to refinance its crippling debt burden and left it struggling to import basic goods such as food. Beijing has also declined to renew financing to state oil company PDVSA that is tied to oil industry investment, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources, in contrast to other loans that are used for a broader range of expenditures. PDVSA in December paid off a $1.5 billion loan that it received in 2014, but was unable to renew it. The loan is paid off in cash rather than in oil, which made it less attractive, the source said. Venezuela has in recent months proposed different arrangements under which China would put in new cash, including renewing part of the $20 billion Large Volume Fund, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources. Those requests have been ignored, the sources said. But despite China’s discontent, halting the grace period would have little practical benefit because it would most likely lead Caracas to get behind on payments - something it has done in the past. In order to enforce its claims, China would have to open a cumbersome commercial dispute and engage in an unfriendly process of forcibly collecting on the loans, embarrassing a government that it actively supported for years. Venezuela as of last year had fallen behind on oil shipments to China as well as Russia, another ally that has been providing financing, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.

2018-03-21,"* Abu Dhabi fund files lawsuit; Noble says to defend itself * Company has sold assets, taken writedowns in past 3 years * Noble is seeking a crucial debt restructuring deal * Noble’s shares have collapsed from Feb 2015 * Richard Elman steps down from Noble’s board (Adds fresh Noble Group comment in 10th and 11th paragraphs) By Anshuman Daga SINGAPORE, March 21 (Reuters) - Goldilocks Investment Co, a leading shareholder of Noble Group Ltd, has filed a lawsuit with the Singapore High Court against the commodities trader and some of its former and current senior executives, alleging they inflated Noble’s assets. “We have filed it today,” Daniel Chia, a Morgan Lewis Stamford lawyer who is representing Goldilocks, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund, said late on Tuesday. The move comes days after Singapore-listed Noble said it would not make the redemption payment for its $379 million bonds which matured on Tuesday. Noble is seeking a $3.4 billion debt restructuring that is crucial for its survival. Noble’s restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders such as Goldilocks, which has an 8.1 percent stake in the trading company. The fund was not available for comment. In a filing to the Singapore bourse on Wednesday, Noble said its founder and chairman emeritus Richard Elman had resigned on Tuesday as a non-executive director. It gave no reason for the resignation of the 77-year-old executive. Elman founded the company in 1986 and then rode a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world’s biggest traders. Hong Kong-headquartered Noble has been negotiating a debt-for-equity swap for months after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday alleges that some of the defendants “sanctioned aggressive revenue recognition and creative accounting policies in order to inflate the valuations of Noble’s ‘associate companies’ and long-term commodity contracts”. “The objective of these overvaluations was to inflate Noble’s revenue and balance sheet,” according to a copy of the 72-page filing seen by Reuters. On Wednesday, Noble confirmed it had been served a “writ of summons” by Goldilocks. “The company is in consultation with its legal advisors in this regard and intends to vigorously resist any and all allegations or claims made against it,” Noble said in a statement to the Singapore stock exchange. Once Asia’s largest commodity trader, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has stood by its accounting. Last week, Noble said it had finalised the restructuring agreement with a group of senior creditors holding 46 percent of its debt, and was in talks with others. Under the deal, Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to creditors. Noble’s market value has fallen to just $114 million, from $6 billion in February 2015, as the company reported record losses and shrunk its business. Late on Tuesday, S&P Global Ratings cut Noble’s credit rating to “D”, implying a default, as it said Noble had missed the principal and coupon payment for its 2018 notes due the same day.

2018-03-21,"* Iran launches Persian Gulf Star refinery - sources * Gasoline imports dropped sharply in recent weeks * Sanctions-lifting nuclear deal hangs in the balance By Ron Bousso and Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - Iran has sharply reduced its gasoline imports in recent weeks after starting up a new refinery, trade sources said, bringing the oil-rich country closer to its goal of fuel self-sufficiency. The reduced dependence on imports comes as the future of a landmark 2015 nuclear accord that offered Iran sanctions relief hangs in the balance, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to pull out of the deal. Iran, despite being OPEC’s third-largest crude oil producer, has for years struggled to meet its domestic fuel needs due to a lack of refining capacity and international sanctions that limited the supply of spare parts for plant maintenance. President Hassan Rouhani has made fuel independence a key objective following the removal of many such trade restrictions, which led to a sharp recovery in Iran’s economy. That goal moved closer after Iran’s national oil company in recent weeks started the second phase of the Persian Gulf Star Refinery at Bandar Abbas, which converts light crude, known as condensate, into gasoline and naphtha. Officials at the refinery could not be reached for comment. The new phase will double the refinery’s capacity to 240,000 barrels per day (bpd), but production has still to be ramped up fully and it might not yet meet its highest fuel-quality specifications, known as Euro IV, trading sources said. “Iran does seem to have significantly reduced its reliance on imports,” said Robert Campbell, head of oil products at consultancy Energy Aspects. “All indications are that imports in March are lower. That coincides with the Iranian New Year, which is usually a strong demand period.” Gasoline imports into Iran are set to drop to around 70,000 tonnes in March, or roughly 20,000 bpd, compared with about 300,000 tonnes in December and 120,000 tonnes in January and February, according to trading sources and shipping data. Imports of gasoline and its blending components are expected to hit around 35,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018, down roughly 50 percent from a year earlier, data on observed flows from oil analytics firm Vortexa shows. The country’s gasoline consumption reached around 520,000 bpd in the year to March, Iranian officials have said. The fall in Iranian imports has led to a gasoline surplus in the Middle East, traders said, with a rare arbitrage for the motor fuel opening from the region to West Africa. Sahara, a trading company, has booked a tanker to load 60,000 tonnes of gasoline at Yanbu in Saudi Arabia on March 26 to go to West Africa, shipping data shows. Traders said exports along the route were also observed last month. Additional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan in Singapore and

2018-03-21,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL.TA) reported higher fourth-quarter losses on Wednesday, citing increased salary and jet fuel expenses and as its market share continued to erode in the face of intensifying competition. Israel’s flag carrier has met with stiff competition from rivals including Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot (AFLT.MM), easyJet (EZJ.L) and WizzAir (WIZZ.L), which offer lower fares even though some flights require a layover. “During 2017 the company faced increasing competition in the Israeli aviation market as a result of a significant increase in the number of seats of foreign airlines, especially low-cost carriers,” said Chief Executive Gonen Usishkin. The company said it lost $29.7 million (£21.13 million) in the final three months of the year, compared with a $2.4 million loss a year earlier.  Revenue grew by 11 percent to $512 million, but this was more than offset by a 17 percent rise in expenses, mainly from salaries and jet fuel.  El Al remained the market leader at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, but its market share fell to 28.5 percent last year from 32.6 percent in 2016. Passenger numbers rose 2.4 percent last year while the total number of travellers at Ben Gurion was up 16 percent.  El Al is banking on a more than $1 billon overhaul of its long-range fleet to win back customers while also revamping its short-haul fare structure.  It has received the first four of 16 Boeing (BA.N) 787 aircraft that will be delivered by 2020 and plans to expand in North America this year with non-stop flights to San Francisco, competing with U.S. carrier United UAL.N.  In November El Al started non-stop flights to Miami, having begun flying to Boston in 2015. El Al has said it plans to add more long-haul routes but a decision is unlikely to be made until later in 2018. At the same time, it plans to refurbish its 737 jets flying to Europe.

2018-03-21,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Five of the world’s biggest energy producers will be questioned by a federal judge on Wednesday about climate change science, part of a lawsuit that accuses the companies of misleading the public for years about their role in global warming. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California sued Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips , Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and BP PLC last year, seeking an abatement fund to help the cities address flooding they say is a result of climate change. The companies argued in legal filings on Tuesday that the case in San Francisco federal court should be dismissed, partly because Congress has given regulatory agencies, not the courts, authority over the production and emission of fossil fuels. The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address climate change in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on climate change in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year. U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to a hearing on Wednesday to describe their views on “the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.” Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office 14 months ago, domestic policy on climate change has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and ordered a broad reversal of climate regulations. He said last year that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely. Alsup, who has presided over high profile technology cases including one between Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc over self-driving cars, is known to ask blunt questions from the bench. Chevron attorney Avi Garbow on Tuesday told reporters the company will tell the judge it agrees with the scientific consensus that it is extremely likely human influence is the cause of warming. It is unclear whether the other companies will agree with that view. Representatives for the other four companies could not immediately be reached. All of the oil companies generally acknowledge that greenhouse gasses are a contributor to climate change. However, the companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for global warming, which is caused by “billions” of parties and “complex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.” (Reporting by Dan Levine; editing by Grant McCool)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-climatechange-hearing/u-s-judge-to-question-big-oil-on-climate-change-idUKL1N1R21OY,21 Mar 2018,"Five of the world's

2018-03-21,"March 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department will hold the largest lease sale in American history in the offshore Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, in a major test of the oil industry’s appetite for federal acreage being offered by the Trump administration. The auction of more than 77 million acres (31.2 million hectares) - an area twice the size of Florida - is part of an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to ramp up U.S. fossil fuels production by lowering royalty rates, opening up more public lands, and rolling back environmental protections. But the push comes it comes at a time U.S. crude oil and natural gas output is already smashing records thanks to improved drilling technology that has opened up cheaper onshore reservoirs, and as Brazil and Mexico compete for drillers in their own deepwater acreage. The U.S. produces about 1.5 million barrels of oil per day from the Gulf of Mexico, about 15 percent of the national total, according to the Energy Information Administration. “American energy production can be competitive,” Vincent DeVito, an energy policy advisor at Interior, said of the auction. “People need jobs, the Gulf Coast states need revenue, and Americans do not want to be dependent on foreign oil.” Others called the unusually large lease sale ill-considered. “Offering a nearly unrestricted supply in a low demand market with a cut rate royalty and almost no competition is bad policy and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer resources,” the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank, said in a statement. The U.S. government offers Gulf of Mexico leases annually, but usually in smaller regional batches. An auction in March 2017, for example, offered up 48 million acres, located in the Central Gulf of Mexico planning region. Wood Mackenzie energy analyst, Mfon Usoro, said she expected demand for the acreage to be slightly higher than in last year’s auctions thanks to higher oil prices and lower corporate taxes. But she noted competition from Latin America, and concerns over the impact of steel tariffs on capital costs could hurt. She said she expected traditional deepwater oil and gas drillers like Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp to “lead the pack” at the auction. A spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil and gas companies, did not respond to a request for comment. In an effort to pump up demand, the Interior Department has said it is considering cutting the royalty rate companies must pay in offshore waters by a third to 12.5 percent. The administration had already cut that rate for shallow water acreage offered in a Gulf of Mexico lease sale last year, which nonetheless yielded relatively low bids on a small percentage of the acreage offered. A Reuters analysis of government data showed the amount of money per acre that oil companies spent in the Gulf in 2017 was about a third the levels in 2013 when oil prices were higher. Energy firms also bid for less than 1 percent of the offered acreage in 2017, compared with 4.5 percent in 2013. The administration is eyeing further vast lease sales offshore in the future, having proposed opening up parts of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific - an idea that has faced pushback from several U.S. coastal governors.

2018-03-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Banks’ metals-related revenues exceeded their earnings from the oil sector last year for the first time since 2014 as low and relatively stable crude prices discouraged hedging activity, but this is unlikely to be the start of a new trend. Banks’ commodity revenue has been on a steady downward path in recent years as they have exited or slimmed down their commodity businesses due to heightened government regulation and a poor performance from the sector. The world’s 50 biggest investment banks made revenue of $1.6 billion from trading, selling derivatives and other activities in metals last year, compared to $1.4 billion in oil, according to Coalition, a financial industry analytics firm. That is the lowest for both in at least a decade and down from $3.9 billion for metals and $5.6 billion for oil in 2008 when the commodity supercycle peaked.  (For a graphic of Banks' metals revenue vs oil revenue click reut.rs/2FWYxnY) Oil-related revenue has dwindled since 2015 as a period of low prices reduced interest from producers and consumers in financial instruments that offer protection against price volatility, said Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition.  “It’s much more oil declining (than metals gaining),” he said. “We’ve seen reduced client activity (in oil), reduced hedging from the corporates as well as low prices at the start of last year and low volumes.”  Metals income held up better thanks to stable revenues from storing gold and silver and a surge in industrial metals prices since early 2016, and because fewer banks have left the precious metals business than have quit oil markets, Shahani said.  “Pretty much every bank maintains a precious metals business. It’s a much more stable revenue pool.” Banks’ revenue from both metals and oil is expected to increase this year as prices and volatility increase, Shahani said, with overall commodities-related revenue seen rising by around 10 percent.  Part of this is likely to come from Goldman Sachs, traditionally one of the top three commodities banks, which is trying to turn around its commodities unit after revenues collapsed last year. Oil-related earnings will likely rebound faster than metals over the next few years as banks focus on building revenues in the oil derivatives market, which is historically a much bigger business than metals derivatives, Shahani said.

2018-03-21,"* MSCI all-country index flat ahead of 1800 GMT Fed announcement * Fed seen raising rates, markets see risk of four hikes in 2018 * Tech sector woes weigh on sentiment on Facebook troubles * Dollar eases off three-week high (Updates throughout, changes dateline, byline, adds quotes) By Sujata Rao LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - World shares were flat on Wednesday and the dollar eased off three-week highs as investors marked time before a likely hike in U.S. interest rates and awaited guidance on how many more to expect for this year. Markets are on edge, not only because of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which should deliver the first rate rise of 2018, but also because of a selloff in U.S. tech shares, which has wiped almost $50 billion off the value of Facebook this week amid uproar over the alleged misuse of users’ data. The Facebook losses have filtered through other tech shares in the United States and overseas, with shares in Twitter falling more than 10 percent on Tuesday. The losses are likely to have hit investors hard, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey showing global funds heavily positioned in tech shares just before the rout began . “There are tensions between potential bad news and good news in the market. The bad news is the problem facing the tech sector, which has been the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “The good news is we must recall why the Fed is tightening policy. It’s because of the underlying strength of the U.S. and global economy.” MSCI’s all-country equity index flatlined MIWD00000PUS>, and is now 6 percent off record highs hit at the end of January, pressured by fears of a global trade war ignited by U.S. President Donald Trump and the possibility that the Fed could end up raising interest rates more than three times this year. The Fed has increased borrowing costs five times since it began tightening policy in late 2015. Markets are pricing in three rises this year but some reckon policymakers could squeeze in a fourth, which might trigger a bond and equity selloff. The 1800 GMT announcement will also be the first under new Fed chair Jerome Powell, analysts note. “We might have significant changes in communication compared with what we’ve seen under (previous chair Janet) Yellen,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “The economic situation post tax cuts also justifies a significant shift upwards in the dot plot,” he added, referring to fears the Fed’s de facto policy forecast chart could signal four rate rises rather than three, due to the economic boost delivered by Trump’s tax reforms. Those expectations had sent the dollar to nearly three-week highs on Tuesday but it eased back a quarter percent against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, having lost almost half a percent this month. The greenback’s weakness — it fell 10 percent last year — is at least partly down to U.S. capital seeking to invest overseas amid robust world growth. Milligan said that would continue unless trade skirmishes started impacting the world economy or U.S. growth accelerated further. “To get the dollar higher we will need combination of the Fed being more aggressive and signalling more changes for 2019,” he added. European shares edged down, despite a small tech index bounce off two-week lows and equity futures signalled that Wall Street would likewise open a touch lower Emerging equities fell 0.2 percent A major overhang for financial markets is the spectre of a global trade war. Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday, after imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month. Investors are worried his actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war if China and other countries retaliate with similar or harsher measures, threatening global growth. This week’s meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies failed to diffuse tensions, with the so-called G20 bloc saying only it “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions”. The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars were on the defensive after being knocked down to multi-month lows, while most emerging currencies were also marked lower. The Aussie languished near three-month troughs against the dollar of $0.7679 while the Kiwi hit the lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar held at $1.3029 after hitting $1.3124 on Monday, a low not seen since mid-2017. The Mexican peso was up almost 1 percent against the dollar after reports the United States had dropped a demand that vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico should contain 50 percent U.S. content. Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil, lifting Brent futures almost half a percent. Copper prices in Shanghai fell to their lowest in almost six month, their fourth straight day of losses. Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-03-21,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Turkey’s first nuclear plant will open in 2023, its builder Rosatom told Reuters on Wednesday, adding talks with potential investors were not expected to affect the construction timetable.  Earlier this month, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters the Akkuyu nuclear plant in southern Turkey was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date as its state-owned Russian builder Rosatom struggles to find local partners. The 4,800 megawatt plant is intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports, but has been beset by delays since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010. Rosatom said last month it was in talks with Turkish state-owned power producer EUAS after a deal with a consortium of three firms collapsed. “Rosatom categorically rejects speculation that any changes to the composition of the local ownership structure in the Akkuyu project have any bearing on the timetable of its implementation,” Rosatom said in a statement. Rosatom has been looking at four Turkish companies as possible partners, but little progress has been made so far, said one of the sources, both of whom declined to be identified because the information is not yet public. Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said. “We are doing our utmost to speed up the first unit’s construction based on following the strictest safety regulations and the request of the Turkish party to achieve physical start-up of the first unit of the NPP (nuclear plant) in 2023,” Rosatom said in emailed comments to Reuters on Wednesday. Rosatom is a global leader in the nuclear power market, accounting for 17 percent of it. It has 33 power blocks in 12 countries in its asset portfolio.

2018-03-21,"(Adds comment from Indonesia biodiesel association, context) JAKARTA, March 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia has won an appeal against the European Union in a dispute over the bloc’s anti-dumping duty on biodiesel, the Ministry of Trade said in a statement on Wednesday. The European Court of Justice, the EU’s highest court, ruled that the bloc must do away with anti-dumping duties of between 8.8 percent to 23.3 percent on imports of Indonesian biodiesel products. Indonesia is one of the world’s largest exporters of palm oil-based biodiesel. “With the elimination of these duties, businesses can once again export biodiesel to the EU,” said Oke Nurwan, director general of foreign trade at the Indonesian trade ministry. He added that the elimination of duties was valid from March 16, 2018. The Indonesia Biofuel Producers Association welcomed the ruling. “We’re asking producers to prepare exports soon,” said Paulus Tjakrawan, vice chairman of the association. He declined to give an estimate on expected export volumes. The EU court ruling reinforces a decision made by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) earlier this year, which said the EU needed to bring its measures into conformity with WTO agreements. Indonesia also plans to challenge anti-subsidy duties in the United States in a U.S. court and at the WTO. Indonesia has also been pushing domestic biodiesel consumption as part of an ambitious plan to develop its biofuels industry. It plans to expand biodiesel subsidies to cover palm-oil blended fuels for use by its huge mining sector in addition to the power sector.

2018-03-21,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Asia is a critical battlefield in the global fight to rein in air pollution, registering about 5 million premature deaths each year, delegates at a United Nations conference said on Wednesday, as urged tougher enforcement of curbs. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls air pollution the greatest environmental risk to human health. About 90 percent of related deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries, most of them in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. “There is a sense that if you’re developing economically it doesn’t mean that you have to live in a city where you can’t breathe the air,” Dechen Tsering, the Asia-Pacific director of the U.N. Environment program, said at the two-day event. “There is also a growing sense that there are technologies, there is financing (to help),” said Tsering, adding that the region was a key battleground in the fight. Air pollution grew more than 5 percent between 2008 and 2013 in more than two-thirds of Southeast Asian cities, the WHO said in a report in 2016. Children are “uniquely vulnerable”, said Karin Hulshof, East Asia and Pacific director for the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF, adding that about 300 million children worldwide live in areas where the air is toxic. “What we are seeing, more and more, in cities like Ulanbataar, is hospitals full of children suffering from diseases related to air pollution,” said Hulshof, referring to a public health crisis in Mongolia’s capital caused by toxic smog. Emissions limits are simply not being enforced in Asia, however, said Andreas Kock, managing director at Scheuch Asia, which develops and produces environmental cleaning technologies. “Basically, they are not investing because the pressure is not there,” said Kock, who called for efforts to spur industries in Asia to adopt pollution-reducing technology. Major cities, such as Bangkok, need to build comprehensive public transport networks and push citizens to use them, Tsering said, as well as environment-friendly vehicles, like bicycles. That is the aim of Mobike, a bike-sharing smartphone application that allows people to find bicycles and unlock them by scanning a QR code.  “In Bangkok, we operate in two locations and we hope to expand in a few months,” Sam Nathapong, a representative of China-based Mobike, told Reuters.

2018-03-21,"OSLO (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, said on Wednesday it would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter by 2025 and help thousands of farmers cope with disruptions to water supplies stoked by global warming. The Belgium-based brewer also said it would make all its packaging either returnable or from mainly recycled materials by 2025 and was on track to achieve a goal set in 2017 to get all the electricity it buys from renewable sources by 2025. “It’s a win-win ... It’s good for business and good for the environment”, chief executive Carlos Brito told Reuters of the new sustainability goals. He declined to estimate the total cost of the measures or the impact on earnings. Brito said AB InBev, whose beers include Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, was vulnerable to environmental changes since it relied on barley, malt, hops, wheat, rice and other products grown by 50,000 farmers in dozens of nations. “If the environment has a problem, we have a problem,” he said in a telephone interview from New York of disruptions such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms linked to climate change.  “If we were a supplier of smartphones we would make them in one location and ship around the world,” he said.  Many companies are setting tougher environmental goals after almost 200 nations signed up for the 2015 Paris climate agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts climate change has a human cause, plans to pull the United States out of the deal and instead promote fossil fuels. AB InBev plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2025, to the equivalent of 37.93 kg (83.62 lb) of carbon dioxide to produce a hectolitre of beer from 50.57 kg in 2017.    Brito said the new goals for 2025 would include suppliers and wholesalers - beyond the company’s previous environmental targets that focused on the company’s core operations. The firm aims to cut water use, including by “restoring watersheds in areas that need it most, and improving water availability and quality for our communities,” it said. It would work to ensure all farmers had needed skills by 2025. AB InBev was one of 74 companies on an “A list” for water reporting in 2017 from the independent London-based CDP, which monitors environmental performance by thousands of companies. It got a “B” for reporting on climate change in 2017 after an “A minus” in 2016. The firm will seek new ideas by scientists and entrepreneurs for everything from plastics recycling to better soil management in a project called the “100+ Sustainability Accelerator”. Brito doubted that climate change would mean an ever hotter world that would boost beer sales by making people thirstier. “Some places will likely get warmer, some will get colder,” he said, adding ever more people drink beer indoors at home where temperatures are steadier than outside.

2018-03-21,"CARACAS/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is likely to extend an agreement providing crisis-stricken Venezuela with favorable loans repayment terms but will not lend fresh funds to President Nicolas Maduro’s government, according to sources in Caracas and Beijing familiar with the situation.  During a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into the OPEC member’s coffers through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America.  But the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms when a fall in oil prices  and declining crude output pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.  Though unwilling to throw Venezuela a financial lifeline, the state-run China Development Bank (CDB) will likely extend next month a grace period begun in 2016 that allows Venezuela to make only interest payments on its loans, the sources said. However, China has ignored several requests for new funding. “Given Venezuela’s falling oil production, it’s natural for Chinese banks not to renew loans,” said one Chinese oil industry source who asked not to be identified.  A second oil industry source, asked if the conditions would be tightened, cited a Chinese proverb, saying China would not “drop stones on somebody who has fallen into a well.” Venezuela still owes China $19.3 billion, according to one Venezuelan finance industry source who has tracked the information via contacts in both countries. Some $10.4 billion of that is owed under the $20 billion Large Volume Long Term fund signed in 2010. A further $8.4 billion remains outstanding under the Joint China Venezuela Fund via three tranches of $4 billion to $5 billion each, according to the source. China’s policy is not to lend new funds until old loans have been paid off - which cannot happen under the interest-only scheme created in April 2016 because the outstanding balance does not change.  CDB President Zheng Zhijie, asked by Reuters if the bank was having second thoughts about financing Venezuela given its situation, said: “We’ve done our assessment of its political and economic situation. We’re just monitoring now.” However, one Beijing-based diplomatic source familiar with Chinese thinking on Venezuela said China increasingly sees Maduro as similar to former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who was pushed out after 40 years in power that dragged his once-prosperous country into hyperinflation and economic crisis. China would have no concern about abandoning Maduro as it did Mugabe when he was ousted, the source said, but does not expect China to take an active role in pushing him out. “China looks at Venezuela as another Zimbabwe: a poor return on its investment,” he said. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment. China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that bilateral cooperation was proceeding smoothly at present, adding that: “China will continue to carry out pragmatic cooperation with Venezuela.” Prominent Chinese ratings agency Dagong Global Credit Rating Co in November put Venezuela’s sovereign debt on negative watch in a scathing review that warned of high default risks on bonds, which are not linked to financing arrangements with Beijing. “Venezuela lacks the ability to create wealth on its own while debt repayment sources are highly fragile, thus a low solvency,” Dagong wrote. Sanctions levied by the government of U.S. President Donald Trump have left Venezuela unable to refinance its crippling debt burden and left it struggling to import basic goods such as food. Beijing has also declined to renew financing to state oil company PDVSA that is tied to oil industry investment, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources, in contrast to other loans that are used for a broader range of expenditures. PDVSA in December paid off a $1.5 billion loan that it received in 2014, but was unable to renew it. The loan is paid off in cash rather than in oil, which made it less attractive, the source said. Venezuela has in recent months proposed different arrangements under which China would put in new cash, including renewing part of the $20 billion Large Volume Fund, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources. Those requests have been ignored, the sources said.   But despite China’s discontent, halting the grace period would have little practical benefit because it would most likely lead Caracas to get behind on payments - something it has done in the past.   In order to enforce its claims, China would have to open a cumbersome commercial dispute and engage in an unfriendly process of forcibly collecting on the loans, embarrassing a government that it actively supported for years. Venezuela as of last year had fallen behind on oil shipments to China as well as Russia, another ally that has been providing financing, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.

2018-03-21,"* PTTEP has $5 bln in cash, seeks to ‘extend’ itself * Reduces avg oil-gas cost to $29/bbl in 2017, from $43/bbl * Seeks 10-20 pct stake in Petronas’ SK 316 gas block * Plans to develop gas to power project in Myanmar * Eyes expiring concessions in Mideast to add to output (Writes through, adds graphic and picture links) By Florence Tan KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Reuters) - Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP) is looking closer to home for upstream oil and gas assets in a drive to boost its reserves and production as oil prices have recovered, a senior company executive said on Wednesday. Global oil futures that have held above $60 a barrel and sharp cost-cutting in the upstream sector are encouraging national oil companies and international majors to pump money into exploration and production, although many producers remain wary that surging U.S. oil output could hold crude prices back. Since the oil crisis that began in 2014 and saw prices slump to less then $30 a barrel in early 2016, PTTEP has cut costs and increased efficiency, bringing its average cost of oil and gas output to $29 per barrel last year, down from $43 per barrel. “Now we’re coming back more to the region. We’re good friends with (Malaysia’s) Petronas, but we didn’t really do things together. Now we have more collaboration and we have a project to work together,” Phongsthorn Thavisin, PTTEP’s president of exploration and production, said on the sidelines of the OTC Asia conference. PTTEP, which has $4.5 billion cash on hand, is also eyeing expiring Middle East concessions that can boost its output immediately, and plans to invest in a gas-to-power project in Myanmar by 2022-2023, tapping into gas from blocks M3 and M9 to meet its neighbour’s energy demand, Phongsthorn said. “We’re looking to extend ourselves a little,” he said. Still, ratings agency Fitch expects PTTEP’s reserve profile to remain weak for the next two years as the majority of its assets are located in Thailand, where oil and gas reservoirs are scattered and relatively small. PTTEP has already invested in 10 percent of Train 9 of Malaysia LNG and is exploring offshore block SK410B in Sarawak with Petronas, Phongsthorn said. The company is also in the second round of bidding for a stake in another offshore Sarawak block, SK316, seeking a 10-20 percent share, he said. Last year, state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) kicked off a process to sell a stake of up to 49 percent, worth an estimated $1 billion, in the SK316 offshore gas block in Malaysia’s Sarawak state. Total and some Japanese firms are among others keen to bid for the asset, sources have said. PTTEP also plans to bid for Thailand’s Erawan and Bongkot gas concession licences in an auction scheduled for April, another chance to raise its output and reserves. The government will announce the licence winners in December, which will give the companies time to invest to sustain a combined gas output of 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from the fields before the concessions expire in 2022, Phongsthorn said. PTTEP holds an 8.5 percent stake in a $15 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project led by Anadarko Petroleum in Mozambique. The consortium will build two LNG trains with a total capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum that are slated for completion in 2023. “We are still trying to work out if PTT could commit (its) volume (from Mozambique) either for Thailand or trading,” Phongsthorn said. “The LNG market in the next few years could see more demand and supply could shrink a little. Everyone stopped investing for some time and our industry needs time (to develop assets). I think in the future, you’ll see short supply,” he said. PTTEP is also exploring solar power and batteries technologies for new revenue stream as it adapts itself to a new environment, Phongsthorn said. Falling costs for solar panels have made them a viable electricity source, and oil companies expect electric vehicles to reduce oil demand after 2030.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.5 percent after a run of losses, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street. Chinese shares were a bit more buoyant with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.2 percent as real estate firms posted stellar profits. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 inched up 0.1 percent, while FTSE futures were off a fraction. Markets are convinced the Federal Reserve will announce a quarter point hike at 1800 GMT, but are less sure if it will signal three or four for the year as a whole. “A significant weighting towards four hikes this year may well cause both equity and bond markets to sell off,” Jonathan Sheridan, analyst at FIIG Securities in Sydney, said. “The concerns here are that the Fed overshoots with raising rates into a faltering economy,” Sheridan added. “If this opinion takes hold then we may well see falling longer term rates and a flatter yield curve, and it would also be negative for equities as it increases the chances of a recession.” The Fed has raised rates five times since it began tightening policy in late 2015. Yet the dollar has not really responded, ending 2017 down about 10 percent against a basket of currencies. “We remind readers that every single FOMC rate hike this cycle has been a ‘dovish hike’ and the USD has declined on the day(s) post the rise,” Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote in a note to clients. On Wednesday, the dollar index held near three-week highs around at 90.267. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback hovered near a one-week top at 106.46. Another major overhang for financial markets is the spectre of a global trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday. The move comes after Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month. Investors are worried Trump’s actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war if China and other countries retaliate with similar or harsher measures, threatening global growth. To add to these concerns, a meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies this week failed to diffuse the threat. The so-called G20 agreed only to stand by an ambiguous declaration on trade from 2017 and “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions”. The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars were on the defensive after being knocked down to multi-month lows. The Aussie fell to a three-month trough of $0.7679 overnight while the kiwi dollar hit the lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar held at $1.3029 from Monday’s low of $1.3124, a level not seen since mid-2017. Equity analysts have also turned increasingly downbeat. “Cracks in the bull case are starting to emerge,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, citing the bank’s March fund manager survey. “The threat of a trade war returns to the top of the list of tail risks most commonly cited by investors, followed by inflation and a slowdown in global growth,” he added. “Investors have yet to act on these fears, however, as rates and earnings are keeping the bulls bullish.” Among major commodities, oil prices were lifted by tensions in the Middle East and healthy demand. U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $63.69 per barrel. Brent gained 16 cents to $67.58. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,313.31 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey, Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.4 percent after four straight days of losses, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street. Chinese shares were buoyant with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.3 percent. Australian and Korean stocks were up marginally. The market is convinced the Fed will announce a quarter point hike at 1800 GMT, but are less sure if it will signal three or four for the year as a whole. “A significant weighting towards four hikes this year may well cause both equity and bond markets to sell off,” Jonathan Sheridan, analyst at FIIG Securities in Sydney, said. “The concerns here are that the Fed overshoots with raising rates into a faltering economy,” Sheridan added. “If this opinion takes hold then we may well see falling longer term rates and a flatter yield curve, and it would also be negative for equities as it increases the chances of a recession.” The Fed has raised rates five times since it began tightening policy in late 2015. Yet the dollar has not really responded, ending 2017 down about 10 percent against a basket of currencies. “We remind readers that every single FOMC rate hike this cycle has been a ‘dovish hike’ and the USD has declined on the day(s) post the rise,” Richard Grace, chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia wrote in a note to clients. On Wednesday, the dollar index held near three-week highs around at 90.35. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback hovered near a one-week top at 106.5. Another major overhang for financial markets is the spectre of a global trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday. The move comes after Trump imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium earlier this month. Investors are worried Trump’s actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war if China and other countries retaliate with similar or harsher measures, threatening global growth. To add to these concerns, a meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies this week failed to diffuse the threat. The so-called G20 agreed only to stand by an ambiguous declaration on trade from 2017 and “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions”. The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars were on the defensive after being knocked down to multi-month lows. The Aussie fell to a three-month trough of $0.7679 overnight while the kiwi dollar hit the lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar held at $1.3029 from Monday’s low of $1.3124, a level not seen since mid-2017. Equity analysts have also turned increasingly downbeat. “Cracks in the bull case are starting to emerge,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, citing the bank’s March fund manager survey. “The threat of a trade war returns to the top of the list of tail risks most commonly cited by investors, followed by inflation and a slowdown in global growth,” he added. “Investors have yet to act on these fears, however, as rates and earnings are keeping the bulls bullish.” Among major commodities, oil prices were lifted by tensions in the Middle East and healthy demand. U.S. crude rose 20 cents to $63.74 per barrel. Brent gained 22 cents to $67.64. Spot gold climbed 0.1 percent to $1,312.81 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-03-21,"(Updates with SCDF comment that fire has been put out; adds comments on market impact) SINGAPORE, March 21 (Reuters) - A fire that had broken out at an oil storage tank at Tankstore’s Pulau Busing terminal in Singapore on Tuesday evening has been extinguished, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Wednesday. “After approximately 6 hours of intense firefighting operations, the raging oil storage tank fire was extinguished,” the SCDF said on its Facebook page. The cause of the fire is not yet known and is under investigation, an SCDF spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday. Thirty-one firefighting and support vehicles and 128 SCDF personnel were involved in the operations, said the SCDF, adding that it had been alerted to the fire at about 5:50 p.m. on Tuesday. Singapore-based Tankstore operates the terminal on Pulau Busing, an island off Singapore’s southwest coast. It has a total capacity of 2 million cubic metres, or 112 tanks, to store petroleum and petrochemical products, according to the company’s website. The fire-struck storage tank was said to have contained fuel oil, according to a Tankstore employee who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to speak to the media. A by-product of the crude oil refining process, fuel oil is used as a shipping fuel and in power generation. The fire is not expected to have any material impact on fuel oil trading and supply in Singapore, a global trading hub of the fuel, two Singapore-based fuel oil traders said.

2018-03-21,"* Saudi Crown Prince visits Washington * U.S., Saudi Arabia expected to put pressure on Iran * U.S. could reimpose sanctions against Tehran * Healthy demand also supports crude prices * But relentless rise in U.S. crude production caps gains By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, supported by tensions in the Middle East and healthy global demand, although rising U.S. output from the United States continued to weigh on markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.82 a barrel at 0027 GMT, up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $67.66 per barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in to Washington for a state visit, raising market speculation the United States could reimpose sanctions on Iran, following rewnewed criticism of the 2015 nuclear deal. “The presence of the Saudi Crown Prince MBS in Washington and his clear agenda to ramp up pressure on Iran, has for me, been the key driver... of oil, which rose strongly,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Energy consultancy FGE said it was likely that the United States would reimpose sanctions on Iran soon, resulting in a 250,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) drop in its exports by year-end. Analysts also pointed to healthy economic growth and a weak dollar as oil price drivers. In a sign of healthy demand, U.S. crude stocks fell by 2.7 million barrels in the week ended March 16 to 425.3 million, as refineries boosted output, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. “The global economy is humming, and robust demand solidly underpins commodity prices. The soft dollar and a bullish market mood have been equally supportive elements,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity Research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. A weaker greenback makes imports of dollar-denominated crude cheaper for countries using other currencies at home, potentially spurring demand. Despite this, he said seasonally low demand at the end of the northern hemisphere winter season meant he had “a rather cautious near-term outlook on commodities.” Looming over oil markets has been surging U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen by more than a fifth since mid-2016, to 10.38 million barrels per day (bpd), pushing it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia’s 11 million bpd. Analysts say U.S. producers are not yet at their limits. Some say U.S. producers are holding back expansion in order to prevent another price crash, as seen between 2014 and 2016. “The larger players are holding back capital expenditures in an attempt to avoid past mistakes... Despite a substantial growth in the U.S. production, there is no effort to produce to the max with no regard to the market,” said energy consultancy FGE in a note.

2018-03-21,"* Seeks to work with smaller companies in developing countries * Cautiously optimistic on Asia-Pacific region * Provides oilfield services, financing By Florence Tan KUALA LUMPUR, March 21 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes GE (BHGE) is on the hunt for smaller oil and gas projects in Asia Pacific to replicate a project in Papua New Guinea where it is providing services and financing, a senior company executive said. The company, formed from the merger of GE’s oil and gas services and equipment business and Baker Hughes, is seeing signs of renewed interest in oil and gas projects in the region, driven by smaller firms, Asia-Pacific President Visal Leng said on the sidelines of the OTC Asia conference. BHGE offers resource assessment through to drilling and production. It wants to work with smaller companies looking to develop smaller fields and stranded resources in countries such as Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia and Myanmar where there is also demand for natural gas to generate electricity. The move to tackle such projects comes in the wake of the 2014 oil price crash, which devastated the region’s oilfield services sector after producers sharply cut back spending on oil and gas exploration. “We’re cautiously optimistic on the (Asia-Pacific) region because projects are slowly coming back. We also see some smaller projects in size, not by NOCs (national oil companies) or IOCs (international oil companies), but by smaller operators,” Leng said. BHGE is currently working with private Australian company Twinza Oil which is developing the first offshore field for Papua New Guinea, providing fullstream services from assessing reserves to drilling and building the gas processing plant. “We have taken more risks in development.... We have put some skin in the game with some financing,” he said.

2018-03-21,"* MSCI ex-Japan steady after four consecutive losing days * Cracks in bull case emerging - BofAML fund manager survey * Investors fretting over risk of trade war * Australian, NZ, Canadian dollars knocked down in recent days By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, March 21 (Reuters) - A hush settled over financial markets on Wednesday as investors waited to hear how often the Federal Reserve might hike U.S. rates this year, while the currencies of exporting nations were rattled by fears of a full-blown trade war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed after four straight days of losses. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were slightly softer. Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a local holiday while Australian shares were up 0.4 percent. Global shares rallied for all of 2017 but have started this year on the back foot, hit by a combination of factors including the risk of faster rate rises in the United States and alarm over protectionism. “Cracks in the bull case are starting to emerge,” said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofAML, citing the bank’s March fund manager survey. “The threat of a trade war returns to the top of the list of tail risks most commonly cited by investors, followed by inflation and a slowdown in global growth,” he added. “Investors have yet to act on these fears, however, as rates and earnings are keeping the bulls bullish.” U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday.

Investors are worried Trump’s actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war if China and other countries retaliate with similar or harsher measures, threatening global growth. To add to these concerns, a meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world’s 20 biggest economies this week failed to diffuse the threat. The so-called G20 agreed only to stand by an ambiguous declaration on trade from 2017 and “recognised” the need for more “dialogue and actions”. The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars have been knocked down in recent days. The Aussie fell to a three-month trough of $0.7679 overnight while the kiwi dollar hit the lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar held at $1.3076 from Monday’s low of $1.3124, a level not seen since mid-2017. The Hong Kong dollar eased to a fresh 33-year low of HK$7.8452 to U.S. dollar in early Wednesday trade. “The last three days has seen the AUD come under pressure as investors have considered Australia’s exposure to Asian markets in general and China in particular,” said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon. “The risk would seem to be that deteriorating sentiment towards China and Chinese markets could leave the AUD looking particularly exposed, given the lack of yield support,” he said, with U.S. cash rates likely to rise above Australia’s this week. The Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven during times of financial stress, has generally risen since the start of the year, although it eased overnight to a one-week low of 106.54 per dollar. The greenback gained against a basket of currencies as traders limbered up for the two-day Fed Reserve meeting. With a quarter-point hike - its sixth since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015 - baked into market prices, major currencies were largely moving in ranges. Markets have largely priced in three U.S. rate hikes this year, but some analysts suspect the Fed’s ‘dot plot’ of forecasts could shift up to four and spook risk assets. Among major commodities, oil prices gained as investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. U.S. crude rose 23 cents to $63.77 per barrel. Brent settled at $67.42. Spot gold was steady at $1,310 an ounce. Reporting by Swati Pandey
