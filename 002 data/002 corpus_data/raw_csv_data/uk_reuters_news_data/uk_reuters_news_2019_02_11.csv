2019-02-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as an uptick in U.S. drilling, a shutdown caused by a fire at a major U.S. refinery and concerns about U.S.-Chinese trade talks all overshadowed support from OPEC-led supply restraint.    Benchmark Brent oil were down 71 cents, or 1.14 percent,  to $61.39 a barrel at 1445 GMT.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.19 cents or 2.26 percent to $51.53.         “Oil prices are still trying to figure out what lead to follow. On the one hand, there is the OPEC+ cut story, now coupled with increasing issues around Venezuelan supply”, Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said. “At the same time, it has to be argued that a lot of the economic data that has been released over the last few days has really not been too encouraging, and U.S.-Chinese trade talks are also seemingly not progressing very fast.” Energy firms in the United States last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks, pointing to a further rise in U.S. crude production, a weekly report by Baker Hughes said on Friday. WTI prices were also weighed down by the closure of the second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) at Phillips 66’s Wood River, Illinois, refinery following a fire on Sunday. GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production & drilling levels - tmsnrt.rs/2Tm4u4I Trade talks between Washington and Beijing resume this week with a delegation of U.S. officials travelling to China for the next round of negotiations.  The United States has threatened to increase tariffs already imposed on goods from China on March 1 if the trade talks do not produce an agreement, a move which could help slow growth in fuel demand. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline, dampening hopes of a quick trade pact. Prices have been buoyed, however, by output curbs from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+. The deal, effective from January, aims to cut 1.2 million bpd until the end of June to forestall an overhang, in a move producers and many analysts expect to soon help balance supply and demand.  Suhail Al Mazrouei, the Energy Minister of the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday the oil market should achieve this balance in the first quarter of 2019. OPEC and its allies meet on April 17 and 18 in Vienna to review the agreement, but a draft cooperation charter seen by Reuters fell short of a new formal alliance among the producers. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, along with older sanctions on fellow OPEC member Iran, have also prevented crude prices from falling further.

2019-02-11,"LISBON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp said on Monday it expects higher crude output, refining margins and efficiency gains to deliver a steep rise in 2020 and beyond as its Brazilian and Angolan operations pump up the volumes. While a relative minnow compared with oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total and Exxon , Galp is a household name in Portugal, distributing gas and selling petrol via a network of branded service stations. Traditionally an oil refiner, Galp has attracted interest because of its oil and gas production growth prospects from stakes in projects in Brazil, Angola and Mozambique and China’s Sinopec owns a 30 percent in its Brazilian assets. Galp said its oil output rose 15 percent in 2018 and it expects a rise of 8-12 percent in 2019 after delays with the start-up of Brazilian projects, and by 12-16 percent in 2020. The offshore Iara field is now due to start producing in the second half of 2019, its chief executive Carlos Gomes da Silva said on a post-earnings conference call, adding that Galp also expects its upstream earnings to benefit from lower oil taxes. “After 2020, we are assuming a higher production versus the previous guidance. We expect to benefit from the increase contributions from Lula and Iara, where we see positive signs,” Gomes da Silva added. While Galp’s fourth-quarter net profit was below forecasts, falling by 42 percent to 109 million euros, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose four percent, ending the full year at 2.2 billion euros. It projected EBITDA of 2.1 to 2.2 billion euros for 2019, but said that this should jump to more than 3 billion euros in 2020, with further growth through 2025. Shares in Galp were up 0.5 percent at 1423 GMT, helped by a 15-percent proposed increase in the dividend payout, of 0.63 euros a share, traders said. Analysts at Santander said that despite a weak quarter, affected by mark-to-market hedging losses and scheduled refinery maintenance, they expected “highly differentiated upward earnings trend” in the next few years. “We still reason to be optimistic for sound delivery 2019 onward - particularly upstream,” they wrote, reinforcing their ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock. “The value support and cash outlook is bright for Galp in our view.” Galp CFO Filipe Silva said that hedging contracts should have a positive impact in the coming quarters, while in refining, Galp expects recent initiatives aimed at increasing gains by $1 per barrel to make a full contribution by 2020. The company also said it hopes to see the first oil from the Kaombo South project in Angola this year.

2019-02-11,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp expects only five of its current 10-strong board to stand for reelection at an annual shareholder meeting in May, as it restructures after filing for bankruptcy last month because of potential liabilities from California wildfires. The utility said it also expected the board to include 11 independent directors by the time of the meeting, currently set for May 21. It did not say how big the board would finally be, or which directors it expected to stay on, only that the independent members would be in a majority. Hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management LLC last month demanded the complete removal of the embattled Californian power company’s board, saying the bankruptcy filing was unnecessary and harmed the interests of the company’s shareholders. “We fully understand that PG&E must re-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders,” PG&E said in a statement on Monday. “We recognize the importance of adding fresh perspectives to the Board to help address the serious challenges the business faces.” A heated court hearing in San Francisco at the end of last month saw U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup hold off on changing the terms of the company’s probation from its conviction for a 2010 natural gas pipeline blast. Alsup also scolded the company for not being focused enough on safety. The company has since outlined plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present. The board said it was working to identify candidates who would improve its expertise in safety, operations and other critical areas. BlueMountain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-02-11,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against U.S. sanctions imposed on his country’s oil industry, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group. But a source familiar with the matter said the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a founding member, had declined to make any formal statement. OPEC says it is concerned with oil policy, not politics. More than 40 nations including the United States, European powers and most of Latin America have recognised Maduro’s rival, Juan Guaido, as the country’s rightful head of state, following disputed elections last year. The request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters, a day after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].  “Our country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,” Maduro wrote. I seek “your firm support and collaboration to jointly denounce and face this shameless dispossession of ... important assets of one of the members of OPEC”, the letter said. He wrote that OPEC should help to determine potential solutions based on “the impact that this action has on the global energy market, and the risk it represents for the other countries ... of this organisation”. The sanctions on Venezuela have boosted global oil prices, which were trading at around $62 a barrel on Monday. The move has disrupted shipments as more than 20 tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil have been anchored off the U.S. Gulf Coast. Still, analysts say there is ample spare capacity in other oil producers such as Saudi Arabia plus strategic reserves in consuming nations to compensate for a loss of Venezuela’s exports. OPEC tends to avoid political disputes involving individual members. Last year, it declined a request from Iran for a discussion of U.S. sanctions against Tehran at a policy-setting meeting. Venezuela was once a top-three OPEC oil producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country’s economy.  Energy research and consulting firm Rystad sees Venezuelan  production plummeting to 680,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year, from 1.34 million bpd at the end of 2018. Venezuela pumped 3 million bpd at the turn of the century. Together with Libya and Iran, Venezuela is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut due to the involuntary decline in production.

2019-02-11,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The political career of Thailand’s Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi lasted only three days, but in that time her declaration that she would be a candidate for prime minister in a March election shook up the kingdom. For the sister of King Maha Vajiralongkorn to enter politics was shocking enough, but what threatened to upend Thailand’s political dynamic was the fact that she declared her candidacy for a populist party linked to an exiled former prime minister. By Monday, the country’s Election Commission had disqualified the princess, 67, from taking part in the election, echoing the words of the king himself, who said on Friday her candidacy was “inappropriate”. Still, even though the princess won’t be a candidate in the March 24 vote, her political ambitions - and the populists’ audacious gambit in nominating her - could linger in voters’ minds. The election is the first since a 2014 military coup, and will pit allies of ousted ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra against urban and middle class opponents espousing extreme devotion to the Thai monarchy. Thaksin or his proxies have won every election in Thailand since 2001. With its nomination of the king’s sister for prime minister, the Thai Raksa Chart party sought to flip the longstanding charge by opponents that Thaksin and his allies were insufficiently loyal to the monarchy. The royal family is revered in Thailand as semi-divine. Insulting the monarchy is against the law, punished by up to 15 years in prison. By longstanding tradition, the royal family have kept themselves above politics as a symbol of Thai culture. Since 2005, when protesters drawn mostly from the middle-class and urban establishment began demonstrating against Thaksin’s rule, the rallying call of anti-Thaksin forces has been to protect the monarchy. The early protesters wore yellow - a colour associated with the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej - to show their reverence for the monarchy and Thai culture that they said Thaksin threatened through corruption and consolidating his own personal power. The military deposed Thaksin in 2006 and, since then, Thai politics have been locked in a cycle of his allies winning elections and later being ousted from power by court rulings or coups - most recently in 2014, when the army overthrew the remnants of a government that had been led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck. Nominating Princess Udolratana was Thai Raksa Chart’s attempt to turn the table and invoke the appeal of the royal family as a populist princess. But the gambit was quickly shut down by her brother, who ascended to the throne in 2016, after the death of their father, and will be officially crowned in May. Still, the brief entry of royalty into politics may only deepen Thailand’s political divisions, said Anusorn Unno, Dean of the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology at Thammasat University. “For Thai Raksa Chart supporters, this has created more sympathy to the party ... These would see the party as a victim in this situation,” he said. As for Thaksin’s opponents, they are likely to be galvanised by what they will see as an attempt to manipulate the monarchy, said Anusorn.

2019-02-11,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched and some burned U.S. flags on Monday to mark the 40th anniversary of the triumph of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shi’ite cleric who toppled the Shah in an Islamic Revolution that rattles the West to this day. On Feb 11, 1979, Iran’s army declared its neutrality, paving the way for the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East.  State TV showed crowds defying cold rainy weather and carrying Iranian flags while shouting “Death to Israel, Death to America,” trademark chants of the revolution which ousted the United States’ most important ally in the Middle East. “Much to the dismay of America, the revolution has reached its 40th year,” read one banner. Soldiers, students, clerics and black-clad women holding small children thronged streets across Iran, many carrying portraits of Khomeini, who died in 1989, and Iran’s current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The large turnout in state-sponsored rallies came as Iranians face mounting economic hardships many blame on the country’s clerical leaders.  Last year, Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical leadership since a 2009 uprising over disputed elections.  Prices of basic foodstuffs, particularly meat, have soared since President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions. In January, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran was facing its worst economic crisis since the Shah was toppled. But he remained defiant as Iranians recalled the end of a monarch who catered to the rich and unleashed secret police on dissenters. In a speech at Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) square, Rouhani said U.S. efforts to isolate Iran would fail.  “We will not let America become victorious… Iranian people have and will have some economic difficulties but we will overcome the problems by helping each other,” he said. Marchers carried cardboard cutouts of dogs. One had the face of Trump and the other the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Yadollah Javani, the Revolutionary Guards’ deputy head for political affairs, said Iran would demolish cities in Israel to the ground if the United States attacked the Islamic Republic. “The United States does not have the courage to shoot a single bullet at us despite all its defensive and military assets,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.  State TV showed a cartoon of the Shah being thrown into the “dustbin of history”, wearing clothes in U.S. colours and holding Iranian newspapers headlined “The Shah has left!” Khomeini returned from exile in France two weeks after the Shah and his wife flew to Aswan, Egypt. He was greeted by millions of supporters in Tehran. Revolutionaries later began executing supporters of the Shah including four top generals. Washington and the Arab world have viewed Iran with great suspicion since the Islamic Revolution, fearing Khomeini’s radical ideology would inspire militants across the Middle East. Today, the United States and its Arab allies are trying to counter Tehran’s growing influence in the Middle East, where it has proxies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. “The world saw when Iran decided to help people of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Yemen, they achieved victory. The enemies are now confessing to their defeat,” said Rouhani. Some Iranians criticise their leaders for what they say are foreign adventures which squander funds. Iranian leaders say they are protecting national interests. Tehran was determined to expand its military power despite pressure from hostile states, Rouhani said.  Iran displayed its ballistic missile capabilities during a parade marking the anniversary, including the Zolfaqar, a ground-to-ground missile with a 700 km (435 miles) range and the Qiam, with a range of 800 km, according to Tasnim news agency. Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the Revolutionary Guards deoputy head, said Tehran would not withdraw forces from the region, dismissing U.S. calls for Iranian clout to be curbed.

2019-02-11,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China struck an upbeat note on Monday as trade talks resumed with the United States, but also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. White House senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway on Monday also expressed confidence in a possible deal. Asked if the two countries were getting close to a trade agreement, she told Fox News in an interview, “It looks that way, absolutely.” The United States is expected to keep pressing China on longstanding demands that it reform how it treats American companies’ intellectual property in order to seal a trade deal that could prevent tariffs from rising on Chinese imports. The latest talks kick off with working level discussions on Monday before high-level discussions later in the week. Negotiations in Washington last month ended without a deal and with the top U.S. negotiator declaring work was needed. “We, of course, hope, and the people of the world want to see, a good result,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news briefing in Beijing. The two sides are trying to hammer out a deal before the March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (£155 billion) worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Trump said last week he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before that deadline, dampening hopes that a trade pact could be reached quickly. But the White House’s Conway said a meeting was still possible soon. Escalating tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and disrupted global trade and business flows, roiling financial markets. The same day the latest talks began, two U.S. warships sailed near islands claimed by China in the disputed South China Sea, a U.S. official told Reuters. Asked if the ships’ passage would impact trade talks, Hua said that “a series of U.S. tricks” showed what Washington was thinking. But Hua added that China believed resolving trade frictions through dialogue was in the interests of both countries’ people, and of global economic growth. China claims a large part of the South China Sea, and has built artificial islands and air bases there, prompting concern around the region and in Washington.

The bombing, which took place in the La Colorada area of Arauquita municipality near the border with Venezuela, spilled crude oil into a dry riverbed nearby, Ecopetrol said in a statement late Sunday. There were no injuries, it said. There were more than 80 attacks on the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline in 2018, which kept it offline for most of the year. Although Ecopetrol did not name the group responsible, military sources said the bombing was carried out by leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The ELN has about 2,000 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders say has seized natural resources without benefiting Colombians.

2019-02-11,"* Dreyfus sees consolidation in Brazil milling sector * Alvean expects slight global sugar surplus in 2019/20 (Adds more quotes, context) By Maha El Dahan  and Dahlia Nehme DUBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Commodities trading firm Louis Dreyfus expects faster switching between sugar and ethanol production in Brazil, with more flexible mills leading to “dramatic” price-driven shifts. “Usually you have to see sugar playing a premium over ethanol or the opposite for a period of time before you start seeing the switch, “ Enrico Biancheri, head of sugar trading worldwide at Louis Dreyfus, which has a controlling interest in Brazilian sugar and ethanol maker Biosev SA, said. Depressed sugar prices have led Brazilian companies to increase their capacity to produce ethanol, with many mills able to switch between using cane to produce either sugar or biofuel ethanol depending on which is more profitable. “Recently the industry is learning to become more pragmatic and more economics driven. The low sugar price is a driver by itself so the mills have to be more flexible in order to generate more,” Biancheri told a Dubai conference on Monday. Biancheri also said he expected consolidation within the Brazilian milling industry to continue with the best performers buying up assets from those that are financially stressed. Meanwhile Gareth Griffiths, chief executive of Alvean, said prices were “at the tipping point” for sugar and ethanol. Alvean, the largest sugar trader globally, is expecting a slight sugar surplus for 2019-2020 of around 2 million tonnes. Analysts have been expecting a small sugar deficit for the period after years of surplus that have depressed prices. This view was supported by Sucden general manager Thierry Songeur who predicted a slight deficit by the end of 2019-2020, with India the unknown quantity. India could export as much as 5 million tonnes to the market this year and a switch to more ethanol production will not take place in the short term to get rid of its surplus, he said. “Ethanol will not be your remedy in the short term.” Biancheri also said anticipation about the potential for ethanol in India had been going on for “quite some time” but the steps needed were not being taken quickly enough. “It will be more of a mid to long term story,” he said.

Negotiations in Washington last month ended without a deal and with the top U.S. negotiator declaring work was needed. “We, of course, hope, and the people of the world want to see, a good result,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news briefing in Beijing. The two sides are trying to hammer out a deal before the March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (£155 billion) worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Trump said last week he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before that deadline, dampening hopes that a trade pact could be reached quickly. But the White House’s Conway said a meeting was still possible soon. Escalating tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and disrupted global trade and business flows, roiling financial markets. The same day the latest talks began, two U.S. warships sailed near islands claimed by China in the disputed South China Sea, a U.S. official told Reuters. Asked if the ships’ passage would impact trade talks, Hua said that “a series of U.S. tricks” showed what Washington was thinking. But Hua added that China believed resolving trade frictions through dialogue was in the interests of both countries’ people, and of global economic growth. China claims a large part of the South China Sea, and has built artificial islands and air bases there, prompting concern around the region and in Washington.

2019-02-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as an uptick in U.S. drilling, a shutdown caused by a fire at a major U.S. refinery and concerns about U.S.-Chinese trade talks all overshadowed support from OPEC-led supply restraint.    Benchmark Brent oil were down 71 cents, or 1.14 percent,  to $61.39 a barrel at 1445 GMT.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $1.19 cents or 2.26 percent to $51.53.         “Oil prices are still trying to figure out what lead to follow. On the one hand, there is the OPEC+ cut story, now coupled with increasing issues around Venezuelan supply”, Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said. “At the same time, it has to be argued that a lot of the economic data that has been released over the last few days has really not been too encouraging, and U.S.-Chinese trade talks are also seemingly not progressing very fast.” Energy firms in the United States last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks, pointing to a further rise in U.S. crude production, a weekly report by Baker Hughes said on Friday. WTI prices were also weighed down by the closure of the second largest crude distillation unit (CDU) at Phillips 66’s Wood River, Illinois, refinery following a fire on Sunday. GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production & drilling levels - tmsnrt.rs/2Tm4u4I Trade talks between Washington and Beijing resume this week with a delegation of U.S. officials travelling to China for the next round of negotiations.  The United States has threatened to increase tariffs already imposed on goods from China on March 1 if the trade talks do not produce an agreement, a move which could help slow growth in fuel demand. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline, dampening hopes of a quick trade pact. Prices have been buoyed, however, by output curbs from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+. The deal, effective from January, aims to cut 1.2 million bpd until the end of June to forestall an overhang, in a move producers and many analysts expect to soon help balance supply and demand.  Suhail Al Mazrouei, the Energy Minister of the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday the oil market should achieve this balance in the first quarter of 2019. OPEC and its allies meet on April 17 and 18 in Vienna to review the agreement, but a draft cooperation charter seen by Reuters fell short of a new formal alliance among the producers. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, along with older sanctions on fellow OPEC member Iran, have also prevented crude prices from falling further.

Chinese stock indexes played catch-up when reopening after a week-long break. Gains came as the commerce ministry said retail earnings during the Lunar New Year holiday jumped 8.5 percent from the period last year, even though growth in the world’s second largest economy is slowing. China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower while South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were slightly firmer after it was toppled from a four-month top on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan on public holiday. “Ranges have been on the tight side today, and nobody has been prepared to stamp down any authority,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne broker Pepperstone. “I have no doubt that will change as we head through the week, with trade relations slap bang at the epicentre of concerns,” he said. Tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and roiled global financial markets. A new round of trade talks began in Beijing on Monday, with higher-level talks involving U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday. If the negotiations do not progress sufficiently by March 1, the U.S. has said it intends to raise tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China to 25 percent from 10 percent. “U.S.-led trade uncertainty along with increasing concerns over the extent of the current global growth slowdown has seen an increase in demand for core global bonds,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank. “Against a backdrop of uncertainty and despite a Fed that is comfortably on hold, the dollar continues to win the least ugly contest.” The U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled patience on policy after delivering four hikes in 2018, citing growing economic risks from a slowdown in global growth. The dollar index held near a six-week high around 96.695 against a basket of currencies, setting up for its sixth straight session of gains as traders piled into the greenback in a safe-haven move. World markets are already under strain from a drumroll of gloomy news on the global economy. Last week, the European Commission sharply downgraded euro zone growth for this year and next and  U.S. President Donald Trump added to the anxiety with a declaration that he had no plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. Adding to worries, a collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers over the weekend amid a clash over immigrant detention policy raised fears of another government shutdown. The rising pressure on growth means the near term fortunes of the equity markets will partly depend on earnings from major U.S. companies. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc , Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc for further clues about the health of the consumer sector. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier, which would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Elsewhere, the euro was barely changed at $1.1322 after five straight days of losses took it to more than 2 weeks lows. Sterling dithered at $1.2931. The Australian dollar inched up from Friday’s one-month lows although sentiment was still cautious after the country’s central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut. Oil prices slipped on concerns about slowing global demand amid a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 56 cents weaker at $52.16 per barrel while Brent fell 36 cents to $61.74.

2019-02-11,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East oil benchmarks Dubai and DME Oman have nudged above prices for Brent crude, an unusual move as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran along with output cuts by OPEC tighten supply of medium to heavy sour oil, traders and analysts said. Sour crudes, mainly produced in the Middle East, Canada and Latin America, have a high sulphur content and are usually cheaper than Brent, the benchmark for low-sulphur oil in the Atlantic Basin. But Dubai spot prices and DME Oman crude futures for April have held above ICE Brent at Asia’s market close since the start of February, data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Refinitiv Eikon showed. “The forceful implementation of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude exports, the greater-than-expected recent Saudi crude output cut ... and the uncertainty over U.S. sanction exemptions on Iranian crude have all served to strengthen sour crudes relative to sweet benchmarks such as Brent,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co.     U.S. sanctions on Venezuela suddenly halted its crude exports to the United States last month and created a strong pull for medium and heavy sour crude from other places, said the traders and analysts.  The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars. Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - is also boosting Middle East oil prices. And a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed sour crude prices as well. Market observers expect Middle East producers to cut output of heavier oil to meet the curbs. For a graphic on Sour crude prices rise above Brent, see - tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JB Strong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said. Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.  Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, said one of the traders. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s sour oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia. Meanwhile, refiners globally are also processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade. “Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first-half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said. IMO 2020 refers to a mandate by the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to switch to low-sulphur marine fuel from 2020.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast December’s annual output growth to come in at 2.8 percent. The pace was also faster than November’s output growth, which was initially recorded at 2.5 percent, but later revised to 2.6 percent. The Statistics Department did not provide a reason for the revision. The index measures factory output from the manufacturing, electricity generation and mining sectors. Growth in December was supported by gains in all three sectors, data from the department showed. Manufacturing output rose 4.4 percent year-on-year in December, while the electricity generation sectoral index grew 2.7 percent. Mining output shed previous month’s losses to gain 1 percent in December from a year earlier, the data showed.

A U.S. House of Representatives committee approved a bill on Thursday that would open up the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to antitrust lawsuits, but it was uncertain if the measure would be considered by the full chamber. “OPEC is neither a cartel nor involved in the business of fixing oil prices,” Barkindo told Reuters. “It would be a misjudgment to accuse us of such,” he said on the sidelines of an energy forum in Cairo.  OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries including Russia, an alliance known as OPEC+, are reducing oil output in 2019 to avoid a potential supply glut that could weigh on prices. A similar action in 2017 got rid of an earlier supply glut. “OPEC is an open, transparent organization focused on assisting the oil markets to remain in balance on a sustainable basis, which is a fundamental requirement of investors,” Barkindo said.  “The international oil industry needs market stability to plan and invest in a predictable manner in order to guarantee future supplies.” Reporting by Nadine Awadalla and Alex Lawler in London; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Louise Heavens and David Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec/update-1-opec-isnt-a-cartel-doesnt-fix-oil-prices-barkindo-idUKL5N206421,2019-02-11,"OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad

2019-02-11,"MOSCOW/LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against U.S. sanctions imposed on his country’s oil industry, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group. But a source familiar with the matter said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a founding member, had declined to make any formal statement. OPEC says it is concerned with oil policy, not politics. More than 40 nations including the United States, European powers and most of Latin America have recognised Maduro’s rival, Juan Guaido, as the country’s rightful head of state, following disputed elections last year. The request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters. “Our country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,” Maduro wrote. I seek “your firm support and collaboration to jointly denounce and face this shameless dispossession of ... important assets of one of the members of OPEC”, the letter said. He wrote that OPEC should help to determine potential solutions based on “the impact that this action has on the global energy market, and the risk it represents for the other countries ... of this organization”. OPEC tends to avoid political disputes involving individual members. Last year, it declined a request from Iran for a discussion of U.S. sanctions against Tehran at a policy-setting meeting. Venezuela was once a top-three OPEC oil producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country’s economy. Together with Libya and Iran, it is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut.

2019-02-11,"(Adds details on project, background) Feb 11 (Reuters) - Canadian construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc on Monday cut its full-year profit forecast for the second time because of a dispute related to its mining and metallurgy project in Latin America. The company said the challenges on the project are mainly due to unexpected site conditions, environmental and safety measures, and underperformance from sub-contractors.

2019-02-11,"ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria had more than 70 candidates for president when campaigning began for Saturday’s elections.  But only those from the two main parties - President Muhammadu Buhari and former vice president Atiku Abubakar - have a real shot at leading Africa’s most populous nation. While a handful of the other candidates are touted as civil society alternatives, their chances of winning are slim without the big parties’ wealth and patronage. Muhammadu Buhari, 76, made history in 2015 as the first person to democratically oust an incumbent president in Nigeria. Now, as candidate for the All Progressives Congress (APC), he is seeking a second term. It is his fifth run at the presidency. A reputation as a staunch opponent of corruption was key to Buhari’s victory at the last election.  A Muslim, born on Dec. 17, 1942 in the northwestern town of Daura in Katsina state, Buhari spent his career in the army. Installed as military dictator after a coup in December 1983, his approach was typified by policies that included having people whipped if they refused to queue at bus stops. He was overthrown less than two years later in another coup, after the military figures who installed him became displeased with his methods. But Buhari’s anti-corruption cachet has remained strong among his supporters and helped him run successfully in 2015 against Goodluck Jonathan of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The party had been in power since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999.  Buhari rode a wave of anti-corruption sentiment, coupled with promises to revive the stuttering economy and defeat the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency.  Despite a lack of corruption convictions, Nigeria’s first recession in 25 years and a resurgence of Islamist attacks, those policies are little changed for the 2019 race. He earned the nickname ‘Baba Go Slow’ during his first term when critics said he governed at a glacial pace, particularly when low oil prices caused a currency crisis. The moniker first entered popular usage to describe Buhari when he took six months to appoint a cabinet.  Some, including his wife, have said access to Buhari is tightly controlled by close advisers, known in Nigeria as “the cabal”, and that they are really directing policy.  reut.rs/2WAHLna Buhari was absent for five months in 2017, being treated in Britain for an unspecified ailment. Despite that illness, he announced in early 2018 that he would seek re-election, raising concerns about whether he could serve another four years. Buhari has said he has the energy to do so. To his admirers, Buhari is frugal, moral and prizes loyalty above other qualities in his allies - a foil to the alleged excesses of the PDP. To his critics, he is an ailing relic with little head for policy and no concern for the rule of law. Atiku Abubakar is the 72-year-old candidate for the PDP, the party that inherited power from the military in 1999 and governed for the next 16 years. For the first eight of those years, Atiku was vice president to Nigeria’s new democratic leader and former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo. Atiku, like Buhari, is also a northern Muslim, born in Adamawa state. During the later years of military rule, he became a senior customs official, and later a businessman with ventures in port oil and gas logistics as well as a private university.  He sought the APC presidential ticket for the 2015 elections but lost to Buhari and threw his support behind him, funding his campaign and even lending him a private jet. Atiku switched sides again in 2017, and last year emerged as the PDP’s candidate. He has promised to “make Nigeria work again”, lifting it out of the economic doldrums with business-friendly policies that he says will create jobs. He has for years been dogged by corruption accusations, which he denies. Critics say Atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most Nigerians.     His supporters hoped to have put an end to some of those allegations when Atiku travelled to the United States last month, after years of rumours that he could not because of investigations revealing his ties to corruption there. But Atiku had been barred from entering the United States, and Washington only granted him a temporary reprieve from the ban, Reuters reported last week.  To his supporters, Atiku is an accomplished businessman with the economic credentials needed to boost growth, create jobs and attract foreign investors back to Nigeria as it struggles to recover from the first recession in a generation. His opponents say he is a kleptocrat who lacks a moral compass and consistent ideology.

2019-02-11,"(Reuters) - Scared by looming U.S. anti-cartel legislation for the oil industry, the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies such as Russia have decided against creating a formal body, at least on paper. A draft of a document - setting up a new alliance and dated January 2019 - and seen by Reuters carefully avoids any mention of sensitive issues such as oil prices, market share and production cuts. OPEC and Russia have been cutting production together to support prices since 2017, after clinching a deal in December 2016, in moves that have provoked criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.  A committee of the U.S. Congress passed legislation, known as the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, last week. The draft says OPEC and Russia will discuss creating “a mechanism” rather than “an organization” when they meet in April 17-18 in Vienna, calling for the creation of an “Alliance of Oil Producing Countries”. “It looks genuine. It’s also been updated since,” an OPEC source said without giving any further details. Russia’s energy ministry declined to comment. The objectives of the alliance are listed as setting up “an intergovernmental platform to facilitate dialogue” and “further strengthen the collaboration in the formulation of policies aimed at promoting oil market stability”. The objectives are due to be achieved by promoting a better understanding among its members of energy market fundamentals as well as “permanent dialogue among oil producing countries”, according to the document. Russia is not an OPEC member and has said it does intend to join the organization on a permanent basis. OPEC and Russia jointly produce more than 40 percent of the world’s oil. The idea of an organization of OPEC and non-OPEC countries has been mooted since joint efforts to stabilize oil prices have come to fruition. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in December a joint OPEC and non-OPEC structure seemed unlikely due the additional red tape it would create as well as the risk of U.S. monopoly-related sanctions. The draft document also foresees ministerial meetings twice a year and regular encounters of technical experts.

2019-02-11,"(Adds detail, background) JOHANNESBURG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Eskom warned of wider controlled power cuts on Monday after six additional generating units unexpectedly went offline, underscoring troubles at the struggling state power utility and sending the rand currency lower. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan would meet executives of the company over the crisis, an Eskom spokesman said, as the firm prepared to cut 4,000 megawatts of power from the national grid from 1100 GMT likely until 2000 GMT. The rand currency fell to its weakest in almost three weeks following the news, down 0.94 percent as of 1210 GMT at 13.7375 per dollar. The cash-strapped utility, which supplies more than 90 percent of the country’s electricity power, was also forced to cut power for a sustained period in late November and early December, also due to a shortage of generating capacity. Eskom, which employs 48,000 people, is a cornerstone of Africa’s most developed economy but has racked up debts of $31 billion. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a plan last week to avert Eskom’s economic collapse but is facing opposition from powerful labour unions and from within his ruling African National Congress. Ramaphosa’s plan to split Eskom into three entities would do little to address its financial difficulties, ratings agency Moody’s said on Monday. “The move paves the way for a more transparent group with more clearly allocated revenue and cost between business segments,” Moody’s said, but added that Eskom remained a significant risk to the country’s fiscal strength.

2019-02-11,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East oil benchmarks Dubai and DME Oman have nudged above prices for Brent crude, an unusual move as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran along with output cuts by OPEC tighten supply of medium to heavy oil, traders and analysts said. Heavier grades, mainly produced in the Middle East, Canada and Latin America, typically have a high sulphur content and are usually cheaper than Brent, the benchmark for lighter oil in the Atlantic Basin. But Dubai spot prices and DME Oman crude futures for April have held above ICE Brent at Asia’s market close since the start of February, data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Refinitiv Eikon showed. “The forceful implementation of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude exports, the greater-than-expected recent Saudi crude output cut ... and the uncertainty over U.S. sanction exemptions on Iranian crude have all served to strengthen sour crudes relative to sweet benchmarks such as Brent,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co.     U.S. sanctions on Venezuela that suddenly halted its crude exports to the United States last month created a strong pull for medium and heavy crude from elsewhere, traders and analysts said.  The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars. Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - is also boosting Middle East oil prices. A decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed heavy crude prices as well. Market observers expect Middle East producers to cut output of heavier oil to meet the curbs. “The U.S. may have to replace more than 500,000 bpd (barrels per day) of Venezuelan crude with other more expensive heavy crude sources from the Middle East, particularly as Canadian and Mexican flows to the U.S. are essentially maxed out,” JBC Energy said in a note.  GRAPHIC: Sour crude prices rise above Brent - tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JB Strong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said. Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.  Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, one of the traders said. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s heavy oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia. Meanwhile, refiners globally are processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade. “Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said. IMO 2020 refers to a mandate by the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to switch to low-sulphur marine fuel from 2020.

2019-02-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds added more bullish positions in crude at the start of February but at a much slower pace than before, as optimism about OPEC output cuts was tempered by renewed anxiety about the U.S.-China trade talks. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in Brent crude futures and options for the eighth time in the last nine weeks but by just 1 million barrels. Fund managers added new short positions (+13 million barrels) for the week ended Feb. 5, almost as fast as new long positions (+15 million) suggesting much greater dispersion of views about where oil prices will go next. Funds added short positions at the fastest rate for nine weeks since the week ending Dec. 4 in a sign at least some managers think prices have peaked after the recent rally. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ULZTZE) OPEC’s aggressive output reductions and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have removed significant volumes of crude from the market since the start of the year, boosting prices. But doubts about progress in the U.S.-China trade talks and the outlook for the global economy have returned, with equity prices stalling and bond yields dropping, spilling across into concerns about oil consumption. In contrast, portfolio managers added another 8 million barrels of long positions in European gasoil futures and options, taking the overall net long position to 30 million barrels. Funds remain more cautious on gasoil (with long positions outnumbering short ones by just 2.6:1) than on Brent (where the ratio was 4.8:1), reflecting concerns about the economy, but also suggesting more upside potential. Position-building in gasoil is accelerating as funds anticipate new bunker fuel regulations likely to boost consumption of clean-burning gasoil at the expense of dirty fuel oil from the start of 2020. Perhaps more immediately and importantly, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are hitting the availability of medium and heavy-density crudes, which are particularly suited for making gasoil. The same medium and heavy crude shortage that has pushed medium grades to a rare premium over their lighter counterparts may also be encouraging fund managers to turn a bit more bullish on diesel.

2019-02-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - World stock markets edged higher on Monday, as investors eyed the resumption of trade talks between the United States and China and watched for signs of progress on Brexit. European markets took their cue from a 1 percent bounce in Chinese shares, which resumed trading after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index rebounded from one-week lows, helped by some deal-making and gains in mining and banking shares. It was up 0.65 percent. [.EU]  U.S. stock futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street. Worries about a slowdown in global growth, an ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and U.S. politics have been foremost in investors’ minds.  Safe-haven bonds and the dollar have gained amid the prolonged uncertainty, but stocks have also made a good start to the year, with MSCI’S All-Country World Index up nearly 10 percent. The index was 0.1 percent higher on Monday. The dollar reached its highest in six weeks against a basket of currencies, rising for an eighth consecutive day as investors piled into the world’s most liquid currency. [FRX/] This week’s focuses for investors are likely to be the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit, John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.  “The chief focus will be on that broad U.S. dollar picture and whether resistance gives way for another leg higher, driven by preference for the liquidity of the U.S. dollar as the global outlook remains concerning on all fronts,” he said. “The risk remains that investors are unwilling to commit to a breakout until we see what emerges from U.S.-China trade negotiations and Brexit.” Just six weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union, it still has no exit plan in place. Data on Monday showed the British economy grew last year at its slowest since 2012. China struck an upbeat note as the trade talks resumed, but it also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before March 1, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Worries about Europe’s economic slowdown and plunging inflation expectations dominated morning trade in debt markets. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, held close to 0.10 percent after touching 0.77 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016. The European Commission downgraded its euro zone growth forecasts last week. [GVD/EUR] A collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers has meanwhile raised fears of another government shutdown there. “Trade talks and shutdown (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The rising threat to growth means equity markets will focus on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In Asia, China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slightly higher after it fell from a four-month high on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan closed for a public holiday. Elsewhere, the euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.1317 after five straight days of losses took it to more than two-week lows. Sterling fell to $1.2895 after the Q4 GDP data was released. [GBP/] British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the idea of a customs union with the European Union, ending hopes she would shift her Brexit policy to win over the opposition Labour Party, leaving Britain still on course for a disorderly exit.

2019-02-11,"MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the global oil trading industry gathered for its biggest annual meeting in Asia in September last year, U.S. oil producing companies came well prepared. U.S. giant Exxon Mobil and European rival Royal Dutch/Shell prepared brochures for oil buyers detailing various U.S. crude grades and why they were suitable to replace part of Asia’s long-standing supplies from the Middle East, Africa and Russia. As the oil industry gathers in London this month for the annual IP Week, U.S. crude producers may have every reason to toast the success of their campaign in Europe, as well as Asia. Only a few years ago, before the hydro-fracking and shale revolution overturned the economics of U.S. oil production, the United States was the world’s largest oil importer by far and prohibited exports of oil by law. Now shipments of U.S. crude into Europe have just hit a new record. January imports were 630,000 barrels per day, still - behind Russia and Iraq but above other OPEC producers including Nigeria and Libya. Higher U.S. crude exports have been helped by lower supplies of Iranian and Venezuelan crude, which Washington has put under sanctions, scaring buyers across the world.  In the whole of 2018, U.S. supplies to Europe doubled to 430,000 bpd, according to Refinitiv Eikon flows data. That represented 6 percent of overall imports or equal to the levels of Iranian oil imports to Europe before the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran.  “U.S. crude is a real headache. It puts a lot of pressure on regional light grades. In fact, prices for all grades are affected because it is such a significant extra supply,” said a trader with a European trader selling Russian oil. Pressure will likely only increase as for 2019 U.S. crude oil production is expected to average 12.06 million bpd, up 1.18 million bpd from last year, according to U.S. government. Future predictions say the United States could produce as much as 15 million bpd of crude and up to 20 million bpd of total oil liquids, giving it complete self-sufficiency as it would fully cover its consumption of 18-19 million bpd. Booming U.S. production has prompted OPEC and major non-OPEC producers like Russia to slash output by 3-4 percent since 2017 to prop up prices. The pact has helped double prices to $60 per barrel but at the expense of a market share loss to U.S. firms. “Welcome to the free market,” said a U.S.-based executive of an international trading firm. “Local producers either need to drop their pricing to compete or find other markets”. Competition is particularly acute in northwest Europe, where Britain and the Netherlands imported 6.5 and 5.1 million tonnes of U.S. crude in 2018 respectively.  BP, Litasco, Equinor, Total and ExxonMobil were among the main buyers in the Baltic replacing North Sea barrels with U.S. grades, traders say. “WTI is the new dated Brent,” said a senior crude trader referring to the U.S and European benchmarks. BP takes U.S. oil to its Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany while Poland’s PKN Orlen said in January it would cut Russia’s Urals purchases from Kremlin oil major Rosneft by 30 percent and partially replace it with U.S. barrels. In Britain, the main U.S. oil buyers are Essar Oil and Exxon Mobil, traders said. In the Mediterranean, buyers of U.S. barrels - Italy, Spain, France - tend to use them to replace light Caspian CPC Blend, Russia’s Urals and Iranian oil, traders said. Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum added WTI to its list of preferred crude options alongside Urals and CPC as did Turkey’s Tupras. In Italy, U.S. oil flows to Kuwait Petroleum’s Milazzo refinery and the Swiss Varo Energy’s plant. WTI was by far the most popular U.S. grade among European buyers in 2018, followed by Midland Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mars.  As the world moves to tighter marine fuel regulations, which will increase demand for light barrels, demand for U.S. oil - which is predominantly light - will only rise. “I expect U.S. crude to become even more popular in Europe. It seems that whatever is happening to oil markets these days, the U.S. benefits,” said a trader with large European major.

2019-02-11,"* LPG project’s investments seen at over $300 mln * Annual production seen at 500,000 tonnes of propane and butane * Consortium yet to respond to Vitol - sources By Damir Khalmetov and Alla Afanasyeva MOSCOW, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Vitol, the world’s top oil trader, plans to access liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan and may finance the construction of a processing and export facility, industry and company sources told Reuters. LPG is mainly a by-product of oil development at the field and at the moment there is no infrastructure for refining, storage and transportation of LPG from Kashagan. The new facility, expected to be commissioned about two years from now, will desulfurize liquid propane-butane mix delivered by pipeline from Kashagan’s Bolashak plant, fraction it into propane (some 70-75 percent) and butane (some 25-30 percent) and tranship to railway tank cars. Vitol, Kazakhstan’s largest crude offtaker, is ready to invest in the project - worth over $300 million - as soon as this year to build a facility annually producing 500,000 tonnes of propane and butane, according to Reuters sources. The trader has approached North Caspian Operating Co (NCOC), the field operator, and Kashagan’s shareholders with a proposal to build the LPG processing and export facility near Karabatan railway station in the Atyraus region, but no immediate reaction followed. Vitol declined to comment, but Vitol sources confirmed the trader’s interest in the project. The sources said that according to the Kazakh government’s schedule, the plant is set to be commissioned in 2021. “NCOC has no comment on any commercial discussions that may be ongoing at this time,” the consortium said in a statement. Kazakhstan’s Energy Ministry provided no comment. The new facility may help Vitol boost its presence in the Kazakh LPG export sector. Vitol plans to deliver propane and butane to the global market via Russia’s Black Sea terminal in Taman, where Vitol has a transhipment contract. The proposed terms of cooperation between Vitol and Kashagan’s stakeholders were not immediately clear, sources said. “Vitol wants to buy low-grade LPG, purify it and sell via Taman,” a source familiar with the matter said. Kashagan, one of the biggest oil discoveries in recent history, started commercial output in late 2016 after years of delays and currently produces about 350,000 barrels of crude per day. Natural gas output at Kashagan in 2018 reached 6.8 billion cubic metres, Kazakh Energy Ministry data shows. Kashagan operator NCOC includes Eni, Total , Shell, ExxonMobil, Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz, China’s CNPC and Japan’s Inpex.

2019-02-11,"(Corrects spelling of oil minister’s name in first paragraph and throughout) NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela is open to barter-like payments from India to boost oil sales to the world’s third-biggest oil consumer, the South American country’s oil minister Manuel Quevedo said on Monday. Venezuela buys a slew of products including medicines from India, and it is looking for alternative payment mechanisms after application of the latest stringent U.S. sanctions. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “The relationships with India will continue,  the trade will continue and we will simply expand all the trade and relationship,” Quevedo told reporters on the sidelines of Petrotech conference, without giving any further details on how a barter mechanism with India would work. Venezuela’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude oil it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela’s oil output is now at 1.57 million bpd, Quevedo said. The Venezuelan oil minister, who now holds the rotating presidency of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said it was important to listen to all the consuming countries that represent oil demand to maintain the balance of demand and supply in the markets. “Inventory levels, demand, supply are the elements taken into account while trying to maintain the balance the global industry needs,” Quevedo said. Unilateral sanctions by the United States have reduced PDVSA’s oil output and caused a loss of about $20 billion to its oil revenue-dependent economy, he said. “U.S. exercises kidnapping of resources around the world ... It is financial persecution. Now they want to steal Citgo Petroleum from Venezuela,” he said. Citgo Petroleum Corp is a unit of PDVSA and Venezuela’s top foreign asset. Citgo operates three U.S. refineries that supply about 4 percent of total U.S. fuel production, and it is PDVSA’s largest U.S. customer for its oil exports. Following the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, both sides have engaged in aggressive moves for control of Citgo, which has roots in the United States dating back 100 years, but has been owned by Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, for three decades. Sanctions have forced Citgo and other U.S. refiners to seek crude oil supplies from other nations.

But neither looks set to produce a breakthrough, prolonging the uncertainty,” Societe Generale told clients in a note. China struck an upbeat note as talks resumed, but it also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before a March 1 deadline, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. In fixed income, fears of economic slowdown in Europe and plunging inflation expectations dominated morning trade on Monday. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield remained close to 0.10 percent. Last week, the European Commission  downgraded euro zone growth forecasts for this year. Adding to worries, a collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers over the weekend raised fears of another government shutdown. “Trade talks and shut-down (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, fell as low as 0.77 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016, reflecting concern in bond markets about economic conditions. The rising threat to growth means equity markets will partly depend on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc . Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In Asia, China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slightly higher after it fell from a four-month high on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan on public holiday. Elsewhere, the euro was barely changed at $1.1322 after five straight days of losses took it to more than two-week lows. Sterling fell to $1.2895 after UK GDP data for the fourth quarter was released. Britain’s economy slowed as expected in the final three months of last year, pushing growth in 2018 to its weakest in six years as Brexit worries hammered investment. British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the idea of a customs union with the European Union, ending hopes she would shift her Brexit policy to win over the opposition Labour Party. May will promise lawmakers a second opportunity to influence the Brexit talks later in the month in a bid to stave off any rebellion from within her own party by those who fear Britain could end up leaving without a deal. The Australian dollar inched up from Friday’s one-month lows, although sentiment was still cautious after the country’s central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut. Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 0.6 percent lower at $52.42 per barrel. Brent was flat $62.12.

2019-02-11,"* Dreyfus sees consolidation in Brazil milling sector * Alvean expects slight global sugar surplus in 2019/20 (Adds more quotes, context) By Maha El Dahan  and Dahlia Nehme DUBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Commodities trading firm Louis Dreyfus expects faster switching between sugar and ethanol production in Brazil, with more flexible mills leading to “dramatic” price-driven shifts. “Usually you have to see sugar playing a premium over ethanol or the opposite for a period of time before you start seeing the switch, “ Enrico Biancheri, head of sugar trading worldwide at Louis Dreyfus, which has a controlling interest in Brazilian sugar and ethanol maker Biosev SA, said. Depressed sugar prices have led Brazilian companies to increase their capacity to produce ethanol, with many mills able to switch between using cane to produce either sugar or biofuel ethanol depending on which is more profitable. “Recently the industry is learning to become more pragmatic and more economics driven. The low sugar price is a driver by itself so the mills have to be more flexible in order to generate more,” Biancheri told a Dubai conference on Monday. Biancheri also said he expected consolidation within the Brazilian milling industry to continue with the best performers buying up assets from those that are financially stressed. Meanwhile Gareth Griffiths, chief executive of Alvean, said prices were “at the tipping point” for sugar and ethanol. Alvean, the largest sugar trader globally, is expecting a slight sugar surplus for 2019-2020 of around 2 million tonnes. Analysts have been expecting a small sugar deficit for the period after years of surplus that have depressed prices. This view was supported by Sucden general manager Thierry Songeur who predicted a slight deficit by the end of 2019-2020, with India the unknown quantity. India could export as much as 5 million tonnes to the market this year and a switch to more ethanol production will not take place in the short term to get rid of its surplus, he said. “Ethanol will not be your remedy in the short term.” Biancheri also said anticipation about the potential for ethanol in India had been going on for “quite some time” but the steps needed were not being taken quickly enough. “It will be more of a mid to long term story,” he said.

2019-02-11,"* Shah was U.S.’ closest ally * Iran squeezed by U.S. sanctions * Iran, foes wage Middle East proxy wars By Parisa Hafezi DUBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Iranians held nation-wide rallies on Monday to mark the 40th anniversary of the fall of the Shah and the triumph of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shi’ite cleric who led an Islamic Revolution that rattles the West to this day. On Feb 11, 1979, Iran’s army declared its neutrality, paving the way for the collapse of the U.S.-backed monarch, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East. State TV showed large crowds carrying Iranian flags and chanting “Death to Israel, Death to America,” trademark chants of the revolution. One banner read: “Much to the dismay of America, the revolution has reached its 40th year.” President Hassan Rouhani said Iran was determined to expand its military power and ballistic missile programme despite mounting pressure from hostile countries to curb Iran’s defensive work, state TV reported. “We have not asked and will not ask for permission to develop different types of ... missiles and will continue our path and our military power,” Rouhani said in a speech at Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) square, where tens of thousands gathered to mark the anniversary. The large turnout in state-sponsored rallies came as Iranians face rising prices, food shortages and high inflation that have triggered waves of protests. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers last year and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran, dealing a blow to the country’s economy. Iranian officials said the move amounted to “economic warfare” Soldiers, students, clerics and black-clad women holding small children, flocked to the streets of cities and towns, many carrying portraits of Khomeini and Iran’s current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Regional power Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries have viewed Iran with great suspicion since the Islamic Revolution swept the Shah from power, fearing Khomeini would inspire Islamic militants across the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia are locked in proxy wars in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. Writing by Parisa Hafezi, Editing by Michael Georgy, William

Chinese stock indexes played catch-up when reopening after a week-long break. Gains came as the commerce ministry said retail earnings during the Lunar New Year holiday jumped 8.5 percent from the period last year, even though growth in the world’s second largest economy is slowing. China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower while South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were slightly firmer after it was toppled from a four-month top on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan on public holiday. “Ranges have been on the tight side today, and nobody has been prepared to stamp down any authority,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne broker Pepperstone. “I have no doubt that will change as we head through the week, with trade relations slap bang at the epicentre of concerns,” he said. Tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and roiled global financial markets. A new round of trade talks began in Beijing on Monday, with higher-level talks involving U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday. If the negotiations do not progress sufficiently by March 1, the U.S. has said it intends to raise tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China to 25 percent from 10 percent. “U.S.-led trade uncertainty along with increasing concerns over the extent of the current global growth slowdown has seen an increase in demand for core global bonds,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank. “Against a backdrop of uncertainty and despite a Fed that is comfortably on hold, the dollar continues to win the least ugly contest.” The U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled patience on policy after delivering four hikes in 2018, citing growing economic risks from a slowdown in global growth. The dollar index held near a six-week high around 96.695 against a basket of currencies, setting up for its sixth straight session of gains as traders piled into the greenback in a safe-haven move. World markets are already under strain from a drumroll of gloomy news on the global economy. Last week, the European Commission sharply downgraded euro zone growth for this year and next and  U.S. President Donald Trump added to the anxiety with a declaration that he had no plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal.

2019-02-11,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East oil benchmarks Dubai and DME Oman have nudged above prices for Brent crude, an unusual move as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran along with output cuts by OPEC tighten supply of medium to heavy sour oil, traders and analysts said. Sour crudes, mainly produced in the Middle East, Canada and Latin America, have a high sulphur content and are usually cheaper than Brent, the benchmark for low-sulphur oil in the Atlantic Basin. But Dubai spot prices and DME Oman crude futures for April have held above ICE Brent at Asia’s market close since the start of February, data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Refinitiv Eikon showed. “The forceful implementation of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude exports, the greater-than-expected recent Saudi crude output cut ... and the uncertainty over U.S. sanction exemptions on Iranian crude have all served to strengthen sour crudes relative to sweet benchmarks such as Brent,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co.     U.S. sanctions on Venezuela suddenly halted its crude exports to the United States last month and created a strong pull for medium and heavy sour crude from other places, said the traders and analysts.  The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars. Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - is also boosting Middle East oil prices. And a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed sour crude prices as well. Market observers expect Middle East producers to cut output of heavier oil to meet the curbs. For a graphic on Sour crude prices rise above Brent, see - tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JB Strong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said. Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.  Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, said one of the traders. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s sour oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia. Meanwhile, refiners globally are also processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade. “Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first-half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said. IMO 2020 refers to a mandate by the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to switch to low-sulphur marine fuel from 2020.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast December’s annual output growth to come in at 2.8 percent. The pace was also faster than November’s output growth, which was initially recorded at 2.5 percent, but later revised to 2.6 percent. The Statistics Department did not provide a reason for the revision. The index measures factory output from the manufacturing, electricity generation and mining sectors. Growth in December was supported by gains in all three sectors, data from the department showed. Manufacturing output rose 4.4 percent year-on-year in December, while the electricity generation sectoral index grew 2.7 percent. Mining output shed previous month’s losses to gain 1 percent in December from a year earlier, the data showed.

2019-02-11,"(Repeats story first issued on Feb. 10 for wider distribution, no changes to text) By Sudarshan Varadhan GREATER NOIDA, India, Feb 10 (Reuters) - South Sudan will return to producing more than 350,000 barrels of crude per day by the middle of 2020, up from current levels of just over 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) currently, the country’s oil minister said on Sunday. Production is expected to rise to 270,000 bpd by the end of 2019, Oil Minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Petrotech conference in Greater Noida, a satellite city of India’s capital New Delhi. The world’s youngest country, which split from Sudan in 2011, has one of the largest reserves of crude in sub-Saharan Africa, only a third of which have been explored so far. The country lost many of its oilfields to a civil war that broke out two years after its independence. A September peace agreement is largely holding. “By the end of the year, block 3 and 7 will be hitting 180,000 bpd, blocks 1, 2 and 4 will be producing 70,000 bpd, and block 5A will be producing 20,000 bpd,” Gatkuoth said. “We used to produce 350,000 to 400,000 bpd. We expect to go back to those levels by the middle of next year,” he said. South Sudan has signed a preliminary agreement with Russia’s Zarubezhneft for exploring some of the blocks, Gatkuoth said. “They are interested in block B1, B2, E1 and E2. We will be working to see where they are likely to be interested in the most,” he said. South Africa, which has committed to investing $1 billion in the country, would collaborate with South Sudan on the construction of pipelines and a new refinery along the border with Ethiopia, the minister said. “We have agreed to build a refinery on the border of Ethiopia, we have already signed an agreement with Ethiopia to offtake refined products,” Gatkuoth said. Land-locked South Sudan is looking to boost its export options as it looks beyond its neighbour Sudan, the minister said. “We have new blocks in the southern part of South Sudan, oil from which will be exported to East Africa (through the new pipelines),” he said. American oil majors such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron showed interest in investing in South Sudan, but are currently not interested because of the conflict, he said. “We have been approaching Exxon officials, and I will be meeting them in Houston next month,” he said.

2019-02-11,"(Repeats Feb. 8 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - “Once upon a time ...” Storytelling is one of the most fundamental human impulses. Humans have been telling stories for thousands of years as a means of entertainment but more importantly to help them make sense of the world around them and to transmit that understanding to others. Narratives are a way of organising a series of actions or events to understand the process of cause and effect, helping make sense of the past and anticipate the future. “Anthropologists, who conduct research on the behaviour of diverse tribes around the world, have observed a universal that people use narrative to explain how things came to be and to tell stories. “Visitors to any human society will observe people facing each other, sitting around the television, or the campfire, together and vocalising, and more recently tweeting, stories,” according to economist Robert Shiller. “It seems the human mind strives to reach enduring understanding of events by forming them into a narrative that is imbedded in social interactions” (“Narrative economics”, Shiller, 2017). Or according to the Pixar rules of storytelling, compiled by Emma Coates, the ideal narrative runs: “Once upon a time there was … , Every day …. , One day … , Because of that … , Because of that … , Until finally …” (“Pixar tips”, Washington Post, June 25, 2012). The narrative impulse is hard-wired into our brains and is present in every creation myth, fairy-tale, history book, academic research paper, newspaper, political rally and corporate earnings call. Satisfying stories obey a few simple rules: * Good stories start at the beginning (“once upon a time”) and move linearly through a sequence of events to a conclusion (“the end”). * Cause and effect are closely and intuitively linked and should be roughly proportionate to one another (big consequences should stem from big causes). * Each effect should have a single cause, or at most a small and easily comprehended number, rather than result from the complex and incomprehensible interaction among many causes. * Heroes and villains should be clearly identified and eventually be rewarded or punished by the chain of events according to some definition of morality. * Luck, chance and randomness can play a part, but hard work, intelligence, worthiness and free will are more important in determining outcomes. The problem with the campfire model (mono-causal, linear, proportionate, moral and determinant) is that it fails to explain many important real-world processes (which are non-linear/circular, exponential, amoral and random). Financial market movements, business cycles, oil cycles and even the rise and fall of companies, corporate leaders and politicians – none of them can be properly explained and predicted by the traditional narrative model. In these real examples, processes are multi-causal, complex, do not always produce virtuous winners, and often do not lead to clear outcomes and predictions. Descriptions of real-world processes often fail as satisfying stories – while emotionally pleasing stories often fail to explain and predict the real world properly. Politicians, business leaders, campaigners and opinion formers often prefer simpler narratives that provide a more satisfying explanation, stir an emotional response and serve as a call to action. The narratives used to frame and explain an issue can have a powerful impact on how businesses, employees, customers and voters respond and the choices they make (sometimes unconsciously). Storytelling can influence the real world as much as the other way around, so narratives can be instruments of power, whether they are right or wrong. But forecasters and analysts should prefer accurate descriptions of real processes, for all their limits of complexity and indeterminacy. The limits of predicting outcomes from circular and complex processes with a significant random element mean forecasts should normally be expressed as scenarios with an associated probability distribution. Even then, many forecasts are hyper-sensitive to small changes in the starting point or assumptions about the causation process, so the probability distribution itself is often highly unstable or uncertain. Forecasters should always be humble about their ability to make accurate predictions, especially far into the future or when many variables are changing simultaneously. Often the most useful part of forecasting is the discipline of having to think in a rigorous way, identifying and analysing all the potential variables in play, getting a better sense of the range of uncertainty. Once the key variables have been identified, some risks can be eliminated, transformed, insured or managed, while others simply have to be borne. Campfire storytellers are judged by the emotional satisfaction their narratives provide; forecasters and analysts should expect to be judged by a different standard. Acknowledging and embracing uncertainty is not a sign of failure or lack of courage but an honest admission of the limits of forecasting and of the complex way in which processes evolve.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.44 per barrel at 0036 GMT, down 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $62 a barrel. In the United States, energy firms last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks, a weekly report by Baker Hughes said on Friday. Companies added 7 oil rigs in the week to Feb. 8, bringing the total count to 854, pointing to a further rise in U.S. crude production, which already stands at a record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd). C-OUT-T-EIA Elsewhere, the head of Russian oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, has written to the Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Moscow’s deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to withhold output is a strategic threat and plays into the hands of the United States. The so-called OPEC+ deal has been in place since 2017, aimed at reining in a global supply overhang. It has been extended several times and, under the latest deal, participants are cutting output by 1.2 million bpd until the end of June. OPEC and its allies will meet on April 17-18 in Vienna to review the pact. Preventing crude prices from falling much further have been U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, targetting its state-owned oil firm PDVSA. “The issues in Venezuela continue to support prices. Reports are emerging that PDVSA is scrambling to secure new markets for its crude, after the U.S. placed additional sanctions on the country,” ANZ bank said on Monday.

2019-02-11,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visits Hungary, Slovakia and Poland this week he wants to make up for a lack of U.S. engagement that opened the door to more Chinese and Russian influence in central Europe, administration officials say. On a tour that includes a conference on the Middle East where Washington hopes to build a coalition against Iran, Pompeo begins on Monday in Budapest, the Hungarian capital that last saw a secretary of state in 2011 when Hillary Clinton visited. On Tuesday he will be in Bratislava, Slovakia, for the first such high-level visit in 20 years. “This is overdue and needed,” a senior U.S. administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Our message is we have to show up or expect to lose. “Our efforts at diplomatic engagement are aimed at competing for positive influence and giving allies in the region an indication of U.S. support and interest in order to have alternatives to China and Russia.” Washington is concerned about China’s growing presence, in particular the expansion of Huawei Technologies, the world’s biggest telecom gear maker, in Hungary and Poland.  The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei’s equipment could be used for espionage and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. Huawei denies engaging in intelligence work for any government. Pompeo will also voice concerns about energy ties with Moscow, and urge Hungary to not support the TurkStream pipeline, part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe. Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and its main domestic source of electricity is the Paks nuclear power plant where Russia’s Rosatom is involved in a 12.5 billion-euro ($14 billion) expansion. It is also one of the EU states that benefit most from Chinese investment. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said this month the United States could help Hungary diversify away from Russian energy by encouraging ExxonMobil to proceed with long-stalled plans to develop a gas field in the Black Sea. The administration official said there had been progress toward sealing bilateral defence accords with Hungary and Slovakia, which is looking to buy F-16 fighter jets.  Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland, said U.S. engagement with the region fell after EU and NATO enlargement to central Europe, and as Washington’s attention moved to Asia and conflict in the Middle East. “A lot of Americans thought our work in the region was done, and yet it was not so,” said Fried, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington. “There was a sense in the last administration that eastern and central Europe was a finished place.” The bulk of Pompeo’s Poland visit will focus on a U.S. conference on the “Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East”. Vice President Mike Pence will also attend the two-day event that starts on Feb. 13. Washington hopes to win support to increase pressure on Iran to end what the it says is its malign behaviour in the Middle East and to end its nuclear and missile programmes. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal on limiting Iran’s nuclear work last year but the European Union is determined to stick with it. It is unclear what delegations European capitals will send to what Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has called a “desperate anti-Iran circus”. “We think anybody who doesn’t participate is going to be missing out,” a second administration official said. White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son in law, will discuss a U.S. plan for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, although he is not likely to give details.

2019-02-11,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday signed an order withdrawing more than two-thirds of the state’s National Guard troops from the U.S.-Mexico border, calling claims of an illegal immigration crisis there nothing but “political theatre.” Newsom said most of the roughly 360 National Guard members deployed to the border would be reassigned to other duties in the state, with about 100 remaining behind as part of a task force targeting drug trafficking and cartels. “This whole border issue is a manufactured crisis. We are not interested in participating in this political theatre,” Newsom said at an afternoon news conference in Sacramento. The governor, a Democrat who took office in January, said border crossings were at their lowest level since 1971 and that the state’s undocumented population had dropped to a more than 10-year low. “This is pure politics, period full stop,” he said. The move was a rebuke to President Donald Trump, who won election in 2016 partly on a populist pledge to build a wall on the southern U.S. border which he said in his campaign Mexico would pay for.  Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion to help build that wall was central to a 35-day partial U.S. government shutdown that ended last month. He agreed to reopen the government for three weeks to allow lawmakers time to find a compromise and avert another shutdown on Feb. 15.    Newsom’s predecessor, Governor Jerry Brown, agreed to send National Guard troops to the border last April after reaching agreement with the Trump administration that they would focus on fighting criminal gangs and smugglers and not enforce immigration laws.    New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham last week ordered the withdrawal of most National Guard troops deployed at the border by her Republican predecessor at Trump’s request last year. Trump has deployed an extra 3,750 U.S. troops on the border this month. Newsom said some of the National Guard troops would be re-deployed to help fight what he said were mushrooming illegal marijuana farms following approval of a 2016 ballot measure to legalize recreational cannabis - legislation the governor helped champion. “We have to hold accountable those who are not participating in the legal cannabis market,” he said. “These illegal grows are manifesting, getting bigger.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, Peter Szekely in New York, Rich McKay in Atlanta and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-california/update-2-california-pulls-most-national-guard-troops-from-u-s-mexico-border-idUKL1N2060T6,11 Feb 2019,"California Governor

2019-02-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is considering releasing its draft proposal to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline without including simultaneous measures it promised the oil industry to curb biofuel credit speculation, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The move would help the agency lift a summertime ban on sales of so-called E15 gasoline in time for the U.S. driving season, but is likely to anger oil refiners that had been asking the Trump administration for biofuel credit market reforms to reduce their costs. If EPA passed on introducing biofuel credit trading limits, it would leave the door open to potential speculative price surges that could cost refiners like Valero Energy Corp hundreds of millions of dollars. President Donald Trump announced in October he was directing the EPA to allow year-round sales of E15, in a win for the powerful corn industry which supplies ethanol. E15 gasoline contains 15 percent ethanol, versus the 10 percent found in most U.S. gasoline. The ban had been imposed over concerns that E15 contributes to smog in hot weather. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud declined to comment.  The EPA had initially planned to combine credit trading limits into the E15 rule as a concession to the oil industry, which says speculation increases the price of biofuel credits it must purchase to comply with federal law.  Under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard oil refiners have to blend increasing volumes of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year, or purchase credits - called Renewable Identification Numbers - from those who do.     The combined draft proposal was scheduled for release this month, and was meant to be finalised and implemented by June. “The EPA has been seriously looking at dropping the RIN reform to speed up the process on E15,” one industry source with knowledge of the matter said. One other source said that the EPA had already decided to delay the credit trading limits. “They separated the RIN reform to ensure that the (E15) rule would get done in a timely manner,” the source said. The sources asked not to be named discussing the matter.  The agency is still working to release its draft rule for E15 by the end of the month, possibly within days, and is planning to expedite the rule-making process to finish it by June when seasonal driving demand picks up. The recent partial government shutdown in the United States had raised concerns the effort might not be completed on time because agency workers were furloughed. Bill Wehrum, a senior EPA official, in charge of the department drafting the rule, said the agency would still make it ready for summer driving season.

2019-02-11,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Iranians marched and some burned U.S. flags to mark the revolution’s 40th anniversary on Monday as Tehran showed off ballistic missiles in defiance of U.S. efforts to curb its military power. Soldiers, students, clerics and black-clad women holding small children thronged streets across Iran, many with portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shi’ite cleric who toppled the Shah in an Islamic uprising that still haunts the West. On Feb. 11, 1979, Iran’s army declared its neutrality, paving the way for the fall of U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. State television showed crowds carrying Iranian flags in cold rainy weather, shouting “Death to Israel, Death to America” - trademark chants of the revolution.  The Islamic Republic has vowed to increase its military strength despite mounting pressure from Western countries to curtail its ballistic missile programme. Those capabilities were on display during the march, including the Qadr F, a ground-to-ground missile with a 1,950-km (1,220-mile) range, Tasnim news agency said. “We have not asked and will not ask for permission to develop different types of ... missiles and will continue our path and our military power,” President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech at Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) square. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday that the Iranian government had let down its people.  “40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror. The regime in Iran has produced only #40YearsofFailure. The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future,” he posted in both English and Farsi. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also responded on Twitter. “#40YearsofFailure to accept that Iranians will never return to submission. #40YearsofFailure to adjust US policy to reality. #40YearsofFailure to destabilise Iran through blood & treasure. After 40 yrs of wrong choices, time for @realDonaldTrump to rethink failed US policy,” he wrote. Iranians face mounting economic hardships many blame on the country’s clerical leaders, and pictures on social media showed some people also demonstrating against corruption, unemployment and high prices.  “Our presence in the 40th anniversary of the revolution is to show our support for the Islamic Republic,” said one sign held by a protester. “But it does not mean we support corruption of some officials and their betrayal of the oppressed people.” Reuters could not independently verify the pictures.  Last year, Iran cracked down on protests over poor living standards that posed the most serious challenge to its clerical elite since a 2009 uprising over disputed elections.  Prices of basic foodstuffs have soared since Trump withdrew Washington from world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Iran last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. In January, Rouhani said Iran was dealing with its worst economic crisis since the Shah was toppled.  But he remained defiant on Monday as Iranians recalled the end of a monarch who catered to the rich. “The Iranian people have and will have some economic difficulties but we will overcome the problems by helping each other,” he said. Yadollah Javani, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ deputy head for political affairs, said Iran would demolish cities in Israel if the United States attacked. “The United States does not have the courage to fire a single bullet at us despite all its defensive and military assets. But if they attack us, we will raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground,” Javani told the state news agency IRNA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the threat. “I am not ignoring the threats of the Iranian regime, but nor I am impressed by them,” he said. “Were this regime to make the terrible mistake of trying to destroy Tel Aviv and Haifa, it would not succeed, but it would mean that they had celebrated their last Revolution Day. They would do well to take that into account.” Washington and the Arab world have viewed Iran with great suspicion since the Islamic Revolution, fearing Khomeini’s radical ideology would inspire militants across the Middle East. Today, the United States, its Arab allies and Israel are trying to counter Tehran’s growing influence in the Middle East, where it has proxies in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.  Iran also has vast clout in Iraq, where Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the overseas arm of the Revolutionary Guards, was frequently photographed guiding Shi’ite militias in the war against Sunni Islamic State militants.

2019-02-11,"Feb 11 (Reuters) - Foreign partners of Venezuela’s PDVSA are facing pressure from the state-run oil firm to publicly declare whether they will continue as minority stakeholders in Orinoco Belt projects following U.S. sanctions, three people familiar with the matter said. The sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), imposed last month in an attempt to dislodge Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, barred access to U.S. financial networks and oil supplies for the PDVSA joint ventures, pressuring the nation’s already falling crude output and exports. PDVSA’s Orinoco Belt joint venture partners, mostly U.S. or European companies, are facing difficulties getting cash-flow out of the country as a result of the sanctions, straining their ability to continue output and exports. PDVSA has been in talks with the companies to persuade them to commit publicly to the joint ventures, the sources said in recent days. PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. On Monday, Venezuelan Oil Minister and PDVSA head Manuel Quevedo said on a visit to India that relations with international oil companies including Chevron were continuing. France’s Total SA, Norway’s Equinor ASA, Russia’s Rosneft and U.S.-based Chevron hold minority stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA that produce crude and operate oil upgraders capable of converting the country’s extra-heavy oil into exportable grades. The four crude upgraders are capable of converting up to 700,000 barrels per day. The oil is exported by the joint ventures and each partner receive its share of the exports. Total believes it can stay in Venezuela, its Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Monday, although the firm last week said its bank accounts were blocked and it had evacuated its foreign employees. Rosneft has continued working normally at its Petromonagas joint venture with PDVSA, according to the sources. Equinor declined to comment on operational issues, referring questions to Petrocedeno, its joint venture with PDVSA. Chevron did not immediately reply to a request for comment. PDVSA last week ordered Petrocedeno to halt oil production and upgrading, due to a lack of naphtha to dilute the extra-heavy crude, according to sources from the project. The Petrocedeno-PDVSA venture’s 220,000-bpd upgrader was already out of service when the decision was made, one of the people said. It is unclear when oil output will be halted. PDVSA is studying if the other joint ventures in the Orinoco will have to halt operations, with diluent supplies dwindling, the people said. India’s Reliance and PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum are the main suppliers of naphtha to Venezuela, according to internal PDVSA data. Those flows have declined since sanctions took effect on Jan. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

2019-02-11,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan military forces have full control of Libya’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, a spokesman said, in a challenge to the internationally recognised government in Tripoli. There was no immediate confirmation or comment from state oil firm NOC which operates with foreign partners the 315,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) field deep in Libya’s southern desert. LNA (the Libyan National Army) based in eastern Libya began an offensive in the south last month to fight militants and secure oilfields. Last Wednesday, the LNA reached a remote pumping station of  El Sharara, but had until now not moved on the main field, which a force of state guards and tribesmen seized in December demanding funds. Production stopped then. “Peacefully with no resistance LNA has full control over Sharara oilfield with all its facilities,” the LNA spokesman said on Twitter, adding the facility was being secured. Pictures posted online showed jubilant soldiers standing in front of an El Sharara signpost. Reuters was unable to reach workers at the field for further information. Hours earlier, the LNA’s chief of staff, Abdel-Razeq Nathouri, told Reuters the soldiers were negotiating access to the field. The internationally recognised government in Tripoli had tried sending its own commander, Ali Kennah, to secure the field. El Sharara had formally belonged to the Tripoli administration which in reality had been unable to exercise control. Kennah had flown on the weekend to the nearby El Feel oilfield and later made it to El Sharara, but failed to take control of it, oil workers have said. Oil production in Libya, a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been disrupted since conflict broke out in 2011, with protesters and armed groups often targeting oilfields and energy infrastructure. National production stands at under 1 million bpd, well below pre-2011 capacity of 1.6 million bpd.

2019-02-11,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday welcomed a probe into whether officials improperly tried to help construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc, making clear he sought to ride out a potential scandal just months ahead of elections. Independent ethics commissioner Mario Dion said he would look into allegations, first raised by the Globe and Mail newspaper, that Trudeau officials last year had pressured Jody Wilson-Raybould, when she was the country’s justice minister and attorney general, to help SNC-Lavalin avoid a trial over bribery and corruption charges linked to Libyan contracts. “We welcome the ethics commissioner’s investigation. ... It’s extremely important that Canadians can continue to have confidence in our system,” Trudeau told reporters in Vancouver. Although Dion’s office has only limited powers to sanction wrongdoing, the probe shows the affair may become more problematic for Trudeau as he prepares for a close-run re-election bid this October.  Wilson-Raybould was unexpectedly demoted last month and given the more junior post of veterans affairs minister, prompting speculation she was being punished for insisting the trial go ahead rather than allowing SNC-Lavalin to pay a fine. Trudeau said he had “full confidence” in Wilson-Raybould, who has declined to discuss the matter. Pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research said he did not think the allegations would immediately hit the Liberals’ chances. “One thing in isolation usually doesn’t have a massive material impact on support. But if something else comes out that is similar to this ... that’s the risk for the government,” he said in a phone interview. That said, there are signs of unhappiness. Liberal legislator Wayne Long said he was “extremely troubled” by the allegations and wanted a full and transparent investigation. Wilson-Raybould’s father, Bill, said on Facebook that she had been “demoted because she would not ‘play ball’ with the Big Boys who run the Liberal Party.” Opinion surveys by Nanos and others show the Liberals with only a slender lead over the official opposition Conservatives. The leader of the Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, said in a newspaper editorial on Monday that Trudeau was “a fraud.” Last week Trudeau denied that his office tried to pressure Wilson-Raybould to make a deal with SNC-Lavalin, which faces fraud and corruption charges linked to allegations that former executives paid bribes to win Libyan contracts under Muammar Gaddafi’s regime, which fell in 2011. SNC has argued it should be allowed to avoid a trial because the executives accused of wrongdoing have left the company and it has overhauled ethics and compliance systems. Justice Minister David Lametti told CTV on Sunday it was still theoretically possible he could direct federal prosecutors to drop the idea of a trial. One source with knowledge of the matter said it was not unusual for an attorney general to have “robust conversations” with colleagues as they gathered data in such situations. But the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, insisted there had been no interference in the SNC-Lavalin case.  Wilson-Raybould “is not someone who takes these issues lightly and she would not have stood for this had she thought people were trying to influence her in a way that was not right. ... She would have quit,” the source said. SNC-Lavalin is based in the politically powerful province of Quebec, where the Liberals need to capture more seats to have any chance of winning a second successive majority government. The company cut its full-year profit forecast for a second time on Monday, citing a dispute with a client related to a mining project in Latin America. SNC-Lavalin shares were trading down 7.7 percent shortly before the market close.

2019-02-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets globally inched higher on Monday after China struck an upbeat tone as trade talks between the United States and Beijing resumed, though worries remained over the fate of Brexit.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.22 points, or 0.21 percent, to 25,053.11, the S&P 500 gained 1.92 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,709.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.71 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,307.91.  European markets closed higher, with the benchmark Stoxx 6000 index gaining 0.8 percent, while Chinese shares rose more than 1 percent on the first day of trading after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.03 percent. Worries about a slowdown in global growth, the U.S.-China trade dispute and the possibility of another U.S. government shutdown have been foremost on investors’ minds. At the same time, Britain is due to leave the European Union in six weeks, though it still has no exit plan in place. Data on Monday showed the British economy grew last year at its slowest since 2012. “The risk remains that investors are unwilling to commit to a breakout until we see what emerges from U.S.-China trade negotiations and Brexit,” said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank.  China expressed hopes for a trade breakthrough as talks between the world’s two largest economies resumed, though a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea cast a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before March 1, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Safe-haven bonds and the dollar have gained amid the prolonged uncertainty. The dollar reached its highest in six weeks against a basket of other currencies, rising for an eighth consecutive day as investors piled into the greenback.  Worries about Europe’s economic slowdown and falling inflation expectations dominated morning trade in debt markets. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, held close to 0.10 percent after touching 0.077 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016. The European Commission downgraded its euro zone growth forecasts last week.  U.S. benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.6554 percent, compared with 2.63 percent late on Friday. A collapse in border protection talks between U.S. Democratic and Republican lawmakers raised fears of another government shutdown. “Trade talks and shutdown (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The rising threat to growth means equity markets will focus on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the path  of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 0.6 percent lower at $52.40 per barrel. Brent was 1 percent lower at $61.48.

2019-02-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Monday as worries surrounding the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks overshadowed support from OPEC-led supply restraint. Brent crude futures lost 59 cents, or 0.95 percent, to settle at $61.51 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 31 cents, or 0.59 percent, to settle at $52.41 a barrel. Trade talks between the United States and China resumed with working-level discussions before high-level discussions later in the week. Beijing, however, expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea. This cast a shadow as the two countries try to reach a deal before the March 1 deadline when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline, dampening hopes of a quick trade pact. Escalating U.S.-China trade tensions have cost both countries billions of dollars and disrupted global trade and business flows, roiling financial markets. “There’s a lot of uncertainty about what’s going on with this trade war, whether they’re going to get anything done,” said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “You’ve got concerns about slowing growth.” A rising U.S. dollar also weighed on oil futures. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. “Until some dollar weakness begins to develop, the complex could have difficulty advancing much this week even allowing for some supportive elements out of an upcoming slew of energy releases,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Still, oil prices have been buoyed this year by output curbs from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+. The deal, effective from January, aims to cut 1.2 million barrels per day until the end of June to forestall a supply overhang. Suhail Al Mazrouei, the energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday the oil market should achieve this balance in the first quarter of 2019.  OPEC and its allies meet on April 17 and 18 in Vienna to review the agreement, but a draft cooperation charter seen by Reuters fell short of a new formal alliance among the producers. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, along with older sanctions on fellow OPEC member Iran, have also prevented crude prices from falling further. Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against the sanctions, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group. The country also wants to double its oil sales to India and is open to barter payment arrangements with the world’s third-biggest crude consumer, Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said on Monday.

2019-02-11,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Swiss authorities are assisting Brazilian prosecutors in their investigation into an alleged corruption scheme involving global commodity trading firms Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura, a spokesman for the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland said on Monday.  The spokesman said the attorney general’s office had received requests between June 2018 and January 2019 for “mutual legal assistance” from Brazilian prosecutors relating to their probe. Brazilian prosecutors have alleged that executives of the commodities companies, including some in the United States, were involved in improper payments to executives at Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA. The U.S. Justice Department has launched its own investigation into these business dealings.   The attorney general’s spokesman added the requests concerned “in particular two of the three companies mentioned, as well as several natural persons (individual people). These requests are still being executed.” He did not identify the two companies or the individuals. Brazilian federal prosecutors and the trading firms did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Vitol and Glencore have previously said they are cooperating with Brazilian authorities, and Trafigura has said it takes the allegations seriously. All three have been suspended from business dealings with Petrobras. In December last year, Brazilian prosecutors alleged the three firms and others collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras officials to secure advantages in deals.  The announcement marked a new phase in the years long “Car Wash” corruption probe that has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America. Swiss, U.S. and Brazilian authorities have worked closely on Car Wash cases that led to the world’s largest ever leniency deal after industrial conglomerate Odebrecht agreed to pay $2.6 billion.  The Swiss attorney general announced in November 2016 that it had opened a criminal probe into a Trafigura employee as part of a wider investigation into suspected corruption at Petrobras. The spokesman said that investigation was ongoing, without providing an update.

2019-02-11,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday contracts private companies have with state-run power utility CFE should be revised to keep electricity prices low, sending shares in one firm tumbling. “We are urging companies that have agreements with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) to come together to review contracts and above all to reach an agreement that electricity prices will not increase,” Lopez Obrador said during his morning press conference. The president, a leftist who took office in December, pledged during the campaign to strengthen the CFE and avoid energy price hikes during his term.  Lopez Obrador noted that the state-owned utility is already contractually obliged to pay billions of dollars to the private companies that developed seven natural gas pipelines to supply power plants, even though the projects are incomplete and unable to deliver gas. Those companies are Mexican energy infrastructure firm IEnova, a unit of U.S.-based Sempra Energy; TransCanada Corp; and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim’s Carso, said CFE chief Manuel Bartlett. Over the past couple decades, Mexico has transitioned to  natural gas to generate most of its power, relying increasingly on imports via pipeline from the United States. At Lopez Obrador’s behest, Bartlett cited by name several former public servants who are now energy company executives, accusing them of taking part in a scheme to “destroy” the CFE. “If the pipelines can’t be built, as is happening in seven large gas pipelines, the companies still have to be paid even if there’s no gas,” said Lopez Obrador. IEnova’s shares dropped as much as 6.95 percent, TransCanada’s 0.67 percent and Carso’s 0.94 percent after the comments. In a statement to the Mexican stock exchange, IEnova said it has one pipeline that began operations in 2017 but that “sabotage” interrupted supplies to CFE.   Some companies have been unable to complete construction of pipelines because of opposition from local communities. In other cases, the companies cannot deliver the gas even though the pipelines have been completed because of delays in building and converting power plants. Lopez Obrador has been a staunch critic of 2013-14 energy reforms that ended the wholesale electricity monopoly held by CFE. “We are looking to achieve a voluntary restructuring of agreements and commitments within the framework of the law ...  the government is committed to not increasing electricity prices for consumers, but we want private companies to help,” he said.

2019-02-11,"(Adds statement from Missouri’s natural resources department, details on weather) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp said on Monday a stretch of its Keystone crude pipeline from Nebraska to Illinois remained shut after a leak was discovered in the area of St. Louis, Missouri, last week. The cause and source of the spill have not been determined and there is no estimated timeline for a restart, TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email. The closure affects the line that runs from Steele City, Nebraska, to Patoka, Illinois. The 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline system is a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Midwest. TransCanada told Keystone shippers last week it was declaring force majeure on shipments affected by the shutdown, according to a notice seen by Reuters. Force majeure is a declaration that unforeseeable circumstances prevented a party from fulfilling a contract. Canadian pipelines have been running at capacity as a production surge in Alberta overwhelmed existing pipeline infrastructure, forcing the Alberta provincial government to order production cuts starting last month. Western Canadian heavy crude has attracted greater demand in recent days following U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s state oil company. The discount on Canadian heavy crude compared with U.S. light oil traded at about $11.50 per barrel on Monday, slightly wider than Friday’s level of about $11 a barrel, according to Net Energy Exchange. Excavation crews worked through the weekend, but work was hampered by inclement weather, a spokesman for Missouri’s Department of Natural Resources said. The total amount of oil spilled has not been determined and contractors will assess the exposed pipeline on Monday, spokesman Brian Quinn said in an email. Temperatures in the St Louis area dropped more than 10 degrees Fahrenheit below average levels over the weekend, data from weather-forecaster AccuWeather showed. TransCanada said personnel working on the cleanup of the spill affirm that the released product is controlled and there is no threat to public safety. Both TransCanada and Enbridge Inc shut their lines in the St Louis area last week as officials investigated the source of the leak. Enbridge said on Monday its Platte crude pipeline resumed normal operations on Friday evening.

2019-02-11,"(Adds background on other projects) HOUSTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Sentinel Midstream on Monday became the latest contender in the race to build a crude export terminal off the U.S. Gulf Coast, announcing plans to develop a facility off Freeport, Texas that could fully load a supertanker in one day. The Dallas-based company’s announcement follows seven other proposed crude export terminals vying to build a facility capable of loading a very large crude carrier (VLCC) without relying on smaller vessels to transfer crude cargoes, a process called reverse lightering that adds several days to loading times. Some executives, traders and analysts said they believe not every proposed terminal project will get built. Sentinel’s project would include an onshore terminal with 18 million barrels of storage, an offshore pipeline, platform and single-point mooring buoys that will load VLCCs, which carry 2 million barrels, at a rate of 85,000 barrels per hour. The company said it has financial backing from Dallas private equity firm Cresta Fund Management. Magellan Midstream Partners LP late last month said it is also considering Freeport as a spot to build an offshore crude export terminal, after it began talks with companies developing crude transportation assets there. Magellan is also considering a site near Corpus Christi, Texas. The current slate of eight projects would have a combined export capacity of 12.5 million barrels per day, more than is currently produced in the United States. “Right now there may only be enough demand for one project in Corpus and one in the Houston area,” said Perry Schuldhaus, vice president of business development at Enbridge Inc , in an interview on Monday. “It comes down to customer demand.” Enbridge on Jan. 31 submitted permit applications with the U.S. Maritime Administration to build an offshore export terminal near Freeport that could be in service by early 2022 with storage capacity of 15 million barrels and export capacity of 2 million barrels per day.

2019-02-11,"* Eskom cuts 4,000 MW from national grid * Test for Ramaphosa months before election * Rand currency, Eskom dollar bonds slump * Eskom board says to audit power system (Updates after Eskom board statement) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - South Africa’s Eskom implemented the most severe power cuts in  years on Monday after seven generating units unexpectedly went offline, underscoring the challenge President Cyril Ramaphosa faces to fix the struggling state-owned utility. Ramaphosa is trying to reform cash-strapped Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the power in Africa’s most industrialised economy but is drowning in 419 billion rand ($30 billion) of debt, to lift the economy before an election in May. But he has been hampered by fiscal constraints, as well as a sharp deterioration in Eskom’s power plant performance after years of mismanagement during which critical maintenance work was delayed. The rand fell to its weakest in almost three weeks, and Eskom’s dollar-denominated 2028 bond suffered its steepest daily fall in more than two months, as investors fretted about the economic impact of the power cuts. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the company would cut 4,000 megawatts from the national grid from 1100 GMT on Monday, likely until 2000 GMT, and that the last time Eskom had slashed so much power was in the 2014/15 financial year. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan met Eskom executives and the firm’s board of directors to discuss a way out of the crisis. They decided to conduct a full audit of the country’s power system to identify weak points and avoid further crises, the board said in a statement. Four of the seven units that unexpectedly went offline were back in service by Monday evening, while the remaining three would be back by Tuesday morning, the statement added. Ramaphosa, who announced a plan last week to split Eskom into three separate entities in an effort to make it more efficient, said on Twitter the power cuts had come as a shock and were “most worrying”. Ramaphosa’s plan to split Eskom faces opposition from powerful labour unions and within his ruling African National Congress party, while some analysts have said a bolder approach was needed. Ratings agency Moody’s said on Monday an “unbundling” of Eskom into different units for generation, transmission and distribution would pave the way for greater transparency but do little to solve the firm’s financial difficulties. “While this is a bold step, it probably won’t be enough. Splitting it in three doesn’t fix the issue that Eskom is in a very dire financial situation,” said Trieu Pham, an emerging market debt strategist at Dutch bank ING. Eskom was also forced to cut power for a sustained period in late November and early December, also due to a shortage of generating capacity because of unplanned outages. $1 = 13.8106 rand

2019-02-11,"Feb 11 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said on Monday it  approved a request by TransCanada Corp’s Columbia unit to put part of the company’s $600 million Gulf XPress natural gas pipeline into service in Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. Gulf XPress is one of several pipelines designed to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in the U.S. Southeast and Gulf Coast The 0.88-billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) Gulf XPress project includes construction of seven new compressor stations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to power about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. New pipelines built to remove gas from the Marcellus and Utica have enabled shale drillers to boost output in Appalachia to a record high of 31.6 bcfd in February versus 26.9 bcfd in the same month a year ago. That represents about 38 percent of the nation’s total dry gas output of 83.3 bcfd in 2018. A decade ago, Appalachia was responsible just 1.6 bcfd, or 3 percent, of the country’s total production in 2008.

2019-02-11,"* U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil firm * Venezuela now exports some 300,000 bpd of oil to India * India’s exports to Venezuela still modest (Adds context, data on Venezuelan exports) By Nidhi Verma and Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela is open to barter payment arrangements with India as it seeks workarounds to U.S. sanctions imposed in late January, Venezuelan Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo said on Monday. Caracas, which buys medicines and other products from India, is looking for alternative payment methods to keep oil flowing to what is now its first destination for crude exports after its U.S. customers froze purchases due to sanctions. Quevedo said he wants to double sales to India, which last year bought more than 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Venezuela. “The relationships with India will continue, the trade will continue,” Quevedo said, adding that Venezuela wanted to expand trade in services and technology with New Delhi. The minister told reporters during a conference that Venezuela aimed to double oil supplies to India from 300,000 bpd now. Before sanctions, the United States bought more than 500,000 bpd, making it Venezuela’s largest buyer. “India also wants to increase the intake,” Quevedo said after a meeting with Indian refiners in New Delhi. The U.S. government on Jan. 28 issued its toughest sanctions yet against PDVSA, barring companies based in Venezuela and U.S. subsidiaries from transferring proceeds of oil sales to PDVSA’s bank accounts until a new government being formed by congress head Juan Guaido sets up new foreign accounts. Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, partly owned by Russia’s Rosneft, both buy Venezuelan oil. Reliance is one of PDVSA’s largest cash payers and a prominent fuel supplier to Venezuela through its U.S. unit RIL, according to internal trade records from the state-run company. Last year, Reliance and Nayara jointly imported 344,100 bpd of Venezuelan crude, down 13 percent from 2017, according to ship tracking data reviewed by Reuters. But India last year remained Venezuela’s second largest destination for oil exports. Barter deals could help India balance its trade with Venezuela. In fiscal 2017/18, India’s imports from Venezuela were worth $5.87 billion while its exports were $79.3 million, Indian trade ministry data showed. The minister said Venezuela’s oil output was now 1.57 million bpd, about half its level at the start of the century. Secondary sources estimate production is about 1.2 million bpd. Quevedo, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said it was important to listen to oil-consuming nations as OPEC and other producers sought to balance supply and demand in the market. The minister said U.S. sanctions meant Venezuela had lost $20 billion in revenues. He did not give a time frame. Guaido, who proclaimed himself president last month in a move recognized by the United States and some of its allies, is trying to obtain income accrued by PDVSA’s U.S. refining subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum Corp. In response, PDVSA is taking steps to remove at least two American executives from Citgo’s board of directors, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. “U.S. exercises kidnapping of resources around the world. ... It is financial persecution. Now they want to steal Citgo Petroleum from Venezuela,” Quevedo said, confirming Venezuela’s efforts to remove the two U.S. executives from the board. Despite U.S. sanctions, Quevedo said there was no shortage of gasoline in Venezuela and said the country’s relations with international energy companies continued. “We have strategic association with several companies around the world,” he said, adding that one of those was U.S. energy company Chevron Corp.

2019-02-11,"(Adds minister comments, Total and BP comments, context) By Nadine Awadalla and Aidan Lewis CAIRO, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Egypt’s gas output will get a boost this year as the country’s huge Zohr field nears peak production and with $1.8 billion in investment from BP, officials said on Monday, as Egypt returns to export markets and positions itself as a regional hub. Egypt hopes to leverage its strategic location and well-developed infrastructure to become a key international trading and distribution centre for gas, a potentially remarkable turnaround for a country that spent about $3 billion on annual liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports as recently as 2016. It has made a series of big discoveries in recent years, including Zohr, the largest gas field in the Mediterranean, helping to draw back investors that had pulled away after a 2011 uprising led to mounting debt payments. “What we have achieved in only three years has started to attract the attention of everybody — everybody in oil and gas industry, financial organizations ... everyone is looking to Egypt with interest,” Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told an energy forum in Cairo. Egypt is now hoping to tap long underutilised liquefaction plants, where gas is turned into LNG, to export supplies across the Mediterranean along with that of its neighbours, like Israel, which said it would pipe gas to Egypt later this year. Egypt imported its final natural gas shipment last September, and said it will begin exporting to Jordan this year, though the exact level of shipments and timeline is still unclear. Its domestic production level stands at about 6.6 billion cubic feet per day. BP said in September it will spend about $1.8 billion this year getting several fields online, making Egypt its largest investment destination worldwide for a second year running. “For the last two years in a row we’ve invested more money in Egypt than in any other country,” BP CEO Bob Dudley said at the conference. “So this is a deep, deep commitment to Egypt.” Total production at BP’s West Nile Development will soar to nearly 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) after the project’s third field, Raven, comes online. About 700 million cubic feet per day will come online by April from the first two, Giza and Fayoum, Molla said. The country’s top gas asset, Zohr, discovered by Eni in 2015, will near peak production of about 3 bcfd from 2.1 billion currently by the end of 2019, Molla said, further boosting potential export capacity. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said the French oil major is considering developing downstream petrochemicals in Egypt after having acquired a stake in Idku, one of its two liquefaction plants. Eni, which owns a stake in the country’s other liquefied natural gas plant in Damietta along with Spain’s Gas Natural has said the long idle plant should restore operations this year. “There is no date, however there is a strong interest for all involved parties in having Damietta restart as soon as possible,” said Eni Chief Midstream Gas and Power Office Massimo Mantovani. Molla said results of two exploration tenders held last year for 27 blocks would be announced during the three-day forum, and that it had seen “high turnout” from international companies. He said about 80 percent of arrears to international oil companies had been paid, but did not specify the amount left. In July they stood at $1.2 billion.

2019-02-11,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania environmental regulators suspended all permit work for Energy Transfer LP after the company failed to comply with an October order following an explosion of the Revolution natural gas pipe in the western part of the state in September. The company said the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) action on Friday did not affect operation of any pipeline that is in service or construction where permits have already been issued. Energy Transfer said it is “committed to bringing the Revolution project into full compliance with all environmental permits and applicable regulations.” Revolution is a gas gathering pipeline that feeds into Energy Transfers’ Rover gas pipeline and Mariner East natural gas liquids pipes. The explosion occurred on Sept. 10.  In October, the DEP ordered Energy Transfer to “stabilize disturbed areas” of Revolution and “prevent further erosion from the construction area.” The DEP, however, said the company “had not fulfilled the terms of the order and was not progressing toward compliance.” Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said in a statement the suspension will affect the in-service date for Revolution, which is currently not in service, and the Mariner East 2 pipeline. Part of Mariner East 2 went into service at the end of December. The governor said there are 27 approvals currently under review by DEP for Mariner East 2. He said Revolution will remain closed until full compliance has been achieved. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said they do not expect the suspension to delay the full startup of Mariner East 2 or 2X. Officials at Energy Transfer were not immediately available to say when the remaining part of Mariner East 2 or 2X would enter service. In the past, the company said 2X would enter service in the second half of 2019. Mariner East 1, meanwhile, remains out of service after the discovery of a sink hole near the pipe in January. The pipe was also shut in March due to sink holes. Energy Transfer started work on the $2.5 billion expansion of Mariner East in February 2017 and had planned to finish the new 350-mile (563-kilometer) pipeline in the third quarter of 2017. But completion was delayed by work stoppages by state agencies due to permit violations and other problems, including release of drilling fluids into waterways and the discovery of sinkholes.

2019-02-11,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has concluded that palm oil cultivation results in deforestation and its use in transport fuel should be phased out, but environmentalists criticized it on Monday for allowing a number of exceptions. The Commission published its proposed criteria for determining what crops caused harm at the weekend, following a law passed by the European Union last year to end the use of feedstocks in biofuels that damage the environment. Under the new EU law, the use of more harmful biofuels will be capped at 2019 levels until 2023 and reduced to zero by 2030. The law has caused an uproar in palm oil producing countries. Indonesia has threatened to challenge it at the World Trade Organization, while Malaysia is looking into restricting imports of French products over French plans to remove palm oil from biofuel in 2020.  The Commission proposal, designed to become law after four weeks of feedback, said 45 percent of the extra land used for palm oil production since 2008 had previously been forested, compared with 8 percent for rival oil crop soybeans and 1 percent for sunflowers and rapeseed. However, it also said producers who could show they had intensified yields may be exempt. It could then be argued that their crops cover demand for biofuel and for food and feeds, without needing expansion onto non-agricultural land, such as forests. Such higher-yielding crops would be considered as less harmful if they, for example, are small holdings or entail cultivation of food or feed on “unused land”. Bas Eickhout, a Greens EU lawmaker who has been active on the file, said the exemptions were excessive and would allow large producers to wreak destruction. “The battle is not over... (We) still have time to close these loopholes and clamp down on destructive palm oil entering the EU,” he said. Campaign group Transport & Environment said loopholes meant that Europe could keep using the same amount of palm oil in diesel that it does today. An exemption for small-holdings made no sense, it said, as there was no link between size of plantation and deforestation risk and because farmers of small lots typically sold to mills controlled by large corporations. It also said it deplored the Commissions exemption for soy.

JP Morgan was one of the organisers of the deal. * Last week, Gazprom placed the 7-year Eurobond with a yield of 5.15 percent, Refinitiv IFR reported.

2019-02-11,"(Adds 2019 forecast, analyst comment, project details) Feb 11 (Reuters) - Canadian construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc on Monday cut its full-year profit forecast for the second time, citing dispute with a client related to a mining project in Latin America. SNC did not name the customer, saying the matter was confidential, but analysts said the dispute was related to one of the company’s projects with Chile’s Codelco, which ran into environmental and labor union challenges last year. SNC won a contract from Codelco to help upgrade the Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile in 2012, followed by a deal to build sulphuric acid plants at the mine in 2016. Last year, Chile’s state miner faced mass protests at the mine as the planned overhaul faced delays due to technical issues and rising costs. The challenges on the project are mainly due to unexpected site conditions, environmental and safety measures, as well as underperformance from sub-contractors, SNC said in a statement. Due to the negative impact from the project, the core earnings for the fourth quarter from its mining and metallurgy unit could record a loss of up to C$350 million, the company said. SNC-Lavalin said it aimed to complete the project in the second quarter of 2019 as it had agreed to settle the dispute with the help of an independent third party. The company now expects its 2018 adjusted profit of C$1.20 to C$1.35 per share, down from its prior forecast of C$2.15 to C$2.30 per share. SNC had earlier cut its profit forecast in January, citing troubles related to the project and ongoing trade challenges in Saudi Arabia. “All told, the setback on the Mining & Metallurgy (M&M) project is disappointing but management provided important clarity on its 2019 outlook and financial standing,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Yuri Lynk in a note. Since there are no new mining projects in its segment and the project is scheduled to wrap up soon, SNC could recover a portion of these losses in the future, Lynk added. SNC said it expects 2019 adjusted profit outlook to be in the range of C$3.00 to C$3.20. The company is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb.22. Shares of the company were down 4.9 percent at C$34.9 in morning trading.

2019-02-11,"NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Stock markets globally edged higher on Monday as investors eyed the resumption of trade talks between the United States and China and watched for signs of progress on Brexit. European markets rebounded from last week’s declines after Chinese shares rose 1 percent on the first day of trading after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.55 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,113.88, the S&P 500 gained 3.92 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,711.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 17.81 points, or 0.24 percent, to 7,316.00. Worries about a slowdown in global growth, the U.S.-China trade dispute and the possibility of another U.S. government shutdown have been foremost in investors’ minds. At the same time, Britain is due to leave the European Union in six weeks though it still has no exit plan in place. Data on Monday showed the British economy grew last year at its slowest since 2012. “The risk remains that investors are unwilling to commit to a breakout until we see what emerges from U.S.-China trade negotiations and Brexit,” said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. China struck an upbeat note as the trade talks resumed, but it also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before March 1, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Safe-haven bonds and the dollar have gained amid the prolonged uncertainty. The dollar reached its highest in six weeks against a basket of other currencies, rising for an eighth consecutive day as investors piled into the greenback. Worries about Europe’s economic slowdown and falling inflation expectations dominated morning trade in debt markets. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, held close to 0.10 percent after touching 0.077 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016. The European Commission downgraded its euro zone growth forecasts last week. U.S. benchmark 10-year notes last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.659 percent, compared with 2.63 percent late on Friday. A collapse in talks between U.S. Democratic and Republican lawmakers has meanwhile raised fears of another government shutdown. “Trade talks and shutdown (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The rising threat to growth means equity markets will focus on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 0.8 percent lower at $52.31 per barrel. Brent was 0.2 percent lower at $61.97.

2019-02-11,"MARJ, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan military forces are in talks with protesting state guards to take over the nation’s largest oilfield El Sharara peacefully and pass it to the state oil firm, a commander said on Monday. The comments by Abdel-Razeq Nathouri, chief of staff of the Libyan National Army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar, may soothe fears of a battle for the 315,000 barrels-per-day field. Libya has been in turmoil since the NATO-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with rival administrations and armed groups controlling different territories. The LNA began an offensive in the south last month to fight Islamist militants, Chadian opposition forces and cross-border smugglers, as well as to secure oil installations. It reached a remote pumping station, but has not moved on the main El Sharara field which a rival force of state guards seized in December demanding money. Production stopped then. “We are now in talks with the guards. In the end, Libyans mustn’t fight each other,” Nathouri, who is Haftar’s No. 2, told Reuters at his office in the city of Marj in the Green Mountains, a 90-minute drive from main eastern city of Benghazi.  He did not give details of financial negotiations with the state guards holding El Sharara, though he said their demands on salary payments and uniforms were rightful and would be met. Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the negotiations with the group at El Sharara. Tensions there and at the nearby 70,000 bpd El Feel field have risen in past days after the LNA banned flights without its permission.  Nathouri said his forces would hand El Sharara over to the Tripoli-based National Oil Company (NOC) once it had control, as it did with oil ports in the centre of Libya last year after expelling an armed group holding them. Players in east Libya have tried to bypass Tripoli, where an internationally-recognised government sits, and export oil direct, but the United Nations has prohibited that, deterring potential buyers.  To keep oil flowing, Libya’s only source of income apart from gas exports, the east has accepted to route oil exports through decade-long established channels via NOC Tripoli.  On Saturday, the LNA carried out four air strikes near the El Feel oilfield, run by NOC, after a plane landed there, a field engineer said. It intercepted the plane after takeoff the next day to search it. The Tripoli government, which opposes a rival Benghazi administration backing the LNA, said the planes were evacuating wounded from a previous battle, as well as oil workers. But Nathouri said in reality the plane had transported a commander from the capital, Ali Kennah, to lead forces in the south. Kennah, however, was no threat as he had been unable to muster a force, he said.  The LNA had no intentions to move on El Feel as the field was operating without security issues, Nathouri said. “We don’t move on oilfields which are working normally and are under control by NOC. We only move on sites under threat of external forces,” he said. Libya used to pump up to 1.6 million bpd under Gaddafi’s rule, but that plunged to as low as 90,000 in 2013 due to strife and blockades at fields. Now, with El Sharara paralysed, NOC produces around 1 million bpd, industry sources say.

2019-02-11,"* Rand weakens more than 1 pct * Stocks follow emerging-market shares higher (Adds stocks, latest prices) JOHANNESBURG, Feb 11 (Reuters) - South Africa’s rand fell to its weakest in almost three weeks on Monday as state electricity firm Eskom stepped up controlled power cuts because of a shortage of generating capacity. At 1456 PM, the rand was 1.12 percent weaker at 13.7675 per dollar, its softest level since Jan. 24, after Friday’s close of 13.6150. “Load-shedding is never good, especially from a growth perspective. The weakness you’re seeing now is certainly linked to the power cuts. It will be interesting to see what the finance minister says next week about bailing out (state firms),” Unum Capital trader Michael Porter said. Cash-strapped Eskom, which supplies 90 percent of the country’s electricity, resumed blackouts on Sunday. The previous ones had been in early December. It said on Monday it would increase the power cuts from the national grid to 4,000 megawatts from 2,000 megawatts after six of its generating units unexpectedly went off line, and that outages would probably last until 2000 GMT. President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday he planned to split Eskom into three separate entities in a move to avert a financial crisis that ratings firms have warned poses a major risk to the country’s sovereign rating. Investors, however, seemed unconvinced and by Friday had upped bearish bets on the currency, with the premium on options to sell the rand jumping to around one-month highs. “We see potential for the rand’s further depreciation in the next few sessions,” Juri Kren, an analyst at Continuum Economics, said in a note. Bonds also suffered on Monday, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 12.5 basis points to 8.780 percent, its highest since Jan. 30. In the equities market, stocks followed emerging markets after a move higher in major Asian markets as they returned from the Lunar New Year holiday propped up emerging-market shares on Monday.

2019-02-11,"LISBON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp said on Monday it expects higher crude output, refining margins and efficiency gains to deliver a steep rise in 2020 and beyond as its Brazilian and Angolan operations pump up the volumes. While a relative minnow compared with oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total and Exxon , Galp is a household name in Portugal, distributing gas and selling petrol via a network of branded service stations. Traditionally an oil refiner, Galp has attracted interest because of its oil and gas production growth prospects from stakes in projects in Brazil, Angola and Mozambique and China’s Sinopec owns a 30 percent in its Brazilian assets. Galp said its oil output rose 15 percent in 2018 and it expects a rise of 8-12 percent in 2019 after delays with the start-up of Brazilian projects, and by 12-16 percent in 2020. The offshore Iara field is now due to start producing in the second half of 2019, its chief executive Carlos Gomes da Silva said on a post-earnings conference call, adding that Galp also expects its upstream earnings to benefit from lower oil taxes. “After 2020, we are assuming a higher production versus the previous guidance. We expect to benefit from the increase contributions from Lula and Iara, where we see positive signs,” Gomes da Silva added. While Galp’s fourth-quarter net profit was below forecasts, falling by 42 percent to 109 million euros, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose four percent, ending the full year at 2.2 billion euros. It projected EBITDA of 2.1 to 2.2 billion euros for 2019, but said that this should jump to more than 3 billion euros in 2020, with further growth through 2025. Shares in Galp were up 0.5 percent at 1423 GMT, helped by a 15-percent proposed increase in the dividend payout, of 0.63 euros a share, traders said. Analysts at Santander said that despite a weak quarter, affected by mark-to-market hedging losses and scheduled refinery maintenance, they expected “highly differentiated upward earnings trend” in the next few years. “We still reason to be optimistic for sound delivery 2019 onward - particularly upstream,” they wrote, reinforcing their ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock. “The value support and cash outlook is bright for Galp in our view.” Galp CFO Filipe Silva said that hedging contracts should have a positive impact in the coming quarters, while in refining, Galp expects recent initiatives aimed at increasing gains by $1 per barrel to make a full contribution by 2020. The company also said it hopes to see the first oil from the Kaombo South project in Angola this year.

2019-02-11,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp expects only five of its current 10-strong board to stand for reelection at an annual shareholder meeting in May, as it restructures after filing for bankruptcy last month because of potential liabilities from California wildfires. The utility said it also expected the board to include 11 independent directors by the time of the meeting, currently set for May 21. It did not say how big the board would finally be, or which directors it expected to stay on, only that the independent members would be in a majority. Hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management LLC last month demanded the complete removal of the embattled Californian power company’s board, saying the bankruptcy filing was unnecessary and harmed the interests of the company’s shareholders. “We fully understand that PG&E must re-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders,” PG&E said in a statement on Monday. “We recognize the importance of adding fresh perspectives to the Board to help address the serious challenges the business faces.” A heated court hearing in San Francisco at the end of last month saw U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup hold off on changing the terms of the company’s probation from its conviction for a 2010 natural gas pipeline blast. Alsup also scolded the company for not being focused enough on safety. The company has since outlined plans to increase the controversial practice of shutting off the power to communities at risk of wildfire when dangerous conditions such as high winds and dry heat are present. The board said it was working to identify candidates who would improve its expertise in safety, operations and other critical areas. BlueMountain did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2019-02-11,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against U.S. sanctions imposed on his country’s oil industry, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group. But a source familiar with the matter said the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a founding member, had declined to make any formal statement. OPEC says it is concerned with oil policy, not politics. More than 40 nations including the United States, European powers and most of Latin America have recognised Maduro’s rival, Juan Guaido, as the country’s rightful head of state, following disputed elections last year. The request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters, a day after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL].  “Our country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,” Maduro wrote. I seek “your firm support and collaboration to jointly denounce and face this shameless dispossession of ... important assets of one of the members of OPEC”, the letter said. He wrote that OPEC should help to determine potential solutions based on “the impact that this action has on the global energy market, and the risk it represents for the other countries ... of this organisation”. The sanctions on Venezuela have boosted global oil prices, which were trading at around $62 a barrel on Monday. The move has disrupted shipments as more than 20 tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil have been anchored off the U.S. Gulf Coast. Still, analysts say there is ample spare capacity in other oil producers such as Saudi Arabia plus strategic reserves in consuming nations to compensate for a loss of Venezuela’s exports. OPEC tends to avoid political disputes involving individual members. Last year, it declined a request from Iran for a discussion of U.S. sanctions against Tehran at a policy-setting meeting. Venezuela was once a top-three OPEC oil producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country’s economy.  Energy research and consulting firm Rystad sees Venezuelan  production plummeting to 680,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year, from 1.34 million bpd at the end of 2018. Venezuela pumped 3 million bpd at the turn of the century. Together with Libya and Iran, Venezuela is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut due to the involuntary decline in production.

2019-02-11,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The political career of Thailand’s Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi lasted only three days, but in that time her declaration that she would be a candidate for prime minister in a March election shook up the kingdom. For the sister of King Maha Vajiralongkorn to enter politics was shocking enough, but what threatened to upend Thailand’s political dynamic was the fact that she declared her candidacy for a populist party linked to an exiled former prime minister. By Monday, the country’s Election Commission had disqualified the princess, 67, from taking part in the election, echoing the words of the king himself, who said on Friday her candidacy was “inappropriate”. Still, even though the princess won’t be a candidate in the March 24 vote, her political ambitions - and the populists’ audacious gambit in nominating her - could linger in voters’ minds. The election is the first since a 2014 military coup, and will pit allies of ousted ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra against urban and middle class opponents espousing extreme devotion to the Thai monarchy. Thaksin or his proxies have won every election in Thailand since 2001. With its nomination of the king’s sister for prime minister, the Thai Raksa Chart party sought to flip the longstanding charge by opponents that Thaksin and his allies were insufficiently loyal to the monarchy. The royal family is revered in Thailand as semi-divine. Insulting the monarchy is against the law, punished by up to 15 years in prison. By longstanding tradition, the royal family have kept themselves above politics as a symbol of Thai culture. Since 2005, when protesters drawn mostly from the middle-class and urban establishment began demonstrating against Thaksin’s rule, the rallying call of anti-Thaksin forces has been to protect the monarchy. The early protesters wore yellow - a colour associated with the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej - to show their reverence for the monarchy and Thai culture that they said Thaksin threatened through corruption and consolidating his own personal power. The military deposed Thaksin in 2006 and, since then, Thai politics have been locked in a cycle of his allies winning elections and later being ousted from power by court rulings or coups - most recently in 2014, when the army overthrew the remnants of a government that had been led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck. Nominating Princess Udolratana was Thai Raksa Chart’s attempt to turn the table and invoke the appeal of the royal family as a populist princess. But the gambit was quickly shut down by her brother, who ascended to the throne in 2016, after the death of their father, and will be officially crowned in May. Still, the brief entry of royalty into politics may only deepen Thailand’s political divisions, said Anusorn Unno, Dean of the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology at Thammasat University. “For Thai Raksa Chart supporters, this has created more sympathy to the party ... These would see the party as a victim in this situation,” he said. As for Thaksin’s opponents, they are likely to be galvanised by what they will see as an attempt to manipulate the monarchy, said Anusorn.

2019-02-11,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese officials expressed hopes on Monday that a new round of talks would bring them closer to easing their seven-month trade war, but a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea cast a shadow over the negotiations in Beijing. The world’s two largest economies are trying to hammer out a deal before a March 1 deadline, after which U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Washington is expected to keep pressing Beijing on long-standing demands that it make sweeping structural reforms to protect American companies’ intellectual property, or IP, end policies aimed at forcing the transfer of technology to Chinese companies, and curb industrial subsidies. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the Trump administration was pleased that the talks were moving forward but cautioned that March 1 is a “real deadline” for reaching a deal. The talks kicked off in Beijing with discussions among deputy-level officials on Monday before minister-level meetings later in the week. A round of talks at the end of January ended with some progress reported - but no deal and U.S. declarations that much more work was needed.  “You know, the juniors are working on something now that they’re going to present to the seniors later in the week,” Hassett told Fox Business Network. “And, absolutely, you know, we’ve put everything on the table, including IP theft and forced technology transfer and so on.”  Hassett, who chairs the Council of Economic Advisers, added that the White House is “very much looking forward to what the senior people come up with this week.” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also struck an upbeat tone about the talks, telling a news briefing:  “We, of course, hope, and the people of the world want to see, a good result.”  However, Hua expressed anger about two U.S. warships sailing on Monday near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea, saying this was creating tensions in the area.  Asked if the ships’ passage would impact trade talks, Hua said that “a series of U.S. tricks” showed what Washington was thinking. But Hua added that China believed resolving trade frictions through dialogue was in the interests of both countries’ people and of global economic growth. China claims a large part of the South China Sea, and has built artificial islands and air bases there, prompting concern around the region and in Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline, dampening hopes that a trade pact could be reached quickly. White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said a meeting was still possible soon, telling Fox News Channel that Trump wants a deal with China, but it must be “fair to Americans, and American workers and American interests.” Asked if the United States and China were getting close to a trade agreement, she said, “It looks that way, absolutely.”   But U.S. stock markets were less enthusiastic about prospects for a deal, with any optimism overshadowed by concerns about another government shutdown and a diminished 2019 U.S. corporate earnings outlook. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite eked out nominal gains on Monday while the blue-chip Dow Industrials edged lower.

2019-02-11,"BOGOTA, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Colombia’s Cano Limon pipeline was bombed on Saturday, state-run oil company Ecopetrol said, the sixth time it has been attacked this year. The bombing, which took place in the La Colorada area of Arauquita municipality near the border with Venezuela, spilled crude oil into a dry riverbed nearby, Ecopetrol said in a statement late Sunday. There were no injuries, it said. There were more than 80 attacks on the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline in 2018, which kept it offline for most of the year. Although Ecopetrol did not name the group responsible, military sources said the bombing was carried out by leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The ELN has about 2,000 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders say has seized natural resources without benefiting Colombians.

2019-02-11,"CAIRO (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the exporting group was not in the business of fixing oil prices, when asked on Monday to comment on a U.S. House committee passing a bill targeting OPEC oil supply cuts. A U.S. House of Representatives committee approved a bill on Thursday that would open up the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to antitrust lawsuits, but it was uncertain if the measure would be considered by the full chamber. “OPEC is neither a cartel nor involved in the business of fixing oil prices,” Barkindo told Reuters. “It would be a misjudgment to accuse us of such,” he said on the sidelines of an energy forum in Cairo.

2019-02-11,"ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria had more than 70 candidates for president when campaigning began for Saturday’s elections.  But only those from the two main parties - President Muhammadu Buhari and former vice president Atiku Abubakar - have a real shot at leading Africa’s most populous nation. While a handful of the other candidates are touted as civil society alternatives, their chances of winning are slim without the big parties’ wealth and patronage. Muhammadu Buhari, 76, made history in 2015 as the first person to democratically oust an incumbent president in Nigeria. Now, as candidate for the All Progressives Congress (APC), he is seeking a second term. It is his fifth run at the presidency. A reputation as a staunch opponent of corruption was key to Buhari’s victory at the last election.  A Muslim, born on Dec. 17, 1942 in the northwestern town of Daura in Katsina state, Buhari spent his career in the army. Installed as military dictator after a coup in December 1983, his approach was typified by policies that included having people whipped if they refused to queue at bus stops. He was overthrown less than two years later in another coup, after the military figures who installed him became displeased with his methods. But Buhari’s anti-corruption cachet has remained strong among his supporters and helped him run successfully in 2015 against Goodluck Jonathan of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The party had been in power since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999.  Buhari rode a wave of anti-corruption sentiment, coupled with promises to revive the stuttering economy and defeat the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency.  Despite a lack of corruption convictions, Nigeria’s first recession in 25 years and a resurgence of Islamist attacks, those policies are little changed for the 2019 race. He earned the nickname ‘Baba Go Slow’ during his first term when critics said he governed at a glacial pace, particularly when low oil prices caused a currency crisis. The moniker first entered popular usage to describe Buhari when he took six months to appoint a cabinet.  Some, including his wife, have said access to Buhari is tightly controlled by close advisers, known in Nigeria as “the cabal”, and that they are really directing policy.  reut.rs/2WAHLna Buhari was absent for five months in 2017, being treated in Britain for an unspecified ailment. Despite that illness, he announced in early 2018 that he would seek re-election, raising concerns about whether he could serve another four years. Buhari has said he has the energy to do so. To his admirers, Buhari is frugal, moral and prizes loyalty above other qualities in his allies - a foil to the alleged excesses of the PDP. To his critics, he is an ailing relic with little head for policy and no concern for the rule of law. Atiku Abubakar is the 72-year-old candidate for the PDP, the party that inherited power from the military in 1999 and governed for the next 16 years. For the first eight of those years, Atiku was vice president to Nigeria’s new democratic leader and former military head of state, Olusegun Obasanjo. Atiku, like Buhari, is also a northern Muslim, born in Adamawa state. During the later years of military rule, he became a senior customs official, and later a businessman with ventures in port oil and gas logistics as well as a private university.  He sought the APC presidential ticket for the 2015 elections but lost to Buhari and threw his support behind him, funding his campaign and even lending him a private jet. Atiku switched sides again in 2017, and last year emerged as the PDP’s candidate. He has promised to “make Nigeria work again”, lifting it out of the economic doldrums with business-friendly policies that he says will create jobs. He has for years been dogged by corruption accusations, which he denies. Critics say Atiku would use his policies to enrich himself and those around him without addressing the poverty that afflicts most Nigerians.     His supporters hoped to have put an end to some of those allegations when Atiku travelled to the United States last month, after years of rumours that he could not because of investigations revealing his ties to corruption there. But Atiku had been barred from entering the United States, and Washington only granted him a temporary reprieve from the ban, Reuters reported last week.  To his supporters, Atiku is an accomplished businessman with the economic credentials needed to boost growth, create jobs and attract foreign investors back to Nigeria as it struggles to recover from the first recession in a generation. His opponents say he is a kleptocrat who lacks a moral compass and consistent ideology.

2019-02-11,"(Reuters) - Scared by looming U.S. anti-cartel legislation for the oil industry, the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies such as Russia have decided against creating a formal body, at least on paper. A draft of a document - setting up a new alliance and dated January 2019 - and seen by Reuters carefully avoids any mention of sensitive issues such as oil prices, market share and production cuts. OPEC and Russia have been cutting production together to support prices since 2017, after clinching a deal in December 2016, in moves that have provoked criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.  A committee of the U.S. Congress passed legislation, known as the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, last week. The draft says OPEC and Russia will discuss creating “a mechanism” rather than “an organization” when they meet in April 17-18 in Vienna, calling for the creation of an “Alliance of Oil Producing Countries”. “It looks genuine. It’s also been updated since,” an OPEC source said without giving any further details. Russia’s energy ministry declined to comment. The objectives of the alliance are listed as setting up “an intergovernmental platform to facilitate dialogue” and “further strengthen the collaboration in the formulation of policies aimed at promoting oil market stability”. The objectives are due to be achieved by promoting a better understanding among its members of energy market fundamentals as well as “permanent dialogue among oil producing countries”, according to the document. Russia is not an OPEC member and has said it does intend to join the organization on a permanent basis. OPEC and Russia jointly produce more than 40 percent of the world’s oil. The idea of an organization of OPEC and non-OPEC countries has been mooted since joint efforts to stabilize oil prices have come to fruition. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in December a joint OPEC and non-OPEC structure seemed unlikely due the additional red tape it would create as well as the risk of U.S. monopoly-related sanctions. The draft document also foresees ministerial meetings twice a year and regular encounters of technical experts.

2019-02-11,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East oil benchmarks Dubai and DME Oman have nudged above prices for Brent crude, an unusual move as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran along with output cuts by OPEC tighten supply of medium to heavy oil, traders and analysts said. Heavier grades, mainly produced in the Middle East, Canada and Latin America, typically have a high sulphur content and are usually cheaper than Brent, the benchmark for lighter oil in the Atlantic Basin. But Dubai spot prices and DME Oman crude futures for April have held above ICE Brent at Asia’s market close since the start of February, data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Refinitiv Eikon showed. “The forceful implementation of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude exports, the greater-than-expected recent Saudi crude output cut ... and the uncertainty over U.S. sanction exemptions on Iranian crude have all served to strengthen sour crudes relative to sweet benchmarks such as Brent,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co.     U.S. sanctions on Venezuela that suddenly halted its crude exports to the United States last month created a strong pull for medium and heavy crude from elsewhere, traders and analysts said.  The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars. Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - is also boosting Middle East oil prices. A decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed heavy crude prices as well. Market observers expect Middle East producers to cut output of heavier oil to meet the curbs. “The U.S. may have to replace more than 500,000 bpd (barrels per day) of Venezuelan crude with other more expensive heavy crude sources from the Middle East, particularly as Canadian and Mexican flows to the U.S. are essentially maxed out,” JBC Energy said in a note.  GRAPHIC: Sour crude prices rise above Brent - tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JB Strong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said. Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.  Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, one of the traders said. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s heavy oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia. Meanwhile, refiners globally are processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi Arabia’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade. “Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said. IMO 2020 refers to a mandate by the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to switch to low-sulphur marine fuel from 2020.

2019-02-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds added more bullish positions in crude at the start of February but at a much slower pace than before, as optimism about OPEC output cuts was tempered by renewed anxiety about the U.S.-China trade talks. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in Brent crude futures and options for the eighth time in the last nine weeks but by just 1 million barrels. Fund managers added new short positions (+13 million barrels) for the week ended Feb. 5, almost as fast as new long positions (+15 million) suggesting much greater dispersion of views about where oil prices will go next. Funds added short positions at the fastest rate for nine weeks since the week ending Dec. 4 in a sign at least some managers think prices have peaked after the recent rally. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ULZTZE) OPEC’s aggressive output reductions and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have removed significant volumes of crude from the market since the start of the year, boosting prices. But doubts about progress in the U.S.-China trade talks and the outlook for the global economy have returned, with equity prices stalling and bond yields dropping, spilling across into concerns about oil consumption. In contrast, portfolio managers added another 8 million barrels of long positions in European gasoil futures and options, taking the overall net long position to 30 million barrels. Funds remain more cautious on gasoil (with long positions outnumbering short ones by just 2.6:1) than on Brent (where the ratio was 4.8:1), reflecting concerns about the economy, but also suggesting more upside potential. Position-building in gasoil is accelerating as funds anticipate new bunker fuel regulations likely to boost consumption of clean-burning gasoil at the expense of dirty fuel oil from the start of 2020. Perhaps more immediately and importantly, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are hitting the availability of medium and heavy-density crudes, which are particularly suited for making gasoil. The same medium and heavy crude shortage that has pushed medium grades to a rare premium over their lighter counterparts may also be encouraging fund managers to turn a bit more bullish on diesel.

European markets took their cue from a 1 percent bounce in Chinese shares, which resumed trading after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rebounded from one-week lows, helped by some deal-making and gains in mining and banking shares. It was up 0.65 percent. U.S. stock futures indicated a positive open on Wall Street. Worries about a slowdown in global growth, an ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and U.S. politics have been foremost in investors’ minds. Safe-haven bonds and the dollar have gained amid the prolonged uncertainty, but stocks have also made a good start to the year, with MSCI’S All-Country World Index up nearly 10 percent. The index was 0.1 percent higher on Monday. The dollar reached its highest in six weeks against a basket of currencies, rising for an eighth consecutive day as investors piled into the world’s most liquid currency. This week’s focuses for investors are likely to be the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit, John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note. “The chief focus will be on that broad U.S. dollar picture and whether resistance gives way for another leg higher, driven by preference for the liquidity of the U.S. dollar as the global outlook remains concerning on all fronts,” he said. “The risk remains that investors are unwilling to commit to a breakout until we see what emerges from U.S.-China trade negotiations and Brexit.” Just six weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union, it still has no exit plan in place. Data on Monday showed the British economy grew last year at its slowest since 2012. China struck an upbeat note as the trade talks resumed, but it also expressed anger at a U.S. Navy mission through the disputed South China Sea, casting a shadow over the prospect for improved Beijing-Washington ties. The two sides are trying to come up with a deal before March 1, when U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. Worries about Europe’s economic slowdown and plunging inflation expectations dominated morning trade in debt markets. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, held close to 0.10 percent after touching 0.77 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016. The European Commission downgraded its euro zone growth forecasts last week. A collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers has meanwhile raised fears of another government shutdown there. “Trade talks and shutdown (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The rising threat to growth means equity markets will focus on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In Asia, China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slightly higher after it fell from a four-month high on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan closed for a public holiday. Elsewhere, the euro was 0.05 percent lower at $1.1317 after five straight days of losses took it to more than two-week lows. Sterling fell to $1.2895 after the Q4 GDP data was released. British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the idea of a customs union with the European Union, ending hopes she would shift her Brexit policy to win over the opposition Labour Party, leaving Britain still on course for a disorderly exit. The Australian dollar inched up from Friday’s one-month lows, although sentiment was still cautious after the central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut. Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 0.8 percent lower at $52.31 per barrel. Brent was 0.2 percent lower at $61.97.

2019-02-11,"MOSCOW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When the global oil trading industry gathered for its biggest annual meeting in Asia in September last year, U.S. oil producing companies came well prepared. U.S. giant Exxon Mobil and European rival Royal Dutch/Shell prepared brochures for oil buyers detailing various U.S. crude grades and why they were suitable to replace part of Asia’s long-standing supplies from the Middle East, Africa and Russia. As the oil industry gathers in London this month for the annual IP Week, U.S. crude producers may have every reason to toast the success of their campaign in Europe, as well as Asia. Only a few years ago, before the hydro-fracking and shale revolution overturned the economics of U.S. oil production, the United States was the world’s largest oil importer by far and prohibited exports of oil by law. Now shipments of U.S. crude into Europe have just hit a new record. January imports were 630,000 barrels per day, still - behind Russia and Iraq but above other OPEC producers including Nigeria and Libya. Higher U.S. crude exports have been helped by lower supplies of Iranian and Venezuelan crude, which Washington has put under sanctions, scaring buyers across the world. GRAPHIC: Crude oil suppliers to Europe in January 2019 - tmsnrt.rs/2UUtkZM In the whole of 2018, U.S. supplies to Europe doubled to 430,000 bpd, according to Refinitiv Eikon flows data. That represented 6 percent of overall imports or equal to the levels of Iranian oil imports to Europe before the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran. GRAPHIC: U.S. supplies to Europe in 2017-2019 -  tmsnrt.rs/2BmWo4Q “U.S. crude is a real headache. It puts a lot of pressure on regional light grades. In fact, prices for all grades are affected because it is such a significant extra supply,” said a trader with a European trader selling Russian oil. Pressure will likely only increase as for 2019 U.S. crude oil production is expected to average 12.06 million bpd, up 1.18 million bpd from last year, according to U.S. government.  Future predictions say the United States could produce as much as 15 million bpd of crude and up to 20 million bpd of total oil liquids, giving it complete self-sufficiency as it would fully cover its consumption of 18-19 million bpd. Booming U.S. production has prompted OPEC and major non-OPEC producers like Russia to slash output by 3-4 percent since 2017 to prop up prices. The pact has helped double prices to $60 per barrel but at the expense of a market share loss to U.S. firms. “Welcome to the free market,” said a U.S.-based executive of an international trading firm. “Local producers either need to drop their pricing to compete or find other markets”. Competition is particularly acute in northwest Europe, where Britain and the Netherlands imported 6.5 and 5.1 million tonnes of U.S. crude in 2018 respectively. GRAPHIC: U.S. supplies to Europe in 2018 - tmsnrt.rs/2UJfngZ BP, Litasco, Equinor, Total and ExxonMobil were among the main buyers in the Baltic replacing North Sea barrels with U.S. grades, traders say. “WTI is the new dated Brent,” said a senior crude trader referring to the U.S and European benchmarks. BP takes U.S. oil to its Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany while Poland’s PKN Orlen said in January it would cut Russia’s Urals purchases from Kremlin oil major Rosneft by 30 percent and partially replace it with U.S. barrels. In Britain, the main U.S. oil buyers are Essar Oil and Exxon Mobil, traders said. In the Mediterranean, buyers of U.S. barrels - Italy, Spain, France - tend to use them to replace light Caspian CPC Blend, Russia’s Urals and Iranian oil, traders said. Greece’s Hellenic Petroleum added WTI to its list of preferred crude options alongside Urals and CPC as did Turkey’s Tupras. In Italy, U.S. oil flows to Kuwait Petroleum’s Milazzo refinery and the Swiss Varo Energy’s plant.  WTI was by far the most popular U.S. grade among European buyers in 2018, followed by Midland Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mars. GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil supplies to Europe by grades - tmsnrt.rs/2UYoQ4r As the world moves to tighter marine fuel regulations, which will increase demand for light barrels, demand for U.S. oil - which is predominantly light - will only rise. “I expect U.S. crude to become even more popular in Europe.

LPG is mainly a by-product of oil development at the field and at the moment there is no infrastructure for refining, storage and transportation of LPG from Kashagan. The new facility, expected to be commissioned about two years from now, will desulfurize liquid propane-butane mix delivered by pipeline from Kashagan’s Bolashak plant, fraction it into propane (some 70-75 percent) and butane (some 25-30 percent) and tranship to railway tank cars. Vitol, Kazakhstan’s largest crude offtaker, is ready to invest in the project - worth over $300 million - as soon as this year to build a facility annually producing 500,000 tonnes of propane and butane, according to Reuters sources. The trader has approached North Caspian Operating Co (NCOC), the field operator, and Kashagan’s shareholders with a proposal to build the LPG processing and export facility near Karabatan railway station in the Atyraus region, but no immediate reaction followed. Vitol declined to comment, but Vitol sources confirmed the trader’s interest in the project. The sources said that according to the Kazakh government’s schedule, the plant is set to be commissioned in 2021. “NCOC has no comment on any commercial discussions that may be ongoing at this time,” the consortium said in a statement. Kazakhstan’s Energy Ministry provided no comment. The new facility may help Vitol boost its presence in the Kazakh LPG export sector. Vitol plans to deliver propane and butane to the global market via Russia’s Black Sea terminal in Taman, where Vitol has a transhipment contract. The proposed terms of cooperation between Vitol and Kashagan’s stakeholders were not immediately clear, sources said. “Vitol wants to buy low-grade LPG, purify it and sell via Taman,” a source familiar with the matter said. Kashagan, one of the biggest oil discoveries in recent history, started commercial output in late 2016 after years of delays and currently produces about 350,000 barrels of crude per day. Natural gas output at Kashagan in 2018 reached 6.8 billion cubic metres, Kazakh Energy Ministry data shows. Kashagan operator NCOC includes Eni, Total , Shell, ExxonMobil, Kazakh state firm KazMunayGaz, China’s CNPC and Japan’s Inpex.

2019-02-11,"(Corrects spelling of oil minister’s name in first paragraph and throughout) NEW DELHI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela is open to barter-like payments from India to boost oil sales to the world’s third-biggest oil consumer, the South American country’s oil minister Manuel Quevedo said on Monday. Venezuela buys a slew of products including medicines from India, and it is looking for alternative payment mechanisms after application of the latest stringent U.S. sanctions. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “The relationships with India will continue,  the trade will continue and we will simply expand all the trade and relationship,” Quevedo told reporters on the sidelines of Petrotech conference, without giving any further details on how a barter mechanism with India would work. Venezuela’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude oil it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela’s oil output is now at 1.57 million bpd, Quevedo said. The Venezuelan oil minister, who now holds the rotating presidency of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said it was important to listen to all the consuming countries that represent oil demand to maintain the balance of demand and supply in the markets. “Inventory levels, demand, supply are the elements taken into account while trying to maintain the balance the global industry needs,” Quevedo said. Unilateral sanctions by the United States have reduced PDVSA’s oil output and caused a loss of about $20 billion to its oil revenue-dependent economy, he said. “U.S. exercises kidnapping of resources around the world ... It is financial persecution. Now they want to steal Citgo Petroleum from Venezuela,” he said. Citgo Petroleum Corp is a unit of PDVSA and Venezuela’s top foreign asset. Citgo operates three U.S. refineries that supply about 4 percent of total U.S. fuel production, and it is PDVSA’s largest U.S. customer for its oil exports. Following the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, both sides have engaged in aggressive moves for control of Citgo, which has roots in the United States dating back 100 years, but has been owned by Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, for three decades. Sanctions have forced Citgo and other U.S. refiners to seek crude oil supplies from other nations.

Adding to worries, a collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers over the weekend raised fears of another government shutdown. “Trade talks and shut-down (worries) are really weighing on markets,” said Sebastian Fellechner, rates strategist at DZ Bank. “We don’t see any major movements because of the general and global uncertainty.” The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, considered the risk-free benchmark for the region, fell as low as 0.77 percent on Friday, its lowest since October 2016, reflecting concern in bond markets about economic conditions. The rising threat to growth means equity markets will partly depend on earnings from major U.S. companies for clues about the health of consumer shares. These include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Macy’s Inc and Gap Inc . Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies to decline 0.1 percent from a year earlier. That would be the first such quarterly profit decline since 2016, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In Asia, China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slightly higher after it fell from a four-month high on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan on public holiday. Elsewhere, the euro was barely changed at $1.1322 after five straight days of losses took it to more than two-week lows. Sterling fell to $1.2895 after UK GDP data for the fourth quarter was released. Britain’s economy slowed as expected in the final three months of last year, pushing growth in 2018 to its weakest in six years as Brexit worries hammered investment. British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the idea of a customs union with the European Union, ending hopes she would shift her Brexit policy to win over the opposition Labour Party. May will promise lawmakers a second opportunity to influence the Brexit talks later in the month in a bid to stave off any rebellion from within her own party by those who fear Britain could end up leaving without a deal. The Australian dollar inched up from Friday’s one-month lows, although sentiment was still cautious after the country’s central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut. Oil prices slipped on concern about slowing global demand and a pick-up in U.S. drilling activity. U.S. crude was 0.6 percent lower at $52.42 per barrel. Brent was flat $62.12.

Depressed sugar prices have led Brazilian companies to increase their capacity to produce ethanol, with many mills able to switch between using cane to produce either sugar or biofuel ethanol depending on which is more profitable. “Recently the industry is learning to become more pragmatic and more economics driven. The low sugar price is a driver by itself so the mills have to be more flexible in order to generate more,” Biancheri told a Dubai conference on Monday. Biancheri also said he expected consolidation within the Brazilian milling industry to continue with the best performers buying up assets from those that are financially stressed. Meanwhile Gareth Griffiths, chief executive of Alvean, said prices were “at the tipping point” for sugar and ethanol. Alvean, the largest sugar trader globally, is expecting a slight sugar surplus for 2019-2020 of around 2 million tonnes. Analysts have been expecting a small sugar deficit for the period after years of surplus that have depressed prices. This view was supported by Sucden general manager Thierry Songeur who predicted a slight deficit by the end of 2019-2020, with India the unknown quantity. India could export as much as 5 million tonnes to the market this year and a switch to more ethanol production will not take place in the short term to get rid of its surplus, he said. “Ethanol will not be your remedy in the short term.” Biancheri also said anticipation about the potential for ethanol in India had been going on for “quite some time” but the steps needed were not being taken quickly enough. “It will be more of a mid to long term story,” he said.

2019-02-11,"* Shah was U.S.’ closest ally * Iran squeezed by U.S. sanctions * Iran, foes wage Middle East proxy wars By Parisa Hafezi DUBAI, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Iranians held nation-wide rallies on Monday to mark the 40th anniversary of the fall of the Shah and the triumph of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shi’ite cleric who led an Islamic Revolution that rattles the West to this day. On Feb 11, 1979, Iran’s army declared its neutrality, paving the way for the collapse of the U.S.-backed monarch, the United States’ closest ally in the Middle East. State TV showed large crowds carrying Iranian flags and chanting “Death to Israel, Death to America,” trademark chants of the revolution. One banner read: “Much to the dismay of America, the revolution has reached its 40th year.” President Hassan Rouhani said Iran was determined to expand its military power and ballistic missile programme despite mounting pressure from hostile countries to curb Iran’s defensive work, state TV reported. “We have not asked and will not ask for permission to develop different types of ... missiles and will continue our path and our military power,” Rouhani said in a speech at Tehran’s Azadi (Freedom) square, where tens of thousands gathered to mark the anniversary. The large turnout in state-sponsored rallies came as Iranians face rising prices, food shortages and high inflation that have triggered waves of protests. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers last year and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran, dealing a blow to the country’s economy. Iranian officials said the move amounted to “economic warfare” Soldiers, students, clerics and black-clad women holding small children, flocked to the streets of cities and towns, many carrying portraits of Khomeini and Iran’s current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Regional power Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries have viewed Iran with great suspicion since the Islamic Revolution swept the Shah from power, fearing Khomeini would inspire Islamic militants across the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia are locked in proxy wars in Iraq, Yemen and Syria. Writing by Parisa Hafezi, Editing by Michael Georgy, William

Chinese stock indexes played catch-up when reopening after a week-long break. Gains came as the commerce ministry said retail earnings during the Lunar New Year holiday jumped 8.5 percent from the period last year, even though growth in the world’s second largest economy is slowing. China’s blue-chip index surged 1.6 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks recouped some losses to end 0.2 percent lower while South Korea’s KOSPI index was up 0.2 percent. Indonesian and Indian benchmarks were in the red. That left MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were slightly firmer after it was toppled from a four-month top on Friday. Trading volumes were generally light, with Japan on public holiday. “Ranges have been on the tight side today, and nobody has been prepared to stamp down any authority,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne broker Pepperstone. “I have no doubt that will change as we head through the week, with trade relations slap bang at the epicentre of concerns,” he said. Tensions between the United States and China have cost both countries billions of dollars and roiled global financial markets. A new round of trade talks began in Beijing on Monday, with higher-level talks involving U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday and Friday. If the negotiations do not progress sufficiently by March 1, the U.S. has said it intends to raise tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China to 25 percent from 10 percent. “U.S.-led trade uncertainty along with increasing concerns over the extent of the current global growth slowdown has seen an increase in demand for core global bonds,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank. “Against a backdrop of uncertainty and despite a Fed that is comfortably on hold, the dollar continues to win the least ugly contest.” The U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled patience on policy after delivering four hikes in 2018, citing growing economic risks from a slowdown in global growth. The dollar index held near a six-week high around 96.695 against a basket of currencies, setting up for its sixth straight session of gains as traders piled into the greenback in a safe-haven move. World markets are already under strain from a drumroll of gloomy news on the global economy. Last week, the European Commission sharply downgraded euro zone growth for this year and next and  U.S. President Donald Trump added to the anxiety with a declaration that he had no plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before the March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. Adding to worries, a collapse in talks between U.S. Democrat and Republican lawmakers over the weekend amid a clash over immigrant detention policy raised fears of another government shutdown.

2019-02-11,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Middle East oil benchmarks Dubai and DME Oman have nudged above prices for Brent crude, an unusual move as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran along with output cuts by OPEC tighten supply of medium to heavy sour oil, traders and analysts said. Sour crudes, mainly produced in the Middle East, Canada and Latin America, have a high sulphur content and are usually cheaper than Brent, the benchmark for low-sulphur oil in the Atlantic Basin. But Dubai spot prices and DME Oman crude futures for April have held above ICE Brent at Asia’s market close since the start of February, data from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Dubai Mercantile Exchange and Refinitiv Eikon showed. “The forceful implementation of U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude exports, the greater-than-expected recent Saudi crude output cut ... and the uncertainty over U.S. sanction exemptions on Iranian crude have all served to strengthen sour crudes relative to sweet benchmarks such as Brent,” said Tilak Doshi, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co.     U.S. sanctions on Venezuela suddenly halted its crude exports to the United States last month and created a strong pull for medium and heavy sour crude from other places, said the traders and analysts.  The sanctions, aimed at blocking Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the nation’s oil revenue, will be extended to non-U.S. oil buyers from April 28, potentially stopping them from paying for Venezuelan oil in U.S. dollars. Elsewhere, uncertainty over whether Washington will in May extend waivers to sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports that it previously granted to top Iranian crude buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea - is also boosting Middle East oil prices. And a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to rein in oil output has buoyed sour crude prices as well. Market observers expect Middle East producers to cut output of heavier oil to meet the curbs. For a graphic on Sour crude prices rise above Brent, see - tmsnrt.rs/2TBR6JB Strong demand from the United States for heavy oil to replace Venezuelan supplies has boosted prices for U.S. Mars crude and Latin American grades, restricting supplies of those cargoes to Asia, traders said. Offers of Mars crude for April delivery to North Asia have risen more than $1 a barrel, while spot premiums for Latin American grades such as Castilla from Colombia, have climbed by $2 a barrel, traders said.  Castilla was sold out even before its loading programme was released, said one of the traders. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. U.S. refiners are also seeking more supplies from the Middle East, creating a pull for such barrels at a time when Asia’s sour oil demand is growing as two new refineries have started trial runs in China and Malaysia. Meanwhile, refiners globally are also processing more medium and heavy crude to reap higher profits from fuel oil and middle distillates. That has kept the price gap between Saudi’s Arab Light and Arab Heavy crude in Asia close to the narrowest in a decade. “Heavy sour strength is bolstered through the first-half of 2019 by continued complex refinery capacity growth and tight fuel oil markets, before IMO 2020 presents a cliff for (high-sulphur fuel oil) demand,” Citi analysts said. IMO 2020 refers to a mandate by the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to switch to low-sulphur marine fuel from 2020.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast December’s annual output growth to come in at 2.8 percent. The pace was also faster than November’s output growth, which was initially recorded at 2.5 percent, but later revised to 2.6 percent. The Statistics Department did not provide a reason for the revision. The index measures factory output from the manufacturing, electricity generation and mining sectors. Growth in December was supported by gains in all three sectors, data from the department showed. Manufacturing output rose 4.4 percent year-on-year in December, while the electricity generation sectoral index grew 2.7 percent. Mining output shed previous month’s losses to gain 1 percent in December from a year earlier, the data showed.

2019-02-11,"(Repeats story first issued on Feb. 10 for wider distribution, no changes to text) By Sudarshan Varadhan GREATER NOIDA, India, Feb 10 (Reuters) - South Sudan will return to producing more than 350,000 barrels of crude per day by the middle of 2020, up from current levels of just over 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) currently, the country’s oil minister said on Sunday. Production is expected to rise to 270,000 bpd by the end of 2019, Oil Minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Petrotech conference in Greater Noida, a satellite city of India’s capital New Delhi. The world’s youngest country, which split from Sudan in 2011, has one of the largest reserves of crude in sub-Saharan Africa, only a third of which have been explored so far. The country lost many of its oilfields to a civil war that broke out two years after its independence. A September peace agreement is largely holding. “By the end of the year, block 3 and 7 will be hitting 180,000 bpd, blocks 1, 2 and 4 will be producing 70,000 bpd, and block 5A will be producing 20,000 bpd,” Gatkuoth said. “We used to produce 350,000 to 400,000 bpd. We expect to go back to those levels by the middle of next year,” he said. South Sudan has signed a preliminary agreement with Russia’s Zarubezhneft for exploring some of the blocks, Gatkuoth said. “They are interested in block B1, B2, E1 and E2. We will be working to see where they are likely to be interested in the most,” he said. South Africa, which has committed to investing $1 billion in the country, would collaborate with South Sudan on the construction of pipelines and a new refinery along the border with Ethiopia, the minister said. “We have agreed to build a refinery on the border of Ethiopia, we have already signed an agreement with Ethiopia to offtake refined products,” Gatkuoth said. Land-locked South Sudan is looking to boost its export options as it looks beyond its neighbour Sudan, the minister said. “We have new blocks in the southern part of South Sudan, oil from which will be exported to East Africa (through the new pipelines),” he said. American oil majors such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron showed interest in investing in South Sudan, but are currently not interested because of the conflict, he said. “We have been approaching Exxon officials, and I will be meeting them in Houston next month,” he said.

2019-02-11,"(Repeats Feb. 8 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - “Once upon a time ...” Storytelling is one of the most fundamental human impulses. Humans have been telling stories for thousands of years as a means of entertainment but more importantly to help them make sense of the world around them and to transmit that understanding to others. Narratives are a way of organising a series of actions or events to understand the process of cause and effect, helping make sense of the past and anticipate the future. “Anthropologists, who conduct research on the behaviour of diverse tribes around the world, have observed a universal that people use narrative to explain how things came to be and to tell stories. “Visitors to any human society will observe people facing each other, sitting around the television, or the campfire, together and vocalising, and more recently tweeting, stories,” according to economist Robert Shiller. “It seems the human mind strives to reach enduring understanding of events by forming them into a narrative that is imbedded in social interactions” (“Narrative economics”, Shiller, 2017). Or according to the Pixar rules of storytelling, compiled by Emma Coates, the ideal narrative runs: “Once upon a time there was … , Every day …. , One day … , Because of that … , Because of that … , Until finally …” (“Pixar tips”, Washington Post, June 25, 2012). The narrative impulse is hard-wired into our brains and is present in every creation myth, fairy-tale, history book, academic research paper, newspaper, political rally and corporate earnings call. Satisfying stories obey a few simple rules: * Good stories start at the beginning (“once upon a time”) and move linearly through a sequence of events to a conclusion (“the end”). * Cause and effect are closely and intuitively linked and should be roughly proportionate to one another (big consequences should stem from big causes). * Each effect should have a single cause, or at most a small and easily comprehended number, rather than result from the complex and incomprehensible interaction among many causes. * Heroes and villains should be clearly identified and eventually be rewarded or punished by the chain of events according to some definition of morality. * Luck, chance and randomness can play a part, but hard work, intelligence, worthiness and free will are more important in determining outcomes. The problem with the campfire model (mono-causal, linear, proportionate, moral and determinant) is that it fails to explain many important real-world processes (which are non-linear/circular, exponential, amoral and random). Financial market movements, business cycles, oil cycles and even the rise and fall of companies, corporate leaders and politicians – none of them can be properly explained and predicted by the traditional narrative model. In these real examples, processes are multi-causal, complex, do not always produce virtuous winners, and often do not lead to clear outcomes and predictions. Descriptions of real-world processes often fail as satisfying stories – while emotionally pleasing stories often fail to explain and predict the real world properly. Politicians, business leaders, campaigners and opinion formers often prefer simpler narratives that provide a more satisfying explanation, stir an emotional response and serve as a call to action. The narratives used to frame and explain an issue can have a powerful impact on how businesses, employees, customers and voters respond and the choices they make (sometimes unconsciously). Storytelling can influence the real world as much as the other way around, so narratives can be instruments of power, whether they are right or wrong. But forecasters and analysts should prefer accurate descriptions of real processes, for all their limits of complexity and indeterminacy. The limits of predicting outcomes from circular and complex processes with a significant random element mean forecasts should normally be expressed as scenarios with an associated probability distribution. Even then, many forecasts are hyper-sensitive to small changes in the starting point or assumptions about the causation process, so the probability distribution itself is often highly unstable or uncertain. Forecasters should always be humble about their ability to make accurate predictions, especially far into the future or when many variables are changing simultaneously. Often the most useful part of forecasting is the discipline of having to think in a rigorous way, identifying and analysing all the potential variables in play, getting a better sense of the range of uncertainty. Once the key variables have been identified, some risks can be eliminated, transformed, insured or managed, while others simply have to be borne. Campfire storytellers are judged by the emotional satisfaction their narratives provide; forecasters and analysts should expect to be judged by a different standard. Acknowledging and embracing uncertainty is not a sign of failure or lack of courage but an honest admission of the limits of forecasting and of the complex way in which processes evolve.

2019-02-11,"* U.S. rig count rises to 854 -Baker Hughes * Rosneft pressures Putin to end supply cuts with OPEC * But U.S. sanctions against Venezuela support crude prices * U.S. oil drilling & production levels: tmsnrt.rs/2S87iVI By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Crude prices dipped early on Monday in Asia as U.S. drilling activity picked up and as Russia’s biggest oil producer pressured President Vladimir Putin to end the supply cut deal with Middle East-dominated producer club OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.44 per barrel at 0036 GMT, down 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $62 a barrel. In the United States, energy firms last week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks, a weekly report by Baker Hughes said on Friday. Companies added 7 oil rigs in the week to Feb. 8, bringing the total count to 854, pointing to a further rise in U.S. crude production, which already stands at a record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd). C-OUT-T-EIA Elsewhere, the head of Russian oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, has written to the Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Moscow’s deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to withhold output is a strategic threat and plays into the hands of the United States. The so-called OPEC+ deal has been in place since 2017, aimed at reining in a global supply overhang. It has been extended several times and, under the latest deal, participants are cutting output by 1.2 million bpd until the end of June. OPEC and its allies will meet on April 17-18 in Vienna to review the pact. Preventing crude prices from falling much further have been U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, targetting its state-owned oil firm PDVSA. “The issues in Venezuela continue to support prices. Reports are emerging that PDVSA is scrambling to secure new markets for its crude, after the U.S. placed additional sanctions on the country,” ANZ bank said on Monday.

2019-02-11,"* US concerned over Russia, China engagement in Europe * Pompeo visits Hungary, Slovakia and Poland * Will attend Middle East conference in Warsaw By Lesley Wroughton and Gergely Szakacs BUDAPEST, Feb 11 (Reuters) - When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visits Hungary, Slovakia and Poland this week he wants to make up for a lack of U.S. engagement that opened the door to more Chinese and Russian influence in central Europe, administration officials say. On a tour that includes a conference on the Middle East where Washington hopes to build a coalition against Iran, Pompeo begins on Monday in Budapest, the Hungarian capital that last saw a secretary of state in 2011 when Hillary Clinton visited. On Tuesday he will be in Bratislava, Slovakia, for the first such high-level visit in 20 years. “This is overdue and needed,” a senior U.S. administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Our message is we have to show up or expect to lose. “Our efforts at diplomatic engagement are aimed at competing for positive influence and giving allies in the region an indication of U.S. support and interest in order to have alternatives to China and Russia.” Washington is concerned about China’s growing presence, in particular the expansion of Huawei Technologies, the world’s biggest telecom gear maker, in Hungary and Poland. The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei’s equipment could be used for espionage and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. Huawei denies engaging in intelligence work for any government. Pompeo will also voice concerns about energy ties with Moscow, and urge Hungary to not support the TurkStream pipeline, part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe. Hungary gets most of its gas from Russia and its main domestic source of electricity is the Paks nuclear power plant where Russia’s Rosatom is involved in a 12.5 billion-euro ($14 billion) expansion. It is also one of the EU states that benefit most from Chinese investment. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said this month the United States could help Hungary diversify away from Russian energy by encouraging ExxonMobil to proceed with long-stalled plans to develop a gas field in the Black Sea. The administration official said there had been progress toward sealing bilateral defence accords with Hungary and Slovakia, which is looking to buy F-16 fighter jets. Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland, said U.S. engagement with the region fell after EU and NATO enlargement to central Europe, and as Washington’s attention moved to Asia and conflict in the Middle East. “A lot of Americans thought our work in the region was done, and yet it was not so,” said Fried, now at the Atlantic Council think-tank in Washington. “There was a sense in the last administration that eastern and central Europe was a finished place.” The bulk of Pompeo’s Poland visit will focus on a U.S. conference on the “Future of Peace and Security in the Middle East”. Vice President Mike Pence will also attend the two-day event that starts on Feb. 13. Washington hopes to win support to increase pressure on Iran to end what the it says is its malign behaviour in the Middle East and to end its nuclear and missile programmes. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 deal on limiting Iran’s nuclear work last year but the European Union is determined to stick with it. It is unclear what delegations European capitals will send to what Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has called a “desperate anti-Iran circus”. “We think anybody who doesn’t participate is going to be missing out,” a second administration official said. White House adviser Jared Kushner, Trump’s son in law, will discuss a U.S. plan for peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, although he is not likely to give details.
