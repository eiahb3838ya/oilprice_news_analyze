2019-01-07,"WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the attorney general of Massachusetts to obtain records from Exxon Mobil Corp to probe whether the oil company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change. The justices declined to hear Exxon’s appeal of a ruling by the top court in Massachusetts holding that Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the company misled consumers and investors. The action by the high court marked the latest setback for Exxon in its efforts to halt the Massachusetts investigation and a similar one by New York’s attorney general, who in October filed a lawsuit against the company.

2019-01-07,"CARACAS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA has signed a deal with little-known U.S. energy firm Erepla that is part-owned by a prominent Florida Republican to help increase the socialist-run country’s plummeting crude oil output, the company said. Erepla Services LLC, part-owned by Republican Harry Sargeant III and which Delaware state records show was only registered two months ago, said it plans to invest up to $500 million to increase production at three Venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced. The arrangement faces significant hurdles including obtaining an exemption from Trump administration sanctions that block U.S. companies from providing financing to the government of President Nicolas Maduro or Venezuelan state firms. It is a further sign that Venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about U.S. sanctions and overall dysfunction. Erepla said that the agreement will “revitalize oil production” at the Tia Juana Lago and Rosa Mediano fields in the western Lake Maracaibo region and in the Ayacucho 5 bloc, in the eastern heavy-oil Orinoco Belt. The company added that the deal gives it “enhanced managerial participation” in the projects and will be responsible for procurement, a key difference from long-established joint ventures between PDVSA and oil majors like Chevron Corp, where PDVSA has full operational control. It said Erepla would be “responsible for the entirety of the investment.” A spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds. Neither PDVSA nor the Oil Ministry responded to a request for comment. The Erepla spokesman confirmed media reports that Sargeant, who has served as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and currently runs asphalt trading and shipping firm Global Oil Management Group, is a part-owner of Erepla. The spokesman declined to say what size stake Sargeant has in the company. The deal is the first new partnership between PDVSA and a private company since Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo in August announced a set of “joint service agreements” with 14 little-known companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and PDVSA. Those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who expanded the state’s role in the OPEC country’s energy industry. Output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed, dropping to 1.46 million barrels per day in November from more than 2 million at the end of last year, according to OPEC figures, in a sign of the company’s struggles under military rule. Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan that block U.S. citizens from providing financing to Maduro’s government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment. But because PDVSA is perennially cash-strapped, agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of up-front funding that could run afoul of sanctions. Erepla said it had applied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implements sanctions, for a “Specific License affirming the agreement.” The Treasury Department, which is affected by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Consulted on how a company with no evident oil-field experience would be in a position to take on the project, the Erepla spokesman said the firm’s “ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining ability.” Maduro, who has deepened Venezuela’s relationships with U.S. adversaries like Russia and China, often accuses the United States of plotting to overthrow him and steal the OPEC nation’s oil wealth. The deal has been criticized by hardline Chavez supporters, who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company. “This is the worst giveaway in the history of our country’s oil industry,” former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “Maduro and Quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all Venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our oil.” (Additional reporting by Mayela Armas and Corina Pons in Caracas Editing by Susan Thomas)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil/venezuelas-pdvsa-inks-oil-deal-with-firm-part-owned-by-florida-republican-idUKL1N1Z600N,07 Jan 2019,"Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA

2019-01-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - British carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) has triggered contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components as well as use ports other than Dover.   Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 days but a negotiated withdrawal agreement looks set to be voted down by MPs next week, making a “no deal” exit - and disruption to trade - more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and is one of the country’s rare manufacturing success stories, has warned that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined its contingency plans in October, had no choice but to authorise them at a board meeting in December.  “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two years where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the “accumulating” cost of the plans.  “We programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don’t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.”  “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, joins a growing list of companies readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturers ramping up stocks in preparation for potential border delays. Aston is signing deals with supplier DHL to allow for the use of ports other than Dover - Britain’s busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any customs delays - and has authorised its supply chain team to make air freight bookings.  The government has said it will prioritise the movement of key supplies such as medicines if the flow of goods is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said.  Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delays imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturers face different challenges. Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), Britain’s favourite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, builds only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (F.N) counts Britain as its third-largest market but makes no cars there.  Meantime Nissan (7201.T), which builds around half a million cars at its northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (7203.T) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicles to the rest of the EU. While mass-market brands are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end players such as Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customers could absorb extra costs and are more concerned about customs checks and delays.  Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, as interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer criticised politicians on both sides of the Channel. “Both the European and the UK politicians are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said. As carmakers prepare for multiple Brexit eventualities, they are also dealing with stricter emissions rules and a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy, China, which has hit a variety of firms including Apple (AAPL.O). While some automakers have reported falling demand, Aston, which has seen its share price fall by more than a third since it listed in October, said it had a record 2018. “There has not been any downflow since those (Q3) numbers so in fact, broadly speaking, the opposite as we launched (sports cars) DBS and Vantage into China,” said Palmer.

2019-01-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Last year was the fourth warmest on record, extending a scorching streak driven by a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Monday. Average world surface air temperatures were 14.7 Celsius (58.5 Fahrenheit) in 2018, just 0.2C off the highest, it said in the first global assessment based on full-year data. This year will also likely be hot, its scientists said. “Dramatic climatic events like the warm and dry summer in large parts of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic regions are alarming signs to all of us,” said Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of Copernicus.  Among other extremes in 2018, California and Greece suffered severe wildfires, Kerala in India had the worst flooding since the 1920s and heatwaves struck from Australia to North Africa. Around Antarctica, the extent of sea ice is at a record low at the start of 2019, according to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Copernicus chief scientist Freja Vamborg said 2019 would also likely be hot. “We now have a nascent El Nino - it depends partly on what happens ... will it continue or die out?” she told Reuters. The last four years have seen the highest average temperatures since records began in the 19th century - 2016 was the hottest, boosted by an El Nino event that warmed the surface of the Pacific Ocean, ahead of 2017 and then 2015. The Copernicus report said that concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to a new record of 406.7 parts per million (ppm) in 2018 from 404.1 in 2017, stoked largely by human burning of fossil fuels. And the average global temperature in the past five years was 1.1C (2.0F) above pre-industrial times, it said. According to a U.N. climate report last year, temperatures will rise 1.5C above pre-industrial times by mid-century on current trends - bringing the prospect of even more extreme weather. That U.N. report said governments would have to make unprecedented cuts in greenhouse gases to keep temperatures below the 1.5C rise, which is the toughest goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Almost 200 nations agreed a “rule book” to govern the Paris accord in talks in Poland last month, even though critics said it was insufficient to prevent dangerous climate change.  The Paris accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energies such as wind and solar power. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. The Copernicus report confirms projections by the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2018 would be fourth warmest.  The WMO will issue its own estimate for 2018 temperatures in coming weeks, also comprising data compiled by U.S., British and Japanese agencies.

2019-01-07,"NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp will import 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February after a gap of three months, with the nation’s overall purchases from Tehran remaining at 9 million barrels, three industry sources said. The United States in early November granted India a six-month waiver from sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Under the agreement, New Delhi must restrict its Iranian oil purchases to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels. BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will lift 1 million barrels each of Iranian crude oil in February, the sources said. HPCL this month resumed purchases of Iranian oil after a gap of six months. The company halted Iranian oil purchases in July after its insurance company refused to provide cover for the crude because of U.S. sanctions, although its chairman said HPCL may resume buying Iranian oil under sanctions waivers. Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the same as this month. Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 2 million barrels compared with 3 million barrels this month, the sources said. An IOC official had previously said his firm would lift 180,000 bpd - the full volume contracted under an annual deal with Iran for this fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.

2019-01-07,"NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Energy-hungry India will allow state-owned explorers to rope in the private sector to raise production from old fields as the world’s third biggest oil importer strives to better exploit its hydrocarbon resources and cut dependence on foreign oil. India is the world’s third-largest oil consumer and buys about 80 percent of its supplies from abroad. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to cut India’s dependence on foreign oil to 67 percent by 2022. India is looking at raising production from “nomination blocks,” or fields handed to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd after independence, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday. The fields are both onshore and offshore. The boards of ONGC and Oil India will be allowed to issue production enhancement contracts and bring in private players to drill some nomination fields, Pradhan said. He said the current fiscal model was not supportive of raising output from nomination fields. “Revenue was the priority at one point of time but now the government is of the view that the priority is to raise production,” Pradhan told reporters at a function to launch the country’s second licensing round under new rules. India has offered 14 blocks under the latest auction and will offer another 23 fields, including five coal bed methane blocks, in the next round later this month. It hopes to launch two more rounds by December. Pradhan also said India would offer higher incentives for production from old blocks in frontier or difficult areas. So far, the key criteria for winning a block has been the higher revenue offered to the government from the oil and gas production. But the policy has not helped oil and gas output, which has been stagnant for years. After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and Bassein gas fields in 1976, ONGC has not been able to bring any new major fields into production in the last four decades. India has also failed to draw interest from global oil majors in licensing rounds since 1990 even though the fiscal terms were eased. However, Royal Dutch Shell and BP later bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights.

2019-01-07,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. crude vs WTI Houston, Girassol: tmsnrt.rs/2RBeVDA By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil is starting to trickle back to China with three cargoes slated to arrive next month, but volumes are still a long way off levels prior to the outbreak of trade hostilities between the world’s two largest economies. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv shows three tankers carrying 3.94 million barrels are en route from the United States to China and will arrive in February. This is up from zero cargoes slated to arrive in January, a mere one in December and zero in both November and October. Prior to the tit-for-tat tariffs being imposed from the middle of last year, crude oil was a success story in the U.S.-China trade relationship as Beijing bought increasing volumes of booming U.S. shale oil production. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States, representing about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. China’s imports of U.S. crude reached a record high of about 460,000 bpd in June, according to the Refinitiv data. It’s worth noting that China hasn’t imposed any tariff on U.S. crude imports, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas, which were included in Beijing’s retaliatory measures. What seems clear is that Chinese refiners decided to hold back on buying U.S. crude either because they were nudged in that direction by the government, or because they were concerned that a tariff would be imposed. Using crude oil for politics is certainly nothing new, so the resumption of trade between China and the United States may well depend on the status of talks between the administration of President Donald Trump and its counterpart in Beijing. However, if the U.S.-China crude trade was strictly about economics, it’s likely that U.S. crude prices will have to fall some more, especially relative to competing grades of West African crude. The bulk of the U.S. crude going to Asia is light and sweet, and therefore competes with grades like Nigeria’s Bonny Light BON-E and Angola’s Girassol GIR-E. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures have dropped sharply since their peak in early October, the price of physical WTI delivered in Houston, as assessed by Argus Media, hasn’t fallen by as much. WTI Houston was at $53.88 a barrel on Jan. 4, while WTI futures were at $47.96, a discount of $5.92 a barrel. Six months ago, WTI Houston was at $75.79 a barrel and the futures were $74.13, showing that since then the investor market has become more bearish on U.S. crude prices than the physical market. Comparing WTI Houston to Girassol shows that the Angolan grade traded at a small premium on Jan. 4, closing at $56.24 a barrel to WTI Houston’s $53.38. The small price advantage for the physical WTI is not enough to overcome the higher cost of a longer voyage to Asia, meaning that U.S. crude is currently uncompetitive. This suggests that U.S. exporters will have to be prepared to offer deeper discounts if they wish to displace West African barrels from the Asian markets. A further complicating factor is the new output cuts announced by OPEC and its allies, chiefly Russia. It’s likely that much of the oil affected by the production restrictions will be medium to heavy grades, given that the bulk of the cutting will be done by Saudi Arabia and Russia. This is likely to tighten the market for heavier grades, which are not readily replaced by light crudes, such as WTI, even if there are plentiful supplies of the light crudes. This means that even if the United States is increasing its output, there may not be enough demand for light crudes to soak up the extra supply.

2019-01-07,"ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A loan facility from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will help cash-starved Pakistan bridge a yawning current account deficit and shore up foreign reserves, Pakistan’s chief government spokesman said on Monday. The UAE’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, visited Islamabad on Sunday and confirmed a $3 billion loan package first announced last month. “The $3 billion package which has already been announced was formalised,” the government’s top spokesman, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, told a news conference. Chaudhry did not give any details about any further assistance through deferred oil payments, which he said late last year the UAE would be extending to Pakistan on top of the loan. Nor did he give details of the interest rate on the $3 billion loan. However, Pakistan’s English-language daily Dawn quoted Chaudhry as saying the loan had been given on an interest rate of 2.8 percent, and that the UAE would be giving another $3.2 billion for the supply of oil on deferred payment. Pakistan has been facing an economic crisis due to depleting foreign reserves and a widening current account deficit since the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan took office in August. Khan, who has been critical of foreign loans throughout his political career, had no option but to seek financial support from friendly countries besides approaching the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout. Pakistan secured a $3 billion loan from Saudi Arabia and a similar amount every year in oil supply on deferred payment for three years. Pakistan has also been trying to get loans from neighbouring China, which has pledged nearly $60 billion for energy and road and rail infrastructure projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), known as China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Last week, in response to a Financial Times report that China had agreed to lend Pakistan $2 billion to bolster foreign exchange reserves, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China would continue to provide support to Pakistan “in the form of aid, trade, investment and in other ways”. After several rounds of talks late last year, discussions with the IMF broke for unexplained reasons, although Pakistan said it was already taking most of the steps the IMF required, including steps to bridge the budget deficit, more revenue collection and devaluation of the rupee. Pakistan expects the talks to resume this month.

2019-01-07,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has signed a deal with little-known U.S. energy firm Erepla, partly owned by a prominent Florida Republican, to help increase the socialist-run country’s plummeting crude oil output, the company said.  Erepla Services LLC, with an undisclosed stake held by Republican Harry Sargeant III and which Delaware state records show was only registered in November, said it plans to invest up to $500 million to increase production at three Venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced. Sargeant and Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA have clashed in the past. Between 2006 and 2008, PDVSA was awarded $52 million after a company partly owned by Sargeant was accused of not paying for several crude shipments in 2002 and 2003, court records show. The new arrangement faces significant hurdles, including obtaining an exemption from Trump administration sanctions that block U.S. companies from providing financing to the government of President Nicolas Maduro or Venezuelan state firms. It is a further sign that Venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about U.S. sanctions and overall dysfunction. Erepla said the agreement will “revitalize oil production” at the Tia Juana Lago and Rosa Mediano fields in the western Lake Maracaibo region and in the Ayacucho 5 bloc, in the eastern heavy-oil Orinoco Belt. The company added that the deal gives it “enhanced managerial participation” in the projects and will be responsible for procurement, a key difference from long-established joint ventures between PDVSA and oil majors like Chevron Corp (CVX.N), where PDVSA has full operational control. Erepla said it would be “responsible for the entirety of the investment.” A spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds. Neither PDVSA nor the Oil Ministry responded to requests for comment. The Erepla spokesman said Sargeant, who has served as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and runs asphalt trading and shipping firm Global Oil Management Group, owns a stake in Erepla, but declined to reveal the percentage. The deal is the first new partnership between PDVSA and a private company since Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo in August announced a set of “joint service agreements” with 14 little-known companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and PDVSA. Those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who expanded the state’s role in the OPEC country’s energy industry. Output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed, dropping to 1.46 million barrels per day in November from more than 2 million at the end of last year, according to OPEC figures, in a sign of the company’s struggles under military rule. Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on Venezuela that block U.S. citizens from providing financing to Maduro’s government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment. But because PDVSA is perennially cash-strapped, agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of upfront funding that could run afoul of sanctions. Erepla said it had applied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implements sanctions, for a “Specific License affirming the agreement.” The Treasury Department generally does not comment on individual license applications or the timeline for reviewing them, a Treasury spokesperson said. The Erepla spokesman said the firm’s “ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining ability.” Erepla said its minority owner is “an international oil company” that produces over 70,000 barrels per day “in a terrain similar to the Venezuelan fields,” but the spokesman declined to name the owner. Sargeant maintained business ties to PDVSA in the early 2000s through a company that he partly owned called Trigeant, whose Corpus Christi, Texas-based refinery processed Venezuelan crude into asphalt, according to court records. PDVSA won arbitration claims against Trigeant in 2006 and 2008 totaling $52 million for unpaid crude cargoes, and received a $17 million payment, according to court records. Before having paid the full amount, Trigeant sold the refinery to a third party. PDVSA won a court order blocking the sale, arguing that it was a fraudulent transfer meant to prevent it from collecting on the arbitration judgment because Sargeant had a controlling stake in the buyer. Trigeant later declared bankruptcy, and an attorney for Sargeant said he “ultimately made PDVSA whole.” “Ultimately, Harry III resolved PDVSA’s claims to their satisfaction,” Chris Kise, a partner at Foley & Lardner, said by phone. Maduro, who has deepened Venezuela’s relationships with U.S. adversaries like Russia and China, often accuses the United States of plotting to overthrow him and steal the OPEC nation’s oil wealth. The deal has been criticized by hardline Chavez supporters, who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company. “This is the worst giveaway in the history of our country’s oil industry,” former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “Maduro and Quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all Venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our oil.”  Additional reporting by Mayela Armas and Corina Pons in Caracas; Editing by Susan Thomas and Richard Chang",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil/update-1-venezuelas-pdvsa-in-oil-deal-with-firm-part-owned-by-florida-republican-idUKL1N1Z71BJ,07 Jan 2019,"Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA

Kim, appointed twice by former U.S. President Barack Obama for five-year terms, had pushed financing for green energy projects and largely dropped support for coal power investments, but had avoided public clashes with the Trump administration, which has made reviving the U.S. coal sector a priority. Just last month, the World Bank announced it would double its investments to fight climate change to around $200 billion over the next five years.  Kim told World Bank employees in an email that he was leaving the world’s largest lender and donor to poor and middle-income countries on Feb. 1 to join a private-sector firm focussed on infrastructure investments in the developing world. “The opportunity to join the private sector was unexpected, but I’ve concluded that this is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets,” Kim said. Kim said details about his new job would be released later. The physician and former Dartmouth College president said he would also rejoin the board of Partners in Health, a health advocacy group he co-founded 30 years ago.  Kristalina Georgieva, who in 2017 became the World Bank’s chief executive officer, will assume the role of interim president when Kim departs, the bank said. Georgieva, a Bulgarian national, had previously held senior European Union posts after serving 15 years at the World Bank, starting as an environmental economist in 1993. Two people familiar with Kim’s shock announcement to the World Bank executive board said he was leaving of his own accord and was “not pushed out” by the Trump administration. President Donald Trump, however, will wield strong influence in choosing Kim’s successor as the United States holds a controlling share of the World Bank’s voting rights. The bank president has traditionally been an American chosen by the U.S. administration, but some of the multilateral lender’s 189 member countries could mount a new challenge with alternative candidates. Mark Sobel, a former U.S. executive director at the International Monetary Fund and a longtime former U.S. Treasury official, said chances were high for a challenge from bigger emerging market countries such as Brazil or China, which have been clamouring for more influence in multilateral institutions commensurate with their economic clout. “The world is suspicious of the Trump administration, which has a different agenda for the bank,” Sobel said in a phone interview. “If they were to put forward somebody that is hardline, that would engender a reaction and antipathy.” The World Bank’s board will still need to reach a consensus on a candidate, and a more moderate U.S. nominee would have a better chance of winning approval, he added. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury, which oversees the U.S. voting interest in the World Bank, said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin “looks forward to working with his fellow governors in selecting a new leader.” David Malpass, the Treasury’s undersecretary for international affairs, has questioned the need for additional resources for the World Bank and other international financial  institutions, arguing instead that the lenders should focus more of their resources on poorer countries and lend less to middle-income countries such as China. Nonetheless, the Treasury backed a $13 billion (10.2 billion pounds) capital increase for the World Bank last year, which imposed some lending and management reforms, including some caps to the rate of salary increases.

2019-01-07,"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross predicted on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that “we can live with” as dozens of officials from the world’s two largest economies resumed talks in a bid to end their trade dispute. Ross told CNBC the immediate trade issues would be easiest to tackle while enforcement issues and structural reforms, such as intellectual property rights and market access, would be more challenging to resolve. “I think there’s a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement that China can live with, that we can live with and that addresses all of the key issues,” Ross said in an interview with CNBC. China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had the “good faith” to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions as Chinese officials met their U.S. counterparts in Beijing for the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled global markets. After the first day of talks wrapped up, Chinese importers made their third large purchase of U.S. soybeans in the past month, Chicago-based traders said. But China has bought only around 5 million tonnes since purchases resumed in December, less than 20 percent of the beans it bought a year earlier. Trump said on Sunday that trade talks with China were going very well and that weakness in the Chinese economy gave Beijing a reason to work towards a deal. Ross told CNBC the talks were being held with appropriate-level staff and would help determine how the administration moves forward.  The two sides agreed to hold “positive and constructive” dialogue to resolve economic and trade disputes in accordance with the consensus reached by their respective leaders, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing.  “From the beginning we have believed that China-U.S. trade friction is not a positive situation for either country or the world economy. China has the good faith, on the basis of mutual respect and equality, to resolve the bilateral trade frictions.” Trump imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods last year and has threatened more to pressure Beijing to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property to hacking. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own. “As for whether the Chinese economy is good or not, I have already explained this. China’s development has ample tenacity and huge potential,” Lu said. “We have firm confidence in the strong long-term fundamentals of the Chinese economy.” Lu also said Vice President Wang Qishan would attend the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in late January, but added that he had not yet heard of any arrangements for a meeting with Trump there. Few details emerged of the trade talks, which were scheduled to run through Tuesday.  Although the talks were held at a vice ministerial level, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who has led trade negotiations with the United States and is a top economic adviser to Xi, made an unexpected appearance at the meetings on Monday, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Leaked photographs posted on the South China Morning Post’s website showed U.S. officials applauding Liu’s appearance, including the U.S. delegation leader, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish. Another photo shows a wider view of dozens of officials from each country seated at three long tables facing each other and around the room’s borders, significantly more people than those attending previous rounds of U.S.-China trade talks.  A private-sector source familiar with the talks said this could indicate that more detailed discussions were likely taking place. The U.S. delegation includes under secretaries from the U.S. departments of agriculture, commerce, energy and treasury, as well as senior officials from the White House. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNBC that the United States and China are “making progress” on trade. “I hope too that we’ll make progress on all of the other  places whether China’s not behaving in the way that we wish it would, whether that’s their cyber activity that has had a real impact, whether that’s the theft of intellectual property, which has hurt American businesses. Tu Xinquan, a Chinese trade expert at Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics, told Reuters before talks began that the meetings would likely focus on technical issues and leave major disagreements to more senior officials. Data last week showed manufacturing has slowed in both China and the United States, though the U.S. Labour Department on Friday reported a surge in new jobs in December along with higher wages.  Officials have given scant details on concessions that China might be willing to make to meet U.S. demands, some of which would require structural reforms unpalatable for Chinese leaders. Even if a trade agreement is reached soon, analysts say it would be no panacea for China’s economy, which is expected to continue decelerating in coming months.

2019-01-07,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that his crackdown against fuel theft was yielding positive results, even as the intervention sparked severe fuel shortages in parts of the country and long lines of angry motorists. In a bid to eliminate years of mounting theft, state oil firm Pemex has changed its distribution, triggering shortfalls in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-making hub in central Mexico. Guanajuato’s state government said that less than one third of the state’s gas stations were open on Monday. Lopez Obrador told a news conference the government had not established a date for when operations would return to normal, but stressed that supply was not in danger. “We are changing the whole distribution system, that’s the reason for the shortage. We have enough gasoline,” he said. Mexican television showed long lines of drivers waiting to fill up in central states as well as Jalisco in the west and Tamaulipas in the north. Years of fuel theft by criminal groups and others by tapping pipelines and stealing tanker trucks has led to losses totalling billions of dollars for public coffers. Lopez Obrador’s government has ordered the armed forces to intervene in Pemex’s facilities, including one refinery. “The supply will normalise, and at the same time we are going to guarantee that fuel is not stolen,” said Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. “We have seen a reduction in theft like never before ... but we still have work to do.” Guanajuato’s governor Diego Sinhue told local radio that of the state’s 415 gas stations, only 115 were open. In Leon, Guanajuato’s biggest city with a population of more than 1.5 million, only 7 of 196 stations were open on Sunday, he said. “Fuel is becoming a serious problem,” said Sinhue, a member of the opposition centre-right National Action Party (PAN). “People are really angry about this shortage.” Sinhue said the army had informed him it had taken control of the state’s Salamanca refinery on Monday morning. There, members of the armed forces were monitoring tankers going in and out of the facility, as well as the pressure of pipelines. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle offered an apology on Mexican radio for the shortages. Asked when the problem would be fixed, she said it was in the process of being “normalized”.

2019-01-07,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the attorney general of Massachusetts to obtain records from Exxon Mobil Corp(XOM.N) to probe whether the oil company for decades concealed its knowledge of the role fossil fuels play in climate change.  The justices declined to hear Exxon’s appeal of a ruling by the top court in Massachusetts holding that state Attorney General Maura Healey, a Democrat, had jurisdiction to seek records to probe whether the company misled consumers and investors. The high court’s action marked the latest setback for Exxon in its efforts to halt the Massachusetts investigation and a similar one by New York’s attorney general, who in October filed a lawsuit against the company. “The law is clear. The Attorney General’s Office has the authority to investigate Exxon’s conduct toward consumers and investors, and we are proceeding. The public deserves answers from this company about what it knew about the impacts of  burning fossil fuels, and when,” said Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Healey. A spokesman for Exxon declined to comment. New York’s lawsuit accused Exxon of engaging in a systematic scheme to deceive investors about the impact that future climate change regulations could have on its business. Exxon has called the claims “meritless.” The Massachusetts and New York investigations were launched following 2015 news reports that Exxon’s own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.  Those news reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions. Healey in 2016 issued a civil investigative demand to Exxon seeking documents to investigate whether it had violated the state’s consumer-protection law through its marketing and sale of fossil fuel products. Exxon said that because it is incorporated in Texas and New Jersey, Healey had no basis to seek documents to conduct a Massachusetts-based investigation. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in April held that jurisdiction existed because of Exxon’s control over advertising conducted for about 300 franchise gas stations operating under the Exxon and Mobil brands in Massachusetts. Exxon has called the Massachusetts and New York investigations politically motivated. Reporting by Nate Raymond and Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston.

2019-01-07,"(Corrects to show that Kim was president of Dartmouth College, not Princeton University, in paragraph 5) By David Lawder WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly resigned on Monday, more than three years before his term ends in 2022, amid differences with the Trump administration over climate change and the need for more development resources.

2019-01-07,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Economy Ministry denied that the government would pay $14 billion to state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA to settle a dispute over an oil-producing zone off the Brazilian coast known as the transfer-of-rights area. The ministry told Reuters in a statement the figure, reported on Monday by the Valor Economico newspaper, was only one of several proposals passed to the transition team of President Jair Bolsonaro by his predecessor Michel Temer. The final amount has not yet been decided, the ministry said. The report that $14 billion had been agreed to settle the  dispute helped boost the common shares of Petrobras, as the company is known, as much as 5.5 percent. Common shares closed Monday 3.3 percent up and preferred rose 1.6 percent, against a 0.15 percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa index. Settling on a figure would be a major step forward in the long-running dispute and help Petrobras cut its sizeable net debt, which stood at $73 billion as of the third quarter. At times during negotiations, Petrobras has claimed that it is owed as much as $30 billion, while parts of the government has said Petrobras owed money to the state. On Wednesday, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said he expected the dispute to be resolved within 100 days, and that Petrobras was the creditor in the dispute. The amount Petrobras was owed and the form of payment was still under discussion, he added. A dispute over the area in question dates back to 2010, when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. The government received additional shares in Petrobras in return, based on oil prices at the time.  The volume of oil in the area is now estimated to be much larger, however, and the cash-strapped government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil. The choice reserves cannot be auctioned until the government and Petrobras resolve a dispute over the 2010 transaction. Among other things, the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in 2014, which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated.

2019-01-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Monday, rebounding further from 1-1/2-year lows reached in December, on support from OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 27 cents to settle at $57.33 a barrel, a 0.47 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 56 cents to settle at $48.52 a barrel, a 1.17 percent gain. Oil futures have gained more than 7 percent since last Monday. “Momentum is coming back into the market from very depressed price levels,” Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. Prices drew support from a Wall Street Journal report saying that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut crude exports to around 7.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of January.   OPEC and its allies are trying to rein in a surge in global supply, driven mostly by the United States, where production surpassed 11 million bpd in 2018. Record high crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has pushed up U.S. inventories. OPEC oil supply fell in December by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.68 million bpd, a Reuters survey found last week, led by cuts from top exporter Saudi Arabia. “We continue to view the OPEC production cuts that became official last week as a legitimate bullish consideration and we still look for the reduction to translate to a reduced U.S. crude surplus that could potentially be erased in some 8-9 weeks,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell by 565,000 barrels from last Tuesday to Friday, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. More upbeat equity markets also offered support. “When stock markets are strong oil usually follows suit,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. Shares have risen on expectations that trade talks this week between the United States and China will ease the trade war. Disruptions to trade undermine prospects for economic growth and oil demand. [MKTS/GLOB] Goldman Sachs said in a note it had downgraded its average Brent crude oil forecast for 2019 to $62.50 a barrel from $70 due to “the strongest macro headwinds since 2015.” Societe Generale cut its 2019 oil price forecast for Brent by $9 to $64 a barrel and reduced its forecast for U.S. light crude by $9 to $57 a barrel.

Maurel & Prom said in a December statement it had agreed to pay 70 million euros ($80.5 million) to buy the stake from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and that it would invest 350 million euros ($402.5 million) in boosting output. “It will participate together with PDVSA with $400 million in investment to increase production in Lake Maracaibo,” said Quevedo in a broadcast from Venezuela’s presidential palace in the company of Maurel & Prom President Michel Hochard. “We have signed agreements to ensure the necessary investments at the start of 2019 ... to boost production to 70,000 barrels per day,” he said, without making any reference to Shell. The field in 2018 produced around 15,500 barrels per day, Maurel and Prom said in December. Shell in an emailed statement confirmed the sale of its stake to Maurel and Prom. The Lake Maracaibo area has been plagued by frequent theft of equipment and chronic power cuts as Venezuela remains mired in deep recession, hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine.

2019-01-07,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp on Monday offered to buy QEP Resources Inc (QEP.N), which has a big presence in the Permian Basin near major energy producers, for $2.07 billion, or $8.75 per share, 44 percent above the stock’s closing price on Friday. QEP Resources shares surged after the offer was made in a letter to the company’s board. The proposal could force the company to put itself up for sale, according to a person close to the Elliott camp. The letter said QEP remained undervalued despite its efforts to focus on the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field, where its operations are more lucrative than in other regions where it is selling properties. After the offer from billionaire activist investor Paul Singer’s Elliott, shares of the Denver-based QEP jumped 41 percent to $8.55 on Monday afternoon. The New York-based hedge fund has a 5 percent stake in QEP, according to Refinitiv data. QEP in a statement acknowledged receiving the proposal and said it would “carefully consider it” in light of shareholder interests and the current market. QEP’s shares traded above $13 as recently as July, when benchmark U.S. crude oil CLc1 traded above $70. Since then, crude has since fallen more than 40 percent and last traded below $49. Elliott would run QEP as an independent private company if the deal goes through, according to the source close to the hedge fund. Elliott believes the company’s Permian acreage could attract competing bids, according to the person. QEP’s 50,700 acres in the Permian are contiguous, making it easier to drill horizontal wells that extend up to two miles. Neighboring operators include Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Encana Corp (ECA.TO) and Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O).  “All three companies could make a case that the QEP assets would fold in” to their Permian operations, said Jeoffrey Lambujon, a equity researcher at Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co. Oil has plunged since October as investors worried about oversupply and fears of an economic slowdown. If crude prices remain weak, it would be harder for QEP to get a competing bid, said Williams Capital Group analyst Gabriele Sorbara.  Prices rebounded 2.5 percent on Monday on OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets. [O/R] “While its bid offers a healthy exit opportunity for current investors, Elliott’s letter to the board is clearly a preliminary step in the negotiation process,” Raymond James said in a research note. Elliott specializes in buying undervalued assets. In December, Elliott and Siris Capital bid to take Travelport Worldwide (TVPT.N) private in an all-cash deal valuing the travel technology company at $4.4 billion. “QEP as a public-company investment has not worked, and its stock continues to trade well below its intrinsic value,” Elliott wrote in a letter addressed to the board. Last year, QEP decided to sell its Williston oil asset in North Dakota, Montana and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan as well as the Haynesville gas asset in Texas and Louisiana. It wanted to focus solely on the Permian basin, the oilfield that has been at the heart of the U.S. shale boom. The Elliott offer is conditional on closing the Haynesville asset sale, but not on the closure of the Williston asset sale, the hedge fund said in its letter.

Growing bets the Federal Reserve will halt its multi-year rate hike cycle sent the dollar lower across the board, while rising equity markets and support from OPEC production cuts helped lift oil prices. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.77 percent, its highest since Dec. 19. On Friday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the American Economic Association that the Fed is not on a preset path of rate hikes and that it will be sensitive to the downside risks markets are pricing in. The comments, coming after a robust U.S. jobs report, helped boost risk sentiment and lift stock markets around the world. On Monday, U.S. stocks edged higher as investors turned their attention to the latest round of U.S.-China trade talks and a prolonged government shutdown, halting Wall Street’s strong surge from Friday. U.S. officials are meeting their counterparts in Beijing this week for the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has roiled global markets. China has the “good faith” to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday, as the world’s two largest economies resumed talks in a bid to end their trade dispute. “Trade has been one of the big factors, along with the budget stalemate, contributing to the climate of fear that we’re seeing,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 74.9 points, or 0.32 percent, to 23,508.06, the S&P 500 gained 14.26 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,546.2 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.25 points, or 0.86 percent, to 6,797.11. European shares were slightly lower amid lingering worries about the euro zone economy and Brexit. The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.29 percent. In currency markets, the dollar weakened amid diminished expectations for further U.S. interest rate hikes. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was down 0.48 percent at 95.722. “Fed Chair Powell’s comments Friday that policymakers were flexible and ‘listening carefully’ to financial markets helped support the impression that the Fed tightening cycle may slow or pause in the coming months,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. Interest rate futures traders are now pricing in a partial rate cut for this year, while the Fed has indicated that two rate hikes are likely. Gold rose and palladium hit a record high as the weaker dollar spurred demand for the metals from holders of other currencies. Spot gold was up 0.27 percent at $1,288.25 per ounce. U.S. Treasury prices erased early gains after a private report released on Monday showed growth of U.S. services industries slowed to a five-month low in December, signalling the world’s largest economy is decelerating faster than economists’ forecasts. Benchmark 10-year notes shed 2/32 in price to yield 2.6640 percent, from 2.659 percent on Friday. Stable equity markets and production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries helped oil prices rise for a fifth straight session. Brent crude oil was up $1.66 at $58.72 a barrel. U.S. crude was up $1.64 at $49.6 a barrel.

2019-01-07,"(Adds analysts, background) By Lena Masri CAIRO, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Egypt’s foreign currency reserves fell to $42.551 billion in December from $44.513 billion in November, the central bank said on Monday, the first drop since a 2016 currency devaluation. The last time Egypt’s foreign currency reserves fell was in October 2016, the month before it signed a three-year, $12 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund that included a currency float. That deal was part of an effort to attract foreign investors who fled during Egypt’s 2011 uprising. The central bank did not give reasons for the drop. “It was a surprise,” Naeem Brokerage head of research Allen Sandeep said of the development, adding he was unsure of the reasons. Egypt expects to receive the fifth instalment of its IMF loan, worth $2 billion, in January. That tranche will offset December’s drop, Sandeep forecast. “In January I would think it would go back to the $44 billion mark,” he said. The fifth tranche had been expected in December and the delay has likely contributed to the drop in reserves, said Alia Mamdouh, director of macro and strategy at Beltone Financial. “I don’t think it’s alarming because we are expecting the tranche to be disbursed in January, and 5 billion Euro bonds are expected to be issued in the first half of this year,” she said. The central bank also had outstanding liabilities of $3 billion in December that would have contributed to the decrease in foreign reserves, said Mamdouh. Egypt has been pursuing tough economic reforms as part of the IMF programme. In addition to the currency devaluation, reforms have included new taxes and deep cuts to energy subsidies, straining the budget of tens of millions of Egyptians.

2019-01-07,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that the country’s offensive against fuel theft was yielding good results and would continue, though it has provoked fuel shortages and long lines of angry motorists. As part of the campaign to combat chronic theft of gasoline, state oil firm Pemex is changing its distribution, triggering shortages in at least six states. Lopez Obrador said at a news conference that the government had not established a date for when operations would return to normal, but stressed that supply was not in danger. “We are changing the whole distribution system, that’s the reason for the shortage. We have enough gasoline,” said Lopez Obrador. Mexican television showed long lines of drivers waiting to fill up in central states as well as Jalisco in the west and Tamaulipas in the north. Years of massive theft of fuel by criminal groups and others, mostly by tapping pipelines, has led to steep losses for the government and Pemex. The government led by Lopez Obrador has already ordered the armed forces to intervene in Pemex’s facilities, including one refinery. “The supply will normalize, and at the same time we are going to guarantee that fuel is not stolen,” said Lopez Obrador, who took office in December. “We have seen a reduction in theft like never before...but we still have work to do.” (Reporting by Veronica Gomez Sparrowe; Writing by Julia Love Editing by Alistair Bell)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-theft/mexican-president-says-fuel-theft-plan-working-despite-shortages-idUKL1N1Z70P8,07 Jan 2019,"Mexican President Andres

2019-01-07,"LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon foiled an attempted military coup on Monday, killing two suspected plotters and capturing seven others just hours after they took over state radio in a bid to end 50 years of rule by President Ali Bongo’s family. Government spokesman Guy-Bertrand Mapangou announced the deaths and arrests after soldiers briefly seized the radio station and broadcast a message saying Bongo was no longer fit for office after suffering a stroke in Saudi Arabia in October.  The quick failure of Monday’s coup and the lack of widespread support suggest further efforts to overthrow Bongo are unlikely, analysts said. But the attempt alone shows a growing frustration with a government weakened by the President’s secretive medical leave. On Dec. 31, in one of his first television appearances since the stroke, Bongo, 59, slurred his speech and he appeared unable to move his right arm. It is unclear if he is able to walk. He has been in Morocco since November to continue treatment.      In a radio message at 4:30 a.m. (0330 GMT), Lieutenant Kelly Ondo Obiang, who described himself as an officer in the Republican Guard, said Bongo’s New Year’s Eve address “reinforced doubts about the president’s ability to continue to carry out of the responsibilities of his office”. Outside the radio station, loyalist soldiers fired teargas to disperse about 300 people who had come out into the streets to support the coup attempt, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters circled overhead and there was a strong military and police presence on the streets.   Most of the beachside capital was quiet, however, and a government spokesman said the situation was under control after the arrests.  Residents said Internet access was cut. “The government is in place. The institutions are in place,” Mapangou told France 24.          The Bongo family has ruled the oil-producing country since 1967. Bongo has been president since succeeding his father, Omar, who died in 2009. His re-election in 2016 was marred by claims of fraud and violent protest. The economy was long buoyed by oil revenues, much of which went to a moneyed elite while most of the two-million population live in deep poverty. In Libreville, expensive western hotels overlook the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the capital’s hillside shanties to the east.  A sharp drop in oil output and prices in recent years has squeezed revenues, raised debt and stoked discontent. Oil workers’ strikes have become more common. Economic growth was 2 percent last year, down from over 7 percent in 2011.  The coup indicates “broad socio-economic and political frustration with Gabon’s leadership, which has been weakened by the suspected incapacitation of its strongman president,” Exx Africa Business Risk Intelligence said in a report.  The international community condemned the coup attempt, including former colonial ruler France which urged its 8,900 citizens registered in Gabon to avoid moving around Libreville.  “Gabon’s stability can only be ensured in strict compliance with the provisions of its constitution,” French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said. African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat reaffirmed “the AU’s total rejection of all unconstitutional changes of power.”  In a video on social media, Ondo is seen in a radio studio wearing military fatigues and a green beret as he reads the statement. Two other soldiers with rifles stand behind him.    Ondo said the coup attempt was by a group called the Patriotic Movement of the Defence and Security Forces of Gabon against “those who, in a cowardly way, assassinated our young compatriots on the night of August 31, 2016,” a reference to violence after Bongo was declared winner of a disputed election.  Bongo won the poll by fewer than 6,000 votes, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched.  “President Bongo’s record as defence minister under his father lowers the possibility that current military leadership is supportive of his ouster,” said Judd Devermont of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. France has a permanent force of 300 soldiers in Gabon. The United States also sent about 80 soldiers to Gabon last week in response to possible violence in Democratic Republic of Congo after a presidential election there.  Foreign governments have often suspected Bongo and members of his government of corruption, accusations they have denied. During his father’s rule, Gabon was a pillar of “La Francafrique”, a web of influence that gave French companies favoured access to African autocrats.    Gabon’s dollar-denominated sovereign debt <XS1003557870=TE > <US362420AC51=TE > tumbled in early trading, with both outstanding bonds losing around 3 cents in the dollar. However, prices recovered in late morning, with bonds trading around half a cent lower.

2019-01-07,"CARACAS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA has signed a deal with little-known U.S. energy firm Erepla that is part-owned by a prominent Florida Republican to help increase the socialist-run country’s plummeting crude oil output, the company said. Erepla Services LLC, part-owned by Republican Harry Sargeant III and which Delaware state records show was only registered two months ago, said it plans to invest up to $500 million to increase production at three Venezuelan oil fields in exchange for a portion of the crude produced. The arrangement faces significant hurdles including obtaining an exemption from Trump administration sanctions that block U.S. companies from providing financing to the government of President Nicolas Maduro or Venezuelan state firms. It is a further sign that Venezuela is tapping inexperienced firms to stem massive declines in crude output as more established oil companies steer clear of the troubled country due to concerns about U.S. sanctions and overall dysfunction. Erepla said that the agreement will “revitalize oil production” at the Tia Juana Lago and Rosa Mediano fields in the western Lake Maracaibo region and in the Ayacucho 5 bloc, in the eastern heavy-oil Orinoco Belt. The company added that the deal gives it “enhanced managerial participation” in the projects and will be responsible for procurement, a key difference from long-established joint ventures between PDVSA and oil majors like Chevron Corp, where PDVSA has full operational control. It said Erepla would be “responsible for the entirety of the investment.” A spokesman declined to elaborate on how it would raise the funds. Neither PDVSA nor the Oil Ministry responded to a request for comment. The Erepla spokesman confirmed media reports that Sargeant, who has served as finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and currently runs asphalt trading and shipping firm Global Oil Management Group, is a part-owner of Erepla. The spokesman declined to say what size stake Sargeant has in the company. The deal is the first new partnership between PDVSA and a private company since Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo in August announced a set of “joint service agreements” with 14 little-known companies that did not appear to have experience operating oilfields and PDVSA. Those contracts were similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who expanded the state’s role in the OPEC country’s energy industry. Output has continued to stagnate since the deals were signed, dropping to 1.46 million barrels per day in November from more than 2 million at the end of last year, according to OPEC figures, in a sign of the company’s struggles under military rule. Washington has levied several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan that block U.S. citizens from providing financing to Maduro’s government without placing explicit restrictions on commerce or investment. But because PDVSA is perennially cash-strapped, agreements to boost production usually involve partner companies putting up significant amounts of up-front funding that could run afoul of sanctions. Erepla said it had applied to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implements sanctions, for a “Specific License affirming the agreement.” The Treasury Department, which is affected by the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Consulted on how a company with no evident oil-field experience would be in a position to take on the project, the Erepla spokesman said the firm’s “ownership includes serious and significant oilfield production capabilities as well as heavy oil refining ability.” Maduro, who has deepened Venezuela’s relationships with U.S. adversaries like Russia and China, often accuses the United States of plotting to overthrow him and steal the OPEC nation’s oil wealth. The deal has been criticized by hardline Chavez supporters, who say it cedes too much control to a foreign company. “This is the worst giveaway in the history of our country’s oil industry,” former Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “Maduro and Quevedo will have to be held to account for giving away assets belonging to all Venezuelans and ceding our sovereignty over managing our oil.” (Additional reporting by Mayela Armas and Corina Pons in Caracas Editing by Susan Thomas)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil/venezuelas-pdvsa-inks-oil-deal-with-firm-part-owned-by-florida-republican-idUKL1N1Z600N,07 Jan 2019,"Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA

2019-01-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - British carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) has triggered contingency plans to cope with a potentially disorderly Brexit, including hiring a new supply chain chief and preparing to fly in components as well as use ports other than Dover.   Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the European Union in just over 80 days but a negotiated withdrawal agreement looks set to be voted down by MPs next week, making a “no deal” exit - and disruption to trade - more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and is one of the country’s rare manufacturing success stories, has warned that leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without a deal would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which outlined its contingency plans in October, had no choice but to authorise them at a board meeting in December.  “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two years where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters, declining to put a figure on the “accumulating” cost of the plans.  “We programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don’t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.”  “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston Martin, the preferred drive of fictional secret agent James Bond, joins a growing list of companies readying for a no deal Brexit. Data last week showed manufacturers ramping up stocks in preparation for potential border delays. Aston is signing deals with supplier DHL to allow for the use of ports other than Dover - Britain’s busiest and so most likely to be disrupted by any customs delays - and has authorised its supply chain team to make air freight bookings.  The government has said it will prioritise the movement of key supplies such as medicines if the flow of goods is hit after Brexit, so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” Aston Martin, which built more than 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018 ... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said.  Carmakers fear their just-in-time production will grind to a halt if there are delays imposed after Brexit, but different manufacturers face different challenges. Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), Britain’s favourite carmaker accounting for over 20 percent of sales, builds only 11,000 Bentleys in the country, while Ford (F.N) counts Britain as its third-largest market but makes no cars there.  Meantime Nissan (7201.T), which builds around half a million cars at its northern English Sunderland plant, and Toyota (7203.T) export the overwhelming majority of their British-built vehicles to the rest of the EU. While mass-market brands are most worried about potential trade tariffs, smaller, high-end players such as Aston and McLaren believe their affluent customers could absorb extra costs and are more concerned about customs checks and delays.  Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, as interim vice president for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer criticised politicians on both sides of the Channel. “Both the European and the UK politicians are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said. As carmakers prepare for multiple Brexit eventualities, they are also dealing with stricter emissions rules and a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy, China, which has hit a variety of firms including Apple (AAPL.O). While some automakers have reported falling demand, Aston, which has seen its share price fall by more than a third since it listed in October, said it had a record 2018. “There has not been any downflow since those (Q3) numbers so in fact, broadly speaking, the opposite as we launched (sports cars) DBS and Vantage into China,” said Palmer.

2019-01-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - Last year was the fourth warmest on record, extending a scorching streak driven by a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Monday. Average world surface air temperatures were 14.7 Celsius (58.5 Fahrenheit) in 2018, just 0.2C off the highest, it said in the first global assessment based on full-year data. This year will also likely be hot, its scientists said. “Dramatic climatic events like the warm and dry summer in large parts of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic regions are alarming signs to all of us,” said Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of Copernicus.  Among other extremes in 2018, California and Greece suffered severe wildfires, Kerala in India had the worst flooding since the 1920s and heatwaves struck from Australia to North Africa. Around Antarctica, the extent of sea ice is at a record low at the start of 2019, according to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. Copernicus chief scientist Freja Vamborg said 2019 would also likely be hot. “We now have a nascent El Nino - it depends partly on what happens ... will it continue or die out?” she told Reuters. The last four years have seen the highest average temperatures since records began in the 19th century - 2016 was the hottest, boosted by an El Nino event that warmed the surface of the Pacific Ocean, ahead of 2017 and then 2015. The Copernicus report said that concentrations of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to a new record of 406.7 parts per million (ppm) in 2018 from 404.1 in 2017, stoked largely by human burning of fossil fuels. And the average global temperature in the past five years was 1.1C (2.0F) above pre-industrial times, it said. According to a U.N. climate report last year, temperatures will rise 1.5C above pre-industrial times by mid-century on current trends - bringing the prospect of even more extreme weather. That U.N. report said governments would have to make unprecedented cuts in greenhouse gases to keep temperatures below the 1.5C rise, which is the toughest goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Almost 200 nations agreed a “rule book” to govern the Paris accord in talks in Poland last month, even though critics said it was insufficient to prevent dangerous climate change.  The Paris accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energies such as wind and solar power. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. The Copernicus report confirms projections by the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2018 would be fourth warmest.  The WMO will issue its own estimate for 2018 temperatures in coming weeks, also comprising data compiled by U.S., British and Japanese agencies.

2019-01-07,"NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp will import 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February after a gap of three months, with the nation’s overall purchases from Tehran remaining at 9 million barrels, three industry sources said. The United States in early November granted India a six-month waiver from sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Under the agreement, New Delhi must restrict its Iranian oil purchases to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels. BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will lift 1 million barrels each of Iranian crude oil in February, the sources said. HPCL this month resumed purchases of Iranian oil after a gap of six months. The company halted Iranian oil purchases in July after its insurance company refused to provide cover for the crude because of U.S. sanctions, although its chairman said HPCL may resume buying Iranian oil under sanctions waivers. Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the same as this month. Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 2 million barrels compared with 3 million barrels this month, the sources said. An IOC official had previously said his firm would lift 180,000 bpd - the full volume contracted under an annual deal with Iran for this fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. India recently exempted rupee payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from a steep withholding tax, paving way for pending dues to be cleared.

2019-01-07,"NEW DELHI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Energy-hungry India will allow state-owned explorers to rope in the private sector to raise production from old fields as the world’s third biggest oil importer strives to better exploit its hydrocarbon resources and cut dependence on foreign oil. India is the world’s third-largest oil consumer and buys about 80 percent of its supplies from abroad. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to cut India’s dependence on foreign oil to 67 percent by 2022. India is looking at raising production from “nomination blocks,” or fields handed to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd after independence, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday. The fields are both onshore and offshore. The boards of ONGC and Oil India will be allowed to issue production enhancement contracts and bring in private players to drill some nomination fields, Pradhan said. He said the current fiscal model was not supportive of raising output from nomination fields. “Revenue was the priority at one point of time but now the government is of the view that the priority is to raise production,” Pradhan told reporters at a function to launch the country’s second licensing round under new rules. India has offered 14 blocks under the latest auction and will offer another 23 fields, including five coal bed methane blocks, in the next round later this month. It hopes to launch two more rounds by December. Pradhan also said India would offer higher incentives for production from old blocks in frontier or difficult areas. So far, the key criteria for winning a block has been the higher revenue offered to the government from the oil and gas production. But the policy has not helped oil and gas output, which has been stagnant for years. After the discovery of the Bombay High oil fields in 1974 and Bassein gas fields in 1976, ONGC has not been able to bring any new major fields into production in the last four decades. India has also failed to draw interest from global oil majors in licensing rounds since 1990 even though the fiscal terms were eased. However, Royal Dutch Shell and BP later bought stakes from firms that had won drilling rights.

2019-01-07,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. crude vs WTI Houston, Girassol: tmsnrt.rs/2RBeVDA By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil is starting to trickle back to China with three cargoes slated to arrive next month, but volumes are still a long way off levels prior to the outbreak of trade hostilities between the world’s two largest economies. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv shows three tankers carrying 3.94 million barrels are en route from the United States to China and will arrive in February. This is up from zero cargoes slated to arrive in January, a mere one in December and zero in both November and October. Prior to the tit-for-tat tariffs being imposed from the middle of last year, crude oil was a success story in the U.S.-China trade relationship as Beijing bought increasing volumes of booming U.S. shale oil production. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States, representing about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. China’s imports of U.S. crude reached a record high of about 460,000 bpd in June, according to the Refinitiv data. It’s worth noting that China hasn’t imposed any tariff on U.S. crude imports, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas, which were included in Beijing’s retaliatory measures. What seems clear is that Chinese refiners decided to hold back on buying U.S. crude either because they were nudged in that direction by the government, or because they were concerned that a tariff would be imposed. Using crude oil for politics is certainly nothing new, so the resumption of trade between China and the United States may well depend on the status of talks between the administration of President Donald Trump and its counterpart in Beijing. However, if the U.S.-China crude trade was strictly about economics, it’s likely that U.S. crude prices will have to fall some more, especially relative to competing grades of West African crude. The bulk of the U.S. crude going to Asia is light and sweet, and therefore competes with grades like Nigeria’s Bonny Light BON-E and Angola’s Girassol GIR-E. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures have dropped sharply since their peak in early October, the price of physical WTI delivered in Houston, as assessed by Argus Media, hasn’t fallen by as much. WTI Houston was at $53.88 a barrel on Jan. 4, while WTI futures were at $47.96, a discount of $5.92 a barrel. Six months ago, WTI Houston was at $75.79 a barrel and the futures were $74.13, showing that since then the investor market has become more bearish on U.S. crude prices than the physical market. Comparing WTI Houston to Girassol shows that the Angolan grade traded at a small premium on Jan. 4, closing at $56.24 a barrel to WTI Houston’s $53.38. The small price advantage for the physical WTI is not enough to overcome the higher cost of a longer voyage to Asia, meaning that U.S. crude is currently uncompetitive. This suggests that U.S. exporters will have to be prepared to offer deeper discounts if they wish to displace West African barrels from the Asian markets. A further complicating factor is the new output cuts announced by OPEC and its allies, chiefly Russia. It’s likely that much of the oil affected by the production restrictions will be medium to heavy grades, given that the bulk of the cutting will be done by Saudi Arabia and Russia. This is likely to tighten the market for heavier grades, which are not readily replaced by light crudes, such as WTI, even if there are plentiful supplies of the light crudes. This means that even if the United States is increasing its output, there may not be enough demand for light crudes to soak up the extra supply.

2019-01-07,"ISLAMABAD, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A loan facility from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will help cash-starved Pakistan bridge a yawning current account deficit and shore up foreign reserves, Pakistan’s chief government spokesman said on Monday. The UAE’s crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, visited Islamabad on Sunday and confirmed a $3 billion loan package first announced last month. “The $3 billion package which has already been announced was formalised,” the government’s top spokesman, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, told a news conference. Chaudhry did not give any details about any further assistance through deferred oil payments, which he said late last year the UAE would be extending to Pakistan on top of the loan. Nor did he give details of the interest rate on the $3 billion loan. However, Pakistan’s English-language daily Dawn quoted Chaudhry as saying the loan had been given on an interest rate of 2.8 percent, and that the UAE would be giving another $3.2 billion for the supply of oil on deferred payment. Pakistan has been facing an economic crisis due to depleting foreign reserves and a widening current account deficit since the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan took office in August. Khan, who has been critical of foreign loans throughout his political career, had no option but to seek financial support from friendly countries besides approaching the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout. Pakistan secured a $3 billion loan from Saudi Arabia and a similar amount every year in oil supply on deferred payment for three years. Pakistan has also been trying to get loans from neighbouring China, which has pledged nearly $60 billion for energy and road and rail infrastructure projects as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), known as China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Last week, in response to a Financial Times report that China had agreed to lend Pakistan $2 billion to bolster foreign exchange reserves, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China would continue to provide support to Pakistan “in the form of aid, trade, investment and in other ways”. After several rounds of talks late last year, discussions with the IMF broke for unexplained reasons, although Pakistan said it was already taking most of the steps the IMF required, including steps to bridge the budget deficit, more revenue collection and devaluation of the rupee. Pakistan expects the talks to resume this month.

2019-01-07,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark backed a proposal on Monday to build nine new artificial islands to expand the industrial district of Copenhagen and attract investment. The new islands would make up around a quarter of a development project the size of 420 soccer fields in total. Construction could begin in 2022 and the project could be fully functional by 2040. The government expects it to attract up to 380 new businesses and create 12,000 jobs, adding more than $8 billion to the economy, equivalent to 2.5 percent of GDP. “We will stand stronger in international competition to attract business, investment and highly qualified labor” with the project, interior minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll-Bille said in a statement. “That could contribute to growth and development not just in the capital area but in all of Denmark.” The proposal must still be approved by parliament. Business minister Rasmus Jarlov told reporters at a press briefing that the government expected the project to be self financed in part by selling lots on the islands. One of the nine islands will house a plant converting waste from the capital to bio gas, cleaning waste water and storing green energy from windmills. Others will have space for industrial companies. Copenhagen is located across two main islands, Zealand and Amager, and has already been expanded numerous times with the construction of small artificial islands. In October last year Denmark also proposed building an island near Copenhagen’s harbor to create more space for the city’s growing population.

2019-01-07,"LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Aston Martin has hired a supply chain chief and approved Brexit plans to avoid delays by using ports other than Dover and flying in components as the carmaker prepares for a possible no deal in March, its boss told Reuters. Britain, the world’s fifth largest economy, is due to leave the globe’s biggest trading bloc in just over 80 days but a Brexit agreement looks set to be voted down by lawmakers next week, making a no deal and potential trade barriers more likely. Britain’s car industry, which employs over 850,000 people and has been lauded as a success story by politicians, has consistently warned that leaving the EU without an agreement would add costs and could halt output due to snarl-ups. Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the luxury automaker, which was in October considering plans to fly components and move more in through other ports, had no choice but to authorise such contingencies at a board meeting in December. “I don’t think we’ve been in a position in the last two years where we’ve been further apart from understanding where we’re going to end up,” Palmer told Reuters. “We programme a car to align and order all the parts for those cars twelve weeks in advance. You don’t need to do the maths to know that therefore takes us across the Brexit period.” “We have to prepare for the worst case scenario.” Aston is signing deals with its first-tier supplier, DHL, to allow for the use of ports other than Dover and has triggered the authority for its supply chain team to make bookings for air freight. But the government has already said it will prioritise the movement of key supplies such as medicines in a scenario where the free-flow of goods is hit after Brexit so it is unclear what would happen to other items. “We don’t have any assurances,” said Palmer. “One assumes if you’re putting parts onto a standard chartered plane, no one’s going to kick you off.” The company, which built over 6,000 top-end models last year at its central English plant in Gaydon, its only factory, is also holding a stock of cars in Germany. “It’s an inventory to some extent that we put in place during the course of 2018... and depending on what happens in the next few weeks, may or may not increase,” Palmer said. The firm’s Brexit plans have added an “accumulating cost,” he added. Aston has hired John Griffiths, who has worked for Nissan and aerospace firm Rolls-Royce, as Interim Vice President for supply chain, in a role Palmer said “there was a nagging need (for) which has been confirmed with Brexit.” Palmer also criticised politicians on both sides of the Channel who have failed to provide the stability needed for businesses to succeed. “Both the European and the UK politicians, are not discharging the duty for which they are put in place which is basically to plan and bring certainty to allow the country to thrive,” he said.

2019-01-07,"ATHENS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Greece has given investors another week to Jan. 15 to submit binding bids for three coal-fired power plants and a licence to build another one, a senior energy ministry official told Reuters on Monday. Public Power Corp. (PPC) is selling the plants in northern Greece and on the southern Peloponnese under the terms of Athens’ latest international bailout after an EU court ruled that PPC had abused its dominant position in the coal market. The bid deadline has been repeatedly pushed back since the tender was launched last year for different reasons. PPC has shortlisted six investors but a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named, said only three may submit binding bids. PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, and the energy ministry are handling the divestment and the EU Commission is overseeing the process. The Jan. 7 deadline was pushed back because PPC wants to first conclude a voluntary redundancy scheme it has offered to its workers, the official said, declining to be named. Investors will then have a clearer picture of the plants’ workforce, the official added. PPC employs about 1,400 people at the plants and aims for about two-thirds to sign up to the voluntary redundancy scheme or opt to move to other subsidiaries within the group by later this week, according to another source close to the process. PPC declined to comment on the issue. PPC’s chairman has called for the bid deadline to be extended to February, saying this was needed to ensure bidders had all the necessary information to make their offers, including a European Commision decision on whether the plants would be financially rewarded for making capacity available. However, the energy ministry has pushed for the process to be wrapped up earlier. The six investors shortlisted are: A consortium of Beijing Guohua Power Company and Damco Energy; Gek Terna; ElvalHalcor; Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding; Indoverse Coal Investments; Mytilineos.

The resumption of talks between the United States and China on tariffs also helped restore some optimism to a market battered in recent weeks by trade tensions and a weakening global growth outlook. Though European shares were in the red on Monday, they were still close to three-week highs after Friday’s strong gains and a stellar opening for Asian bourses. MSCI’s world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, was still at its highest level in 2-1/2 weeks and about 6 percent higher than its December trough. “It is a reminder that central banks still have some firepower to deal with lower growth prospects, and perhaps what we are also getting some return of liquidity as investors return from the holidays,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. He warned, however, that there is continued uncertainty about global growth, trade talks between the United States and China and U.S. monetary policy. “There are a number of questions that remain unanswered,” Shaw said. On Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls data showed the world’s largest economy added 312,000 net new jobs in December, while wages rose at a brisk annual pace of 3.2 percent, both way above expectations. This, along with a 100 basis point cut in China’s bank reserve requirement ratios and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would be flexible in its approach in 2019, has been the main driver for the recovery. The boost to stock markets saw them recapture all the year’s losses and push into positive territory for 2019, with Wall St’s main indices closing up more than 3 percent by the close on Friday. After gains of more than 2 percent in Shanghai and HK on Friday before the U.S. jobs data and Powell’s comments, both markets added almost 1 percent more on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei reversed Friday’s plunge to gain 2.4 percent. European stocks were slightly lower across the board, though mining stocks were up 0.7 percent after the reserve requirement ratio cut from China boosted metals prices, especially steel and iron ore. This renewed optimism saw U.S. Treasury yields rise off recent lows, and two-year yields move back above the federal funds rate to 2.49 percent. That is nearly 50 bps below the November peak, however, suggesting there is still plenty of nervousness around growth prospects for the U.S. economy. “Clearly markets are now pricing in the risk of a cut in 2019,” said Shaw of Investec. “That’s a big shift given until relatively recently when we’ve been focusing on rate hikes.” Some of the stocks recovery may be attributed to investors buying stocks once again in the belief that the market had bottomed out or had overshot in pricing in global risks. In any case, Friday was a strong session for Wall Street, with the Dow recording gains of 3.29 percent, while the S&P 500 jumped 3.43 percent and the Nasdaq 4.26 percent. Futures pricing were flat to slightly lower, suggested that Wall Street would hold on to most these gains. Goldman Sachs researchers expect a bounce in equity markets in 2019. “If, as we expect, global economies slow down in 2019 but avoid recession, and U.S. interest rates peak, there is likely to be a risk rally,” they said in a note. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that with 2,055 of 2,767 U.S. and global companies in a bear market, it might be time to buy. “Our Bull & Bear Indicator has fallen to an ‘extreme bear’ reading, triggering the first ‘buy’ signal for risk assets since June 2016,” they wrote in a note. The U.S. dollar — which served as a safe haven in 2018 — fell broadly, with the euro edging up to $1.1440 and the dollar index easing 0.25 percent to 95.94. The currency could not even hold early gains on the yen, lapsing back to 108.36. Gold benefited from the diminished risk of U.S. rate hikes and rose half a percent to $1,290.90, just off a six-month high. Oil prices firmed after Brent bounced about 9.3 percent last week. The crude benchmark rose 135 cents on Monday to $58.42 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 111 cents to $49.07.

2019-01-07,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s surface water quality improved in 2018, with more samples taken from river and lakes reaching standards fit for human use, the country’s environment ministry said on Monday. Beijing has extended its campaign to tackle pollution from air to water, attempting to clean up the black and stinky streams flowing through Chinese cities and improve the water quality of its natural reserves. But while water quality in most of China’s major waterways including the Yellow, Huai, Yangtze and Pearl rivers improved in 2018, those in northeastern China such as the Liao and Songhua were found to be even more polluted than in 2017. China has vowed to take action to “significantly reduce” the volume of industrial wastewater flowing into the Bohai Sea in northern part of the country.  Among the 1,940 samples from across China last year, 71 percent were considered grade III or better, meaning they were suitable for drinking and fishing, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said, up 3.1 percentage points on 2017. Meanwhile the amount of “below grade V” water that cannot be used in either agriculture or industry, fell by 1.6 percentage points to 6.7 percent in 2018. Phosphorus and ammonium nitrate, which mainly come from industrial waste water, pesticides and organic fertilisers, were identified as the major pollutants of water pollution, the MEE said in a statement.  Chemical oxygen demand, a measure used to determine organic content in water, was also found to exceed the national level in the “below grade V” rivers.

It previously expected 2019 investment of 153 billion crowns. “It is good news that activity is so high on the Norwegian continental shelf. We believe this is because of the significant restructuring the industry has done in recent years, which has increased competitiveness,” the lobby said in a statement. But it said investment would start to fall after 2019 to 182.5 billion crowns in 2020, 168 billion crowns in 2021, 156.5 billions crowns in 2022 and 141.5 billion crowns in 2023. The group said its forecast for investment was based on a survey of companies that was completed before October when oil was trading at above $70 a barrel. Since then prices had dropped and were trading at $58 a barrel on Monday. NOG head Karl Eirik Schjoett-Pedersen said the price fall was not expected to have a major impact. “We think the projects are quite robust, because the companies have been focused to make them economic at even lower oil prices,” he said. Norway’s Equinor said its new projects had an average break-even price of $21 a barrel, while Aker BP said it would not invest in projects with break-even price higher than $30 a barrel. “I’m very concerned about the need to focus on the costs,” Schjoett-Pedersen said. NOG said exploration spending was expected to rise to 30 billion crowns in 2019 from 26 billion in 2018, although the number of wells being drilled was not expected to change from last year’s 56. $1 = 8.3304 Norwegian crowns

Average world surface air temperatures were 14.7 Celsius (58.5 Fahrenheit) in 2018, 0.2C less than 2016 which was the hottest year on record, it said in the first global assessment of temperatures based on full-year data. The year 2016 was boosted by an El Nino event that warmed the surface of the Pacific Ocean. “In 2018, we have again seen a very warm year, the fourth warmest on record,” Jean-Noël Thépaut, head of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement. “Dramatic climatic events like the warm and dry summer in large parts of Europe or the increasing temperature around the Arctic regions are alarming signs to all of us,” he added. The years 2017 and 2015 were also fractionally warmer than 2018 in records dating back to the 19th century, Copernicus said. Almost 200 nations agreed to a “rule book” to govern the Paris climate agreement in talks in Poland last month, even though critics said it was insufficient to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. The 2015 Paris accord seeks to end the fossil fuel era this century by shifting to cleaner energies such as wind and solar power. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out and instead promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry. The Copernicus report confirms projections by the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in November that 2018 would be fourth warmest, after a cool start to the year.

2019-01-07,"DUBAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - A close aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday U.S. officials had approached him during a visit he made last month to Afghanistan to request talks with Tehran, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Tensions between arch foes, Iran and the United States, have increased since last May, when President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers, and then reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic that had been lifted under the terms of the pact. “During my visit to Kabul last month, the Americans... asked to hold talks,” the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, was quoted as saying, without specifying what the U.S. side wanted to discuss. U.S. officials were not immediately available to comment on the report. In 2001, Iran worked with the United States to help set up a new Afghan government to replace the Taliban, which had been toppled by a U.S.-led military campaign following al Qaeda’s September 11 attacks on U.S. cities. Shamkhani was in Kabul last month for talks with the Taliban “to help curb the security problems in Afghanistan”. He said the Kabul government had known of his talks with the Taliban. Majority-Shi’ite Iran has long had close ties to Shi’ites in neighbouring Afghanistan whose militias have fought the Taliban’s Sunni militants. Washington accuses Iran of trying to extend its influence in western Afghanistan by providing military training, financing and weapons to the Taliban, a charge Tehran denies. Shamkhani’s comments came days after reports of talks between U.S. and Taliban officials over proposals for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and a future withdrawal of foreign troops ahead of possible peace negotiations. Khamenei slapped down an offer of direct talks made by Trump last year and Iranian officials have said Washington’s crippling sanctions would fail to wreck the economy. In July, Iranian authorities said Tehran had rejected eight U.S. requests for a meeting between Trump and President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in Sept 2017. “America’s fantasy and hostile measures have led nowhere, in spite of all their vengeful efforts towards the Iranian people, and will certainly not in the future,” Iranian state TV quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi as saying on Monday. “Our nation will never yield to the cruel pressures of the United States. We will never bend to those who talk the language of sanctions and build walls instead of bridges.” (Writing by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Gareth Jones)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-usa-afghanistan/khamenei-aide-says-us-approached-him-in-kabul-seeking-talks-with-iran-idUKL8N1Z720N,07 Jan 2019,"A close aide to Iran's Supreme

2019-01-07,"(Repeats Sunday story with no changes to text) By Fernando Carranza Garcia and Anthony Esposito GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Jan 6 (Reuters) - An offensive by Mexico’s new government against fuel theft at one of the country’s main refineries has led to days of shortages at gas stations in several central states, as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines. A Reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco state were closed on Sunday, including those operated by state oil firm Pemex, Spain’s Repsol and BP. There were long lines of motorists at those that were operating. “I’ve gone to 10 gas stations and nothing, there’s none at any of them,” said Alan Delgado, trying to fill his Buick truck at a BP gas station in Guadalajara. “This is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and businesses.” The shortages followed the closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, and as Pemex started using more tankers to transport fuel. Theft by gangs and oil industry workers from Mexico’s state-controlled refineries is a major drain on government resources, but the measures taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortages drag on. Violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income, bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, confirmed on Friday that less fuel was being sent through pipelines. “I ask citizens for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,” Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. Obrador has vowed to tackle theft “outside and inside” Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos, which estimates that fuel worth more than 146 billion pesos ($7.40 billion) has been stolen since 2016 alone. The president said last month that Mexico’s armed forces would take part in security at Pemex installations around the country, including its refinery in Salamanca. Fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence, according to Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue. The Mexican Association of Gasoline Station business owners warned its members on Jan. 3 that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the Salamanca refinery. “You are free to take measures that benefit your customers, to limit the sale (of fuel) to 10 liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public,” the association said. Guanajuato governor Sinhue took to Twitter on Sunday, saying that Pemex’s chief executive Octavio Romero “confirmed that after reopening the Salamanca-Leon pipeline, he expects to reestablish service to 100 percent of the gasoline stations during the day.” It was not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortages in other regions. Pemex said on Saturday that it is “preferring the use of safer means of transport, which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations,” leading to delays in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro. Pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to 20 percent, transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains. A May 2017 study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86 miles) along Pemex’s approximately 14,000 km pipeline network. The government has not made clear if they see road and rail transport as a long term solution for fuel distribution. Transporting fuel by road and rail is 12 to 16 times more expensive than by pipeline, said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. “If this keeps happening and expanding to other parts of the country, the Mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter,” said Monroy.

2019-01-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are cautious on the outlook for oil prices, despite a slump at the end of last year, as fears about the global economy outweigh output cuts by OPEC and its allies. Fund managers cut bullish positions in Brent crude futures and options by 10 million barrels in the week to Dec. 31, exchange data published on Friday showed. Funds have cut their net long position in Brent to just 152 million barrels, down from almost 500 million at the end of September, and close to the lowest level since 2015. Portfolio managers’ bullish long positions outnumbered bearish short ones by a margin of just 2.5 to 1, down from a ratio of more than 19 to 1 at the end of September. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2SFtSlv) There are some signs the heavy liquidation of bullish positions between the start of October and early December has run its course, with Brent prices seeming to find a floor above $50 per barrel. But most fund managers have preferred to wait before taking new long positions until the outlook for the global economy and equity prices becomes clearer. Portfolio managers were even more bearish towards middle distillates such as diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, cutting their net long position in European gasoil by 9 million barrels. Net length in ICE gasoil was cut to just 2 million barrels, down from a recent high of 112 million barrels in early October. The ratio of long to short positions was cut to just 1:1, down from a peak of more than 30:1 less than three months ago, and the lowest for more than two years. Middle distillate consumption is heavily geared to freight transportation by ship, road, rail and aircraft, as well as manufacturing, mining and the farm sector. Distillates tend to be in short supply towards the end of the economic and oil price cycles as industrial activity heads towards a peak, helping put upward pressure on crude prices. Until recently, fears of cyclical shortages were exacerbated by the scheduled introduction of new regulations on shipping fuels, which are likely to boost distillate consumption from the start of 2020. But the loss of momentum in global trade growth since the middle of 2018, coupled with fears about a further slowdown or even recession in 2019, has transformed investor sentiment. Fears about a future shortage have been replaced by concern about a potential slowdown in consumption, compounding the downward pressure on petroleum prices. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

The resumption of talks between the United States and China on tariffs also helped bring back some optimism to a market battered in recent weeks by trade tensions and a weakening global growth outlook. European shares held on to Friday’s strong gains after a stellar opening for Asian bourses, pushing MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, to its highest level in 2-1/2 weeks. It is now 6 percent higher than its December trough. “It is a reminder that central banks still have some firepower to deal with lower growth prospects, and perhaps what we are also getting some return of liquidity as investors return from the holidays and the ability to think things through,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. He warned, however, that there is continued uncertainty about global growth, trade talks between the United States and China and U.S. monetary policy. “There are a number of questions that remain unanswered,” Shaw said. On Friday, U.S. non-farm payrolls data showed the world’s largest economy added 312,000 net new jobs in December, while wages rose at a brisk annual pace of 3.2 percent, both way above expectations. This, along with a 100 basis point cut in China’s bank reserve requirement ratios and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the U.S. central bank would be flexible in its approach in 2019, has been the main driver for the recovery. The boost to stock markets saw them recapture all the year’s losses and push into positive territory for 2019 so far, with Wall St’s main indices closing up more than 3 percent by the close on Friday. After gains of more than 2 percent in Shanghai and HK on Friday before the U.S. jobs data and Powell’s comments, both markets added almost 1 percent more on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei reversed Friday’s plunge to gain 2.4 percent. European stocks were more or less flat across the board, though mining stocks surged 1.1 percent after the reserve requirement ratio cut from China boosted metals prices, especially steel and iron ore. This renewed optimism saw U.S. Treasury yields rise off recent lows, and two-year yields move back above the federal funds rate to 2.485 percent. That is nearly 50 bps below the November peak, however, suggesting there is still plenty of nervousness around growth prospects for the U.S. economy. “Clearly markets are now pricing in the risk of a cut in 2019,” said Shaw of Investec. “That’s a big shift given until relatively recently when we’ve been focusing on rate hikes.” Some of the stocks recovery may be attributed to investors buying stocks once again in the belief that the market had bottomed out or had overshot in pricing in global risks. In any case, Friday was a strong session for Wall Street, with the Dow recording gains of 3.29 percent, while the S&P 500 jumped 3.43 percent and the Nasdaq 4.26 percent. Goldman Sachs researchers expect a bounce in equity markets in 2019. “If, as we expect, global economies slow down in 2019 but avoid recession, and U.S. interest rates peak, there is likely to be a risk rally,” they said in a note. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that with 2,055 of 2,767 U.S. and global companies in a bear market, it might be time to buy. “Our Bull & Bear Indicator has fallen to an ‘extreme bear’ reading, triggering the first ‘buy’ signal for risk assets since June 2016,” they wrote in a note. The U.S. dollar — which served as a safe haven in 2018 — fell broadly, with the euro edging up to $1.1442 and the dollar index easing 0.3 percent to 95.90. The currency could not even hold early gains on the yen, lapsing back to 108.21. Gold benefited from the diminished risk of U.S. rate hikes and rose half a percent to $1,291.12, just off a six-month high. Oil prices firmed after Brent bounced about 9.3 percent last week. The crude benchmark rose 118 cents on Monday to $58.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 93 cents to $48.89.

2019-01-07,"(Reuters) - Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR.L) said it expects to report a non-cash write down of $300 million in its full-year results after being denied the extension of a block license which houses a liquid natural gas project in Equatorial Guinea. The company, which is in talks to be acquired by Medco Energi Internasional Tbk PT (MEDC.JK), holds an 80 percent interest in the block which contains the Fortuna gas discovery. Ophir said that Medco knew it was possible that it would not get the license extension for the block and that deal talks with the Indonesian company were continuing. Equatorial Guinea’s Energy Minister Gabriel Obiang Lima had told Reuters in May last year that Ophir would be forced out of the project unless loan deals were presented to the government by December, adding that the country had already lined up a potential replacement. Block R, which contains the Fortuna gas project, is located in offshore Equatorial Guinea. Five out of six discoveries in the block were made by Ophir, the company said. Ophir, which has plans to shift its headquarters from London to Asia, has been trying to secure $1.2 billion in bank loans to fund the Fortuna LNG project. Analysts expect that the Medco deal to buy Ophir, if completed, would boost the Indonesia-based company’s valuations and help it gain access to international assets.

2019-01-07,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil is starting to trickle back to China with three cargoes slated to arrive next month, but volumes are still a long way off levels prior to the outbreak of trade hostilities between the world’s two largest economies. Vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv shows three tankers carrying 3.94 million barrels are en route from the United States to China and will arrive in February. This is up from zero cargoes slated to arrive in January, a mere one in December and zero in both November and October. Prior to the tit-for-tat tariffs being imposed from the middle of last year, crude oil was a success story in the U.S.-China trade relationship as Beijing bought increasing volumes of booming U.S. shale oil production. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States, representing about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. China’s imports of U.S. crude reached a record high of about 460,000 bpd in June, according to the Refinitiv data. (Graphic: China's imports of U.S. crude: tmsnrt.rs/2RBeVDA) It’s worth noting that China hasn’t imposed any tariff on U.S. crude imports, unlike coal and liquefied natural gas, which were included in Beijing’s retaliatory measures. What seems clear is that Chinese refiners decided to hold back on buying U.S. crude either because they were nudged in that direction by the government, or because they were concerned that a tariff would be imposed. Using crude oil for politics is certainly nothing new, so the resumption of trade between China and the United States may well depend on the status of talks between the administration of President Donald Trump and its counterpart in Beijing. However, if the U.S.-China crude trade was strictly about economics, it’s likely that U.S. crude prices will have to fall some more, especially relative to competing grades of West African crude. The bulk of the U.S. crude going to Asia is light and sweet, and therefore competes with grades like Nigeria’s Bonny Light and Angola’s Girassol. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures have dropped sharply since their peak in early October, the price of physical WTI delivered in Houston, as assessed by Argus Media, hasn’t fallen by as much. WTI Houston was at $53.88 a barrel on Jan. 4, while WTI futures were at $47.96, a discount of $5.92 a barrel. Six months ago, WTI Houston was at $75.79 a barrel and the futures were $74.13, showing that since then the investor market has become more bearish on U.S. crude prices than the physical market. Comparing WTI Houston to Girassol shows that the Angolan grade traded at a small premium on Jan. 4, closing at $56.24 a barrel to WTI Houston’s $53.38. The small price advantage for the physical WTI is not enough to overcome the higher cost of a longer voyage to Asia, meaning that U.S. crude is currently uncompetitive. This suggests that U.S. exporters will have to be prepared to offer deeper discounts if they wish to displace West African barrels from the Asian markets. A further complicating factor is the new output cuts announced by OPEC and its allies, chiefly Russia. It’s likely that much of the oil affected by the production restrictions will be medium to heavy grades, given that the bulk of the cutting will be done by Saudi Arabia and Russia. This is likely to tighten the market for heavier grades, which are not readily replaced by light crudes, such as WTI, even if there are plentiful supplies of the light crudes. This means that even if the United States is increasing its output, there may not be enough demand for light crudes to soak up the extra supply.

Chinese stocks firmed after the country’s central bank announced an easing in policy on Friday, with 100 basis points of cuts to bank reserve requirements freeing up around $116 billion for new lending. “This year we might reasonably expect to see as many as four 100 basis point (reserve requirement ratio) cuts and, in the absence of capital outflow pressures on the currency, quite possibly cuts to the benchmark one-year lending rate as well,” said National Australia Bank head of FX strategy Ray Attrill. Chinese officials also meet their U.S. counterparts for trade negotiations starting later Monday, the first face-to-face talks of the year.

Despite the strength, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sought to ease market concerns about the risk of a slowdown, saying the central bank would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. Markets had already gone much further to price in a major chance of a cut in rates this year, and some of that exuberance was tempered by Powell’s emphasis on the word “patient” in his speech on Friday. Yet, Fed fund futures still implied a rate of 2.33 percent by December, compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. Yields on two-year Treasuries rose to 2.49 percent, from a trough of 2.37 percent, but were still below those on one-year paper.

2019-01-07,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Air pollution in China’s heavy-industrial province of Henan worsened in December even as other regions improved, official data showed, with its cities hit by unfavorable weather and a struggle to find cleaner sources of economic growth. China is restricting industrial output, traffic and coal consumption in the smog-prone north for a second year in a bid to cut pollution during the winter heating period, when thousands of mainly coal-burning boilers are switched on. But nine cities in Henan, home to around 95 million people, still recorded a rise in small, lung-damaging emissions known as PM2.5 to an average of 82 micrograms per cubic meter in the last month of 2018, up 12 percent from a year earlier.  Emissions in the cities - which include several big steel, aluminum and coal producing districts - had already soared by 107 percent from a year earlier in November, according to a Reuters analysis of official data.         As many as 79 cities throughout the north and east have drawn up plans to control smog this winter, with many committed to cutting PM2.5 emissions by 3 percent from last year.     For these cities, average PM2.5 levels fell 18 percent in December from a year earlier to 66 micrograms per cubic meter, according to Reuters calculations, although still nearly double China’s national standard of 35 micrograms. But the local increases in Henan and elsewhere show how much cities are at the mercy of the weather, with conditions such as high humidity and low wind exacerbating smog. “My analysis indicates that (the rises in Henan) are accounted for by the weather,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, energy analyst with Greenpeace. Henan’s smog concentrations have worsened since the end of last year, with the local government saying on Saturday that 12 provincial cities have issued “red alerts” for the coming week.  Some 28 cities in the major pollution control zone around China’s capital Beijing are also struggling to meet winter air quality targets, with average PM2.5 in the last two months of 2018 up 17 percent compared with a year earlier.  The zone includes the country’s top steel producing province of Hebei, where average emissions rose 11 percent in the last two months of 2018. Hebei has promised to cut PM2.5 by 5 percent this year compared to 2018, the official Hebei Daily reported on Monday, citing the local environmental bureau.      It vowed to cut another 14 million tonnes of steel smelting capacity and 9 million tonnes of coal production, after shutting 12.3 million tonnes and 13 million tonnes respectively in 2018. The province said last week it had cut PM2.5 by 12.5 percent to an average of 56 micrograms over the whole of 2018, beating its target.

2019-01-07,"* U.S.-China trade talks start on Monday * OPEC-led supply cuts began in December By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices started the week strongly on Monday, lifted by optimism that talks would soon resolve the trade war between the United States and China, while supply cuts by major producers also supported the market. International Brent crude futures were at $57.75 per barrel at 0040 GMT, up 69 cents, or 1.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $48.60 per barrel, up 64 cents, or 1.3 percent. Financial markets were being lifted early on Monday on expectations that face-to-face trade negotiations between delegates from Washington and Beijing, due to start on Monday, would lead to an easing in tensions between the two biggest economies in the world. More fundamentally for oil markets, traders said crude future prices were being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC Russia. But not all factors are pointing to higher prices. In the United States, crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA stayed at a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the last week of 2018, according to weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released on Friday. That makes the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Record output is also swelling U.S. fuel stockpiles. Crude oil inventories C-STK-T-EIA rose by 7,000 barrels in the week ending Dec. 28, to 441.42 million barrels. Distillate and gasoline stocks, however, rose by a whopping 9.5 million and 6.9 million barrels, to 119.9 million and 240 million barrels respectively, the EIA data showed. “The U.S. supply glut remains a bearish concern,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.
