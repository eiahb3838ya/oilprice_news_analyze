2018-03-13,"(Adds details of earnings) SAO PAULO, March 13 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras Distribuidora SA beat fourth-quarter profit estimates on Tuesday, as the fuel distribution unit of state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA defended strong profit margins despite slipping market share. BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, posted net income of 531 million reais ($163 million), well above a consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters of 294 million reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, (EBITDA), totaled 980 million reais, above a consensus estimate of 890 million reais. In its first earnings report since a December initial public offering, the company said its 2017 revenue slipped 5.7 percent from a year earlier to 43.27 billion reais. Petrobras raked in north of 5 billion reais late last year when it floated a 30 percent stake in the unit as part of a bid to reduce the heftiest debt load among oil majors worldwide. In a management statement, BR said revenue fell due to the strategy of preserving its profit margin regardless of its market share. Petrobras has lost market share in gasoline and diesel sales to rivals following a shift in 2016 to a policy of following international prices. The move allowed Petrobras, with nearly 100 percent of Brazil’s refining capacity, to boost profits even as it started to lose sales to rivals like Raizen and Ipiranga. Though it has tweaked the policy, data in December showed Brazil imported more refined oil products in 2017 than in any year since records began in 2000, suggesting it has continued to lose ground to rivals. $1 = 3.26 reais

The debt, issued in 2013, will be paid to investors on April 13, Ecopetrol said in a statement. Payment was originally scheduled for September. “It is expected the cash position of the company will continue at high levels of solidity, allowing it to confront volatility in crude prices, keep up investment in organic growth and have the possibility of potential inorganic growth opportunities for reserves acquisitions,” the statement said.

2018-03-13,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to fire his secretary of veterans affairs and replace him with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, a New York Times report said on Tuesday, citing two sources close to the White House. David Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary, has been investigated by his department’s inspector general, which last month said he improperly accepted tickets to the Wimbledon tennis tournament last summer during a government trip to Europe. If Shulkin is fired it would be the latest major shakeup in the Trump administration. Early on Tuesday, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after a series of rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran. Perry had lunch with Trump at the White House on Monday. Department of Energy spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said she would not comment on what the two talked about. The energy department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, nor did the White House. Trump did not make a formal offer to Perry when the two men met on Monday, the report said. Perry was an Air Force pilot before becoming the longest serving governor of Texas. Shortly after becoming president last year Trump had considered Perry for the veterans affairs secretary job. The VA inspector general had opened an investigation into leadership at the department after receiving an anonymous complaint accusing Shulkin of misusing travel funds because the trip to Europe, which cost at least $122,344, was more personal than business.

2018-03-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors chairman and chief executive Mary Barra met on Tuesday with U.S. regulatory chiefs, weeks before the Trump administration plans to decide whether to revise landmark fuel efficiency standards through 2025. After Reuters learned of the meetings, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey confirmed Barra had met the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department. At the meeting, the GM CEO “reconfirmed our priorities for modernizing fuel economy standards, which is the need for one national set of requirements and the need to comprehend new technology developments like increased shared and autonomous electric vehicles,” Morrissey said. Automakers are pressing the administration to reach agreement with California to maintain a nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered but is willing to discuss modifications if warranted. “Absent any such evidence, we will certainly resist any changes,” Nichols said. Car companies hope to avoid a potential legal battle between federal regulators, many state attorneys general and environmental groups that could leave them in limbo about future rules. The manufacturers also want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. Industry executives have not publicly asked for specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011, that aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. Auto officials say the Trump administration is considering proposing a significant reduction in the requirements. Any changed regulation will not be finalized until next year. California’s emissions rules are followed by a dozen states including New York and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia that account for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle sales.  Other automakers also have been holding meetings with regulators in recent weeks as have environmental groups as others. A meeting is planned this week between EPA officials and Ford Motor Co’s top environment and safety officer, officials said. The EPA is expected to announce by April the existing 2022-2025 requirements are “not appropriate,” but it is unclear precisely when EPA and the Transportation Department will unveil proposed reductions in the requirements. Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing reductions in the requirements or new flexibilities for automakers remained in flux. EPA officials suggested a proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier unveiling of a proposal, automakers say. In June, New York state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules. The Obama administration sought to “lock in” the rules by announcing in January 2017 the completion of a “midterm review” to determine the feasibility of the 2022-2025 model year rules ahead of an April 1, 2018 deadline. In March 2017, Trump announced he would reopen that review and suggested he would soften the mandates. “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” he told autoworkers in Michigan.

2018-03-13,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - German energy groups E.ON and RWE on Tuesday fleshed out their plans to break up RWE’s Innogy business, predicting higher profits and dividends as a result of a more focused corporate structure. E.ON forecast annual operating profit to rise by an average 3 to 4 percent over the next three years, while RWE flagged a bigger than expected dividend for 2019, driving shares in E.ON to the top of Germany’s blue-chip index. The two companies announced plans to carve up networks, renewables and retail energy firm Innogy, in which RWE holds a 76.8 percent stake, and divide its assets between them in a reshaping of Germany’s power sector. The deal will turn RWE, one of Europe’s largest carbon dioxide emitters, into Europe’s third largest renewables player after Spain’s Iberdrola and Italy’s Enel, with an 8 gigawatt clean power generation portfolio. At the same time it will create Europe’s largest networks and energy retail group under E.ON’s umbrella, with about 50 million energy and gas clients and a regulated assets base, a key gauge of grid value, of 37 billion euros (£32.8 billion). Germany’s shift to solar and wind power after Japan’s Fukushima disaster seven years ago triggered a phase-out of nuclear power, turning the coal and nuclear based business model of the country’s utilities on its head. “This is a transaction that only knows winners,” RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz told reporters on Tuesday, also citing a 5.2 billion euro bid E.ON will launch for Innogy’s minority shareholders in the second quarter. “Critical mass is the key to success in the field of renewables energy. Before this transaction, neither Innogy nor E.ON were in such a position.” But there will be a toll in terms of lost jobs. The deal, expected to close late in 2019, will result in as many as 5,000 job cuts as the future E.ON group targets 600-800 million euros in synergies. E.ON boss Johannes Teyssen said he was hopeful the reductions could be done without forced layoffs. “The announced job cuts ... must be cushioned, with no compulsory redundancies,” said Andreas Scheidt, a member of labour union Verdi’s board. Scheidt is also deputy chairman of E.ON’s supervisory board. In an internal letter to staff seen by Reuters, Innogy’s management board urged employees to remain confident in light of the uncertainty and said Innogy was not the losing party in the three-way transaction. “There are still many open questions. It’ll be our job to ask for answers in the next days, weeks and months,” the board said in the letter. Innogy, in an official statement late on Tuesday, said its board would review E.ON’s offer and respond to it at the appropriate time, strongly urging shareholders to take no action and not sell their shares in the meantime. Shares in E.ON closed more 3.9 percent higher, while Innogy’s edged up 0.5 percent. RWE ended the day 2.9 percent lower, having posted bigger gains than E.ON on Monday. “The market is pricing in the Innogy deal which results in much more focused business models,” a Frankfurt-based trader said. Under the proposed deal E.ON will focus on Innogy’s gas and power networks, raising its share of profits from regulated assets to about 80 percent from 65 percent. RWE carved out and listed Innogy in 2016, hoping to extract more value from its networks and renewables assets, the most promising areas of the crisis-ridden utility sector. It has since tried to find a buyer for its stake. RWE said its ordinary dividend was expected to rise to 0.70 euros per share in 2018, up from 0.50 euros in 2017, with a further increase planned in 2019. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to remain flat. E.ON, which also said its dividend would rise in 2018 as it released strong results on Monday, will keep some renewables assets in the Innogy deal, notably its 1.3 billion pound ($1.8 billion) Rampion wind park off southern Britain.

2018-03-13,"HAMILTON, Ontario (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal Dofasco’s  chief executive said on Tuesday the company was not seeking Canadian government aid as the domestic steel industry faces uncertainty after U.S. President Donald Trump provided temporary tariff relief on steel imports. Sean Donnelly, who heads Canada’s largest steel manufacturer, added that the government must put resources in place to ensure cheap steel is not diverted to Canada after Trump decided last week to impose a 25 percent tariffs on steel imports.   Asked if his company would seek government aid, Donnelly replied: “No.” Canada is the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States but the steel sector accounted for only 22,000 direct jobs and represented 2 percent of exports last year. Donnelly spoke to Reuters as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the steel city of Hamilton to reassure workers and meet with company CEOs, as part of his week-long tour to defend Canadian jobs. On Monday, Trudeau called Trump to stress the need to preserve cross-border supply chains.   Behind closed doors, Trudeau and industry representatives spoke about the issue of cheap steel entering Canada, but did not get into specifics, Canadian Steel Producers Association  (CSPA) President Joseph Galimberti said. Speaking to reporters, Trudeau said he was aware of concerns that countries now faced with tariffs could try to get their steel to the North American market through Canada and the government was working with the industry and United States to prevent that. “That is a concern that we share with the Americans and we’re going to keep ensuring that Canadian steel is Canadian steel,” Trudeau said before shaking hands and taking selfies with the assembled steelworkers. Galimberti said the meeting with Trudeau was an “important affirmation” that the government’s months-long involvement in the issue would continue.  Trump has linked permanent exemption to the successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, making the industry nervous.  The North American industry is heavily integrated, with raw materials, steel and parts crossing the U.S.-Canadian border several times before a finished product such as a vehicle is sold to consumers. About 65 percent of the Hamilton port’s tonnage is iron ore and coal used to make steel. Hamilton, about 75 km (47 miles) southwest of Toronto, has a population of 700,000 and houses Dofasco’s mill, coking and finishing operations at Stelco and a collection of smaller operations that directly employ about 10,000 people in the city.

2018-03-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and European stock indexes closed down on Tuesday, pressured by losses in technology stocks and U.S. President Donald Trump’s ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Sagging equities, in turn, weighed on the dollar and crude oil prices. The possibility of additional tariffs on China, which made news late in the day, may have also dragged stocks down across sectors. “Technology rallied hard yesterday and last week, and there is profit-taking, but it’s just a short-term pressure,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. Falling stock prices pressured oil futures, which fell as much as 1.8 percent before regaining some ground. Oil lately has trended in tandem with equities and remains under pressure from nagging concerns over rising U.S. production. Trump gave Tillerson the boot after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, and replaced his chief diplomat with Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo. The move contributed to a volatile morning across asset classes, but markets began trending decidedly in the red by the afternoon. U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.83 percent to $60.85 per barrel. Brent LCOcv1 was last at $64.69, down 0.4 percent on the day. Energy investors initially saw Tillerson’s firing as a sign that a deal on Iran’s nuclear program could collapse, potentially cutting that country’s oil output. This view supported prices for awhile but could not overcome lingering fears about rising U.S. production. “There’s no stopping us and OPEC’s frustration levels are going to grow,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, referring to efforts by major producers to curb output.  U.S. crude output has reached a record, and weekly data last week showed overall U.S. output rising further.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 171.58 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,007.03, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 17.71 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,765.31 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 77.31 points, or 1.02 percent, to 7,511.01. Stocks slid as shares of Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet were down more than 1.5 percent each, top losers on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.   Equity markets had opened higher after the U.S. Labor Department announced its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in February. The data, in line with economists’ expectations, suggested the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates at a gradual pace.  But “there’s a lot of noise coming out of Washington over all these changes that’s causing the markets to really not focus,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. Potentially compounding the strain were revelations that Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors. “I don’t think China wants to engage in a tariff war, however, this may be upsetting the apple cart,” said Bryan Novak, senior managing director at Astor Investment Management in Chicago. “There could be some anxiety around it. It’s really hard to place value on this right now.” European stocks closed down across the board. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.00 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.38 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.13 percent.   The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.2 percent, with the euro EUR= unchanged at $1.2389.

2018-03-13,"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to grant a bankrupt Philadelphia refiner relief from biofuel laws drew criticism on Tuesday from the country’s biofuels sector and its allies, who said it sets a bad precedent. The EPA and the Carlyle Group-backed Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery agreed on Monday that the refiner will have to satisfy only roughly half of its $350 million in outstanding compliance obligations under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel or buy credits, known as RINs, from those that do. Independent refiners, including some as large as Valero Energy Corp, have long complained about the RFS standards, saying it has boosted costs as the price of credits rose from just a few cents in 2012 to more than $1 at times in 2013 and 2016. However, biofuels companies say the standards are critical to Midwest farmers and help produce cleaner, home-grown fuels like ethanol. Industry representatives complained about the EPA settlement, calling it a bailout for a mismanaged company. “I am very troubled at the precedent this sets and there are discussions underway whether the EPA has the legal standing to grant the relief. We are exploring our options,” said Michael McAdams, head of the Advanced Biofuels Association. President Donald Trump has called several White House meetings to change the program. The EPA has signaled it is willing to exempt more small refineries, which would limit potential buyers for the credits. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said the settlement raises a couple questions: “How are the RIN obligations being treated compared to the other obligations of PES? Does this set an unfair precedent for other refiners that continue to act in good faith to comply with the law?” PES was given relief on about half of its outstanding obligations. The company, which lacks blending facilities, entered into bankruptcy owing 467 million credits from 2016 and 2017, with only 210 million credits in hand, the filing showed. The settlement puts PES on stable path to success and protects 1,100 jobs, Cherice Corley, a company spokeswoman, said in an email Tuesday. But more needs to be done, Corley said. “This is only a partial and temporary reprieve, and we are hopeful that policymakers will substantively address the flawed RINs compliance mechanism so that a restructured PES and other independent merchant refiners can finally compete on a level playing field,” Corely said. PES got a huge win. It does not have to go into the market and buy some 250 million in compliance credits covering 2016, 2017 and part of 2018. The refiner can turn over its available credits to the EPA, and is excused from any shortfall.  “There’s no denying it - the EPA settled in a way that was beneficial to the bankruptcy and this particular firm. It sends a bad signal about what the EPA will accept in the future,” said Scott Irwin, agricultural economist at the University of Illinois. PES blamed its financial woes on the cost of buying the credits.. But other factors contributed to the bankruptcy, including withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. Private equity firm Carlyle rescued the refinery from shutting in 2012, putting up $175 million for majority control. Most dividends paid to the investor group were backed by loans taken against refinery assets. Monday’s settlement alleviates fears that the refinery was going to be exempt from the program moving forward or be allowed to dump millions of credits onto the market, traders said. The EPA will now require PES to buy credits semi-annually, rather than annually. That makes it more difficult for the refinery, the largest on the U.S. East Coast, to build a large short position or defer its obligations and risk getting into a hole, as it did in 2017. Prices for renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2018 were at 39 cents on Tuesday, little changed from a day earlier, having already lost 40 percent in the last two weeks. Prices for 2017 are selling at an unusual discount versus the 2018 prices in the wake of the PES settlement, traders said.

2018-03-13,"(Adds reaction from U.S. Department of State in para 6) By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, March 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An environmental advocacy group sued the U.S. government on Tuesday for failing to release records that could show why it has not filed a report required under a global climate compact. The Paris accord obligates the United States to submit a report every two years detailing greenhouse gas emissions and steps taken to meet a goal to keep the global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Its latest report should have been filed by Jan. 1 with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - the Paris accord’s guardian - said the plaintiff, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an Arizona-based non-profit. “This is a critical report that the world needs,” Jean Su, the CBD’s attorney, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone, adding that the U.S. submitted its last biannual report on 31 Dec. 2015. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, said the U.S. Department of State had violated transparency and administrative laws due to its “failure ... to respond to the Center’s request for records”. The Department of State said through a spokeswoman that it “does not comment on matters under litigation”. It is the latest legal action taken by green advocates to combat efforts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to minimize its role in combating climate change and roll back environmental regulations. The suit follows a request by CBD in February for information under a U.S. transparency law about the report. Trump last year announced his plan to pull out of the landmark deal to fight global warming, which was reached in Paris in 2015 by nearly 200 nations. But the withdrawal process is expected to take at least three years, meaning the country remains party to the deal. In its complaint, the CBD said the United States had violated the Freedom of Information Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to take the required steps to share information on the report’s status. The lawsuit asked the court to order the Department of State to “conduct searches reasonably calculated to locate all records” related to the information request by the CBD, which claims 1.6 million members and supporters. Trump has previously said he thinks climate change is a hoax. Scientific consensus, however, holds that climate change is largely manmade, with such devastating effects as extreme weather, rising sea levels and more frequent, powerful storms.

2018-03-13,"QUITO, March 13 (Reuters) - Ecuador on Tuesday launched a bidding round for foreign companies to develop oil and gas reserves, hoping to attract some $800 million in investment to boost production in the Andean nation’s sluggish economy. Winners will operate four oil fields in Ecuador’s eastern Amazon region and one natural gas field in the gulf of Guayaquil under 10-year service contracts, officials said, adding that payments will be linked to global oil prices. The Cuyabeno-Sansahuari, Yuralpa, Oso and Blanca-Vinita fields produce 36,300 barrels per day (bpd). The government hopes to raise output by about 15,000 bpd. “Current (oil) prices allow us to increase activity in eastern Ecuador to boost employment, boost production and explore for new reserves,” Alex Galarraga, manager of state-run oil company Petroamazonas, said during the announcement of the tender. The Amistad natural gas field has production of 39 million cubic feet per day, which the company expects will rise by 11 million cubic feet per day. Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno has said the government plans to increase crude production by 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year by adding barrels from the Amazon area. Oil Minister Carlos Perez said Ecuador was producing below its quota allowed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), so it has room to raise output. The auction process is expected to be completed in June. Companies will be able to carry out drilling, well completion, reactivation of closed wells and construction of required facilities.

2018-03-13,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Oil major BP Plc expects more than 90 percent of the world’s shipping fleet will comply with new regulations slashing sulphur levels ships are allowed to burn starting 2020, a company executive said on Tuesday. Coming International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules will cut the amount of sulphur emissions that ships worldwide are allowed from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent by 2020. “Potential non-compliance is a significant issue that the market has been contending with,” Jason Breslaw, who leads BP’s  distillate trading origination across the Americas, said at an industry conference in New Orleans. Breslaw said BP expects only about 9 percent of the industry is likely to be non-compliant as the rule takes effect. The compliance level has significant implications for demand for high-sulphur fuel oil; BP’s estimates fall well short of other analyst estimates of about 30 percent non-compliance.  The IMO has said there would be no delays or exceptions to the coming rules, whether or not the industry takes the steps it needs to comply, and warned that all parties face consequences if they do not play their part.    Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates about 30 percent non-compliance, said Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oil markets. “At the moment nobody is really doing anything ... with a number of the shippers playing chicken with the regulator, does the regulator blink? We don’t know,” Gelder told Reuters. One way ships can comply with coming standards is to retrofit vessels with costly scrubbers, which can reduce sulphur emissions even if ships continue to burn dirty fuel.  But there are significant concerns with this process as well, industry participants said. The cost of installing scrubbers is about $3 million to $10 million, said Anil Rajguru, vice president of process safety at Fluor Corp. “Right now less than 500 ships have scrubbers. We’re talking more like 50,000 and it could take more than a decade before scrubbers are fitted on (all) the vessels,” Rajguru said.

2018-03-13,"* Oil, U.S. stocks fall in afternoon after choppy morning * Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft are biggest losers * Trump ousts Secretary of State Tillerson * U.S. CPI data meets forecasts By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. and European stock indexes slid on Tuesday as investors reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump’s ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, with the dollar and crude oil prices following suit. Losses in technology stocks drove dips in the U.S. equity market, while oil prices - which lately have trended in tandem with equities - fell by as much as 1.8 percent before regaining some ground, hurt by concerns over rising U.S. production. Trump gave Tillerson the boot on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, and replaced his chief diplomat with loyalist Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo. The move had contributed to a volatile morning across asset classes, but markets were trending decidedly in the red by the afternoon. U.S. crude fell 1.35 percent to $60.53 per barrel and Brent was last at $64.40, down 0.85 percent on the day. Investors initially saw Tillerson’s firing as a sign that a deal on Iran’s nuclear program could collapse, potentially cutting Iran’s oil output, which supported prices. Fears about rising U.S. production were of more concern later in the day. “There’s no stopping us and OPEC’s frustration levels are going to grow,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, referring to efforts by major producers to curb output since last year. U.S. production has reached a record, and weekly data last week showed overall U.S. output rising further, to more than 10.3 million barrels per day. Wall Street dipped in the afternoon after seesawing through the morning. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 178.64 points, or 0.71 percent, to 24,999.97, the S&P 500 lost 19.81 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,763.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 82.96 points, or 1.09 percent, to 7,505.36. The slide was driven by big losses in the tech industry, with shares of Microsoft, Facebook and Alphabet down more than 1 percent, top losers on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Equity markets had opened higher after the U.S. Labor Department announced its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in February, in line with economists’ expectations - data that suggested the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates at a gradual pace this year. But “there’s a lot of noise coming out of Washington over all these changes that’s causing the markets to really not focus,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. European stocks closed down across the board. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.00 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.45 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.03 percent. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.2 percent, with the euro up 0.48 percent to $1.2391. In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.8389 percent, from 2.87 percent late on Monday. Additional reporting by Ayenat Mersie, Sruthi Shankar and Kate

2018-03-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell more than 1 percent on concerns over rising U.S. production and as equities fell, erasing earlier gains driven in part by the firing of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Brent crude futures LCOc1 dropped 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $64.64 per barrel. U.S. West Texas (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell 65 cents, or 1.06 percent, to $60.71 per barrel. The market has been buffeted by a number of factors in an active session, including weakness in the equity market, which has trended in tandem with oil of late.  U.S. production has reached an all-time record and weekly data last week showed overall output rising further, to more than 10.3 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude production from major shale formations was expected to rise in April to a record 6.95 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday. “There’s no stopping us and OPEC’s frustration levels are going to grow,” said Philip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, referring to efforts by major producers to curb output since last year. Tillerson’s firing increases risks to the multilateral agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities, raising questions about potential effects on output by the third largest crude oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  CIA director Mike Pompeo is the pick to replace Tillerson; he has called for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to be scrapped. Trump has threatened to withdraw from the accord between Iran and six world powers unless Congress and European allies “fix” it with a follow-up pact. “The market is having a wobble on the back of the potential impact on future supply from Iran and also for the ramifications for the Middle East as a whole,” Ole Hansen, senior manager at Saxo Bank, said. Concerns about supply have had an effect in the forward curve in the futures market, where the May contract has outperformed April, putting May’s price higher than April’s, known as “contango.”  When the front-month contract is trading at a lower level than a later-dated contract, it suggests emerging concerns about growing supply, and reduced need to buy oil now.   “The market switched from backwardation to contango in the crude oil curve today... that’s a situation that implies weakness; it’s a situation that, if it persists, will lead to an increase in storage,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.      Data from the American Petroleum Institute will be released at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and is expected to show a build U.S. crude inventories for the third straight week.

2018-03-13,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several green groups criticized the Trump administration’s choice on Tuesday of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, saying his past skeptical comments about global warming show he is less suited to run U.S. foreign policy about climate change than the former Exxon Mobil CEO. Pompeo, who was a Republican congressman from Kansas prior to running the CIA under U.S. President Donald Trump, has been among the biggest critics of efforts to combat global warming by past U.S. administrations, and has questioned the validity of existing climate science - saying it needs to be developed further.  “In this position, (Pompeo) could prove to be dangerous to our national security and the safety of our planet,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Some climate advocates said, however, they hoped the long slate of issues facing the State Department now - from North Korea’s nuclear agenda to intensifying trade disputes - would keep climate change low on Pompeo’s list of priorities should he be confirmed by the Senate. “Right now, climate change is not going to be a top 10 issue for him,” said Andrew Light, a former adviser to Todd Stern, the U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change under Obama.  Pompeo is also a top recipient of campaign donations from Koch Industries, having taken over $375,500 from the family-owned energy conglomerate for campaigns going back to 2010, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a transparency watchdog. Koch Industries has donated millions of dollars to efforts opposing climate change regulation. His background upsets many environmentalists, but dovetails neatly with Trump’s energy agenda to roll back Obama-era climate regulations and support domestic production of coal and crude oil - the fossil fuels that scientists blame for global warming. Trump has repeatedly bashed international efforts to combat climate change, and has at times called global warming a hoax. Tillerson had also faced stern opposition from environmentalists when he was nominated as Secretary of State, given his years at the helm of one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, but he had tried to be a moderating influence on Trump over climate policy during his tenure.  For example, Tillerson advocated continued U.S. cooperation regarding the Paris Climate Agreement, a global deal to fight warming, a battle he lost when Trump announced in June the U.S. intention to withdraw. The State Department has since continued to send delegations to international climate summits, where envoys have been perceived by their foreign counterparts as constructive. “We’ve gone from Exxon’s CEO to the Koch Brothers’ most loyal lapdog,” said May Boeve, executive director for climate activist group 350.org. Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch own Koch Industries. Environmental groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club issued similar statements, calling the nomination a potential step backwards.  Koch Industries did not immediately comment, and efforts to reach Pompeo were not successful. Officials at the White House and the State Department did not immediately comment on whether Pompeo would be expected to update U.S. climate change policy.  “Tillerson was basically hands-off on the issue (of climate change),” said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It is not clear it is going to be any more of a priority for Pompeo.”   Reporting by Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner in Washington, additional reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles, writing by Richard Valdmanis; Editing by Phil Berlowitz",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-climate/greens-fear-climate-backslide-with-pompeo-as-top-u-s-diplomat-idUKL8N1QV5WX,13 Mar 2018,"Several green groups

Donnelly also said the Canadian government must put resources in place to ensure that cheap steel is not diverted into Canada after Trump last week decided to impose a 25 percent tariffs on steel imports. While Canada and Mexico secured a temporary reprieve, Trump has linked permanent exemption to a successful North American Free Trade Agreement deal, making the industry nervous. Canada is the biggest supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States. But relative to bigger industries such as agriculture and auto manufacturing, the steel sector only employs 22,000 direct jobs and represented 2 percent of exports last year. ArcelorMittal is the largest steel manufacturer in Canada, employing about 10,300 people with seven units in the country, according to the Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA). “I think it’s just boots on the ground, boots on the ground both at the CBSA (Canada Border Services Agency) and in Global Affairs to make sure whatever remedies are put in place and that’s up to the government to come up with the remedies or tools ...that they have the resources to enforce,” Donnelly told Reuters. Donnelly was speaking as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited the steel city of Hamilton to reassure workers, as part of his week-long tour to defend Canadian jobs. On Monday, Trudeau called Trump to stress the need to preserve the “mutually beneficial” cross border supply chains. The North American steel industry is heavily integrated, with raw materials, steel and parts crossing the U.S.-Canadian border several times before a finished product such as a vehicle or refrigerator is sold to consumers. About 65 percent of the Hamilton port’s tonnage is iron ore and coal used to make steel. Hamilton, with a population of 700,000, houses Dofasco’s mill, coking and finishing operations at Stelco and collection of smaller operations that directly employ about 10,000 people in the city.

2018-03-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo American (AAL.L) on Tuesday announced new goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent, improve energy efficiency by 30 percent and cut freshwater withdrawal by 50 percent in arid regions, all by 2030. Previous 2020 goals included an energy savings target of 8 percent and a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent, while cutting freshwater withdrawal by 20 percent. The way the targets are calculated also changes as the previous energy and greenhouse gas goals were calculated versus business as usual, while the 2030 goals seek an improvement in energy efficiency per tonne of copper equivalent mined and an absolute cut in greenhouse gas emissions. Anglo refers to the new targets as “stretch goals” because of the challenge of meeting them and says they should give it a strategic advantage by cutting costs and making it easier to secure operating licences as environmental concerns mount. “The financial benefits to our business by 2030 are expected to be significant, including from substantially reduced energy and water costs,” CEO Mark Cutifani said as he announced the goals to investors in London. “If you don’t have the trust over all our communities, you just won’t get the access to the ground,” he added. All the major miners have released a series of sustainability reports and goals, but the industry is still associated with consumption of coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, and environmental damage. Anglo on Monday had to halt iron ore production in Brazil because of a leak and Cutifani said the cause was being investigated.    Cutifani said the miner had reduced its thermal coal business by more than 50 percent over five years, but added governments and communities still depended on the fuel. “How we transition has to be done in a responsible way,” he said.

2018-03-13,"(Adds German negotiator in Pristina) By Fatos Bytyci and Maja Zuvela PRISTINA/SARAJEVO, March 13 (Reuters) - Kosovo has found a short-term fix for a gap in Europe’s power grid which has slowed electric timers across much of the continent, but officials warned on Tuesday the problem may re-emerge unless a network row with Serbia is resolved for good. European grid lobby ENTSO-E said last week the continental European network had been short of 113 gigawatt-hours of energy because Kosovo had taken more power than it produced while Serbia, which is in charge of balancing Kosovo’s grid, had failed to fill the gap between mid-January and March 7. As a result, the European network’s frequency had deviated from its standard of 50 Hertz (Hz) to 49.996 Hz and some electric clocks, steered by the frequency of the power system rather than by a quartz crystal, have lost nearly six minutes. “We have already returned 20 percent of the missing energy and that energy will have to be compensated by the end of this month,” a senior Kosovo energy official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He said the government had allocated 1 million euros ($1.2 million) to buy electricity to compensate for the shortfall and avoid any similar problems in future. But ENTSO-E, the association of European grid operators, said the country of 1.8 million people might need between 4.5 million and 5.6 million euros to compensate for the shortfall. “If there is no more money then we will have the same situation again,” the Kosovo official warned. Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008. Belgrade, which still refuses to recognise Kosovo, committed to normalise relations with Pristina, key to its progress towards European Union membership. But little progress has been made. A spokeswoman for ENTSO-E said a deal must be reached and the energy put back into the system to restore the frequency. “The outstanding point, as to avoid any repetition, is that several legal energy issues between Kosovo and Serbia have to be set. The discussions are ongoing and involve us from a technical side, but also of course the European Commission,” Susanne Nies said. Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj met German mediator Klaus Toepfer on Tuesday to seek a solution to the energy dispute with Serbia. “The Kosovo government will try to resolve the energy problem because this is hampering the economic development of the country,” Haradinaj said in a statement after the meeting. Officials say the problem emerged after a Pristina court ruling in December to end a practice by which Kosovars living south of the River Ibar had been receiving higher bills to compensate for power consumption by Serbs in the north of the country, who do not recognise Kosovo institutions and refuse to pay the Kosovo grid operator. Following the court decision, Kosovo’s energy regulator ordered its grid operator KOSTT to trim the tariff by 44 percent. “KOSTT did not have the legal and financial ability to assume the obligation to further cover the losses for power supply to the northern part,” it told Reuters. Another senior energy official said. “We had two solutions: to cut the electricity to people, hospitals, water companies and trigger violent protests by Serbs, or sit down and watch. We decided to sit down and watch.” Official figures show the uncollected debt now amounts to over 140 million euros. Serbia’s grid operator, EMS, has obstructed KOSTT’s efforts to become a full-fledged ENTSO-E member though KOSTT says all requirements have been met. Both countries in 2015 signed an agreement on operating their grids, but it has never been enacted. The two sides have conflicting claims about ownership of the power grid in Kosovo, built when it was part of Serbia. KOSTT says the row cost it 9.6 million euros in 2017, as EMS continues to benefit from the allocation of capacity from Kosovo’s interconnectors with neighbouring countries. EMS declined to comment.

2018-03-13,"(Reuters) - Oil producers in United States have continued to add to their hedge positions for 2018, which has surpassed the historical averages due to an increase in oil futures prices, Goldman Sachs said in a note on Tuesday. The U.S. producers that Goldman tracks have increased their oil hedges for 2018 to 48 percent, according to the companies’ fourth quarter results. That is up from the 30 percent for third quarter, Goldman said.  Most U.S. exploration and production companies are hedged between $50-$60 per barrel for 2018, below Goldman’s $72.50 per barrel oil price forecast, it said. “We believe producers may continue to tactically add oil hedges at current futures to mitigate oil price volatility in 2018, and have seen producers begin to add 2019 hedges,” the investment bank said. Producers have hedged about 9 percent of next year’s oil production at an average price of about $58 a barrel, Goldman said. U.S. crude futures CLc1 have averaged near $63 per barrel so far this year. That compares with an annual average of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Natural gas hedging for 2018, meanwhile, was at 47 percent, slightly above the five-year seasonal average of 44 percent, Goldman said.

2018-03-13,"(Adds details, quotes) ABUJA, March 13 (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari sacked the head of an amnesty programme for former militants in the country’s oil and gas-producing heartland, amid allegations of graft. Funding of the former Niger Delta militants under the 2009 amnesty has been key to maintaining relative stability in the southern region and preventing attacks on energy facilities in Africa’s biggest oil producer. Crude oil sales make up two-thirds of government revenue. But attacks resumed in 2016, contributing to pushing Africa’s biggest economy into recession that year as oil production was cut from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd, Nigeria’s lowest level for at least 30 years. Announcing the dismissal of Paul Boroh, a retired senior army officer, Buhari ordered the country’s national security adviser to investigate the programme’s activities since 2015, “especially allegations of financial impropriety”. The announcement came in an emailed statement from the president’s spokesman, which gave no details of the allegations. The programme entitles each former militant to a monthly stipend and job training. Boroh is being replaced by Charles Quaker Dokubo, currently Director of Research and Studies at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, a think tank. Reporting by Felix Onuah;

2018-03-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares closed firmly in negative territory on Tuesday  as the euro rose against a faltering dollar after U.S. President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The pan-European STOXX 600  ended the session down 1 percent with Frankfurt's DAX .GDAXI and its German exporter constituents taking the worst hit, down 1.6 percent.  The euro zone currency, a rise in which typically hurts European blue-chip companies, climbed about 0.5 percent against the dollar on Tuesday.  “There is the Tillerson effect and there’s the euro-dollar effect,” said Oddo Securities trader Mikael Jacoby, noting that investors probably saw Tillerson’s removal as a good reason to take some profits after six trading days of gains.  The departure of Gary Cohn as President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser and worries about a possible global trade war had already sent jitters through global financial markets.  “What we are seeing here is that those people in the U.S. administration in the more moderate line of thinking are being ousted, so this adds to the concerns the more radical forces are gaining some ground,” said Rabobank’s head of macro strategy Elwin de Groot. The utilities sector retreated 0.25 percent retreat, with losses limited by demand for German utilities RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) as they plan to divide up the assets of power firm Innogy (IGY.DE).  E.ON (EONGn.DE) got a further boost and posted the second best-performance of the STOXX 600, up 3.9 percent after it said it would raise its dividends for 2018 and 2019. French telecoms company Iliad fell 9.9 percent after missing market forecasts due to losses related to its launch in Italy. Iliad’s rival Orange (ORAN.PA), the dominant French telecoms company, returned to growth last year for the first time since 2009 after spending heavily to roll out high-speed broadband.  Struggling South African retailer Steinhoff SRRJ.J saw its Germany-listed shares rise 2.1 percent after it cut its stake in KAP Industrial (KAPJ.J) as it tried to plug a liquidity gap. Veolia (VIE.PA) fell 2.4 percent, the top faller on France’s CAC 40, after the Qatari government sold its 4.6 percent stake in the utility group.

2018-03-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s proposals of new metrics to determine when the oil market is balanced signals a shift in OPEC’s targets for a pact on supply cuts that has almost achieved the initial aim of reducing bloated inventories. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and nine other producers cut output from January 2017 by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) with the aim of reducing crude stocks in industrialized OECD nations to the five-year average. From a record 3.1 billion barrels in July 2016, OECD stocks  dropped to 2.851 billion barrels in December, falling 216 million barrels during 2017 and now stand just 52 million barrels above the five-year average, International Energy Agency (IEA) data show. OPEC and its allies have been helped because the five-year average is a moving target and has risen even as output curbs were in place. The average climbed to 2.86 billion barrels in September 2017 from about 2.73 billion barrels when the supply pact was sealed in late 2016. “After a period of surplus, the target becomes easier over time as more surplus years are included,” said Standard Chartered head of commodities research Paul Horsnell. But as the OECD inventory target has shifted so has thinking in Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter that worked with Russia to forge the global pact on cutting supplies. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih says OPEC and its partners should look at metrics such as non-OECD inventories, oil in floating storage and crude in transit as they consider the future of the pact that is due to expire at the end of 2018. Those measures, however, are more difficult to monitor. Non-OECD oil demand has outstripped OECD consumption since 2014. But inventories in non-OECD nations tend to be held as strategic not commercial assets, making them less transparent and less likely to shift with changes to demand or supply. Falih has said it would be better to “overbalance” the market, by which he means allowing OECD stocks to drop below the five-year average, rather than end the supply deal too early, another hint that the pact’s expiry could be pushed back. To assess whether supply and demand had achieved a sustainable balance, OPEC could measure the amount of oil in storage against days of demand it covers. This would show whether consumption was enough to avoid rebuilding inventories. (Graphic: Global oil supply and demand fall into line - reut.rs/2Dm6vF7) The amount of oil stored in OECD nations is now equivalent to 61 days of forward demand, the lowest since February 2015. In the two years to mid-2014 when the oil price hit about $115, the number of days cover remained below 60. When OPEC and its partners sealed the supply deal in late November in the wake of an oil price plunge, there were nearly 64 days cover. But measuring forward cover may still only offer limited help to OPEC in determining the right time to reopen oil taps, given output from the United States and other non-OPEC producers is climbing. This has capped oil prices around $65 a barrel now, after rising from below $30 at the start of 2016. PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said OPEC and its partners must “constantly remind the market that the alliance formed at the end of 2016 is more than a marriage of convenience and no divorce is contemplated even after stability is achieved.” The IEA says oil producers outside the supply pact raised output by about 700,000 bpd in the 12 months to January. If OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from supply curbs, are included, the total rises to 1.4 million bpd.     By comparison, world demand grew 1.6 million bpd in 2017. OPEC forecasts global demand will grow by 1.59 million bpd in 2018, compared to the IEA prediction of 1.4 million bpd. OPEC also sees non-OPEC supply rising by 1.4 million bpd in 2019, compared to the IEA forecast of 1.7 million bpd. “OPEC and Russia would probably be better off signaling a gradual approach or a ‘tapering’ of sorts,” analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said, adding they should signal output would only rise once the pact ends if oil prices held steady.

2018-03-13,"* Terminal exports crude from giant El Sharara oilfield * Local sources say workers end one-day strike * Strike saw workers block ships from docking (Updates with strike ending, adds details) TRIPOLI, March 13 (Reuters) - Libya’s Zawiya oil terminal returned to normal operations on Tuesday after workers who were blocking ships from docking agreed to end a one-day strike, two sources said. Zawiya exports crude from Libya’s giant El Sharara oilfield, which produces 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), more than a quarter of the North African country’s output. Production at El Sharara had not been affected by the strike at Zawiya, an engineer at the field said. The field is operated by Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Statoil . “A deal has been reached between the strikers and the company and the loadings have resumed,” said a local oil source, asking not to be identified. The Seagrace, which had been due to load on Tuesday morning, would berth at Zawiya soon, a local shipping source said. The tanker was chartered by Russia’s Rosneft, according to Reuters tracking data. The strike at Zawiya began on Monday. The oil source said that only some workers were involved and that they had been pushing to get cash payments amid a liquidity crisis that has affected banks across Libya in recent years. On Tuesday morning a website that posts news from Azzawiya Oil Refining Company said all loading operations had been stopped “by operators demanding an improvement of the situation in general”. It was not clear how the dispute had been resolved, but oil sources had said on Monday that there were negotiations with striking workers.

2018-03-13,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Driving snow enveloped the U.S. Northeast on Tuesday in its third winter storm in two weeks, closing schools, canceling flights and knocking out power to about 140,000 homes and businesses. The nor’easter was forecast to drop up to 20 inches (51 cm) of snow. It followed two storms that rumbled up the East Coast this month, killing at least nine people and knocking out power to about 2.4 million homes and businesses at their peak. The storm stretched from New York state to Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine. Forecasters warned of blizzard conditions, where high winds make travel dangerous, from coastal Massachusetts through Maine. “We’re anticipating that we’ll be seeing through the mid- to late morning and probably into midafternoon snowfall rates of 1 to 3 inches per hour (up to 7.6 cm),” said Bob Thompson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts. About 140,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Jersey lost power as the storm downed trees and power lines. “As soon as the snow stops and the wind stops blowing, we will be pushing the utilities to give people a sense of when the power will come back on,” Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told reporters on Tuesday. “They will move quickly and aggressively to deal with this once the snow stops.” Schools in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, were shut on Tuesday, Maine’s state legislature canceled its session, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy closed all government offices and the Amtrak passenger rail line halted service between Boston and New York.  More than 1,500 U.S. flights were canceled, according to tracking service FlightAware. The hardest-hit airport was Boston Logan, where about four out of five flights were called off. Nor’easters are storms that typically bring strong winds from the northeast, and they tend to occur most often and most violently between September and April along the East Coast, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. Some nor’easters carry hurricane-force winds. Winds were expected to reach 65 miles (105 km) per hour, forecasters said.  This storm’s heavy snow could down trees weakened by the last two storms and bring a fresh wave of power outages, officials warned. Lower tides meant the storm would probably not bring a repeat of the flooding that sent icy water pouring into the streets of Boston during a storm early this month, forecasters and officials said.

2018-03-13,"* Trump ousts Secretary of State Tillerson * U.S. CPI data meets forecasts * Dollar drops against basket of currencies * Oil jumps initially, then falls By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s high-profile ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sent the U.S. dollar down slightly on Tuesday, with crude oil falling after an initial jump. Trump gave Tillerson the boot on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, and replaced his chief diplomat with loyalist Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo. His firing - the biggest shakeup of Trump’s Cabinet since he took office in January 2017 - was announced by the president on Twitter. Evercore ISI strategist Stan Shipley in New York called it “another sign of a problem in the Trump administration.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.28 percent, with the euro up 0.52 percent at $1.2396. Crude oil initially jumped on the Tillerson news, with investors seeing signs that a deal on Iran’s nuclear program could collapse, but the trend reversed later in the day. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.06 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index lost 0.94 percent. Analysts were largely unmoved by the departure of Tillerson, the latest in a cavalcade of exits from Trump’s White House, and suggested its market impact could be short-lived. David Kotok, chairman of money management firm Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida, said such turnover is “now regularly accepted for the markets.” “I don’t think Tillerson out and a replacement is a shock to the market that lasts very much at all,” Kotok said. Separately, the U.S. Labor Department announced its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in February, in line with economists’ expectations. The data suggests the Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates at a gradual pace this year, which boosted some markets. U.S. crude fell 1.21 percent to $60.62 per barrel and Brent was at $64.57, down 0.59 percent. U.S. Treasuries retraced some early losses after choppy trading following the news on Tillerson. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.8554 percent, from 2.87 percent late on Monday. The consumer price data seemed to offset any negative impact of the Tillerson ouster on U.S. stocks, with Wall Street seesawing slightly in morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,189.74, the S&P 500 lost 2.28 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,780.74 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.05 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,556.28. European stocks fell across the board, with some analysts suggesting Tillerson’s departure fueled concerns that extremists are gaining influence in Trump’s administration. Investec economist Philip Shaw pointed to fears that the move “will give the nationalists greater power within the White House over the globalists.” Emerging market stocks rose 0.26 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.22 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.66 percent. Additional reporting by Ritvik Carvalho, Gertrude

2018-03-13,"LONDON/VIENNA (Reuters) - While other European energy firms are flocking to renewables, Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) is sticking with fossil fuels and telling investors it will deliver rising dividends, lower costs  and free cash flow at just $25 a barrel. The strategy seems to be working. OMV has outperformed peers, with its shares up about 25 percent in the past 12 months against a 1.8 percent drop in the sector. Over two years, the gap widens, with OMV up 85 percent and the sector up 13 percent. Presenting its new targets to 2025 in London on Tuesday, Chief Executive Rainer Seele - who has halved production costs per barrel to around $8 in part by rapidly expanding in Russia - had no qualms about his commitment to a fossil-fuelled future. “We will not engage in renewables. It’s not part of our strategy. I cannot do everything,” he said, outlining OMV’s 10-billion-euro spending programme to 2025. Seele’s comments come as other European energy companies such as Shell (RDSa.L), BP Plc (BP.L), Total SA (TOTF.PA) and  Statoil STL.OL are becoming increasingly active in green energy, seeking to position themselves for the future. Shell alone has spent $400 million on renewables and electric car charging points in recent months. Analysts at Bernstein reckon ‘Big Oil’ has invested more than $3 billion on renewables acquisitions over the past five years, mostly solar. Gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, is widely expected to be crucial for reducing emissions.  OMV is aiming for the gas part of its portfolio to grow to up to 60 percent of the total by 2025, from just under half. Overall output is expected to almost double between 2015 and 2025 to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Seele’s predecessor had bet on North Sea production, where other producers such as Premier (PMO.L) are looking at costs of up to $18 per barrel. But Seele is slashing costs by selling British North Sea assets, reducing OMV’s Norwegian footprint and boosting output in Russia, the Middle East and New Zealand. This allows OMV to target costs at around $8 per barrel through 2025, requiring the oil price LCOc1 to be just $25 a barrel to generate free cash flow, compared with the current market price of around $65.  On that basis, OMV plans to keep or raise its dividend. It proposed its highest ever payout of 1.5 euros a share for 2017. By comparison, BP needs a price of at least $45 per barrel to break even this year, and Statoil around $50. “OMV’s new growth strategy is encouraging despite some bold ambitions for profitable growth to 2025,” Jefferies, which reaffirmed its buy rating on OMV shares, said in a note. “The sustainable organic (free cash flow) yield (of around 10 percent) to 2020 is one of the main attractions to this stock,” it said, pointing to peers on below 7 percent.

2018-03-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has picked partners to provide battery cells and related technology worth around 20 billion euros (17.72 billion pounds) for its growing electric car programme, adding further pressure on U.S. pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O). Until its “dieselgate” emissions scandal was revealed two and a half years ago, Europe’s largest automaker had been slow to embrace electric cars. But the fraud prompted a strategic shift, while advances in batteries and a global fight against pollution are raising pressure on carmakers to adopt zero-emission alternatives. Volkswagen (VW) said on Tuesday it had secured battery technology deliveries for Europe and China, where it sells 80 percent of its vehicles, and will select a supplier for North America soon. While Tesla’s much-anticipated Model 3 sedan has already missed some key production targets, VW plans to expand assembly of zero-emission cars to 16 plants globally through the end of 2022 from three at present. “We have pulled out all the stops over the past months to implement the Roadmap E swiftly and resolutely,” Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said at a news conference, referring to the electric vehicle (EV) programme. VW’s emissions scandal, new Chinese quotas for electric cars and tightening rules on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Europe are causing automakers to focus on green cars and self-driving technology. VW has a goal to sell 3 million electric cars per year across the group by 2025 and to offer an electric version of each of the group’s 300 models by 2030. LG Chem (051910.KS), Samsung (005930.KS) and Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) will deliver batteries to VW, which has no plans to start producing powerpacks by itself, Mueller said. “Building up expertise and mastering the technology does not necessarily imply that we want to start large-scale assembly of batteries ourselves,” the CEO said. “Others can do it better than we can.” Although grappling with billions of euros in costs and fines for dieselgate, VW has pledged to spend 34 billion euros on EVs, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022, one of the most ambitious plans in the industry. Separately, the German carmaker reiterated guidance for higher vehicle sales and revenue this year and for a group operating margin of 6.5-7.5 percent after 7.4 percent last year. In an interview with Reuters TV, Mueller denied top management had a pessimistic view on VW’s business prospects in 2018, but said potential bottlenecks as carmakers rush to get models through new so-called WLTP lab tests for emissions and fuel consumption were causing uncertainty.  “We have to deal with WLTP this year,” he said. “It’s simply too early to speculate whether this will be an especially good year or a normal year.” ($1 = 0.8114 euros) Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Reuters TV; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-results/update-2-vw-assigns-25-bln-in-battery-orders-in-electric-car-drive-idUKL8N1QV2LH,13 Mar 2018,"* VW group aims to launch 80 new EVs by 2025

Trump said on Twitter he was replacing the former oil executive Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA), and that Gina Haspel would take over from Pompeo. The announcement saw the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other top world currencies, fall to a three-day low and meant the S&P 500 opened more subdued than traders had earlier expected. “What we are seeing here is that those people in the U.S. administration in the more moderate line of thinking are being ousted, so this adds to the concerns the more radical forces are gaining some ground here,” said Rabobank’s Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell as much as 3 basis points on the Tillerson news and was last trading at around 2.84 percent, also held down by news of slowing inflation. The MSCI All-Country World index of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries was less than 0.1 percent higher by 1305 GMT, with European stocks a fraction lower having started modestly higher. The world index has recovered about half its losses sustained during a shakeout in stocks in February. The selloff came on the back of strong U.S. wage numbers, which investors feared might feed into inflation and push the U.S. central bank towards a faster pace of monetary tightening. Raising its global growth forecasts, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said the Fed would probably have to raise interest rates four times this year as inflation picks up. Fed funds futures however, show markets pricing in a total of three rate hikes this year. “We had a CPI (consumer price index) which was in line with expectations, which helped the stock market – investors were gearing themselves up for a stronger than consensus figure,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. “Subsequently, that and Treasuries have reversed, that’s on the fear that Tillerson’s alleged removal will give the nationalists greater power within the White House over the globalists.” The pan-European STOXX 600 was last down 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia though, MSCI’s broadest regional index excluding Japan ended up 0.2 percent after spending much of the day struggling for direction. In currencies, the dollar’s dip on the Tillerson news was mainly against the euro. The Japanese yen was still half a percent down and at a two-week low, pressured by a political scandal engulfing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government. Britain’s pound rose to a one-week high. British finance minister Philip Hammond said in a mid-term budget update that the economy would grow slightly more quickly than previously expected and lowered the government’s expected borrowing. “We did have confirmation that public finances are better than expected and that there will be scope for spending increases in future years,” said Sarah Hewin, head of research at Standard Chartered. In commodities U.S. crude futures and Brent were both down half a percent each at 61.01 per barrel and 64.60 per barrel respectively. Gold meanwhile bounced back into positive territory after the Tillerson news and after the U.S. inflation data. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Saikat

Huaneng Power’s net profit came in at 1.79 billion yuan ($282.92 million) in 2017, down from 10.38 billion yuan a year earlier, based on a Shanghai stock exchange filing according to Chinese accounting standards. The profit fall was steeper than the 36.1 percent decline in 2016 and the worst showing since 2008, according to Eikon data based on company filings. In a separate statement, Huaneng Power said it had set aside asset impairment provisions of 1.18 billion yuan in 2017 and planned to issue 34.3 billion yuan worth of domestic and offshore debt financing tools over the next two years to help boost its working capital and fund investments. “In 2017, high coal prices put a lot of pressure on the company’s operations,” Huaneng Power said in the filing. “With the continued cuts in obsolete capacity in the coal industry in 2018 due to the government’s policy, we face some challenges in the supply of resources as there could be regional constraints and limitations from time to time.” The 2017 financial results came after the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets closed.

2018-03-13,"(Updates to add coding; no changes to text) By Luc Cohen BUENOS AIRES, March 13 (Reuters) - Oil majors are evaluating bids for offshore exploration rights in Argentina, a major change in a country that sent Spanish energy giant Repsol packing six years ago and has seen little offshore exploration for decades. To secure bids, Argentina will need to show it has moved beyond its historical fluctuations between free-market policies and left-wing populism and that it has made progress in lowering costs for energy firms. Oil companies including Shell and Statoil told Reuters they are looking at bidding in the auctions, to be held later this year, and a government official said Exxon and Chevron have also shown interest. The country faces fierce competition to attract the billions of dollars of investment needed to develop deepwater reserves. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and neighboring Uruguay will all auction offshore blocks in 2018 after undertaking oil market reforms or revising contract terms to facilitate the entry of the world’s top energy companies. For Big Oil, the potential access to Latin American energy reserves is unprecedented. In many countries now opening, including Argentina, resource nationalism has long barred their entry or limited opportunities. Six years ago, former populist President Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol’s stake in Argentina’s state-owned oil company YPF SA. The move sent chills through both the energy industry and the entire private sector. Interviews with oil industry executives, consultants, geologists and officials point to optimism for Argentina’s upcoming auctions and for President Mauricio Macri’s government, which has sought private sector and U.S. government help in structuring the process. “Growing confidence in the current government’s policies - their focus on trying to create an environment that is attractive for investments - has been the big change,” Shell’s head of deepwater Wael Sawan told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry gathering in Houston. “It’s that focus that has created more interest by the sector to say ‘why not, let’s look at this.’” The auction will be a test of company confidence in the longevity of Macri’s reform agenda because it can take a decade between an initial investment in offshore exploration and the first production. Argentina will take bids for three offshore basins from July through November. Exploration rights for blocks in the 130,000-square km Argentina Basin, 90,000-square km Malvinas West Basin and 5,000 square kilometers in the Austral Basin are on offer. While little exploration has been done outside the Austral basin, YPF has identified 22 million barrels of oil equivalent for further investigation, upstream head Pablo Bizotto said at an event last Wednesday. “There is a lot of interest from large companies - Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell,” Daniel Redondo, the secretary for strategic energy planning in Argentina’s Energy Ministry, told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event. Consultancy Bain & Company, on a contract with the government to gauge interest, last year interviewed more than 60 companies, including “all the majors” and independent explorers including Anadarko and Hunt Oil, said Diego Garcia, a Buenos Aires-based Bain partner. Colombia’s Ecopetrol may bid in the auctions, its chief executive told Reuters. Norway’s Statoil, which already has onshore drilling projects in Argentina, is partnering with YPF on offshore seismic studies and is “considering future licensing rounds,” a spokesman said. “Huge areas of the Argentinian continental shelf will be available for bids from companies,” executive vice president for exploration Tim Dodson said at an event in Buenos Aires last Wednesday. “We have of course started our evaluations already.” Chevron and Exxon declined to comment. Anadarko and Hunt did not respond to requests for comment. Firms likely won’t decide whether to bid until the full terms of the auction are published. Macri’s government has enacted pro-market reforms across the economy. His ‘Let’s Change’ coalition swept to victory in midterm elections last October, taking advantage of divisions within the opposition Peronist movement, which is generally defined by strong defense of labor rights and national sovereignty. Macri is on course to become the first non-Peronist president to finish his term since Argentina’s return to democracy in 1983. He’s expected to stand for re-election starting in late 2019. The decision to hold offshore auctions comes as Argentina struggles to attract investment to its Vaca Muerta shale play, which is in a remote part of Argentina that lacks infrastructure to get oil and gas to consumers. Argentina is home to the world’s No. 2 resources of shale gas and the fourth largest of shale oil, estimates the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Yet oil production peaked in 1998 and gas output topped out in 2004, according to Energy Ministry data. Investment in exploration has dried up since the country’s 2001 financial crisis and the populist political response. Under the terms of a 2014 revision to Argentina’s hydrocarbons law, which was well-received by industry, royalties paid to the national government will be 12 percent of the value of hydrocarbons extracted and companies would receive exploration rights for three years, with an option to extend for three years. Rights for each exploration block would be awarded to the company that pledges the most investment, as laid out in the law, Garcia said. “Companies will be interested in studying something that has not been explored,” said Daniel Gerold of G&G Energy Consultants in Buenos Aires, who said the regional competition was unlikely to be an obstacle for Argentina. “I do not think the big players will have used up all their exploration capital in Mexico.” The majors would likely be most interested in the large Argentina Basin, the least explored of the three on offer, Bain’s Garcia said. By contrast, the Austral Basin just off the coast of Tierra del Fuego would be more of a gas play to serve the domestic market and could appeal to local players and Total, which already operates in the area, he said. The Malvinas West basin could be most appealing to exploration-focused independent oil firms, he said. Perth, Australia-based Searcher Seismic began analyzing existing data on Argentina’s offshore formations in November 2016, smelling opportunity in an economic and political opening, and launched a full database for exploration companies in early February. “This should have been done a long time ago in Argentina,” Searcher director Odd Larsen said. “But the politics and the finances unfortunately held Argentina back for a very long time.” (Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ron Bousso in Houston and Juliana Castilla in Buenos Aires Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/argentina-energy-offshore/analysis-oil-majors-interest-in-argentina-tests-free-market-reforms-idUKL1N1QV0MU,13 Mar 2018,"Oil majors are evaluating

2018-03-13,"* Pro-Zuma group, union say deals to hurt coal sector * $5 billion green energy deals a test for new government * ANC divisions risk hobbling Ramaphosa’s reforms (Adds Transform RSA comment) By Joe Brock JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was dealt a political blow on Tuesday, after a last-minute legal challenge by a group loyal to ousted leader Jacob Zuma blocked the signing of $4.7 billion in renewable energy deals. The North Gauteng High Court agreed to hold a full hearing on the challenge on March 27 after the National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) and Transform RSA, a group which has lobbied for Zuma in the past, on Monday argued the deals would lead to coal-sector job losses and should be scrapped. State power utility Eskom was due to sign 27 mostly wind power and solar deals with independent power producers (IPPs), in the first major investment deal since Ramaphosa replaced Zuma last month. “We are confident that the court will recognise that our rights have been violated,” NUMSA said. The projects were delayed for two years under Zuma as he pursued a much-criticised $100 billion nuclear power plan. Ramaphosa, a wealthy businessman, has made revamping the economy a top priority. But many investors are concerned about his ability to push through reforms given deep divisions in the ruling African National Congress (ANC). Zuma reluctantly resigned last month under sustained pressure from sections of the ANC but his allies remain in high-level roles in the party and are opposed to Ramaphosa. “Given our history, it is natural that you suspect ulterior political motives in the court application,” said Dominic Wills, a director at Sola Future Energy, one of the energy companies involved in the deals. Transform RSA, which wrote a letter to the ANC leadership in January saying removing Zuma would put the country in “jeopardy”, denied it was motivated by political ends. “Transform RSA is a non-profit, grassroots lobby organisation,” the group’s president Adil Nchabeleng told Reuters. “We are opposed to the prohibitive cost of the IPP contracts.” The energy ministry said in a statement it decided not to sign the contracts until after the court ruling and reaffirmed its commitment to expanding green energy programmes. Some investors remained positive. “I’m still fairly optimistic these deals will be signed. When you look at the cold, hard facts about our economy, these are the sort of deals that need to be done,” Wills said. NUMSA and Transform RSA argue that a switch to renewable energy would increase electricity costs for poor South Africans. Energy analyst Chris Yelland, however, said the cost of renewable energy had fallen significantly and it was now cheaper than new coal and nuclear projects. South Africa relies on coal-fired plants for more than 80 percent of its electricity generation, while renewables contribute around 7 percent. Eskom is one of the world’s largest producers of greenhouse gases. “Ultimately this application is futile and economic sense will prevail. South Africa must transform from a dirty energy economy to a cleaner energy economy,” Yelland said. South Africa’s renewable power programme was the fastest-growing in the world seven years ago, attracting $15 billion of investment into wind farms and solar projects involving a cluster of new IPPs backed by foreign investment. Over the past two years Eskom stopped signing renewable energy contracts and focused instead on a plan to build a fleet of nuclear power plants, in a deal that some members of the ANC and rights groups said would be open to corruption. Eskom’s former board is being investigated by parliament over allegations it siphoned off state funds to companies controlled by the Gupta family, businessmen friends of Zuma. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.

Brent crude futures were down 32 cents at $64.63 a barrel by 1246 GMT, off an earlier high of $65.25, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 17 cents at $61.53 a barrel. Both crude benchmarks dropped by around 1 percent on Monday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said output from the shale basin would hit a new record high in April. The premium of the front-month Brent and WTI futures contract to those for delivery further ahead has shrunk in the last two weeks in a sign that traders and investors are less optimistic about the likely balance between global supply and demand this year. “Crude oil futures are still stuck in a triangle, not able yet to show a convincing trend either way,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said. “The price momentum is low and waiting for some volatility creation by the weekly statistics.” U.S. crude inventories are expected to show an increase later in the day when the American Petroleum Institute reports its weekly findings. U.S. crude production from major shale formations is expected to rise by 131,000 bpd in April from the previous month to a record 6.95 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly report on Monday. That expected increase would top the 105,000 bpd climb in March from the previous month, to what was then expected to be a record high of 6.82 million bpd, the EIA said. U.S. production is expected to rise above 11 million bpd by late 2018, taking the top spot from Russia, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Healthy demand and ongoing supply restraint by a group or producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, however, have so far prevented further price falls. “The average monthly increase (in shale output) in the eight months since September is 155,000 bpd. This would see shale oil production soar by 1.5 million bpd within a year – enough to cover the total increase in global oil demand,” Commerzbank said in a note. “Thus OPEC has no scope to expand production from its current level.” But in a sign that an early-year rally in crude oil may have fizzled out, money managers cut their combined net long positions in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 50 million barrels in the week to March 6.

2018-03-13,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: LNG supply growth: reut.rs/2ouZHQT By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 13 (Reuters) - Crude oil is likely to spring to mind if one is asked to name a commodity where the United States is disrupting the market by becoming a swing producer and challenging traditional trade flows, especially in fast-growing Asian markets. But it’s increasingly likely that the United States is about to play the same role in liquefied natural gas (LNG), as it ramps up production in an already well-supplied market. Much has been written recently about how the expected glut in LNG supply is unlikely to materialise, given the rapid growth of demand for the super-chilled fuel in Asia, especially in China, which is now second only to Japan as an importer. Major producer Royal Dutch Shell warned last month of an impending supply gap that will need more than $200 billion of investment by 2030 as the natural gas market grows faster than that for any other source of energy. There is nothing wrong with Shell’s bullish forecast, and there is certainly renewed interest around the world in developing LNG projects to meet forecast demand. Investment in LNG projects fell off a cliff in recent years as the industry dealt with the ramifications of rapid supply growth, which has seen Australia add eight new large-scale plants, while the United States is busy commissioning the second of its new export projects, with five more to come by 2019. While Shell and others may well be correct about the need for new plants to meet demand by 2030, it’s the next couple of years that could prove challenging for the LNG industry. Most of the new capacity built in Australia was done under the old industry model where long-term offtake contracts, often linked to crude oil prices, allowed for the financing of billions of dollars of capital investment with extended payback terms. The model has been somewhat different in the United States, with far less of the upcoming production committed to buyers, meaning more will be sold at spot prices linked to U.S. benchmark Henry Hub natural gas. This is where the role of the United States in LNG starts to look eerily similar to the role its shale oil producers are playing in crude oil markets. Traditional exporters, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, have found it tougher than expected to push crude oil prices higher, mainly because customers, especially in Asia have been able to turn to alternative suppliers. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, have met some success in draining excess global crude inventories, it’s come at the expense of market share in the fast-growing Asian demand region. This can be seen in the customs data for China, the world’s largest crude importer. In 2017, Saudi Arabia’s share of China’s imports was 12.4 percent, a drop from 13.4 percent the prior year. The share enjoyed by the United States, meanwhile, rose from 0.13 percent to 1.84 percent. While the United States is far from a major threat to Saudi Arabia in Asia, when you add in gains by other smaller exporters not part of the OPEC and allies output-cutting deal, it starts to add up. Brazil’s share of China’s crude imports rose from 5 percent in 2016 to 5.5 percent last year. Shipments from Britain went from 1.3 percent to 2 percent in 2017. Just as shale as roiled crude oil markets, it’s likely that U.S. shale gas will have the same effect, at least until demand growth eliminates the coming supply surplus. The United States will add about 50 million tonnes of annual capacity by 2020, assuming all the projects currently under construction are delivered on schedule. China sourced 45.4 percent of its LNG from Australia and 19.7 percent from Qatar in 2017, and just 3.9 percent from the United States. But China’s imports of 1.5 million tonnes of LNG from the United States in 2017 was 661 percent higher than for the previous year, and the risk is that as new U.S. output comes online, it will aggressively compete in Asia. While Chinese demand for LNG has surprised to the upside, with growth of 46.4 percent to 38.1 million tonnes in 2017, it still may be a challenge for the market to absorb all the additional tonnes, not just from the United States but also from smaller projects, mainly in Africa. Like the rise of shale oil as an export force, the coming U.S. LNG wave will disrupt traditional flows across the globe. Similar to shale oil, U.S. LNG is being produced and exported from the Atlantic Basin, but the overwhelming growth in demand is in Asia. While U.S. LNG will be competitive in Latin America, it also will likely displace cargoes from Qatar in Europe, meaning the world’s top producer of LNG will be forced to sell more in Asia, just as Australia is snapping at its heels for bragging rights at the biggest exporter. A buyer-led shift to more flexible contracts will see traditional relationships stretched, as will the increasing activities of trading houses keen to get in on the market. Seasonal demand volatility, particularly from China, will also serve to test the market, with the likelihood that the winter peak will be bigger than before, with the attendant risk that the shoulder seasons either side of cold weather will be weaker. Overall, the LNG market is going to have to adapt to the arrival of U.S. production, but where liquefied gas differs from crude oil is in not having an established producer group that can coordinate a response.

2018-03-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria will begin cutting the sulfur levels allowed in imported fuels in July, a change long sought by health and environmental campaigners, a year after an initial deadline, an official at state oil company NNPC said. West African nations had promised higher quality by July 2017 as part of a United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP)campaign, but only Ghana met the deadline.  Nigeria imports roughly 900,000 tonnes of gasoline every month, accounting for 60 percent of West African imports of the fuel, meaning its choices on fuel quality are likely to impact the entire region. Nigeria will lower the top level of sulfur in diesel to 50 parts per million (ppm), from 3,000 ppm, by July 1, Anibor O. Kragha, NNPC’s chief operating officer of refineries and petrochemicals said in a presentation to the African Refiners Association (ARA).  Gasoline sulfur level cuts, a cost that will be borne largely by the government due to capped prices for the fuel, will start in October, moving to 300 ppm from 1,000 ppm.  Nigeria is targeting a cut to 150 ppm by October 1, 2019, Kragha said.  The Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON), the body responsible for setting requirements for imported goods, published tighter quality rules last year, but another government body - the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) - did not issue revised specifications. James McCullagh, analyst with Energy Aspects, said that meant “NNPC currently has the right — rather than the obligation — to actually import it (cleaner fuels).” “This latest move would merely crystallize that obligation,” he said. Kragha told journalists in Cape Town that the ministries of Environment, Health, Petroleum Resources and Industry and Trade were working together to finalize rules that would be distributed to importers at some point in the second quarter.  UNEP, the ARA and health campaigners have been pushing West African nations to ban fuels that have been illegal in Europe and the United States for years due to what they say are significant health problems associated with sulfur emissions - particularly in dense urban areas such as Lagos. [reut.rs/2FMEeg5] The region is one of the last on earth where it is legal to sell fuels with sulfur levels at and above 1,000 ppm, as east and north African nations and major Asian consumer countries such as China and India have already tightened rules. Kragha, in a presentation during ARA Week in Cape Town, said that while Nigeria was committed to cleaner fuel standards, “significant costs” complicated efforts to meet the deadline. The presentation said that the first shift to cleaner gasoline would cost $11.7 million per month, and the second $15.7 million per month. The diesel reduction would cost $2.8 million per month.  Because gasoline prices are capped in Nigeria, and NNPC itself has been importing the bulk of it over the past year via crude for product swaps, the government is likely to bear much of the initial costs for a cleaner specification.  Diesel prices are deregulated, meaning consumers will pay directly for the better-quality fuels. Nigeria’s own oil refineries will have until 2021 to meet the new sulfur levels, Kragha said.

2018-03-13,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s solar industry more than doubled its fund raising to $10 billion in 2017, clean energy consultancy Mercom said, but activity is likely to slow this year as New Delhi plans to slap high tariffs on imports. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of raising India’s solar power generation to 100 gigawatt (GW) by 2022, five times current levels. The government says India will need to raise at least $125 billion to reach its goal of generating 175 GW of energy from all renewable sources in five years. New large-scale and rooftop solar installations in India jumped to 9.63 GW last year, compared with the addition of 4.31 GW in 2016, Mercom said, but predicted additional installations will fall by 22 percent to 7.5 GW this year. “The lower forecast reflects a smaller pipeline of projects scheduled for commissioning in 2018,” Mercom said. “Auction activity was not very robust in 2017 and though there was a surge in activity at the end of the year, most of the projects that were tendered are not likely to be commissioned until 2019.” Mercom called a proposal by India’s safety watchdog to impose a 70 percent duty on imports of solar equipment from China and some other countries, to protect domestic manufacturers, as an “unexpected and aggressive recommendation that has brought the industry to a standstill”. Any duty would hurt big project developers in India such as SoftBank (9984.T)-backed SB Energy but would be good for local solar component makers such as Indosolar (INDL.NS) and Moser Baer (MOSR.NS), which have struggled to compete with Chinese companies such as Trina Solar and Yingli YGE.N. Reuters also reported in January that solar modules worth more than $150 million were stuck at various Indian ports due to a dispute over their classification and the import tax applicable to them. Most of the modules come from China, but several consignments were held up because customs officials demanded that some of them be classified as electric motors and generators, attracting a 7.5 percent duty, not as diodes, transistors and similar semi-conductor devices with no duty. India aims for renewable energy to make up 40 percent of installed power capacity by 2030, compared with 18.2 percent at the end of 2017, and the ministry of new and renewable energy said in January it was looking to address issues facing solar companies. “The imposition of any additional duties would make solar more expensive and potentially scare away financially strapped distribution companies who are looking to procure the cheapest power generation source available,” Mercom said.

2018-03-13,"(Reuters) - Interdealer broker TP ICAP Plc (TCAPI.L) said it was talking to financial regulators about requirements for a post-Brexit hub, should the company choose the location for its operations. TP ICAP pledged to ensure uninterrupted service in 2018 following Britain’s exit from the European Union, but said its efforts had been hampered by political uncertainty, which has persisted into 2018. “We have now moved from analysis and planning, to decisions and action without a full understanding of the final outcome of the negotiations between the UK government and the EU,” TP ICAP said in a statement. The company said it had “an extensive Continental European footprint” and services EU clients from Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Madrid and other locations. TP ICAP also expects costs in 2018 in relation to making the group “ready for the impact of Brexit”.  The company, which brings together buyers and sellers in financial, energy and commodities markets, said pretax profit rose to 72 million pounds in 2017, from 57 million pounds a year earlier, as interest rate hikes spurred trading volumes in a year of low volatility. Interdealer brokers had in 2016 benefited from higher volatility following political surprises, such as U.S. President Donald Trump’s victory and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. This volatility, however, was short-lived.  Despite low levels of volatility there were still “sporadic increases” in trading volumes, TP ICAP said, adding that it saw increased activity in its rates, foreign exchange and money markets units when interest rates were hiked. Foreign exchange and money markets also benefited from the uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations.     “So far in 2018 we have seen an encouraging start to the year, with a pick-up in volatility and interest rates,” CEO John Phizackerley said.

2018-03-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Eni (ENI.MI) have voluntarily filed to U.S. authorities internal probes into how they acquired a giant field in Nigeria as the companies seek to fight corruption allegations in Europe and Africa.     The filings, to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), do not mean U.S. authorities are investigating Shell or Eni.     But the move shows the companies are trying to preempt questions from the United States as they face one of the oil industry’s biggest-ever graft trials in Italy, to begin in May in Milan, a pending trial in Nigeria and an investigation in the Netherlands.     The case revolves around the purchase of a huge block off oil-rich Nigeria, known as OPL 245, which holds an estimated 9 billion barrels in reserves. [reut.rs/2Fveiph]      Italian prosecutors allege that bribes were paid in an effort to secure rights to the block in 2011. A number of top executives from both companies – including Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi and former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded – will face trial. Under Italian law a company can be held responsible if it is deemed to have failed to prevent, or attempt to prevent, a crime by an employee that benefited the company. Both companies’ shares are traded on U.S. stock exchanges, putting their foreign dealings in the scope of U.S. authorities. Shell and Eni, on behalf of subsidiaries, in 2010 entered deferred prosecution agreements with the DOJ over separate Nigerian corruption allegations.  Those pacts dismissed charges after a certain period in exchange for fines and an agreement to fulfil a number of requirements. They concluded in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  “A company’s disclosure of alleged foreign corruption to both the SEC and the DOJ in the U.S. typically means the company believed U.S. authorities needed to be made aware of this, and both agencies have the authority to prosecute under the (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA),” said Pablo Quiñones, executive director of the New York University School of Law program on corporate compliance and enforcement. Quiñones previously worked as chief of strategy, policy and training at the DOJ’s criminal fraud section, a role that included helping to develop FCPA enforcement policy. The SEC and the DOJ declined to comment on the company disclosures or whether they were looking into any allegations surrounding the block.  Eni noted its disclosure in an SEC filing, in which it said “no evidence of wrongdoing on Eni side were detected”. Shell has said publicly that it submitted the investigation to U.S. authorities and to Britain’s Serious Fraud Office.   Shell and Eni deny any wrongdoing. They say their payments for the block, a total of $1.3 billion, were transparent, legal and went directly into an escrow account controlled by the Nigerian government.  The companies and legal experts say the trial will last more than a year, with potential appeals stretching several years beyond that.  “The risk for companies is of a prolonged period of exposure to open court allegations from a state prosecutor of impropriety,” Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting said. “That will be painful and damaging.” The Milan prosecutor charges that roughly $1 billion of the payments were funnelled to a Nigerian company called Malabu Oil and Gas, which had a disputed claim on the block, and former oil minister Dan Etete, who British and U.S. courts have said controlled Malabu. Reuters has been unable to reach Etete or Malabu for comment. Shell has since said it knew some of the money would go to Malabu to settle its claim, though its own due diligence could not confirm who controlled the company. Eni said it never dealt with Etete or knew he controlled the company, but that the government promised to settle all other claims on the block as part of their deal. (reut.rs/2Fr6G3y) “If the evidence ultimately proves that improper payments were made by Malabu or others to then current government officials in exchange for improper conduct relating to the 2011 settlement of the long standing legal disputes, it is Shell’s position that none of those payments were made with its knowledge, authorisation or on its behalf,” Shell said in a statement.  The proceedings have also brought together investigators in several countries, with authorities in Nigeria and the Netherlands sending information to Milan.  A Dutch anti-fraud team in 2016 raided Shell offices as part of the investigation, and a Dutch law firm has asked prosecutors to consider launching a criminal case in the Netherlands. “I’m not aware of many cases where this many jurisdictions have been at work for so long helping each other out. The amount of cooperation is very unusual,” said Aaron Sayne of the Natural Resource Governance Institute, a non-profit group that advises countries on how to manage oil, gas and mineral resources.  A case by Nigeria’s financial watchdog, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, against defendants including the former attorney general, ex-ministers of justice and oil and various senior managers, current and former, from Shell and Eni, will continue in June.         There has also been at least one effort to take away the asset. Experts say it is worth billions, and Shell has spent millions developing it. Eni intends to make a final investment decision this year on developing the block and said in corporate filings that the asset has a book value of 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion).  The Italian court does not have the ability to rescind rights to the block, and Nigerian oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has said the companies should continue to develop it. But in a lawsuit filed by the Nigerian government against JPMorgan (JPM.N) in London for the U.S. bank's role in transferring money from the deal, it called the agreement that facilitated Shell and Eni's purchase ""unlawful and void"". (reut.rs/2FxBFOR) A JPMorgan spokeswoman previously said the firm “considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit”. Additionally, a Nigerian court last year briefly ordered the seizure of the block.  That decision was later overturned, and Shell and Eni say they are not worried about losing the asset. But the ruling and the language in the government's suit against JPMorgan underscore the risk. [reut.rs/2D88rRe] “It’s a nice, stable asset that could produce a lot of oil for a long time,” Sayne said.

As other energy companies shift their portfolios towards natural gas as a less polluting alternative to oil, OMV said it too will beef up its gas exploration, refining and transport business, aiming to become one of Europe’s top players in the market. The partly state-owned group operates refineries in Austria, Germany and Romania and explores oil and gas fields in central and eastern Europe, the North Sea and the Middle East and Africa. Half of the acquisition budget will be used to expand its refining business by investing in markets outside Europe, where it currently generates the lion’s share of its sales. “We are going to diversify it towards the growing markets, especially as we speak about downstream,” Chief Executive Rainer Seele said at a presentation in London. OMV said it will use part of the war chest to develop an upstream - or exploration and production - business in Australia and New Zealand. The Vienna-based group aims to achieve clean current cost of supplies (CCS) earnings before interest and tax, which exclude special items and inventory gains or losses, of more than 5 billion euros ($6.16 billion) by 2025, an increase of 70 percent to last year. OMV said it targets a 10 percent share of the German gas market by 2025 from 2.5 percent at present and plans to feed additional gas from Norway and Romania into the European grid to increase sales to more than 20 billion cubic meters by 2025. OMV is among five Western companies to have invested in Russian gas export pipeline Nord Stream 2, which the latest U.S. sanctions related to Russia’s activities in Crimea and European Union opposition may make harder to realise. It operates natural gas transmission pipelines in Austria, holds interests in the Central European Gas Hub, and operates gas-fired power plants in Romania and Turkey.

2018-03-13,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Luc Cohen BUENOS AIRES, March 13 (Reuters) - Oil majors are evaluating bids for offshore exploration rights in Argentina, a major change in a country that sent Spanish energy giant Repsol packing six years ago and has seen little offshore exploration for decades. To secure bids, Argentina will need to show it has moved beyond its historical fluctuations between free-market policies and left-wing populism and that it has made progress in lowering costs for energy firms. Oil companies including Shell and Statoil told Reuters they are looking at bidding in the auctions, to be held later this year, and a government official said Exxon and Chevron have also shown interest. The country faces fierce competition to attract the billions of dollars of investment needed to develop deepwater reserves. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and neighboring Uruguay will all auction offshore blocks in 2018 after undertaking oil market reforms or revising contract terms to facilitate the entry of the world’s top energy companies. For Big Oil, the potential access to Latin American energy reserves is unprecedented. In many countries now opening, including Argentina, resource nationalism has long barred their entry or limited opportunities. Six years ago, former populist President Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol’s stake in Argentina’s state-owned oil company YPF SA. The move sent chills through both the energy industry and the entire private sector. Interviews with oil industry executives, consultants, geologists and officials point to optimism for Argentina’s upcoming auctions and for President Mauricio Macri’s government, which has sought private sector and U.S. government help in structuring the process. “Growing confidence in the current government’s policies - their focus on trying to create an environment that is attractive for investments - has been the big change,” Shell’s head of deepwater Wael Sawan told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry gathering in Houston. “It’s that focus that has created more interest by the sector to say ‘why not, let’s look at this.’” The auction will be a test of company confidence in the longevity of Macri’s reform agenda because it can take a decade between an initial investment in offshore exploration and the first production. Argentina will take bids for three offshore basins from July through November. Exploration rights for blocks in the 130,000-square km Argentina Basin, 90,000-square km Malvinas West Basin and 5,000 square kilometers in the Austral Basin are on offer. While little exploration has been done outside the Austral basin, YPF has identified 22 million barrels of oil equivalent for further investigation, upstream head Pablo Bizotto said at an event last Wednesday. “There is a lot of interest from large companies - Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell,” Daniel Redondo, the secretary for strategic energy planning in Argentina’s Energy Ministry, told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event. Consultancy Bain & Company, on a contract with the government to gauge interest, last year interviewed more than 60 companies, including “all the majors” and independent explorers including Anadarko and Hunt Oil, said Diego Garcia, a Buenos Aires-based Bain partner. Colombia’s Ecopetrol may bid in the auctions, its chief executive told Reuters. Norway’s Statoil, which already has onshore drilling projects in Argentina, is partnering with YPF on offshore seismic studies and is “considering future licensing rounds,” a spokesman said. “Huge areas of the Argentinian continental shelf will be available for bids from companies,” executive vice president for exploration Tim Dodson said at an event in Buenos Aires last Wednesday. “We have of course started our evaluations already.” Chevron and Exxon declined to comment. Anadarko and Hunt did not respond to requests for comment. Firms likely won’t decide whether to bid until the full terms of the auction are published. Macri’s government has enacted pro-market reforms across the economy. His ‘Let’s Change’ coalition swept to victory in midterm elections last October, taking advantage of divisions within the opposition Peronist movement, which is generally defined by strong defense of labor rights and national sovereignty. Macri is on course to become the first non-Peronist president to finish his term since Argentina’s return to democracy in 1983. He’s expected to stand for re-election starting in late 2019. The decision to hold offshore auctions comes as Argentina struggles to attract investment to its Vaca Muerta shale play, which is in a remote part of Argentina that lacks infrastructure to get oil and gas to consumers. Argentina is home to the world’s No. 2 resources of shale gas and the fourth largest of shale oil, estimates the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Yet oil production peaked in 1998 and gas output topped out in 2004, according to Energy Ministry data. Investment in exploration has dried up since the country’s 2001 financial crisis and the populist political response. Under the terms of a 2014 revision to Argentina’s hydrocarbons law, which was well-received by industry, royalties paid to the national government will be 12 percent of the value of hydrocarbons extracted and companies would receive exploration rights for three years, with an option to extend for three years. Rights for each exploration block would be awarded to the company that pledges the most investment, as laid out in the law, Garcia said. “Companies will be interested in studying something that has not been explored,” said Daniel Gerold of G&G Energy Consultants in Buenos Aires, who said the regional competition was unlikely to be an obstacle for Argentina. “I do not think the big players will have used up all their exploration capital in Mexico.” The majors would likely be most interested in the large Argentina Basin, the least explored of the three on offer, Bain’s Garcia said. By contrast, the Austral Basin just off the coast of Tierra del Fuego would be more of a gas play to serve the domestic market and could appeal to local players and Total, which already operates in the area, he said. The Malvinas West basin could be most appealing to exploration-focused independent oil firms, he said. Perth, Australia-based Searcher Seismic began analyzing existing data on Argentina’s offshore formations in November 2016, smelling opportunity in an economic and political opening, and launched a full database for exploration companies in early February. “This should have been done a long time ago in Argentina,” Searcher director Odd Larsen said. “But the politics and the finances unfortunately held Argentina back for a very long time.” (Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ron Bousso in Houston and Juliana Castilla in Buenos Aires Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Brian Thevenot)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/argentina-energy-offshore/rpt-analysis-oil-majors-interest-in-argentina-tests-free-market-reforms-idUKL1N1QV04C,13 Mar 2018,"Oil majors are evaluating

2018-03-13,"PRISTINA/SARAJEVO, March 13 (Reuters) - Kosovo has found a short-term fix for a gap in Europe’s power grid which has slowed electric timers across much of the continent, but officials warned on Tuesday the problem may re-emerge unless a network row with Serbia is resolved for good. European grid lobby ENTSO-E said last week the continental European network had been short of 113 gigawatt-hours of energy because Kosovo had taken more power than it produced while Serbia, which is in charge of balancing Kosovo’s grid, had failed to fill the gap between mid-January and March 7. As a result, the European network’s frequency had deviated from its standard of 50 Hertz (Hz) to 49.996 Hz and some electric clocks, steered by the frequency of the power system rather than by a quartz crystal, have lost nearly six minutes. “We have already returned 20 percent of the missing energy and that energy will have to be compensated by the end of this month,” a senior Kosovo energy official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. He said the government had allocated 1 million euros ($1.2 million) to buy electricity to compensate for the shortfall and avoid any similar problems in future. But ENTSO-E, the association of European grid operators, said the country of 1.8 million people might need between 4.5 million and 5.6 million euros to compensate for the shortfall. “If there is no more money then we will have the same situation again,” the Kosovo official warned. Kosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008. Belgrade, which still refuses to recognise Kosovo, committed to normalise relations with Pristina, key to its progress towards European Union membership. But little progress has been made. A spokeswoman for ENTSO-E said a deal must be reached and the energy put back into the system to restore the frequency. “The outstanding point, as to avoid any repetition, is that several legal energy issues between Kosovo and Serbia have to be set. The discussions are ongoing and involve us from a technical side, but also of course the European Commission,” Susanne Nies said. Officials say the problem emerged after a Pristina court ruling in December to end a practice by which Kosovars living south of the River Ibar had been receiving higher bills to compensate for power consumption by Serbs in the north of the country, who do not recognise Kosovo institutions and refuse to pay the Kosovo grid operator. Following the court decision, Kosovo’s energy regulator ordered its grid operator KOSTT to trim the tariff by 44 percent. “KOSTT did not have the legal and financial ability to assume the obligation to further cover the losses for power supply to the northern part,” it told Reuters. Another senior energy official said. “We had two solutions: to cut the electricity to people, hospitals, water companies and trigger violent protests by Serbs, or sit down and watch. We decided to sit down and watch.” Official figures show the uncollected debt now amounts to over 140 million euros. Serbia’s grid operator, EMS, has obstructed KOSTT’s efforts to become a full-fledged ENTSO-E member though KOSTT says all requirements have been met. Both countries in 2015 signed an agreement on operating their grids, but it has never been enacted. The two sides have conflicting claims about ownership of the power grid in Kosovo, built when it was part of Serbia. KOSTT says the row cost it 9.6 million euros in 2017, as EMS continues to benefit from the allocation of capacity from Kosovo’s interconnectors with neighbouring countries. EMS declined to comment. $1 = 0.8123 euros

2018-03-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) group’s record earnings drove up Chief Executive Matthias Mueller’s salary package by about 40 percent last year to 10.14 million euros ($12.47 million) in pay and benefits, the carmaker said on Tuesday. A year ago Europe’s largest automaker introduced new remuneration rules to curb investor criticism over big bonuses paid to executives despite the 2015 “dieselgate” emissions scandal. Mueller, 64, whose contract expires in 2020, earned almost a fifth more than the 8.6 million euros that Daimler (DAIGn.DE) CEO Dieter Zetsche made for 2017, a year in which Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz brand beat rivals Audi (NSUG.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) in global luxury car sales for a second year. Volkswagen group nearly doubled operating profit last year, even as it continued to grapple with fallout from the emissions scandal and prepares to press ahead with a costly strategic shift to electric and self-driving cars. In 2016 Mueller had earned 7.3 million euros under VW’s then backward-looking remuneration system, which allowed bonuses to be based partly on VW’s performance over the previous two years. Under the new rules, the carmaker’s supervisory board capped total pay for its CEO at 10 million euros and other top managers at 5.5 million euros. Under Germany’s HGB commercial code, overall compensation of VW group’s top executive board jumped 27 percent to 50.3 million euros last year from 39.6 million a year earlier, VW said.  Sources at VW said that Mueller’s package exceeded the 10 million limit because of perks and retirement provisions that are usually included under HGB rules.

2018-03-13,"(Adds details, background) JUBA, March 13 (Reuters) - South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir has fired his finance minister and a senior military official on a U.N. blacklist, a presidential decree said. The decree, read on state radio late on Monday, gave no reason for the decision to replace Finance Minister Stephen Dhieu Dau with Salvatore Garang Mabiordit, who is from Kiir’s northern home area of Warrap. Dau is from Upper Nile. Lieutenant General Marial Chanuang Yol Mangok, was dismissed from his post as assistant chief of the defence forces, also without explanation. Mangok, who once was the head of Kiir’s presidential guard, is among six rival generals that the U.N. Security Council blacklisted for “fuelling the ongoing conflict and contributing to the devastating humanitarian crisis” in South Sudan in 2015. South Sudan slid into civil war in December 2013 when a political crisis triggered fighting between forces loyal to Kiir and rebels allied with his former deputy Riek Machar. Thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the conflict that has often been along ethnic lines. Several ceasefires have been agreed, then broken. The conflict has also hurt the economy, with crude oil output at less than half of its pre-war level of 245,000 barrels per day.

2018-03-13,"(Repeats story first published late on Monday) * Utilities increasingly focus on one business * Spot markets reduce value of vertical integration * Physics and politics limit potential of cross-border M&A * Focus on technology acquisition, developing countries By Geert De Clercq PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - An all-German deal to split Innogy between RWE and E.ON looks set to create a template for European utilities M&A that includes the demise of the integrated model, no more big cross-border deals and a quest for  emerging market growth. Under the deal, announced on Sunday, German utility RWE will combine the renewables businesses of rival E.ON with Innogy’s, while E.ON will acquire Innogy’s regulated energy networks and customer operations. The deal continues the break-up of E.ON and RWE, which were two vertically integrated utilities before they split their renewables and grids from their thermal generation assets. With E.ON set to sell its stake in thermal generation unit Uniper to Finland’s Fortum this year, E.ON and RWE will be left with the only assets that still make money in Europe’s power industry: subsidised renewables and regulated networks. Germany’s switch from nuclear to renewables after the Fukushima disaster in 2011 and European Union support for renewable energy created huge overcapacity that is pricing thermal and nuclear-power generation out of the market. In response, RWE’s and E.ON’s first spin-offs two years ago were about getting out of traditional generation. Now, even highly integrated state-owned utilities like France’s EDF and Czech Republic’s CEZ have been presented with break-up scenarios. “European utilities are increasingly specialising in one part of the value chain,” said Colette Lewiner, energy adviser to the chairman of Capgemini, a consultancy. She said this might be partly because spot markets set the power price and thus integrate the value chain from power generation to electricity retailing. The Innogy deal is also notable for its lack of foreign utilities’ involvement. Before the 2008 financial crisis, European utilities were in a dealmaking frenzy, all seeking to buy footholds in other European countries. But most of those deals fell through or turned sour and now only a few EU utilities have a significant presence in other EU countries. Investment bankers had floated Enel, Iberdrola or Engie as potential buyers of Innogy. But none of them materialised as bidders. Electricity, unlike oil and gas, is difficult to transport, which is why utilities never went global. And besides the physics, politics too has played a part in crimping cross-border deals. A decade ago, the EU tried to drive politics out of utilities with a push for privatisation and the unbundling of monopoly-owned grids. But politics has returned via the back door. Germany’s nuclear exit, Spain’s unwinding of renewables subsidies and Britain’s threat of price caps all show the extent to which utilities dance to governments’ regulatory tunes. Roland Vetter, chief investment officer at PraXis Partners, said that besides valuation and the lack of synergies, politics was a major reason for foreign utilities not buying Innogy. “The moment you own these businesses, you are involved in German politics. E.ON already is, for them it is not an issue,” he said. German companies have some impact on politicians, but not foreigners, he said. “If, say, Iberdrola buys a German company, there is no protection, only downside.” Vetter expects no further major M&A deals, neither intra-country or on a regional scale. That is not to say there will be no smaller deals. In a bid to innovate, utilities are buying dozens of small to medium-size companies in new business areas such as electric vehicle charging, insulation, smart meters and energy services. Utilities will also continue investing in emerging markets, which have huge power needs and more liberal regulation. “As new market entrants steal their customers at home, European utilities have no choice but to go seek growth where they can find it,” said Montpellier University’s Jacques Percebois.

2018-03-13,"MOSCOW, March 13 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble weakened on Tuesday pressed by geopolitical tensions between Russia and Britain, as well as weak oil prices. At 0755 GMT, the rouble was 0.16 percent weaker against the dollar at 56.97 and had lost 0.06 percent to trade at 70.17 versus the euro. British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “highly likely” that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning in England of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a military-grade nerve agent. London has given Russia until the end of Tuesday to explain its use and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson already said the United States had “full confidence” in Britain’s assessment that Russia was likely responsible for poisoning. “In particular, the next calls for sanctions - this time, from the United Kingdom - can bring undesirable volatility (for the rouble),” analysts of Rosbank, a subsidiary of Societe Generale, said in a note. Rosbank also said that despite new geopolitical threats there were several reasons for the pressure on the rouble, including a general fall in the emerging market currencies and a drop in oil prices. Oil prices slightly fell on Tuesday as the inexorable rise in U.S. crude output weighed on markets. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia’s main export, was up 0.31 percent at $64.75 a barrel. The market awaits the U.S. inflation data later in the day which could offer clues on the pace of interest rate rises this year. Russian stock indexes were down. The dollar-denominated RTS index was down 0.5 percent to 1,277 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.4 percent lower at 2,308 points.

2018-03-13,"* Ministry to take over climate, carbon duties from state planner * Shift comes as China struggles with CO2 market plans * Responsibilities for river, land, sea pollution to be absorbed By David Stanway SHANGHAI, March 13 (Reuters) - China will hand over a slew of new responsibilities for river, marine and soil pollution as well as climate change to a beefed-up environment ministry, it said on Tuesday, part of its biggest shake-up in years. The 10-year-old Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) will be transformed into the wider-reaching Ministry for Ecological Environment, and will absorb environmental duties formerly held by the land, water and agriculture ministries, China’s parliament said. In a bid to take on polluters, China has been strengthening its environment ministry, drawing up new laws, setting up monitoring systems and launching campaigns to boost compliance by heavy industries. “With the new management structure, the efforts for air, water, soil, and ecological protection will be more coordinated,” said Tonny Xie, director of the Secretariat for the Clean Air Alliance of China (CAAC). “It is also a sign that China will continue the unprecedented commitment and investment to improve environmental quality in future, which will generate significant market potential for clean technologies.” The enlarged body will also absorb functions from the State Oceanic Administration, and from the cabinet office in charge of a huge cross-country water project aimed at easing drought in the north by diverting rivers from the flood-prone south. Climate change and low-carbon growth were previously the responsibility of the powerful state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and switching them to the new ministry could aid coordination, said Li Shuo, a senior climate adviser with environmental group Greenpeace. “But much more detail, including who heads which department, is needed to tell if it is a net positive move,” he said, adding that the NDRC had been a champion of climate policy. The NDRC’s climate role was partly a legacy of veteran climate change official Xie Zhenhua, who joined it in 2007 after resigning from what was then the State Environmental Protection Administration, in the wake of a toxic benzene leak in northeastern China. “It is logical to transfer these duties,” said Shawn He, an environmental lawyer with a Beijing-based law firm, Huamao & Guigu. “But the all-powerful NDRC was very effective at pushing forward climate policies because its powers are immense and it can play a role that no other ministry can play in terms of implementing its agenda.” The switch comes as China struggles to meet pledges to launch a nationwide carbon trading system. Beijing was forced to scale back ambitions late last year amid technical problems. “It will involve lots of trans-ministerial efforts and coordination, and I don’t know whether the new ministry will have the authority to do that,” said He. Ultimately, the power of environmental regulators in China will depend on its leaders’ determination to battle the outcome of more than three decades of untrammelled economic growth. “It is the Party that gets its act together on issues such as air pollution, and not the ministry,” said Li of Greenpeace, referring to the ruling Communist Party.

2018-03-13,"* Venezuela has been roiled by economic crisis * Its oil production last year plunged to lowest in decades * Middle East suppliers continue to dominate shipments to India By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, March 13 (Reuters) - Indian imports of oil from Venezuela have fallen to their lowest levels in over half a decade, shipping and industry data showed, as a severe economic and political crisis hits crude output in the South American OPEC member. India’s oil imports from Venezuela averaged around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) between November, 2017 and February, 2018, a drop of about 20 percent from the same period a year earlier and the lowest such level since 2012, according to data from shipping sources and industry. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. Venezuela’s oil production plunged to the lowest in decades last year, with the country racked by quadruple-digit inflation, a lack of hard currency and a crippling recession. The five-year average of Venezuelan crude oil to India is around 440,000 bpd, the shipping and industry data showed. India’s oil supplies continue to be dominated by Middle East members from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with Iraq and Saudi Arabia prominent. Key for Venezuela’s drop-off in shipments to India are supply obligations to other countries which, amid its overall declining output, leave fewer cargoes available for sale elsewhere. “Venezuela is obliged to supply barrels to China and Russia to pay back debts, so not too much is left for others, mainly India,” said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at consultancy Resource Economist. The sharp Venezuelan declines to India mark a turn-around of a previous trend. Venezuelan oil shipments to India surged from May, 2012, when supplies from Iran hit insurance and banking hurdles caused by western sanctions against Tehran’s nuclear programme. However, New Delhi boosted purchases from Tehran after the lifting of sanctions in 2016, while a destructive cocktail of insufficient investments, payment delays to suppliers, potential U.S. sanctions and a brain drain have hammered Venezuela’s oil industry. “Why should India buy oil from a country which is too far (away)?... Plenty of oil is easily available from nearby nations like Iraq and Iran,” said Haq. Reporting by Nidhi Verma

2018-03-13,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia’s president has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump for more trade between their countries, saying an economic downturn has threatened to destabilise the young Asian democracy sandwiched between China and Russia. Mongolia’s role as an “oasis of democracy” in a region where authoritarianism in on the rise “does not contribute to economic development”, Mongolian President Khaltmaa Battulga said in a letter to Trump dated March 12 and published on his website. Battulga said prosperity was coming too slowly. “Ordinary Mongolian citizens have become discouraged by democracy and have begun to doubt our choice,” he said. Mongolia is emerging from an economic crisis after agreeing to a $5.5 billion (£3.9 billion) economic bailout from the International Monetary Fund last year, which helped stabilise its currency and relieve debt pressures. A resurgence in the coal trade in the region also helped boost growth to 5.1 percent last year compared with just 1 percent in 2016. But Mongolia exported just $8.3 million worth of goods to the United States last year, according to Mongolia’s National Statistics Office. Its total exports stood at $6.2 billion, with the bulk going south to China. Trade with the United States was less than 2 percent of its total last year, and a U.S. decision to allow imports of Mongolian clothing would help ensure economic stability, Battulga said.  He also called for easier visa conditions for Mongolian citizens. The United States is one of Mongolia’s so-called Third Neighbours, which Mongolia uses to balance relations with heavyweight neighbours China and Russia. Battulga told Trump that U.S. trade and investment could help prevent Mongolia from moving in a more authoritarian direction.  “I am confident that supporting Mongolia’s economic security will play a prominent role in your country’s foreign policy,” he wrote.

2018-03-13,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is increasingly looking to just float oil giant Saudi Aramco locally as plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on an international exchange such as London or New York hang in the balance, sources close to the process said. The kingdom is counting on being awarded emerging market status by index complier MSCI in June to help Saudi Aramco attract Western funds, in addition to cornerstone investors from China, Japan and South Korea, the sources said. “I would guess it is about evens that there will be no international IPO,” said a high-level source familiar with the preparations, saying they were proving to be a disappointment.  Saudi Arabia is planning to list up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco in an initial public offering that could value it at up to $2 trillion and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week that Aramco was too important to risk listing in the United States because of litigation concerns, such as existing lawsuits against rival oil companies for their role in climate change. British officials have been told by Saudi counterparts London has a chance to secure the listing but only in 2019 at the earliest, according to the Financial Times, and sources told Reuters the kingdom was now focusing on a listing on the local exchange, or Tadawul. “The only thing we know today is that Tadawul will be the key listing location as our national exchange,” Falih told CNN. “We are waiting for the reforms to be in place and to join MSCI and Aramco listing in Tadawul will be catalytic for that capital market as we bring international capital to the kingdom,” he told the U.S. channel last week. The initial public offering is the centrepiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also boost the kingdom’s budget which has been hit by low oil prices. Initially planned for 2018, preparations have been hit by rows over whether Aramco should list on major Western markets at all. An advisory council to the government asked the securities regulator this year to study the impact of a local listing amid concern a huge IPO could harm the market. MSCI has proposed giving its existing Saudi Arabia stock index emerging market status rather than standalone status following a series of market reforms by the kingdom such as raising caps on foreign ownership of companies. MSCI will give its decision in June and, if positive, the reclassification would be in two steps in May and August 2019. According to an update of the MSCI proposal published in February, Saudi Arabia would have a market capitalisation of $124 billion (£89.3 billion) in MSCI’s Emerging Markets Index, giving it an index weight of 2.3 percent, on a par with Thailand. Based on the assumption that another $100 billion would be added through an Aramco initial public offering, the kingdom’s weighting would rise to about 4 percent, which would be bigger than Russia’s weighting of 3.4 percent, for example. If MSCI grants Saudi Arabia emerging market status, it could be seen as a reason to push against an international listing, the sources close to the listing process said. Passive investment funds that replicate MSCI indexes would need to put 4 percent of their funds allocated to emerging market indexes into Saudi shares to match the country weighting. According to MSCI, $1.7 trillion of assets were benchmarked against MSCI emerging market indexes at the end of June last year, of which about a fifth was from passive investors. That could mean $13.6 billion could come into Saudi stocks from passive investors and if active investors also increased their Saudi exposure to the weighting following an Aramco IPO the total inflows could be $68 billion. Data published in March by fund tracking firm EPFR Global Funds found evidence that investors have warmed to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. Looking at single country equity funds, Saudi Arabia attracted record setting flows as investors looked for alternatives to Russia and Turkey, the data showed.  GRAPHIC - Aramco's suitors: tmsnrt.rs/2xSgSST With the prospect of a listing in London and New York receding, sources familiar with the IPO told Reuters that Hong Kong was now emerging as an increasingly likely compromise because Riyadh wants to help Asian nations that are expected to become cornerstone investors. While London is preferred over New York, the requirement by both for greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco than the Hong Kong exchange is viewed as a drawback by some Saudi officials and advisers, the sources said. Saudi Aramco said on Monday it was still reviewing its options for the initial public offering. A final decision will be made by Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom’s economic and oil policies.  Sources have told Reuters it requires a bourse at least six month to prepare for a listing so a decision would need to be taken in April for the IPO to go ahead this year. Tadawul’s chief said in October that his exchange hoped to be the only venue. But with a total capitalisation of about $475 billion, it could struggle to absorb Aramco without the participation of foreign funds. Sources close to the process, however, said even with emerging market status, Aramco would struggle to raise $100 billion locally. Bankers and analysts said an Aramco float risked drowning out other shares listed on Tadawul, given daily turnover now is about $1.6 billion. “They can do a nominal 2 to 2.5 percent listing,” one of the sources said.

That could mean $13.6 billion could come into Saudi stocks from passive investors and if active investors also increased their Saudi exposure to the weighting following an Aramco IPO the total inflows could be $68 billion.

2018-03-13,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is increasingly looking to just float oil giant Saudi Aramco locally as plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on an international exchange such as London or New York hang in the balance, sources close to the process said. The kingdom is counting on being awarded emerging market status by index complier MSCI in June to help Saudi Aramco attract Western funds, in addition to cornerstone investors from China, Japan and South Korea, the sources said. “I would guess it is about evens that there will be no international IPO,” said a high-level source familiar with the preparations, saying they were proving to be a disappointment.  Saudi Arabia is planning to list up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco in an initial public offering that could value it at up to $2 trillion and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week that Aramco was too important to risk listing in the United States because of litigation concerns, such as existing lawsuits against rival oil companies for their role in climate change. British officials have been told by Saudi counterparts London has a chance to secure the listing but only in 2019 at the earliest, according to the Financial Times, and sources told Reuters the kingdom was now focusing on a listing on the local exchange, or Tadawul. “The only thing we know today is that Tadawul will be the key listing location as our national exchange,” Falih told CNN. “We are waiting for the reforms to be in place and to join MSCI and Aramco listing in Tadawul will be catalytic for that capital market as we bring international capital to the kingdom,” he told the U.S. channel last week. The initial public offering is the centrepiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also boost the kingdom’s budget which has been hit by low oil prices. Initially planned for 2018, preparations have been hit by rows over whether Aramco should list on major Western markets at all. An advisory council to the government asked the securities regulator this year to study the impact of a local listing amid concern a huge IPO could harm the market. MSCI has proposed giving its existing Saudi Arabia stock index emerging market status rather than standalone status following a series of market reforms by the kingdom such as raising caps on foreign ownership of companies. MSCI will give its decision in June and, if positive, the reclassification would be in two steps in May and August 2019. According to an update of the MSCI proposal published in February, Saudi Arabia would have a market capitalisation of $124 billion (£89.3 billion) in MSCI’s Emerging Markets Index, giving it an index weight of 2.3 percent, on a par with Thailand. Based on the assumption that another $100 billion would be added through an Aramco initial public offering, the kingdom’s weighting would rise to about 4 percent, which would be bigger than Russia’s weighting of 3.4 percent, for example. If MSCI grants Saudi Arabia emerging market status, it could be seen as a reason to push against an international listing, the sources close to the listing process said. Passive investment funds that replicate MSCI indexes would need to put 4 percent of their funds allocated to emerging market indexes into Saudi shares to match the country weighting.

2018-03-13,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: LNG supply growth: reut.rs/2ouZHQT By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 13 (Reuters) - Crude oil is likely to spring to mind if one is asked to name a commodity where the United States is disrupting the market by becoming a swing producer and challenging traditional trade flows, especially in fast-growing Asian markets. But it’s increasingly likely that the United States is about to play the same role in liquefied natural gas (LNG), as it ramps up production in an already well-supplied market. Much has been written recently about how the expected glut in LNG supply is unlikely to materialise, given the rapid growth of demand for the super-chilled fuel in Asia, especially in China, which is now second only to Japan as an importer. Major producer Royal Dutch Shell warned last month of an impending supply gap that will need more than $200 billion of investment by 2030 as the natural gas market grows faster than that for any other source of energy. There is nothing wrong with Shell’s bullish forecast, and there is certainly renewed interest around the world in developing LNG projects to meet forecast demand. Investment in LNG projects fell off a cliff in recent years as the industry dealt with the ramifications of rapid supply growth, which has seen Australia add eight new large-scale plants, while the United States is busy commissioning the second of its new export projects, with five more to come by 2019. While Shell and others may well be correct about the need for new plants to meet demand by 2030, it’s the next couple of years that could prove challenging for the LNG industry. Most of the new capacity built in Australia was done under the old industry model where long-term offtake contracts, often linked to crude oil prices, allowed for the financing of billions of dollars of capital investment with extended payback terms. The model has been somewhat different in the United States, with far less of the upcoming production committed to buyers, meaning more will be sold at spot prices linked to U.S. benchmark Henry Hub natural gas. This is where the role of the United States in LNG starts to look eerily similar to the role its shale oil producers are playing in crude oil markets. Traditional exporters, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, have found it tougher than expected to push crude oil prices higher, mainly because customers, especially in Asia have been able to turn to alternative suppliers. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, have met some success in draining excess global crude inventories, it’s come at the expense of market share in the fast-growing Asian demand region. This can be seen in the customs data for China, the world’s largest crude importer. In 2017, Saudi Arabia’s share of China’s imports was 12.4 percent, a drop from 13.4 percent the prior year. The share enjoyed by the United States, meanwhile, rose from 0.13 percent to 1.84 percent. While the United States is far from a major threat to Saudi Arabia in Asia, when you add in gains by other smaller exporters not part of the OPEC and allies output-cutting deal, it starts to add up. Brazil’s share of China’s crude imports rose from 5 percent in 2016 to 5.5 percent last year. Shipments from Britain went from 1.3 percent to 2 percent in 2017. Just as shale as roiled crude oil markets, it’s likely that U.S. shale gas will have the same effect, at least until demand growth eliminates the coming supply surplus. The United States will add about 50 million tonnes of annual capacity by 2020, assuming all the projects currently under construction are delivered on schedule. China sourced 45.4 percent of its LNG from Australia and 19.7 percent from Qatar in 2017, and just 3.9 percent from the United States. But China’s imports of 1.5 million tonnes of LNG from the United States in 2017 was 661 percent higher than for the previous year, and the risk is that as new U.S. output comes online, it will aggressively compete in Asia. While Chinese demand for LNG has surprised to the upside, with growth of 46.4 percent to 38.1 million tonnes in 2017, it still may be a challenge for the market to absorb all the additional tonnes, not just from the United States but also from smaller projects, mainly in Africa. Like the rise of shale oil as an export force, the coming U.S. LNG wave will disrupt traditional flows across the globe. Similar to shale oil, U.S. LNG is being produced and exported from the Atlantic Basin, but the overwhelming growth in demand is in Asia. While U.S. LNG will be competitive in Latin America, it also will likely displace cargoes from Qatar in Europe, meaning the world’s top producer of LNG will be forced to sell more in Asia, just as Australia is snapping at its heels for bragging rights at the biggest exporter. A buyer-led shift to more flexible contracts will see traditional relationships stretched, as will the increasing activities of trading houses keen to get in on the market. Seasonal demand volatility, particularly from China, will also serve to test the market, with the likelihood that the winter peak will be bigger than before, with the attendant risk that the shoulder seasons either side of cold weather will be weaker. Overall, the LNG market is going to have to adapt to the arrival of U.S. production, but where liquefied gas differs from crude oil is in not having an established producer group that can coordinate a response.

Spreadbetters expected a slightly lower start for European stocks, with Britain’s FTSE dipping 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX inching down 0.05 percent and France’s CAC shedding 0.07 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent after spending much of the day swerving in and out of negative territory. The index had surged 1.5 percent on Monday following firm U.S. jobs numbers on Friday, while low wage growth eased concerns about inflation and faster central bank rate hikes. But a mixed performance by U.S. shares overnight tempered the rally. The S&P 500 and the Dow slipped on Monday as the U.S. tariffs signed into law last week weighed on industrials, while a rise in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq to a new record high. Japan’s Nikkei recouped earlier losses and rose 0.7 percent, with gains in chip-related technology shares helping offset losses in steelmakers and automakers still weighed by concerns about U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. Shanghai dipped 0.1 percent. Tech-heavy South Korean and Taiwan shares advanced 0.15 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. “Concerns towards trade conflict stemming from U.S. tariffs continue to linger in the background, capping risk appetite, pushing Treasury yields lower which in turn weighing on the dollar,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “That said, there are still bright spots that bode well for broader risk sentiment, as the Nasdaq’s gains shows.” Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked Singapore-based semiconductor maker Broadcom Ltd’s takeover bid of Qualcomm Inc on grounds of national security, ending what would have been the technology industry’s biggest deal ever. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.1 percent to 89.999 after shedding about 0.2 percent overnight. The euro was little changed at $1.2329 after gaining 0.25 percent overnight. The U.S. currency was up 0.3 percent at 106.740 yen, trimming some losses after a suspected cover-up of a cronyism scandal put Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe and his close ally, Finance Minister Taro Aso, under fresh pressure. Although such doubts have lent support to the yen, the concerns over Japanese political risks have had a relatively minor effect on wider markets so far, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore. “I’m not sure if that’s going to be enough to get us out of this current little risk revival mode that the market is in,” Innes said. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield stood little changed at 2.879 percent. The yield declined by 2.5 basis points overnight. In commodities, crude oil prices extended losses after sliding the previous day amid ongoing concerns over rising U.S. output. U.S. crude futures lost 3 cents to $61.32 per barrel after losing 68 cents the previous day. Brent dipped 2 cents to $64.93 per barrel.

2018-03-13,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will on Tuesday hail the role of international law in settling regional conflicts, comments apparently aimed at bolstering Australian efforts to build a coalition against Chinese assertiveness. Bishop, in a speech ahead of a special meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Sydney, will not name China but will argue that international law will stabilise a region strained by rival claims in the South China Sea. “The rules-based order is designed to regulate behaviour and rivalries of and between states, and ensure countries compete fairly and in a way that does not threaten others or destabilise their region or the world,” Bishop will say in Sydney, according to a leaked draft of the speech seen by the Australian Financial Review. “It places limitations on the extent to which countries use their economic or military power to impose unfair agreements on less powerful nations.” China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with no claim to the South China Sea, has long maintained its neutrality on the dispute to protect economic relationship with China. But with Australia’s relations with China souring in recent months, Bishop’s comment underscore a new Australian tactic. “Australia is trying to get ASEAN on side with the notion that China is a rule-breaker that everyone would be better served by abiding by,” said Nick Bisley, professor of international relations at Melbourne’s La Trobe University. “If it can get ASEAN to use that language, it will strengthen Australia’s position considerably.” ASEAN and China in August begun talks to develop a code of conduct for the South China Sea, though a deal is unlikely before 2019, Singapore’s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in February. The issue of the South China Sea is set to dominate the unofficial agenda of a special three-day meeting of ASEAN countries and Australia beginning on Friday. Officially, the summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the 10 members ASEAN and Australia, and countering the threat of Islamist militants returning to the region from the Middle East. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to travel to Sydney where she will hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is under pressure to publicly condemn the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s Rakhine State over recent months.

2018-03-13,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Oil majors are evaluating bids for offshore exploration rights in Argentina, a major change in a country that sent Spanish energy giant Repsol (REP.MC) packing six years ago and has seen little offshore exploration for decades. To secure bids, Argentina will need to show it has moved beyond its historical fluctuations between free-market policies and left-wing populism and that it has made progress in lowering costs for energy firms. Oil companies including Shell and Statoil told Reuters they are looking at bidding in the auctions, to be held later this year, and a government official said Exxon and Chevron have also shown interest. The country faces fierce competition to attract the billions of dollars of investment needed to develop deepwater reserves. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and neighbouring Uruguay will all auction offshore blocks in 2018 after undertaking oil market reforms or revising contract terms to facilitate the entry of the world’s top energy companies. For Big Oil, the potential access to Latin American energy reserves is unprecedented. In many countries now opening, including Argentina, resource nationalism has long barred their entry or limited opportunities. Six years ago, former populist President Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol’s (REP.MC) stake in Argentina’s state-owned oil company YPF SA (YPFD.BA). The move sent chills through both the energy industry and the entire private sector. Interviews with oil industry executives, consultants, geologists and officials point to optimism for Argentina’s upcoming auctions and for President Mauricio Macri’s government, which has sought private sector and U.S. government help in structuring the process. “Growing confidence in the current government’s policies - their focus on trying to create an environment that is attractive for investments - has been the big change,” Shell’s (RDSa.L) head of deepwater Wael Sawan told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry gathering in Houston. “It’s that focus that has created more interest by the sector to say ‘why not, let’s look at this.’” The auction will be a test of company confidence in the longevity of Macri’s reform agenda because it can take a decade between an initial investment in offshore exploration and the first production. Argentina will take bids for three offshore basins from July through November. Exploration rights for blocks in the 130,000-square km Argentina Basin, 90,000-square km Malvinas West Basin and 5,000 square kilometres in the Austral Basin are on offer. While little exploration has been done outside the Austral basin, YPF has identified 22 million barrels of oil equivalent for further investigation, upstream head Pablo Bizotto said at an event last Wednesday. “There is a lot of interest from large companies - Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell,” Daniel Redondo, the secretary for strategic energy planning in Argentina’s Energy Ministry, told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event.  Consultancy Bain & Company, on a contract with the government to gauge interest, last year interviewed more than 60 companies, including “all the majors” and independent explorers including Anadarko (APC.N) and Hunt Oil, said Diego Garcia, a Buenos Aires-based Bain partner. Colombia’s Ecopetrol may bid in the auctions, its chief executive told Reuters. Norway’s Statoil STL.OL, which already has onshore drilling projects in Argentina, is partnering with YPF on offshore seismic studies and is “considering future licensing rounds,” a spokesman said. “Huge areas of the Argentinian continental shelf will be available for bids from companies,” executive vice president for exploration Tim Dodson said at an event in Buenos Aires last Wednesday. “We have of course started our evaluations already.”  Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon (XOM.N) declined to comment. Anadarko and Hunt did not respond to requests for comment. Firms likely won’t decide whether to bid until the full terms of the auction are published. Macri’s government has enacted pro-market reforms across the economy. His ‘Let’s Change’ coalition swept to victory in midterm elections last October, taking advantage of divisions within the opposition Peronist movement, which is generally defined by strong defence of labour rights and national sovereignty. Macri is on course to become the first non-Peronist president to finish his term since Argentina’s return to democracy in 1983. He’s expected to stand for re-election starting in late 2019. The decision to hold offshore auctions comes as Argentina struggles to attract investment to its Vaca Muerta shale play, which is in a remote part of Argentina that lacks infrastructure to get oil and gas to consumers. Argentina is home to the world’s No. 2 resources of shale gas and the fourth largest of shale oil, estimates the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Yet oil production peaked in 1998 and gas output topped out in 2004, according to Energy Ministry data. Investment in exploration has dried up since the country’s 2001 financial crisis and the populist political response. Under the terms of a 2014 revision to Argentina’s hydrocarbons law, which was well-received by industry, royalties paid to the national government will be 12 percent of the value of hydrocarbons extracted and companies would receive exploration rights for three years, with an option to extend for three years. Rights for each exploration block would be awarded to the company that pledges the most investment, as laid out in the law, Garcia said. “Companies will be interested in studying something that has not been explored,” said Daniel Gerold of G&G Energy Consultants in Buenos Aires, who said the regional competition was unlikely to be an obstacle for Argentina. “I do not think the big players will have used up all their exploration capital in Mexico.”  The majors would likely be most interested in the large Argentina Basin, the least explored of the three on offer, Bain’s Garcia said. By contrast, the Austral Basin just off the coast of Tierra del Fuego would be more of a gas play to serve the domestic market and could appeal to local players and Total, which already operates in the area, he said. The Malvinas West basin could be most appealing to exploration-focused independent oil firms, he said. Perth, Australia-based Searcher Seismic began analysing existing data on Argentina’s offshore formations in November 2016, smelling opportunity in an economic and political opening, and launched a full database for exploration companies in early February. “This should have been done a long time ago in Argentina,” Searcher director Odd Larsen said. “But the politics and the finances unfortunately held Argentina back for a very long time.” Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga and Ron Bousso in Houston and Juliana Castilla in Buenos Aires; Editing by Caroline Stauffer and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/argentina-energy-offshore/analysis-oil-majors-interest-in-argentina-tests-free-market-reforms-idUKL2N1QC1SP,13 Mar 2018,"Oil majors are evaluating

2018-03-13,"CANONSBURG, Pa., March 13 (Reuters) - Republicans are scrambling to avoid a political disaster in a conservative district of Pennsylvania, where a pro-gun, pro-union Democrat who opposes abortion could be about to win a congressional election in one of President Donald Trump’s white, working-class strongholds. Democrat Conor Lamb, a 33-year-old Marine veteran and former federal prosecutor, is in a dead heat with Republican state Representative Rick Saccone in Tuesday’s special election for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives that Republicans have held since 2003. The race is seen as a referendum on Trump and a harbinger for November’s congressional midterm elections, according to pollsters and party insiders who say the moderate Democrat could emerge as a model for Democratic candidates in other competitive House districts that Trump carried in 2016. “The Democrats have nominated the ideal candidate, because he fits the profile of the electorate. If they’d nominated a liberal who allowed the campaign to become nationalized, it would be over by now,” said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin and Marshall College Poll in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. “If he wins, or even if he just comes close, he is a model for Democrats in competitive Trump districts nationally.” Trump won the district, in southwest Pennsylvania, by nearly 20 points in 2016. Republican dominance has been so strong here that Democrats ran no candidates in the last two U.S. House elections, even though state voter registration records show Democrats outnumbering Republicans. But the dynamics have changed in the district, which runs from wealthy suburbs south of Pittsburgh through hardscrabble steel and coal mining towns to farmlands along the West Virginia border. Saccone, 60, a conservative who has described himself as “Trump before Trump was Trump,” led the race by more than 10 percentage points in January. The contest has since narrowed to a toss-up on a wave of Democratic voter enthusiasm for Lamb. A Monmouth University poll on Monday showed Lamb ahead. Bob Zelleznick, 59, of Bethel Park, said he intends to vote for Lamb and hopes for a Democratic win that would make the White House sit up and take notice. “This is important because I think it will send a message to Washington: a lot of people are unhappy with the administration,” Zelleznick said. The White House has arranged a string of visits to energize Saccone’s base. Trump himself has visited twice. The area has also seen Vice President Mike Pence, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, and on the eve of Election Day, the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. “When President Trump’s in your corner, how can you lose?” Saccone told supporters at a weekend rally with the president. A college professor and former Air Force counterintelligence officer, Saccone won an endorsement from the influential Pittsburgh Post-Gazette newspaper, which praised his greater experience and knowledge of the district. “He supports small business owners and would do anything for you to make sure that your business is successful,” said Stephanie Squibb, 48, of Elizabeth, who owns a local printing company. But Saccone has not had much luck running on the Republican national agenda. Tax cuts, the Republican Party’s only major achievement under Trump, have done little to energize local voters, some of whom dismiss the sweeping tax overhaul as a giveaway to the wealthy. Republicans see the president’s plans to impose steel and aluminum import tariffs as a way to generate enough enthusiasm among Trump’s blue-collar supporters to counteract the energy of Lamb’s backers. “They’re hoping this is something that potentially, in the grand calculus, could throw Saccone over the top,” said Republican strategist Ford O’Connell. While the district has just over 500,000 registered voters, U.S. Labor Department statistics show that metal production accounts for less than 10,000 jobs. Lamb, who has the backing of unionized steelworkers, says he agrees with the planned tariffs. His campaign claims to have reached more than 100,000 households with pledges to protect union jobs and pensions along with Medicare and Social Security programs for the elderly that account for nearly one out of every five local residents. Republicans have also found it harder than expected to mount effective attacks on Lamb’s positions on abortion, guns and the national Democratic Party. He has eschewed the national Democratic brand, saying he would not support House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi as speaker. But Lamb did get help from former Vice President Joe Biden, a favorite among Rust Belt Democrats. Lamb says he personally opposes abortion but accepts the Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe vs. Wade landmark decision allowing abortion as the law of the land. He favors enforcing existing gun laws and improving the current system of background checks over setting new gun restrictions. The contest to replace Republican Tim Murphy, who resigned last year, is the fifth competitive special House election since Trump took office. After a victory in Virginia and a Senate upset in conservative Alabama, Democrats are dreaming about another win that would suggest the Republicans might struggle to retain control of the House. Democrats need to pick up 24 seats to gain House control in November. Of the 85 races currently viewed as competitive, 55 are in congressional districts that Trump won in 2016, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Tuesday’s election has little bearing on the current balance of power in the House. Lamb has dramatically outraised Saccone by pulling in $3.9 million since last October. Outside Republican groups, led by the National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional Leadership, Fund have spent at least $8.1 million to keep Saccone afloat, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in campaigns. Democratic groups have spent about $1 million to oppose Saccone in support of Lamb, the Center said. Pennsylvania’s congressional district lines have been redrawn for November by the state supreme court, which will require Lamb and Saccone to run again in separate new districts if they hope to serve in Congress after 2018.

2018-03-13,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index flat, Nikkei down 0.15 pct * Dollar sags, tracking dip in U.S. yields * Markets await U.S. consumer prices data for cues * Crude oil extends decline after overnight slide By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, March 13 (Reuters) - Asian stocks stalled on Tuesday as Wall Street shares lost steam, while the dollar sagged on the back of declining U.S. yields. Investors were focused on U.S. inflation data due later in the day (1230 GMT) for clues on the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate rises this year. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed by mid-morning. The index had surged 1.5 percent on Monday following firm U.S. jobs numbers on Friday, while low wage growth eased concerns about inflation and faster central bank rate hikes. But a mixed performance by U.S. shares overnight cooled investor risk appetite in Asia. The S&P 500 and the Dow slipped on Monday as the U.S. tariffs signed into law last week weighed on industrials, while gains in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq to a new record high. Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent, with shares in steelmakers and automakers still battered by concerns about U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. Some market participants say a political scandal engulfing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government is raising doubts about his ability to pursue economic reform, undermining stock market sentiment. Australian shares lost 0.7 percent , while Shanghai dipped 0.1 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI was effectively flat, faring better as major tech shares such as SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics rose following gains by their U.S. peers. “Concerns towards trade conflict stemming from U.S. tariffs continue to linger in the background, capping risk appetite, pushing Treasury yields lower which in turn weighing on the dollar,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “That said, there are still bright spots that bode well for broader risk sentiment, as the Nasdaq’s gains shows.” Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked Singapore-based semiconductor maker Broadcom Ltd’s takeover bid of Qualcomm Inc on grounds of national security, ending what would have been the technology industry’s biggest deal ever. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was flat at 89.891 after shedding about 0.2 percent overnight. The euro was a shade higher at $1.2337, adding to overnight gains of 0.25 percent. The U.S. currency was down 0.05 percent at 106.350 yen as the renewed political scandal in Japan pushed it off last week’s peak above 107.00. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield stood little changed at 2.877 percent. The yield declined by 2.5 basis points overnight. In commodities, crude oil prices extended losses after sliding the previous day amid ongoing concerns over rising U.S. output. U.S. crude futures lost 0.3 percent to $61.19 per barrel after losing 0.8 percent the previous day. Brent fell 0.3 percent to $64.76 per barrel.

2018-03-13,"(Adds comments from biofuel groups) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted a bankrupt Philadelphia oil refining company a reprieve from complying with the nation’s renewable fuel laws, according to a settlement agreement filed on Monday. The refiner, Carlyle Group-backed Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), filed for bankruptcy protection in January and asked a judge to waive some $350 million in compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. The EPA and PES agreed on Monday that the refiner would only have to satisfy about half those costs, but would face more scrutiny moving forward, court documents showed. The settlement is facing early opposition from ethanol groups. The settlement comes amid a fight between powerful corn and oil interests in Washington over the future of the RFS program. President Donald Trump has sought to bring the two sides together in recent weeks to come up with reforms that can lower the cost for refiners without hurting demand for biofuels, wading into an issue that divides two important constituencies. The PES bankruptcy - and the potential loss of 1,100 jobs in a key electoral state - had fueled calls for change. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits from those who do. PES, which lacks blending facilities, entered into bankruptcy owing 467 million credits from 2016 and 2017, with only 210 million credits in hand, the filing showed. The EPA said PES could comply with the program by turning over its available credits and would be excused from any shortfall, a huge win for the refiner. It said the deal would cover the company up until the point it exits bankruptcy. After exiting bankruptcy, PES would have to comply with the law on a semi-annual basis as opposed to annually and submit itself to more EPA scrutiny. It would face penalties for non-compliance with the agreement. Neither EPA nor PES responded to requests for comment. PES has blamed its financial woes on the cost of buying the credits.. But Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners. The private equity firm Carlyle Group rescued the refinery from shutting in 2012, putting up $175 million for majority control of the company. The majority of the dividends paid to the Carlyle-led investor group were backed by loans taken against the refinery’s assets. The deal will be open for public comment for 10 days before it is finalized, and biofuel groups are showing early opposition. “Under this settlement, it looks like the Carlyle Group gets to keep that cash while avoiding investing in U.S. biofuels and long-term job security for Philadelphia workers. If that’s the case, this is a massive handout,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council, said. Bob Dinneen, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group was still evaluating the settlement, “but at first blush, this strikes us as rewarding bombast behavior and it sets an extraordinarily bad precedent.” The case is #18-10122 (KG), in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.20 a barrel at 0122 GMT, down 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $64.80 per barrel, down 15 cents, or 0.2 percent. Both crude benchmarks dropped by around 1 percent the previous session. “Oil prices fell on the back of concerns that surging U.S. production ... could push inventories in the U.S. higher,” ANZ bank said on Tuesday. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA soared past 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in late 2017, overtaking output by top exporter Saudi Arabia. U.S. production is expected to rise above 11 million bpd by late 2018, taking the top spot from Russia, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The rising U.S. output comes largely on the back of onshore shale oil production. U.S. crude production from major shale formations is expected to rise by 131,000 bpd in April from the previous month to a record high 6.95 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly productivity report on Monday. That expected increase would top the 105,000 bpd climb in March from the previous month, to what was then expected to be a record high of 6.82 million bpd, the EIA said. The EIA is due to publish its latest weekly U.S. production data on Wednesday. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-03-13,"* Chad has taken “important steps” - Tillerson * Visit focused on security allies * Tillerson returning a day early (Adds U.S. statement on Tillerson meeting with Nigeria’s Buhari, paragraph 16) N’DJAMENA, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Monday that Washington was considering lifting a travel ban on Chad, offering an olive branch to an ally in the fight against Islamist militant groups in West Africa. The top U.S. diplomat flew into the Chadian capital, N’Djamena, on the last day of a truncated tour of Africa with stops in Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Nigeria - all frontline partners against Islamic State and al Qaeda offshoots. It was his first diplomatic visit to the continent where many are still smarting from U.S. President Donald Trump’s reported dismissal of states there as “shithole” countries in January. Trump later denied making the comment. Tillerson said Chad had taken important steps to strengthen control over its security and passports. “These steps I think are going to allow us to begin to normalise the travel relationship with Chad,” he told reporters. A report on Chad’s progress was being prepared in Washington and would be reviewed by Trump next month, Tillerson said. “We have to wait for the final report,” he added. Tillerson, who met Chadian President Idriss Deby previously while serving as chief executive of ExxonMobil, said he was concerned about the presence of Islamic State-allied militants in the Sahel and called Chad an “important partner”. In September, The Trump administration added Chad - along with North Korea and Venezuela - to a list of countries whose citizens are restricted from travelling to the United States. That drew protests from Chad and others, including France, which works closely with the Chadian military. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said at the time that Chad had to failed to send proof that it had taken a number of security measures. Chad’s Deby “expressed his incomprehension” about the ban during a meeting with Tillerson on Monday, Foreign Minister Cherif Mahamat Zene said. Tillerson flew to Nigeria after Chad for a stay of just a few hours, less than the overnight visit originally planned. His entourage said he had been forced to cut short the African tour on Monday to return to deal with urgent work in Washington. He held talks with President Muhammadu Buhari behind closed doors in the capital, Abuja. Following their talks, Buhari’s office issued a statement saying the president discussed plans to negotiate for the release of 110 girls abducted from a school in the northeastern town of Dapchi last month rather than use a military option . The girls are suspected of having been abducted by members of Boko Haram. Tillerson also held a news conference with Nigeria’s foreign affairs minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, during which he said the United States was helping Nigeria in the fight against the jihadist group and in the hunt for the missing girls. “Supporting, equipping, training and we can advise and provide information - I think that’s the best way we can help the government of Nigeria secure the release of these girls which we hope will be done in a peaceful manner,” he said. In a statement issued later on Monday, the U.S. State Department said that during Tillerson’s meeting with Buhari, the secretary of state recognized Nigeria’s leadership in efforts to defeat Islamist militant groups in West Africa, and expressed concern about the recent attacks and abductions. The Africa tour coincided with several urgent foreign policy developments, including Thursday’s announcement that Trump will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

2018-03-13,"(Repeats with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DmlwXg By John Kemp LONDON, March 12 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have resumed liquidating their bullish long positions in crude oil and refined fuels amid more signs that the earlier rally in prices has fizzled out. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 50 million barrels in the week to March 6. The reduction largely reversed an increase of 68 million barrels the previous week, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2DmlwXg). Portfolio managers have now reduced their net long position in petroleum in five of the last six weeks by a total of 245 million barrels since Jan. 23. The most recent week saw a reduction in net length in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-17 million barrels), Brent (-5 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-5 million) and European gasoil (-13 million). Some of the froth has blown off the market in the last six weeks but the hedge fund community still has a very bullish bias towards oil prices. Fund managers hold a net long position in the six major petroleum contracts amounting to 1,239 million barrels of oil, a level of bullishness that had never been seen until four months ago. Long positions still outnumbered short positions by a ratio of 10:1, down from a peak of almost 12:1 in January, but again a level of bullishness that was unprecedented until this year. With so many long positions already established, and few remaining short positions to cover, oil prices have struggled to rise further in recent weeks. Instead the market has seen a slow but steady liquidation with existing longs cut by a total of almost 250 million barrels (15 percent) since Jan. 23. It remains uncertain whether this is merely a pause and the price rally will resume shortly, or whether it marks a temporary peak, with more liquidation and price falls to come. But the balance of risks remains tilted towards the downside in the short term given the huge number of long positions still hanging over the market.
