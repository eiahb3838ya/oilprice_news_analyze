2018-04-05,"(Updates with new Trump comments) By Jeff Mason and Timothy Gardner ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - P resident Donald Trump said on Thursday he would take a look into ethics allegations against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt over his condo lease and other issues, but added the official was doing a “fantastic job.” Pruitt has loyally executed Trump’s deregulatory agenda with plans to roll back Obama-era programs cutting emissions from power plants and vehicles. His efforts to slash regulations have helped make Trump popular in coal, natural gas, and oil-producing states. “I think that Scott has done a fantastic job,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One after a trip to West Virginia. “I just left coal and energy country. They love Scott Pruitt.” Still, Trump said he would make a determination about the ethics issues. The White House is probing Pruitt’s lease of a room in a high-end Washington neighborhood for $50 a night in a townhouse co-owned by the wife of energy industry lobbyist Steven Hart, who lobbies for companies regulated by the EPA. Pruitt has told the Washington Examiner in an interview that he was “dumbfounded” his renting of the room in a townhouse was controversial and said his ethics officials reviewed the lease. But the EPA’s ethics office suggested there still could be questions about Pruitt’s housing arrangement. Pruitt, a vocal doubter of mainstream climate change science, also is facing criticism for frequent first-class air travel, spending on costly items in his office, including a $43,000 soundproof telephone booth, and for a trip to Morocco in which he promoted U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas. While Trump appears to support Pruitt, the president can be fickle. Last autumn, Trump said he had confidence in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, even after their relationship was strained by differences of opinion on Iran and Russia policy. Trump fired Tillerson in March. In late March, the EPA’s ethics office cleared Pruitt of accepting an illegal gift from a lobbyist with the condo lease, saying a number of other rooms nearby were available for rent for a similar or lower price. But the office issued a memo, dated on Wednesday and seen by Reuters, that the earlier review did not consider whether Pruitt had violated other ethics rules with the lease. Kevin Minoli, a top ethics official in the EPA’s Office of General Counsel, said in the memo that the review did not address issues such as a rule requiring officials to avoid behavior that could result in their impartiality being questioned. “It is important to note that the federal ethics regulations regarding impartiality apply regardless of whether something involves receiving a prohibited gift,” he wrote. In a separate statement about the memo, Minoli said it explained the ethical issues beyond the scope of the original review. The impartiality rule requires that government officials avoid doing things that could create an “appearance of favoritism in government decision-making,” according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. In the memo, first reported by CNN, Minoli also said he did not have access to enough information to determine whether Pruitt’s actual use of the townhouse was consistent with the lease. Trump’s support for Pruitt, which he also voiced on Tuesday, comes even as U.S. lawmakers, including three fellow Republicans, called for his resignation over the ethics questions. More questions surfaced as Trump commented on Pruitt. Five EPA officials were reassigned, demoted or requested new jobs over the past year after they complained about Pruitt’s spending, a report by the New York Times said.

2018-04-05,"(Reuters) - Fourteen states filed suit on Thursday accusing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of failing to issue regulations for curbing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse pollutant, from existing oil and gas operations as required under the Clean Air Act. The legal challenge, led by New York state, came nine months after a federal appeals court sided with environmental activists who sued to block the EPA from freezing enforcement of its own rules to control methane leaks from new or modified fossil fuel facilities. In both instances, EPA chief Scott Pruitt has been accused of putting the interests of oil and gas companies ahead of the  agency’s obligation to protect air quality, including the control of heat-trapping pollutants that scientists blame for global climate change. Pruitt, who was a leading EPA critic as attorney general of the oil-producing state of Oklahoma before beginning his tenure as head of the EPA, has said he does not believe greenhouse gas emissions are the principal driver of climate change. As EPA administrator, Pruitt has moved to carry out U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to roll back or reconsider a slew of environmental protections deemed burdensome by the industry, including climate change regulations. In March 2017 Trump signed an order to undo climate rules. And the EPA that month halted efforts to collect data from fossil fuel operations to prepare performance standards that states would have to follow in devising methane-control measures for existing wells, pipelines, storage tanks, pumping stations and other facilities. It was EPA’s “unreasonable delay” in developing those standards that Thursday’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, cited as a Clean Air Act violation. “The EPA has a clear legal duty to control methane pollution from oil and gas operations,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. “Its continued refusal to do so is not only illegal, but threatens our public health and environment.” The lawsuit prepared by his office was joined by California, and 12 other states including Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Vermont and Iowa, as well as the District of Columbia and the city of Chicago.  Pruitt was named as the sole defendant in the complaint, which seeks a court order compelling the EPA to devise and issue the emissions standards in question. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Methane, the main component of commercially distributed natural gas, is also a byproduct of oil extraction. Pound for pound, it traps significantly more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas, though its effects are shorter-lived. The oil and gas industry accounts for nearly third of all U.S. methane emissions, according to an EPA report cited in the lawsuit. The overwhelming bulk of those emissions, equivalent to 328 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, come from facilities in existence prior to 2012, the complaint said. The lawsuit cited an Environmental Defense Fund study that found the industry could cut methane emissions 40 percent below projected 2018 levels at an average annual cost of less than a penny per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced. The study said that reduction could save the U.S. economy more than $100 million a year.

2018-04-05,"OKLAHOMA CITY, April 5 (Reuters) - Thousands of Oklahoma teachers packed the state Capitol on Thursday to lobby lawmakers in the cash-strapped state for quick approval of a revenue package they say could end a walkout that has closed public schools for most of the week. Chanting: “One day longer, one day stronger,” the teachers rallied outside the Republican-controlled Senate, where debate is set to start on Friday on the package that includes higher hotel taxes and increasing revenue from casinos. The Oklahoma House of Representatives approved a $20 million internet sales tax on Wednesday as part of a revenue package aimed at ending a statewide walkout by the state’s teachers, who rank among the lowest paid in the country. They are seeking higher wages and more education funding. The walkout, now in its fourth day, is the latest upheaval by teachers in a Republican-dominated state after a successful West Virginia strike last month ended with a pay raise. Scores of school districts in Oklahoma will remain shuttered on Friday, including the two largest. “Our goal is to fully deliver on a teacher pay raise,” Republican Oklahoma Senate Majority Leader Greg Treat told reporters. “We did that last week and we’re going to come through this week and replace the revenue that we had to take out to pass the package,” he said. Last week, lawmakers approved the state’s first major tax increase in a quarter century, a $450 million revenue package that would have raised teacher pay by an average of about $6,000. That was not enough for the teachers, seeking $10,000 over three years. Even with the pay raise approved by lawmakers, they would still receive lower mean salaries than teachers in every neighboring state, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. A major cause for the budget strain comes from tax breaks the state has granted to its energy industry, which were worth $470 million in fiscal year 2015 alone. Oklahoma has some of the lowest taxes on oil and gas production in the United States. In contrast to other energy states that see tax windfalls during boom years, Oklahoma was not able fill state coffers even when times were good. When energy prices experienced a sharp decline a few years ago, so did Oklahoma tax revenue, leading to deeper cuts in education spending, which was already on the decline. On a state level, the inflation-adjusted general funding per student in Oklahoma dropped by 28.2 percent between 2008 and 2018, the biggest reduction of any state, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As a consequence of low pay at home and better opportunities across state lines, Oklahoma is grappling with a teacher shortage that has forced some school districts to cut curricula, go to a four-day school week and deploy nearly 2,000 emergency-certified instructors as a stopgap measure.

2018-04-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained and equity markets around the world jumped on Thursday as fears eased of a trade war between China and the United States after Washington expressed a willingness to negotiate. The dollar rose to a three-week high against the Japanese yen and a 10-week peak versus the Swiss franc, two safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of market uncertainty. U.S. Treasury yields rose to one-week highs as risk appetite returned on the reduced fear of a trade war and on expectations a growing economy will be confirmed on Friday when the closely watched U.S. employment report for March is released.

2018-04-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - A lawmaker in President Emmanuel Macron’s party has officially asked for a parliamentary investigation into the legality of French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, days before the kingdom’s crown prince arrives in France. Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back military support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are  leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million with no sign of a diplomatic breakthrough to ease the crisis.  Seventy-five percent of French people want Macron to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a YouGov poll found. Several rights groups also have warned of possible legal action if the government does not halt its sales.  Sebastien Nadot, a lawmaker elected last year as part of hundreds of new parliamentarians who form Macron’s majority, said on Thursday he and 15 other co-signatories had officially filed a request for a commission of inquiry.  The inquiry asks for a 30-member commission “to study France’s compliance with international commitments regarding  arms export licences, munitions, training, services and assistance that our country has granted during these three years to the belligerents of the conflict in Yemen”.  It remains to be seen whether Nadot will now get the necessary backing from the foreign affairs committee and parliament.  The move by Nadot, which comes just three days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in France for bilateral talks, is surprising in that Macron has faced little opposition in parliament since coming to power last year and commands an overwhelming majority, with few of his lawmakers willing to question the executive’s decisions. France is the world’s third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers. In a briefing ahead of Prince Mohammed’s visit, the French presidency defended its export procedures. “There is a very strict control of arms exports ... which obeys very precise criteria, including the concern for situations in which civilian populations may be endangered “, a French presidential source said. Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defence and economy ministries. Details of licences are not public and, once approved, are rarely reviewed.

2018-04-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, helped by gains in U.S. equities markets and Saudi Arabia’s unexpected hike in crude prices, though crude’s advance was curbed by strength in the dollar.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 gained 31 cents to settle at $68.33 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose 17 cents to settle at $63.54 a barrel. Oil prices drew support as Wall Street rose. Equities investors shrugged off fears of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China and looked forward to the quarterly earnings season. [.N] U.S. officials said the countries could negotiate.  “Oil prices are profiting from the general brightening of sentiment on the markets as signs emerge that the trade dispute is easing between the U.S. and China,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note. Saudi Arabia announced that it would increase its official selling prices of May crude, and the move supported prices, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s kind of bullish that they feel like they can justify those higher prices and not lose market share,” he said. The strength of the U.S. dollar limited oil’s gains, analysts said. The U.S. dollar rose to its highest in more than one month against a basket of major currencies .DXY. Because oil is dollar-priced, a stronger greenback makes purchases in other currencies more expensive.  Market intelligence firm Genscape said inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, rose 2.5 million barrels for the week to April 3, according to traders who saw the data.

2018-04-05,"ROME, April 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The number of plastic bags found in the seas around Britain has significantly dropped since 2010 as European governments crack down on their use, researchers said on Thursday. The percentage of trawls by fishermen that catch at least one plastic bag in the greater North Sea, off Britain’s east coast, more than halved since 2010 to 16 percent, scientists in Britain and the Netherlands said. Prior to 2010, the average was 40 percent, said the study which spanned 25 years. Several European countries, including Ireland, Denmark, France and Britain, have introduced plastic bag levies since 2003, which have led to massive reductions in their use. “The action of all these nations ... meant there are less bags being distributed, less bags ... escaping into the marine environment,” Thomas Maes, co-author of the study, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “If we think a bit more wisely about plastic, especially the single use items we use in our daily life, we can make big changes,” said the marine scientist at Britain’s governmental Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. United Nations figures show 8 million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - enter the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain. Scientists have urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030. In contrast to plastic bags, the researchers found the amount of plastic fishing debris - including nets, floats, buoys - caught has risen. Measures introduced to curb this will take a while to have an impact, Maes said. Several European countries have introduced deposit return schemes for single use bottles in a bid to increase recycling. Britain said it plans to follow later this year as plastic is wreaking havoc on the marine environment – killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading precious habitats. Plastics which have been in the seas for a while may sink into the sea floor, or be torn up and gradually turned into microplastics. They can take hundreds of years to degrade. Cleaning up the oceans is a very complex issue but the crucial thing is to stop more plastic waste entering the seas, and then think about cleaning it up, Maes said. ""We can't be mopping the floor while the tap is still open,"" he said. (Reporting by Alex Whiting @Alexwhi, Editing by Katy Migiro.

There also is a 52 percent probability that a major hurricane will move into the Caribbean Sea during the 2018 season that begins June 1 and runs through Nov. 30, said researchers at Colorado State’s Tropical Meteorology Project.   Its long-range forecast, which expects seven storms to develop into hurricanes, is similar to those recently issued by private forecasters AccuWeather and WeatherBell Analytics. The U.S. Climate Prediction Center will issue its outlook for 2018 in late May, according to Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  “Long-term statistics show that, on average, the more active the overall Atlantic basin hurricane season is, the greater the probability of U.S. hurricane landfall,” wrote authors Philip Klotzbach and Michael Bell in their forecast. A summary of the three forecasts is in the table below. An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 12 named storms of which six become hurricanes, three of them major. Last year, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively. Harvey inundated Houston and forced the partial or complete shutdown of 14 oil refineries including the largest and second largest in the United States. Puerto Rico continues to recover from Maria, which knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents. According to the Colorado State forecast, there is a 39 percent probability a major hurricane will strike the East Coast and a 38 percent probability such a storm will make landfall between the Florida panhandle and Brownsville, Texas.  Both the AccuWeather and Colorado State forecasts point to a weakening La Nina pattern in the Pacific Ocean. La Nina is the name for a pattern of cold ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. The two forecasts do not expect an El Nino pattern will form if the La Nina ends. The El Nino is the name for a pattern of warm ocean temperatures in the central Pacific, which produces high winds across the southern United States, often breaking apart tropical storms.

2018-04-05,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Investors expect U.S., China to negotiate after all * Dollar gains, bond yields rise * World stock valuations cheapest in more than 2 years By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar gained and equity markets around the world jumped on Thursday in a relief rally as fears eased of a trade war between China and the United States after Washington expressed a willingness to negotiate. The dollar rose to a three-week high against the Japanese yen and a 10-week peak versus the Swiss franc, two safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of market uncertainty. U.S. Treasury yields rose to one-week highs as rising stock markets were a sign of improving risk appetite amid expectations a growing economy will be confirmed Friday when the closely watched U.S. employment report for March is released. Major European stock indexes surged 2 percent or more, with Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX, the market most exposed to China, climbing 2.90 percent. MSCI’s all-country world stock index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 1.12 percent, led by Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook. “Markets seem to be in relief rally mode and part of this is really driven by the fact we’re not really in a trade war yet,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “This is quite small in terms of the impact to the economy, we still have the runway of tax reform that’s coming along,” Ripley said, referring to boost U.S. President Donald Trump’s new tax code is delivering to corporate earnings. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 2.47 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 324.01 points, or 1.34 percent, to 24,588.31. The S&P 500 gained 25.55 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,670.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.37 points, or 0.93 percent, to 7,107.48. Signs the United States is looking to resolve a trade dispute with China lifted the dollar but limited an advance in oil prices as crude is dollar-priced and a stronger greenback makes oil purchases in other currencies more expensive. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he expects the United States and China to work out differences and trade barriers likely “will come down on both sides.” The dollar index rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.46 percent to $1.2221. The Japanese yen weakened 0.63 percent versus the greenback at 107.45 per dollar. Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solution in Washington, said the dollar was boosted by a view that “Washington and Beijing might broker a trade deal that doesn’t torpedo global commerce or damage the world economy.” U.S. crude rose 43 cents to $63.80 per barrel and Brent gained 51 cents to $68.53. Gold prices fell as the apparent willingness to resolve a trade dispute reduced demand for bullion as a place to park money. A stronger dollar also crimped gold as it’s more expensive for users of other currencies. U.S. gold futures fell $11.70 to $1,328.50 an ounce. Many suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. Threats to such exports are a powerful weapon for Beijing to wield given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Trump in the presidential election. U.S. soybeans and corn regained ground, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day. Reporting by Kit Rees; Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano

2018-04-05,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian oil and gas group OMV said it will take a 20 percent interest in two oilfields off the United Arab Emirates under a $1.5 billion deal agreed with the Gulf state’s national oil company ADNOC. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which generates almost all of the United Arab Emirates’ oil, is awarding new concessions to foreign investors in a bid to gain access to technology and funding and to secure buyers for its crude.  OMV and ADNOC agreed a year ago to evaluate joint opportunities, including the exchange of know-how in refining operations and cooperation on downstream technical and maintenance support.   OMV said on Thursday that it would acquire a 20 percent interest in the concession for the offshore oilfields Satah Al Razboot and Umm Lulu as well as the associated infrastructure.      The Austrian group wants to build up its Middle East operations to match the size of its Russian business and reduce its reliance on Russia, and said last month that it is ready to spend 10 billion euros ($12 billion) on acquisitions to expand overseas.      ADNOC aims to take full advantage of rising demand for higher value refined and petrochemical products, particularly in China and Asia and benefit from its partners’ experience.  It announced last year that it would split its ADMA-OPCO offshore concession into three areas - Lower Zakum, Umm Shaif and Nasr, and Sateh Al Razboot and Umm Lulu - with new terms to unlock greater value and increase opportunities for partnerships. OMV said it expected to sign the deal with ADNOC at the end of this month.

2018-04-05,"MEXICO CITY, April 5 (Reuters) - Mexican presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will not scrap sweeping energy reforms that ended a decades-long state monopoly if he wins the election, one of his top advisers told daily newspaper El Universal Olga Sanchez Cordero, the leftist candidate’s pick to serve as interior minister, said in comments published on Thursday that if Lopez Obrador is elected he would review contracts - signed since Mexico passed legislation in 2013 ending Pemex’s monopoly - to look for signs of corruption. “Andres will not cancel the energy reform,” Sanchez Cordero, a former supreme court justice, told the paper. Foreign investors and energy companies are paying close attention to what might happen. Lopez Obrador holds a double-digit lead in most polls for the July 1 election. He has been a critic of the energy reform, variously threatening to dismantle it and to run checks on the oil and gas contracts issued under it. A two-thirds super-majority in Congress would be needed to undo the constitutional reforms that ended state oil company Pemex’s nearly 80-year monopoly over the industry. Most analysts regard that prospect as highly unlikely. So far, the reform has yielded a series of competitive oil auctions that have resulted in more than 100 exploration and production contracts with foreign and private producers.

2018-04-05,"NAIROBI, April 5 (Reuters) - Tanzania launched a power plant this week with a capacity of 240 megawatts (MW), part of a plan to end chronic energy shortages in East Africa’s third-biggest economy. The natural gas-powered Kinyerezi II plant, which began operating on Tuesday, was built on the outskirts of Tanzania’s commercial capital Dar es Salaam by Japan-based Sumitomo Corp using combined-cycle technology for 798 billion shillings ($353.72 million). Eighty-five percent of the cost was covered through a loan from a Japanese bank, a Tanzanian presidency statement said. It did not name the bank but Tanzanian newspapers said Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation had provided the loan. “We expect to complete two more projects here in Kinyerezi, which will also employ natural gas and generate 600 megawatts,” Energy Minister Medard Kalemani said, according to a statement posted on the website of TPDC, the national oil company. The government aims to source more of Tanzania’s electricity from natural gas above the current 50 percent, authorities say. Tanzania boasts reserves of over 57 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas, but faces periodic power shortages as it relies on hydro-power dams in a drought-prone region for about a third of its 1,570 megawatts of installed capacity. Last year President John Magufuli said the country needed to invest $46.2 billion over the next 20 years to revamp its ageing energy infrastructure and meet soaring electricity demand. Investors have long complained the lack of reliable power hurts business there. Tanzania plans to boost power generation capacity from around 1,500 MW currently to 5,000 MW over the next three years, according to the country’s energy ministry. It is aiming to launch construction of a $2 billion hydroelectric plant at Stiegler’s Gorge in July that will produce 2,100 MW upon completion in three years time. The government is working on two more projects in Tanzania’s south that would generate 620 MW on completion, Kalemani said. TPDC said it plans to help unlock more natural gas both for power generation for homes and businesses and for distribution directly to industries for use as a source of energy.

2018-04-05,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s top state lender Sberbank (SBER.MM) opposes a plan by billionaire Mikhail Gutseriyev to merge his oil assets into one firm and replace co-owner Glencore (GLEN.L) because of concerns about his energy companies’ heavy debts, sources told Reuters. Gutseriyev, who has built his oil wealth with the help of Glencore over the past 15 years, had to endure a painful debt restructuring that left his energy empire split into two parts. The magnate now wants to merge the firms, Russneft and Neftisa - both of which are heavily indebted to VTB (VTBR.MM), Russia’s No.2 bank, and Sberbank.  It was not yet clear why such an integration would be needed, although one source said a larger, merged company would be able to borrow more.  As part of the plan, Gutseriyev wants Glencore’s 33 percent stake in Russneft to be bought out by a new investor, possibly from China, but the proposal has drawn criticism from Sberbank and not yet been discussed with Glencore, the sources said. The Gutseriyev family owns 47 percent of Russneft.  “Gutseriyev is looking for another partner to replace it (Glencore), telling creditors that the Chinese will be there soon,” one of the sources familiar with the idea said.  The potential merger would be further complicated as stakes in Russneft and Neftisa are held as collateral by VTB and Sberbank under multi-billion-dollar loans.   “These two companies have different creditors so the merger is technically impossible,” the source said. The sources said there was no firm deal on the table.  Russneft produces around 7.5 million tonnes of oil per year, while Neftisa pumps 7 million tonnes.  Sberbank and VTB have also lent to other parts of Gutseriyev’s empire, in particular, real estate developer Inteko and M.Video (MVID.MM), Russia’s largest home electronics retailer, respectively.  A third source, who is familiar with Glencore’s position, said the merger idea had not been discussed with the trading company and was not yet “concrete or serious enough”. In a statement on Thursday, Russneft said that the idea of a merger with Neftisa has been expressed many times before but “for now the idea remains an idea and there are no plans to actually implement it”. “In regard to Glencore, it remains main partner in Russneft,” the company said.  Glencore did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Sberbank and VTB declined to comment. B&N Bank, formerly part of the Safmar holding company that groups Gutseriyev’s family assets, was taken over last year in a bailout by the Russian central bank, which said Safmar’s banking business had expanded too aggressively.  The central bank has held a minority stake in Russneft since the bailout. It is not clear whether and how that could affect the potential merger.  The central bank did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. A spokeswoman for Gutseriyev’s oil assets declined to comment.

2018-04-05,"(Corrects name of bank in paragraph 22 to Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank from Asian American Investment Bank) By Luc Cohen MENDOZA, Argentina, April 5 (Reuters) - As the trade dispute between the United States and China was gaining steam last month, a half-dozen Chinese dancers and a person in a panda bear suit paraded across a stage inside a hotel lobby in the heart of Argentina’s wine country. The March 24 ceremony celebrated the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank’s (IDB) choice to hold its next annual meeting in Chengdu, China, a decision criticized by the United States, whose regional influence has been increasingly challenged by the Asian economic superpower. Just over a week later, China imposed tariffs on a range of U.S. products from frozen pork to wine in response to U.S. President Donald’s Trump’s decision to place tariffs on steel and aluminum from countries including China. The trade fight, which escalated further on Wednesday with China targeting key American imports including soybeans, planes and  cars in retaliation for proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, has left Latin America in the middle, analyzing risks and opportunities. “The U.S. is forcing countries in the region to choose between the U.S. and China,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Latin America and the World program at the Inter-American Dialogue. “It’s putting Latin American countries in a very challenging position while at the same time not offering a particularly attractive policy.” China, whose demand for raw materials increased during rapid economic growth the past two decades, is already the top trade partner for countries ranging from Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy and the world’s top soybean exporter, to tiny Uruguay. Rather than celebrating a chance to gain market share, Brazil and Argentina responded cautiously to the tariffs on Wednesday. Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry declined to comment. Argentina, the world’s No. 3 soy exporter, said it was “analyzing the situation.” Analysts in both countries said, however, the tariffs could force China to purchase more soybeans and soy-based products from South America. Latin American countries’ turn to China for financing has alarmed Washington even as its own policy toward the region shifts. Trump’s December 2017 national security strategy said China was seeking to “pull the region into its orbit through state-led investment and loans.” David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury Department’s undersecretary for international affairs, said at a March conference in Buenos Aires that China’s hosting of next year’s IDB meeting “does not serve the interests of the Western Hemisphere.” In response, IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno noted that the IDB would hold a special meeting for the bank’s 60th anniversary in Washington next year, saying: “We have found the best of all worlds.” Trump’s trade policies and rhetoric about immigration have disturbed even the most U.S.-friendly governments in Latin America. Before the United States temporarily exempted Brazil from planned steel tariffs, a Foreign Ministry official said trade relations between the two countries were in “uncharted waters.” Argentina is threatening to take Washington to the World Trade Organization over biodiesel import tariffs. While the United States is the IDB’s largest shareholder, it backed out last year of one of the bank’s key funds. Still, China’s perceived disregard for projects’ social and environmental costs has generated opposition within Latin America. Civil society groups from Ecuador, Argentina and Peru set up an alliance to present information on “multiple human rights violations” linked to Chinese investments to the United Nations, according to a February statement from global nonprofit alliance Civicus. Chinese foreign direct investment, or FDI, in the region has increased by $70 billion since 2012, according to the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center. While the United States remains the largest source of FDI, its share fell to 20 percent in 2016 from 25.7 percent in 2015 and 24 percent in 2012, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Data from the Inter-American Dialogue and Boston University show lending from Chinese state-run banks to countries in the region exceeded $20 billion in 2015 and 2016. Since 2005, those loans have exceeded combined financing to the region from the IDB, World Bank and CAF, a Latin American development bank. Commercial banks like ICBC are becoming increasingly active, Myers said, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) - a 2-year-old Beijing-based multilateral lender - is seeking to partner with the IDB on projects in the region, such as roads, railways, ports or tunnels that could improve connectivity with Asia. Seven Latin American countries including Argentina have been approved to join the AIIB, although none have yet paid in to become full members.

2018-04-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - A major European carmaker could be brought “to its knees” by carbon dioxide emissions fines, allowing a Chinese buyer to step in with its own electric vehicle technology, Peugeot maker PSA Group’s chief executive said. Carlos Tavares, who chairs European auto industry lobby group ACEA, said that policymakers had failed to anticipate this outcome of the European Union’s 2020 CO2 goals. “The impact is very obvious. It’s going to create a Chinese Trojan Horse in Europe,” Tavares told an industry event hosted by French car magazine Le Journal de l’Auto late on Wednesday. His outspoken comments come against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between China and the United States and wider concerns about growing protectionism worldwide. They also underscore concerns about foreign influence over European manufacturers, jobs and technology, which have risen since China’s Geely snapped up 10 percent of Germany’s Daimler in February. “If a European carmaker missed its (CO2) targets and was brought to its knees by fines, it could not be acquired by another big European carmaker purely because of antitrust rules,” Tavares said, without naming any manufacturer. That would create the opportunity for a foreign investor to bring in the kind of technology “imposed by European authorities, which means electric vehicles,” he said. “And who’s the leader in electrification? It’s the Chinese,” he added. Paris-based PSA, itself 12.2 percent-owned by China’s Dongfeng Motor Corp., has accelerated new vehicle development at Opel and Vauxhall after uncovering what Tavares described as hidden CO2 emissions problems following the brands’ acquisition from General Motors last year. Thanks to the extra investment, the group maintains it is now on track to meet CO2 goals averaging 95 grammes per kilometer being phased in from 2020-2021, backed by hundreds of millions of euros in potential fines for non-compliance. The current EU-mandated average for new cars is 130 g/km. Tavares has called for the EU penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate electric-car charging networks, saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of Brussels-based ACEA on March 7. “ACEA has not approached the European Commission to reopen any discussion of the 2020 goals,” a spokeswoman told Reuters. President Donald Trump’s administration moved this week to weaken U.S. fuel-economy goals previously agreed for 2022-25 in response to calls for a revision by carmakers.      PSA and other European carmakers are facing declining sales of fuel-efficient diesel models, making it harder to meet CO2 targets and avoid large fines.

2018-04-05,"* U.N. deploying more inspectors, monitors to check ship cargos * Aim is to ensure weapons are not smuggled to Houthi fighters * Saudis say cooperating with UN to bring aid to Hodeidah port * Houthi movement has stepped up attacks against kingdom By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, April 5 (Reuters) - The United Nations is beefing up its inspections of ships bringing humanitarian aid to Yemen to ensure that no military items are being smuggled and to speed delivery of desperately-needed relief supplies, U.N. and Saudi officials say. The move comes as the armed Houthi movement controlling much of northern Yemen steps up attacks on the kingdom, hitting a Saudi oil tanker on Tuesday.. A Saudi-led coalition said overnight that Riyadh’s air defence had intercepted a missile which Houthis said was aimed at storage tanks belonging to Saudi Aramco oil company. Saudi Arabia accuses arch-rival Iran of supplying missiles to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the allegation. Under an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council, monitors from the U.N. Verification and Inspection Mechanism (UNVIM) are based in ports in Djibouti, Dubai, Jeddah and Salalah to observe screening of cargo destined for Yemen. “We met with the UNVIM director and his team in Riyadh and we agreed on improved and enhanced capability,” Saudi Ambassador to Yemen Mohammed S. Al-Jabir told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday. He said UNVIM would increase its inspectors to 10 from four and its monitors to 16 from six and would also improve its technology to inspect ships. The team supporting the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen Lise Grande confirmed to Reuters on Thursday those steps taken to increase the number of monitors and inspectors and the use of scanning equipment. A major U.N. pledging conference on Yemen was held this week, drawing pledges of more than $2 billion toward a $3 billion U.N. humanitarian appeal. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which lead coalition air strikes in Yemen in support of the internationally-recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, have contributed $930 million. “We are cooperating with the UNVIM and other U.N. organisations to facilitate and to increase the amount of ships that arrive to Hodeidah port,” Jabir said, referring to Yemen’s main port for humanitarian and commercial goods, under Houthi control. UNVIM only checks commercial and aid ships going to northern ports under Houthi control - Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Isa - and not to Aden, which is under government control. Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, is reeling from the world’s worst humanitarian crisis where 22 million people need vital assistance. When the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh last November, the Western-backed coalition shut Yemen’s airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation and it was partially lifted. But diplomats say Saudi Arabia has been under heavy pressure from its main ally the United States to speed up aid. The blockade and delays have had a chilling effect on commercial suppliers as ships pay hefty demurrage fees as they wait for unloading, experts say. “The blockade of November and December has been solved in January, but really the ships from Djibouti to the harbour of Hodeidah started regularly only at the end of February,” said Dr. Nevio Zagaria, the World Health Organization’s envoy in Yemen. But “bureaucratic impediments” still slow the aid flow, both at Hodeidah and Aden ports, he told Reuters. “We are now early April, we still have the backlog of thousands of pallets that have been waiting to be transported,” Zagaria said, referring to medical and other supplies.

2018-04-05,"LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - Chinese solar power led a record 157 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy capacity added worldwide last year, more than double the amount of new generation capacity from fossil fuels, a U.N.-backed report showed on Thursday. Globally, a record 98 GW of solar power capacity was installed last year with China contributing more than half, or 53 GW, according to U.N. Environment, the Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre and Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The new renewable energy generating capacity, also including wind, biofuels and geothermal energy, dwarfed the 70 GW of net new capacity from fossil fuels in 2017, it said.  “We are at a turning point ... from fossil fuels to the renewable world,” Erik Solheim, head of U.N. Environment, told Reuters. “The markets are there and renewables can take on coal, they can take on oil and gas.” Fossil fuels, however, still dominate existing capacity. Solar, wind, biomass and other renewables generated 12.1 percent of world electricity in 2017, up from 5.2 percent a decade earlier, it said. Climate scientists have advised governments that renewables should be the world’s dominant source of energy by mid-century if they want to achieve the toughest goals set under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to combat global warming. Global investment in renewable energy rose by two percent to $279.8 billion in 2017 from a year earlier. China invested the most in renewables at $126.6 billion - its largest amount ever and 45 percent of the global total. “Much lower costs ... are the driver of solar investment worldwide,” said Angus McCrone, chief editor of Bloomberg New Energy Finance and lead author of the report, told Reuters. And solar power in China benefited from government policies to help industry, reduce air pollution and slow climate change, he said. The report said the cost of generating electricity from large-scale solar photovoltaic technology fell by 15 percent last year to $86 per megawatt hour. In the United States, renewable energy investment fell by six percent in 2017 to $40.5 billion. However, it was relatively resilient to policy uncertainties under President Donald Trump, who wants to promote fossil fuels, the report said. “Trump can no more brake this than those who opposed the Industrial Revolution could stop the Industrial Revolution,” said Solheim, a former Norwegian environment minister. Still, Trump’s decision in January to slap tariffs on imported solar panels could dent U.S. solar power in the short term, McCrone said.  But there was no sign the U.S. Congress would scrap tax credits for renewables that are a bigger driver of long-term investment, he said. Europe’s investment in renewables plunged by 36 percent to $40.9 billion due to factors including the end of subsidies in some countries for solar and wind and lower technology costs. “In Europe the fall in investment is strongly driven by Germany and the UK,” said Ulf Moslener, lead editor of the report at the Frankfurt School.

2018-04-05,"* EDF denies wrongdoing, says supervised by regulator * UFC: EDF nuclear plants ramp down when power prices low * French-German cross-border power trade dysfunctional -UFC * Consumer group calls for investigation, more regulation (Adds comments from press briefing) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - French consumer group UFC Que Choisir called for an investigation and tighter regulation of state-owned utility EDF, saying its virtual monopoly on power generation in France led to higher prices. UFC said a five-year study of nuclear plant utilisation and wholesale power prices showed that when prices are low, EDF systematically underutilises its nuclear reactors, leading to greater use of more expensive fossil fuel-fired power stations, which in turn leads to higher retail power prices. The consumer group estimated that these practices had boosted EDF’s income by about 3.2 billion euros ($3.93 billion) between 2012 and 2016 and had added about 2.4 billion euros to consumers’ bills between 2012 and 2016. For individual power consumers, whose average bill is around 800 euros per year, the extra cost was about 71 euros over the five-year period for EDF clients and 109 euros for the clients of EDF competitors such as Engie and Direct Energie , which partly rely on EDF-generated electricity. “The management (of EDF’s nuclear fleet) is completely unfavourable to the consumer and to the exclusive benefit of EDF, because EDF has a monopoly and does what it wants,” UFC president Alain Bazot told reporters on Thursday. He said it is up to energy market regulator CRE or the French Competition Authority to investigate EDF’s practices. He also called for tighter regulation of the way EDF operates its nuclear plants, notably an obligation for EDF to justify nuclear output cuts when there is no technical problem. EDF denied wrongdoing. “EDF strongly denies UFC’s accusations ....  EDF at all times optimises its power generation fleet ... and operates under the close supervision of market regulator CRE,” the utility said in a statement. A CRE spokeswoman said the regulator monitors wholesale markets to prevent insider trading and market manipulation. She said that currently six investigations are under way, but declined to comment on the UFC study. UFC energy specialist Nicolas Mouchnino said that market data show that a fall in nuclear power output in Germany and Britain typically leads to an increase in wholesale market prices, but that in France nuclear power output typically falls as wholesale prices drop. “EDF adjusts the capacity utilisation of its nuclear fleet in order to boost its profitability, to the detriment of consumers,” he said. The UFC report also said that since 2015, cross-border power exchanges with Germany have been “dysfunctional”. It said this was because when wholesale prices are lower in Germany, relatively little power is imported into France, while when power prices are slightly cheaper in France, exports towards Germany are massive. “There is a need for an investigation into this activity,” Mouchnino said. France’s interconnectors are operated by EDF grid unit RTE.

2018-04-05,"OSLO (Reuters) - Global shipping should set a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Norway’s government and shipowners’ association said on Thursday before talks by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London next week. Norway’s fleet is worth about $45 billion, the fifth most valuable in the world behind Japan, Greece, China and the United States. Norway’s shipping includes offshore, gas, chemicals, car vessels, dry bulk, crude, crude products and containers. The IMO, which says international shipping represents about 2.2 percent of world carbon dioxide emissions, will meet from April 9-13 to develop a strategy to combat climate change. Shipping was not included in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “Emissions should be reduced by 50 percent towards 2050 compared to 2008,” Harald Solberg, head of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, told a joint news conference with Trade Minister Torbjoern Rooe Isaksen. “In the same period demand will increase by maybe 60 percent, so in absolute terms it’s more than a half,” Solberg said. “We need international rules ... our base line is the same as the Norwegian Shipowners (to cut emissions by 50 percent towards 2050),” Isaksen told Reuters. “We hope the IMO will agree on these ambitious emission targets. That is the only solution, if not we fear regional solutions, and that will not work,” Solberg said.  He said that the association’s vision is that shipping should be emissions free in 2100. The IMO says its Marine Environment Protection Committee is expected “to adopt an initial strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships” at the meeting in London. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of phasing out net greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century, mainly by shifting from fossil fuels to cleaner energies such as solar and wind power.

2018-04-05,"GABORONE, April 5 (Reuters) - The Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) said on Thursday it had increased electricity tariffs by 10 percent as the loss-making utility tries to recover costs. BPC has made operating losses for years due to high import costs, non-performing assets and operational inefficiencies. That has made the company reliant on government subsidies to stay afloat, but it is now slashing costs as part of a turnaround plan. The 10 percent adjustment will apply to all consumer categories and was effective from April 1. “Government has approved a combination of an adjustment to existing tariffs, and a subsidy cash injection to BPC,” the power utility said. BPC said it received a subsidy of 800 million pula ($83 million) for the 2018 financial year, down from about 3 billion pula in subsidies in the past two years. BPC slashed its operational losses by 83 percent in the year ended Jan. 31, 2018, to 200 million pula, after cutting imports and overhead costs, and helped by another tariff adjustment in April 2017, BPC Chief Executive Officer Stefan Schwarzfischer said.

2018-04-05,"(Adds details, context) BASRA, Iraq, April 5 (Reuters) - The Iraqi oil ministry signed a two-year contract with Anton Oilfield Services and Petrofac on Thursday to operate the giant Majnoon oilfield, two oil executives said. The companies will operate the southern oilfield on behalf of Iraqi state-owned Basra Oil Company which is taking over operations there from Royal Dutch Shell. Shell had announced its intention to exit the field, which started production in 2014, by the end of June. The Integrated Field Management Support contract for Majnoon signed with Anton and Petrofac can be renewed after two years, the executives said. The executives, one Iraqi and one foreign, are involved in the project but declined to be identified. Basra Oil said in February it plans to raise output at Majnoon to 450,000 bpd in three years, from 240,000 bpd now, by adding a new production platform. With output of 4.4 million bpd in March, Iraq is the second-largest producer of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) after Saudi Arabia. Iraq is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly 5 million bpd under an agreement between OPEC and other exporters including Russia to curtail global supply to support oil prices. The Iraqi government announced plans this week to increase the country’s oil output capacity to 6.5 million bpd by 2022.

2018-04-05,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - In a round of interviews and media briefings on Wednesday, Trump administration officials downplayed the risk of a U.S. trade war with China, insisting tariff threats are just the first round in negotiations. The concerted attempt to calm market nerves came after the two countries each published a list of potential targets for higher tariffs in a dispute over intellectual property and technology transfer. “There’s no trade war here,” the U.S. president’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in an interview with Fox Business Network (“Kudlow: there is absolutely not a trade war”, Real Clear Politics, April 4). “What you’ve got is the early stages of a process which will include tariffs, comments on the tariffs, then ultimate decisions and negotiations. There are already back-channel talks going on,” Kudlow said. “These are just the first proposals ... we’re putting it out for comment, it’s going to take a couple of months, I doubt there will be any concrete action for several months.” The same talking points were echoed by other senior officials including Trump’s press secretary, his commerce secretary and his hawkish foreign trade adviser. The soothing message appeared to work, with U.S. equity indices reversing earlier losses as investors concluded the risk of threatened tariffs actually being imposed was low. But investors and traders are probably underestimating the difficulty of the negotiations and the risk the United States and China could drift into a damaging confrontation by accident. The threat to impose additional 25 percent tariffs on imports from China worth up to $50 billion fits with the Trump administration’s typical negotiating pattern. In general, the administration starts by making an aggressive and openly controversial announcement to drive an issue up the agenda, control the framing, and create leverage, before settling down to negotiate the details in private. It has already employed this approach by threatening to leave free trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea, as well as with steel and aluminium tariffs. Outside the trade area, it has used the same strategy to demand changes to the nuclear agreement with Iran, denuclearisation of North Korea, more burden-sharing by NATO allies, a border wall with Mexico, and to deal with the problem of undocumented child migrants. So far the results have been mixed. The South Korea free trade agreement has reportedly been renegotiated with some minor changes and there has been some progress with NATO, but none of the other negotiations has yet reached a successful conclusion. In employing the same tactics with China, the administration has picked a much more formidable negotiating adversary and opened up a more complicated set of issues. There is no guarantee the negotiations will reach a successful conclusion and avoid imposition of the threatened tariffs. So while negotiations may be able to avert tariffs, there is a non-zero probability that they will fail to achieve a solution. The process itself is likely to be a source of considerable uncertainty for businesses in both countries as well as third parties in their supply chains for months. Most market participants are probably underestimating how difficult the negotiations will prove and the risk of failure or at least repeated bouts of tension. The administration’s mixed messages are themselves a source of confusion. Senior U.S. officials are trying to convince investors tariffs are unlikely to be imposed so as not to trigger a fall in equity prices or business confidence. But for its hardline negotiating strategy to work, the administration must convince China and other countries the threat to impose tariffs is very real. The United States has presented a long list of grievances as part of its Section 301 investigation into technology transfer (“Notice of determination”, United States Trade Representative, April 3). But it is part of a wider set of disputes between the United States and China that cover intellectual property, subsidisation, dumping, government ownership of enterprises and restrictions on market access as well as the overall trade imbalance. U.S. policymakers have questioned almost every aspect of China’s economic model, which is in turn deeply embedded in the country’s social and political system. Achieving wholesale change will not be possible. No country would allow another to impose changes to its fundamental social-economic-political model (short of defeat in war). So the United States will have to narrow its demands to a list of specific and realistic steps that China will be able to take. Washington will also need to provide reassurance that once a deal is done, it will not be re-opened in future with demands for even more concessions. Critically, any deal must allow both sides to save face and avoid the appearance China is making unilateral concessions under pressure. Even before the tariffs were announced, China and the United States had been trying to negotiate a deal over technology transfer, intellectual property and other issues. By increasing the political temperature, the reciprocal tariff announcements have probably made it harder rather than easier to achieve an outcome acceptable to both sides. China has already reiterated it will not negotiate and make concessions under external pressure (“China says it never backs down in the face of threats after trade salvos with U.S.”, Reuters, April 4). U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping have each cultivated an image as a strong leader so neither can afford to back down and be seen as weak in front of a domestic audience. The two sides are engaged in a dangerous game of chicken (“China trade brinkmanship: Beijing’s retaliation for Trump’s tariffs hits Trump’s voters hard”, Wall Street Journal, April 4). The negotiating process could easily drag on for six months or more, creating significant uncertainty for business in the meantime and complicating investment decisions. Businesses will have to start to plan for the imposition of tariffs on their supply chain even if they are never imposed. Even the threat of tariffs has real consequences for investment and trade flows. While the most likely outcome is probably a deal, there is a non-zero and probably significant risk of breakdown. For the moment, markets are assuming the negotiations will succeed, but investors should probably start to take more seriously the possibility of failure and price it in.

2018-04-05,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A coal ship that dropped anchor off the coast of the Indonesian port city of Balikpapan on Borneo island was likely to blame for an oil spill, after dragging a pipeline more than 100 meters and causing it to crack, an energy ministry official said. Indonesia declared a state of emergency this week after the spill and fire killed five fishermen. The environment ministry said the oil covered an area of nearly 13,000 hectares and had polluted 60 km of coastal ecosystems, including mangrove wetlands and marine mammal habitats.  “We suspect the pipe was dragged by the ship that caught fire,” Oil and Gas Director General Djoko Siswanto told reporters on Thursday. “At the time it was bad weather, so they had to drop anchor,” Siswanto said, noting it was an area where ships were not supposed to anchor. Siswanto did not identify the vessel, but said it was a coal ship with a Panama flag.  Balikpapan is a bustling mining and energy hub, sitting on a shipping lane serving one of Indonesia’s biggest thermal coal mining regions. Pertamina had at first said initial tests showed the oil was marine oil used in boats, but on Wednesday said a cracked 20-year-old underwater pipeline linked to its refinery in Balikpapan was the source. By Tuesday night, around 70 cubic meters of spilled oil had been contained by a team from several oil companies operating in the area and government agencies, the environment ministry said. Thick clumps of oil were still visible in some areas on Thursday, but “much less than the several days prior,” Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya said in a statement. The ministry, which is responsible for supervising the cleanup and compensation claims, had asked Pertamina to contain the remaining oil and help affected members of the community, Nurbaya said. Oil and Gas Director General Siswanto said the spill had been stopped and “the remains of the oil spill are still being cleaned up”. He did not estimate how much oil had spilled.     The spill had reduced the operational capacity of the Balikpapan oil refinery, a Pertamina official said. A second smaller undamaged pipeline running next to the broken pipe was being used to deliver crude to the refinery, with additional oil supplied via tankers, Siswanto said. Some green groups have criticized Pertamina for not taking responsibility for the spill.  Siswanto said Pertamina had been late in announcing the source of the oil, but said the government was investigating the company that owned the vessel suspected of breaking the state company’s pipeline. The vessel owners would be questioned and could be charged over the deaths resulting from the spill, he said. “It depends on who was to blame. It depends on the investigation,” he said.

2018-04-05,"TOKYO (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told Chinese President Xi Jinping during talks in Beijing last week that he agreed to return to six-party talks on his nation’s nuclear programme and missile tests, the Nikkei newspaper said on Thursday. Months of chill between Beijing and Pyongyang appeared to suddenly vanish during Kim’s secretive visit, with China saying that Kim had pledged his commitment to denuclearisation. Quoting multiple sources connected to China and North Korea, the Nikkei said that, according to documents issued after Kim and Xi met, Kim told Xi that he agreed to resuming the six-party talks, which were last held in 2009. North Korea declared the on-again, off-again talks dead at the time, blaming U.S. aggression. The talks grouped the two Koreas, the United States, Russia, Japan and host China.   The sources said it was also possible that Kim could convey his willingness to resume the talks to U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit set to take place in May, but that it was far from clear if that meant the talks would actually resume. Chinese officials were not immediately able to comment. China has traditionally been secretive North Korea’s closest ally, though ties have been frayed by Kim’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles and Beijing’s backing of tough U.N. sanctions in response. North Korea has said in previous talks that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan. Some analysts have said Trump’s willingness to meet Kim handed North Korea a diplomatic win, as the United States had insisted for years that any such summit be preceded by North Korean steps to denuclearise.

Gutseriyev, who has built his oil wealth with the help of Glencore over the past 15 years, had to endure a painful debt restructuring that left his energy empire split into two parts. The magnate now wants to merge the firms, Russneft and Neftisa - both of which are heavily indebted to VTB, Russia’s No.2 bank, and Sberbank. It was not yet clear why such an integration would be needed, although one source said a larger, merged company would be able to borrow more. As part of the plan, Gutseriyev wants Glencore’s 33 percent stake in Russneft to be bought out by a new investor, possibly from China, but the proposal has drawn criticism from Sberbank and not yet been discussed with Glencore, the sources said. The Gutseriyev family owns 47 percent of Russneft. “Gutseriyev is looking for another partner to replace it (Glencore), telling creditors that the Chinese will be there soon,” one of the sources familiar with the idea said. The potential merger would be further complicated as stakes in Russneft and Neftisa are held as collateral by VTB and Sberbank under multi-billion-dollar loans. “These two companies have different creditors so the merger is technically impossible,” the source said. The sources said there was no firm deal on the table. Russneft produces around 7.5 million tonnes of oil per year, while Neftisa pumps 7 million tonnes. Sberbank and VTB have also lent to other parts of Gutseriyev’s empire, in particular, real estate developer Inteko and M.Video, Russia’s largest home electronics retailer, respectively. A third source, who is familiar with Glencore’s position, said the merger idea had not been discussed with the trading company and was not yet “concrete or serious enough”. Glencore did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Sberbank and VTB declined to comment. B&N Bank, formerly part of the Safmar holding company that groups Gutseriyev’s family assets, was taken over last year in a bailout by the Russian central bank, which said Safmar’s banking business had expanded too aggressively. The central bank has held a minority stake in Russneft since the bailout. It is not clear whether and how that could affect the potential merger. The central bank did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. A spokeswoman for Gutseriyev’s oil assets declined to comment.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.5 percent, while shares in Europe jumped 1.7 percent to a two-week high. Cyclical sectors including basic resources, autos and banks, hit particularly hard over the past two sessions in Europe, led gains. Sentiment was lifted as Washington expressed a willingness to negotiate, after proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods prompted swift retaliation from Beijing. U.S. S&P 500 mini futures rose 0.4 percent, leaving Wall Street poised to build on Wednesday’s rebound. The dollar also drew support, hitting a two-week high of 90.34 against a basket of major currencies and rising against the safe-haven yen to 107.02 yen. The euro dipped slightly to $1.2264. Proposed 25 percent U.S. tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products from China will be subject to a consultation period expected to last around two months. “I think that the substance of trade restrictions and their real impact will be far less than the headlines,” said Jeffery Becker, Chairman and CEO at Jennison Associates in New York. “U.S. and Chinese cross-border trade has grown significantly over the last decade and economic inter-dependence runs very deep, deeper than the actual trade numbers.” Asian stocks also benefited, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.6 percent, a day after it hit its lowest in almost two months. Japan’s Nikkei ended 1.5 percent higher. Markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday on Thursday. Many suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. That is considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing’s trade arsenal given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Donald Trump in the presidential election. U.S. soybeans and corn regained ground on Thursday, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day. Some observers argue that the global economy is currently running so well that it could cope with the impact of the proposed tariffs, which cover a fraction of world trade. “We’ve had a few months now where markets have really been going sideways and progressively lower, but at the same time has data really rolled over? The answer is no,” Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said. “The underlying economy is actually chugging along which will increase the scope for upside surprises on the corporate front, on the economic front and at some point markets will have to catch up to that.” U.S. data on Wednesday underscored the prevailing bullish view on the economy. Private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, boding well for Friday’s jobs data. A correction since January has driven share price valuations down from record levels, attracting bargain hunters. MSCI ACWI traded at 14.77 times its forward earnings, the lowest in more than two years. Oil prices gave up earlier gains to trade in negative territory, with U.S. crude futures at $63.24 per barrel.

2018-04-05,"(Corrects Hanwha Total volumes to monthly average in paragraph 2) * Naphtha sellers gain on condensates supply shortfall * Hanwha Total, SK scoop up more naphtha than usual * Purchase likely to stay high for at least until June By Seng Li Peng and Jane Chung SINGAPORE/SEOUL, April 5 (Reuters) - Premiums for heavy full-range naphtha have risen to multi-year highs as South Korean petrochemical companies have turned to the product to replace a shortfall in the condensates that they typically use to run in their units, said five industry sources. Hanwha Total Petrochemical has bought at least 250,000 tonnes of heavy full-range naphtha a month so far this year versus an average of 150,000 tonnes a month in 2017, said the sources who participate in the Asian naphtha market. Meanwhile, SK Incheon Petrochem, a unit of SK Innovation , purchased 200,000 tonnes of the product for April delivery versus up to 125,000 tonnes a month previously, the sources said. Heavy full-range naphtha has a higher content of compounds known as aromatics that are used as precursors for petrochemicals such as xylenes and paraxylenes. The companies will likely keep purchasing more heavy full-range naphtha until June as a supply crunch in condensate, a type of light crude oil, has made it uneconomical for the buyers to switch back, the sources said. “SK Incheon Petrochem’s heavy full-range naphtha imports have increased because (it) is now more economical than using condensate,” said a spokesman from SK Innovation but he did not elaborate on the volumes bought. A spokesman for Hanwha Total declined to comment. There has been less condensate available for Asian buyers as new splitters, or processing units that break down the condensate into different types of naphtha and some middle distillates, in South Korea, Singapore and the Middle East have started up. However, the supply dent intensified when Iran cut its monthly shipments of South Pars condensate to South Korea by 3 million barrels, three sources that participate in the market told Reuters last month. Premiums for condensate cargoes for April and May loading rose to as high as $5 a barrel over Dubai quotes. For the April cargoes of heavy full-range naphtha, Hanwha Total and SK both paid premiums of $10.50 a tonne to Japan quotes on a cost-and-freight (C&F) basis. For cargoes for the second-half of May, SK paid a premium of $19 while Hanwha paid up to $16, which is the highest premium the company has paid for any naphtha grades since April 2014. Due to the shortage of condensate in Asia, competing South Korean refiners S-Oil and Hyundai Oilbank, which also operate condensate splitters in South Korea, have recently bought condensate from Norway. However, not all condensate splitters can process heavy full-range naphtha.

2018-04-05,"DOHA (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies should maintain oil supply curbs to guarantee healthy price levels which will allow increased investment in the industry and help avoid a supply and price shock in the long run, OPEC member Qatar said. Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada told Reuters he also supported the idea of creating a permanent platform for OPEC’s cooperation with Russia even after the current round of joint oil supply cuts ends. “There is a clear recovery in oil prices. But it has not been met with an increase in investments ... Investment has been very low. My concern is that medium- to long-term demand is met comfortably,” Sada said in an interview. “Investors are still cautious and over-conservative”. Sada said that global oil demand was set to rise by at least 1.5 million barrels per day this year or by a healthy 1.5 percent. But the global oil investment purse of around $400 billion was still too small to guarantee the required level of investment to replace production from mature fields and the launch of new projects.  “I would see the need to keep the (OPEC cooperation) momentum ... We need to restore investments. It could take months ... OPEC could start being concerned about gross over-tightening.” OPEC and its allies led by Russia have reduced production since the start of 2017 to ease a global oil glut stemming from the U.S. shale oil boom that saw oil prices crashing to below $30 per barrel and investment in the oil sector falling by over $1 trillion in the past three years. OPEC’s production restraints have helped cut global oil stocks in industrialized nations from as high as 350 million barrels above the five-year average to as low as 50 million barrels, Sada said.  The tightening of the market propelled oil prices above $70 per barrel this year but also encouraged U.S. shale oil drillers to increase investments and return to record production growth. “Even with shale, the market is heading for balance,” said Sada. He said record U.S. shale output was almost fully absorbed by demand increases but elsewhere investments were not growing. Some 6.5 million bpd of U.S. shale production have become an integral part of the global supply portfolio and demand could absorb even more as production was falling in places like Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and China, said Sada. Russia has been hinting that OPEC should start considering exiting the cuts sooner rather than later to avoid giving too much of a boost to U.S. shale oil output. OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia has said cuts could be extended in one form or another into 2019 and also said Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to extend their short-term oil cuts alliance to as long as 10 or even 20 years. Sada said he supported the idea of longer term OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation: “The platform should stay. It is in the interest of everybody. The agreement on supply curbs is another thing”. Qatar is one of the smallest OPEC oil producers but is the most influential player in the global liquefied natural gas market thanks to its huge plants producing a total of 77 million tonnes a year. Sitting on the world’s biggest gas field, North Field, which it shares with Iran, Qatar plans to expand its LNG capacity to 100 million tonnes and Sada said it would be done before the gas market gets too tight in the early part of the next decade. “We want this volume to come on time to fill the rising gap between supply and demand,” he said. Sada also said that a long predicted global gas glut has effectively failed to materialize in the past few years. “If you look at operational outages, then there is hardly any surplus in the LNG market today,” he said. “If you go back three years, there was a lot of projections of a gas glut. But it didn’t happen ... the magnitude of supply surplus has diminished greatly and also the expectations of when the markets will balance were brought forward considerably,” he said. “In fact, four or five years ago people were talking about markets balancing by 2030, then they spoke about 2025, today they talk about markets balancing as close as by 2021-2022”.

2018-04-05,"(Adds details, shares, background) MOSCOW, April 5 (Reuters) - Russian metals and mining group Mechel said on Thursday its net profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 plummeted 72 percent compared to the same period the previous year. Mechel, controlled by businessman Igor Zyuzin, reported a net profit of 443 million roubles ($7.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 1.6 billion roubles in the fourth quarter of 2016. Mechel, which has been in talks with its lenders over the past couple of years, said in December said it had won enough creditor backing to restructure a $1 billion loan. Its fourth-quarter 2017 profits were down 93 percent compared to the previous three months of that year. Mechel did not explain why its net profit had fallen both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. “Net income undermined by a 6.1 billion rouble impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets,” Russian brokerage Aton said in a note, without elaborating further. Mechel is due to hold a conference call later on Thursday. Mechel shares underperformed the market, falling more than 2 percent compared with a 0.5 percent in the benchmark stock market index MOEX. For 2017 as a whole, Mechel made 11.56 billion roubles in net profit, a 62 percent increase from 2016, it said. “High coal prices greatly supported our mining division’s results. The steel division last year had to work in a more difficult environment, but by the end of the year the situation stabilised and the division attained good results,” Mechel chief executive Oleg Korzhov said in a statement. Looking ahead, the company said it planned to increase capital investment in 2018 after increasing spending by more than 25 percent to 11 billion roubles in 2017.

2018-04-05,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Chefs and caterers at hotels in Asia-Pacific will work on ways to cut food waste, including tweaking buffets and promoting the use of doggy bags, in a scheme led by environmental group WWF. The Asian arm of the Hotel Kitchen programme, funded by The Rockefeller Foundation, is due to be launched on Friday at a Singapore meeting of international and regional hotel chains. “This is about accelerating change and getting people to think differently about food,” said Pete Pearson, Washington-based director for food waste at WWF. About a third of food produced around the world is never eaten because it is spoiled after harvest and in transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers. That amounts to economic losses of about $940 billion per year, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Yet 815 million people around the world go to bed hungry every night, U.N. figures show. Throwing out food wastes the water, energy and fuel required to grow, store and distribute it, campaigners say, while discarded food ends up in landfill where it rots, releasing climate-changing gases such as methane. Joao Campari, food practice leader with WWF International, said the conservation group - best known for its work with wildlife - began focusing on food because its production is responsible for more than 70 percent of the world’s lost biodiversity. “The planet cannot supply enough resources at the rate we are consuming today,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Hotel Kitchen, which was piloted in the United States last year with international hoteliers including Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott International, is part of WWF’s push to halve per capita food waste by 2030, in line with global development goals. Those hotel groups are expected to participate in the Asia-Pacific expansion of the initiative, Pearson said. Friday’s meeting, backed by the UK-based Waste and Resources Action Programme and the Pacific Asia Travel Association, will chew over with regional hospitality workers how food waste can be identified, managed and minimised. In the United States, hotel chefs worked to ensure menus for buffets and large events could be adjusted quickly, and some of the excess food reused. Instead of loading a buffet with cheeses and meats, for example, most of it could be kept fresh behind the counter until customers ask for it, said Pearson. The U.S. scheme has also trained staff, developed recipes using leftover ingredients, separated food waste from regular rubbish, monitored it, and raised awareness among customers. Donating unused food and helping customers take home uneaten meals will also be discussed on Friday, said Pearson. “Squandering food is squandering everything that goes into food - including habitat and wildlife,” he said. “We’re just running out of time.” The WWF programme is due to be rolled out in Europe within the next three months. Hotels save an average $7 for every $1 spent on curbing food waste, according to a new report by the Champions 12.3 coalition, which analysed 42 hotels in 15 countries. Within the first year of implementing a food waste-reduction programme, more than 70 percent of hotels in the study recouped their investment, it added.

2018-04-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - London-listed power generator ContourGlobal (GLO.L) hopes to secure an equity partner for its new coal-fired power plant in Kosovo by the end of the year or early 2019, the company CEO told Reuters on Thursday. Several financial institutions, such as insurers AXA and ING have announced plans divest from coal-based investments as part of a move to limit global warming. However, ContourGlobal CEO Joseph Brandt said he is confident of securing financing and a partner, for an up to 49 percent stake in the 500 megawatt (MW) coal plant. “The Kosovo project is exceptionally political ... everyone involved recognise it its driven by the nature of Kosovo as a fragile state,” Brandt said in an interview. Kosovo is struggling with power shortages and around 90 percent of its power is produced in two ailing coal-fired plants which are seen as among the worst polluters in Europe.  The country’s government has endorsed the project and last year, Minister of Development Valdrin Lluka said it would help Kosovo’s economic growth rise to 5 or 6 percent in the coming years, up from around 4 percent in 2017. Brandt was speaking to Reuters following the company’s first full-year results announcement since listing on the London Stock Exchange last year.     The company, which operates 83 power plants across Europe, Latin America and Africa and generates about 4,039 megawatts, said revenue rose 13 percent to $1.02 billion in 2017.    Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose to $513 million from $440 million. On listing last year the company said it planned to double its EBITDA within five years, which Brandt said would mainly be achieved through acquisitions.  “We are confident this will happen sooner than five years, given the recent acquisitions we have made,” he said. ContourGlobal said in February it would buy five 50 MW Spanish solar power plants from Spain’s Acciona (ANA.MC) for 806 million euros.  Brandt said the company was technology neutral about new acquisitions and could target renewable or thermal power plants. But he ruled out any acquisitions in the nuclear sector as it is not an area in which the company has expertise. “I don’t see that changing ... it is not an area we are looking at,” Brandt said.

2018-04-05,"* Singapore law firm asks for vessels to be arrested * Bunker barges owned by Vermont UM Shipping * Vessels seized on behalf of Maybank for unpaid debts - source (Updates to add responses from law firm, bank in 4th paragraph) By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - Four marine refuelling barges owned and operated by Vermont UM Shipping Pte Ltd were seized in Singapore on Monday night, according to the website of Singapore’s Supreme Court. Singaporean law firm Rajah & Tann seized the vessels over unpaid claims on behalf of its client, Malayan Banking Berhad, or Maybank, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the person is not authorised to speak to the media. The source declined to specify the amount of the claims against Vermont UM Shipping. Rajah & Tann did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Maybank also did not respond to an emailed request for comment. The vessels - the Angel Sun, Angel Moon, Angel Star and Ansheng - were seized on Monday night, according to the Supreme Court website. The barges for marine refuelling, also known as bunkering, range between 4,999 and 6,964 deadweight tonnes, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. The vessels are qualified to deliver marine fuel oil and are equipped with mass flow meters, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). Vermont UM Shipping did not respond when contacted for a comment on the seizure. Vermont UM Bunkering Pte Ltd, a now defunct Singapore-based marine fuels supplier, is a shareholder of Vermont UM Shipping, according to documents from Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. In April 2016, the MPA stripped Vermont UM Bunkering of its operating licenses after finding discrepancies and wrongful declarations in records kept on board its bunkering vessels. In November of the following year, Vermont UM Bunkering and three of its executives were charged with cheating as part of a government crackdown on short deliveries of fuel to vessels.

2018-04-05,"TORONTO (Reuters) - A slew of equity capital markets offerings in the cannabis sector helped smaller Canadian investment banks and boutiques climb up the league table rankings in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday. Cannabis-related offerings accounted for about 24 percent of overall Canadian deal activity in a the first quarter, when the total dropped 40.5 percent from a year ago to C$7.5 billion, the data showed. Volumes were largely hurt by weakness in the heavyweight energy sector. It was the slowest first quarter since at least 2014. “The decline of energy issuance has been dramatic relative to last year. If this keeps up, it will be a tough year overall from a volume perspective,” said Sante Corona, executive managing director and head of equity capital markets at TD Securities. TD Bank (TD.TO), Canaccord Genuity (CF.TO) and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) took the top three positions in the equity capital markets rankings, advising on deals worth C$954 million, C$797 million and C$677 million respectively. National Bank of Canada (NA.TO), GMP Capital (GMP.TO) and Eight Capital rounded out the top six. Canaccord advised on 29 deals, the largest number. The strong performance of Canaccord, GMP and Eight Capital is unusual because the six biggest Canadian banks tend to take all the top spots, often only swapping places. With the exception of Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO), which has started participating in cannabis deals, the major banks have stayed away. But the strong contribution from the cannabis sector, which includes dozens of companies, highlights the business opportunity it presents, and all the major banks are evaluating the risks and benefits, sources close to the big banks said over the past week on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive client matters. “It’s an entrepreneurial business model attracting risk capital. So the (big) banks don’t like to risk their capital with earlier stage companies,” said Daniel Daviau, chief executive of Canaccord and former co-head of investment banking at CIBC. Daviau said robust mergers and acquisitions in the cannabis industry were driving equity offerings. “Cannabis companies have decided they need scale to attack the global market,” he said. Bankers cited greater depth and breadth of institutional investor interest. “We’re seeing increasing acceptance of the marijuana industry by blue chip investors,” said Steve Ottaway, managing director, investment banking at GMP. “It is a natural evolution of the sector as companies are becoming big enough and deals are becoming significant enough to attract mainstream investor attention.” JPMorgan Asset Management invested in a C$133 million offering by MedReleaf, a major licensed producer of cannabis, Ottaway said. JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-04-05,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions among Canadian companies are expected to pick up pace after a sluggish first quarter, driven by non-resource deals and a rebound in outbound transactions as pension funds and private equity firms put massive pools of capital to work, according to M&A advisers.  Though uncertainty around the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has weighed on deal activity in some sectors of Canada’s economy, bankers expect a resolution to lift deal volumes.  Meanwhile, changes to the U.S. tax system under President Donald Trump are seen boosting cross-border activity, they added. Canadian M&A activity in the first quarter of the year dropped to $54.2 billion, down 37 percent compared with a year ago, data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday, weighed down by lower energy deals which were the biggest driver of 2017 activity. Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO), Lazard (LAZ.N) and Citigroup (C.N) took the top three spots in the M&A volume rankings for the first quarter, followed by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N). Bankers expect real estate and industrials to be in focus this year. “There’s a prodigious appetite from pension funds and alternative asset managers for high-quality global and Canadian assets,” said Brian Hanson, chief executive of Lazard’s Canadian investment banking division. Despite rich valuations, Hanson expects pension funds to pursue new investments, adding: “They’re going to be very disciplined with respect to quality and valuation.” The biggest deal in the first quarter was the Blackstone Group-led (BX.N) planned $17 billion acquisition of about 55 percent in Thomson Reuters Corp’s (TRI.N) (TRI.TO) Financial and Risk business. Blackstone also agreed to buy Pure Industrial REIT AAR_u.TO for about $2 billion. “We’re seeing a significant amount of cross-border flows,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking.  “Even in this market where multiples have expanded near historic levels, there’s still an opportunity to make money from a private equity perspective,” he added. While PE firms were involved with most of the quarter’s biggest deals, U.S. strategic buyers are in a stronger position after the tax changes.  “The U.S. tax cut on a macro level has huge implications for Canadian M&A,” said Jeremy Fraiberg, co-chair of the M&A group at law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt. “With the tax changes, U.S. companies are finding their coffers have more cash and could do more northbound deals as a result,” he said. Among the law firms advising on M&A, Osler came out on top, followed by Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

2018-04-05,"* Investors expect U.S., China to negotiate after all * European stocks hit 2-week high, U.S. futures rise * World stock valuations cheapest in more than 2 years By Kit Rees LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - World stocks edged higher on Thursday as investors used signs of an easing of Sino-U.S. trade tensions to dip back into riskier assets. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.4 percent, while shares in Europe jumped 1.6 percent to a two-week high. Cyclical sectors including basic resources, autos and banks, hit particularly hard over the past two sessions in Europe, led gains. Sentiment was lifted as Washington expressed a willingness to negotiate, after proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods prompted swift retaliation from Beijing. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, a day after it hit its lowest in almost two months. Japan’s Nikkei ended 1.5 percent higher. Markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday on Thursday. U.S. S&P 500 mini futures rose 0.5 percent, with Wall Street set to extend Wednesday’s rebound. Proposed 25 percent U.S. tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products from China will be subject to a public comment and consultation period that is expected to last around two months. “I think that the substance of trade restrictions and their real impact will be far less than the headlines,” said Jeffery Becker, Chairman and CEO at Jennison Associates in New York. “U.S. and Chinese cross-border trade has grown significantly over the last decade and economic inter-dependence runs very deep, deeper than the actual trade numbers. And both countries have a lot to lose by escalating a trade war.” Many suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. It is considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing’s trade arsenal given the impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Donald Trump in the presidential election. “The U.S. administration will have to tread cautiously considering the risk this could hurt election prospects,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Some argue that the global economy is currently running so well that it could cope with the impact of the proposed tariffs, which cover a fraction of world trade. “We’ve had a few months now where markets have really been going sideways and progressively lower, but at the same time has data really rolled over? The answer is no,” Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said. “The underlying economy is actually chugging along which will increase the scope for upside surprises on the corporate front, on the economic front and at some point markets will have to catch up to that.” U.S. economic data published on Wednesday underscored the prevailing bullish view on the economy. Private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, boding well for Friday’s jobs data. A correction since January has driven share price valuations down from record levels, attracting bargain hunters. MSCI ACWI traded at 14.77 times its forward earnings, the lowest in more than two years. Oil prices bounced back in tandem with global share prices, and on a surprise draw in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude futures traded at $63.52 per barrel, up 0.2 percent. In the currency market, the recovery in risk appetite helped boost the dollar against the yen. The U.S. currency changed hands at 107.05 yen. The euro was down slightly at $1.2260. The Canadian dollar hit a five-week high of C$1.2745 per U.S. dollar while the Mexican peso held near a six-month high of 18.065 peso to the dollar hit the previous day, both helped by optimism over a NAFTA trade deal.

2018-04-05,"(Corrects APRIL 4 story to remove reference to headquarters, paragraph 1) TRIPOLI, April 4 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Wednesday it had signed a deal with French building and engineering group Artelia to manage the development of its offices in the eastern city of Benghazi. There have been plans for years to move the state oil firm’s headquarters from the capital Tripoli back to Benghazi, but it remains unclear when such a transfer could happen. NOC did not say when the complex would be built. The buildings will include offices for other oil companies and a branch of Libya’s central bank, as well as a hotel complex and a conference centre, NOC said in a statement. It said the deal had been signed by NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and Artelia executive director Alberto Romeo on Friday, and that funding would come from commercial banks. There were no details on the cost of the project. Most of OPEC member Libya’s oil resources lie in the east of the country, but former leader Muammar Gaddafi moved NOC to Tripoli and starved the eastern region of investment. Benghazi now wants greater influence but parts of the city are in ruins after more than three years of fighting linked to a broader conflict that developed in Libya after the country’s 2011 uprising. Rival factions based in Tripoli and the east have vied for power over the past four years, with some groups in the east making unsuccessful attempts to sell oil independently of Tripoli. Libya’s oil production, which was crippled by conflict and blockades after 2013, has partially recovered to more than one million barrels per day (bpd) last year. The NOC recently announced it would organise an oil and gas conference in Benghazi in October.

2018-04-05,"* Project approvals seen at 30 in 2018, same as 2017 * Investment coming back after slump between 2014-16 * Bigger projects may be approved in 2019 SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - About 30 upstream oil and gas projects are expected to be approved around the world this year, similar to 2017, as operators stay focused on less capital-intensive projects with quicker returns, Wood Mackenzie analysts said on Thursday. Six of the 30 projects WoodMac expects in 2018 have already been sanctioned, the consultancy said in an annual review of the upstream industry. As well as projects in Britain, Norway, Israel and the Netherlands, the six include China’s first wholly owned and operated deepwater gas project, Lingshui, and the $1 billion Pegaga gas project in Malaysia. Oil and gas investment plunged more than 40 percent between 2014 and 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, as crude oil prices slumped from above $100 per barrel. That led many in the industry to argue new supplies will be scarce in the 2020s, triggering price spikes. “Operators have found ways to grow in tough business conditions,” WoodMac research director Angus Rodger said in a statement accompanying the report. “The big question is whether the industry is actually spending enough.” Projects approved in 2017 were double the number in 2016 as costs came down, oil prices rose and corporate finances improved, WoodMac said. However, average capital expenditure in 2017 dropped to $2.7 billion - the lowest in a decade - as operators focused on smaller projects and expansions of producing fields, the consultancy said. The average breakeven cost is expected to fall by 15 percent to $44 per barrel of oil equivalent, with the most competitive projects in shallow waters off Norway, Britain and Mexico. “We should continue to see operators favouring a leaner and meaner path in 2018. Investors and operators want to see faster cycle times and quicker returns,” said Jessica Brewer, a principal analyst at WoodMac. That notion was supported by a Reuters analysis this week, which showed big drillers stuck close to existing infrastructure in their bids for U.S. Gulf drilling leases. Gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are likely to take a bigger slice of overall investment, with big expansion projects in Norway, Iran and Oman, WoodMac said. “We cannot rely on smaller projects forever, and when we look at LNG in particular, we see a lot of big projects on the horizon,” Rodger said. Investments may pick up in 2019 with multi-billion projects such as Mozambique LNG, Canada LNG and expansions in Qatar and Papua New Guinea close to final investment decisions, the consultancy said. “It will be interesting to see if any of these LNG projects push for a late-2018 sanction, thereby locking-in lower costs and pipping the competition,” Rodger said.

2018-04-05,"(Repeats April 4 story with no changes to text) * Ruling Fidesz leads polls with stable base, fractured opposition * Fidesz will certainly stay largest party, polls show * But many Hungarians want change * Tactical voting may support strongest challengers By Marton Dunai BUDAPEST, April 4 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban leads the polls by a mile, his opposition is a bickering patchwork of smaller parties that won’t coordinate and he dominates the public agenda through his firm grip on the media. Yet there is still a chance - a slim chance - that he could lose his majority on Sunday. That’s because a growing number of voters - guided by widely publicised independent and party-sponsored surveys available online - may be set to discard ideology and party allegiances to vote for the candidates who are most likely to win. “Voters might actually do what these parties fail to do, which is vote for the candidate who has the best chance,” Csaba Toth, strategic director of local thinktank Republikon Institue. With a stable base of around two million voters - a quarter of the total - Orban will in all likelihood win a third consecutive term on April 8, his fourth overall, making him by far the longest serving premier in Hungary’s post-Communist history. But polls show voters are increasingly willing to vote tactically. On Wednesday Citibank gave a 10-15 percent chance that Fidesz would fail to get a parliamentary majority, injecting an unexpected note of uncertainty into an election long seen as a sure thing. Orban’s record is mixed: he has fixed the economy but unwound democratic freedoms, and while his opposition to migration has earned him success at home, it has sown distrust among his partners in the European Union. According to a March poll by thinktank Zavecz Research, as many as 46 percent of Hungarians voters want to see a change in government, against 40 percent who want Orban to stay. The remainder said they weren’t sure. “The forces who want a change in government ... have become ready to cooperate,” respected independent analyst Gabor Torok told the news web site 24.hu in February. “The prime minister has forged very strong ties with his voters, but in the meantime he completely alienated voters who want a government change.” The key to Orban’s success has been positioning his party in the centre against a fractured opposition of six parties, including leftists and the former far-right Jobbik, in an electoral system that tends to favour the winner. The potential for opposition success was shown in February in a municipal by-election in the Fidesz stronghold of Hodmezovasarhely, when the opposition parties fielded one candidate and won. Opposition voters want their parties to repeat the strategy nationally, withdrawing weaker candidates to leave a single challenger in each district, a survey from Median showed this week. Few opposition candidates have obliged, although on Wednesday the Socialists and a small liberal party, Egyutt, stepped aside in several districts, including the hotly contested Budapest district that includes parliament and the Buda Castle, leaving one leftist candidate and one for Jobbik. Zavecz Research published data on Wednesday showing that almost a third of Jobbik supporters polled in March were willing to support leftist candidates, up from 19 percent in February. Leftist voters were even more enthusiastic: 43 percent of them said they would vote for Jobbik if need be, up from 26 percent. Even if Fidesz is beaten, it will remain the largest and strongest party, said Republikon Institue’s Toth. Various polls in March showed Fidesz support in the 27-to-41 percent range, versus between 25 to 41 percent for all the opposition put together. One million voters would not comment. “Forcing Fidesz into a minority... is possible to do even under the present scenario,” Toth said. “If you actually want to emerge either in the left or Jobbik as bigger than Fidesz, that (requires) coordination. But that’s not a likely scenario today.” Hungarian voters will mark two ballots on Sunday: a list of individuals running for 106 seats from local districts and parties on the so-called national list, allocating 93 seats. The district elections are decided first past the post, favouring the largest party, which also skews the national list because the winner is able to pass to his or her party in the national list those excess votes that he or she did not need. In 2014, Fidesz won 96 of the districts and 45 percent of the votes on the national list, ending up with a two-thirds majority in parliament. The splintering of the opposition is on display in places like Miskolc, a former industrial city in the northeast where Fidesz, Jobbik and leftist parties came within five percentage points of each other in 2014. Fidesz won that contest. Today, polls suggest Fidesz and Jobbik are neck-and-neck in Miskolc and if voters opt for the strongest candidate instead of their favourite, Jobbik could win. “I really don’t care who wins as long as it’s not Fidesz,” said Margit Orehovszki, a local pensioner, as she headed for a Jobbik street forum. “I think Jobbik has a better chance, although I like the Socialists too.” Several surveys compiled by activist groups and pollsters using various methodologies, including one sponsored by Jobbik, have yielded lists of the strongest candidates in the most closely contested districts. The results, available on a website called “Orban Must Go”, are generally similar. Adam Sanyo, a 29-year-old data analyst, has built a web site called Tactical Voting that directs voters to opposition candidates he has identified as most likely to win, using data from the 2014 election and polls in the run-up to Sunday. His sparsely furnished living room is dominated by a large electoral map and a bank of screens. Post-it notes signify districts where the opposition has a chance. Budapest is nearly all pink, indicating as many as 18 potential leftist victories; the countryside has more than a dozen yellow Jobbik stickers. A high turnout is likely to benefit the opposition more than Fidesz, said Gabor Toka, who led the research effort of Country for All, launched a year ago by prominent activist Marton Gulyas to identify the strongest candidates in 25 districts. “In eastern Hungary especially, there has been a seismic shift,” Toka said. “Fidesz is no longer in the centre of the political spectrum. Which means that even if Jobbik and the leftists attack one another, their voters are ready to cooperate against Fidesz.” The groups hope to reach 1.5 million people in a targeted social media ad campaign in the days leading up to Sunday. “We know the districts where this can make a difference,” said organiser Katalin Igaz. “We need to reach people who may possibly entertain tactical voting, mobilise them and point them to the strongest candidate.” Their advice is that voters split their vote: support the strongest candidate locally and their party nationally. “If parties won’t agree on anything then civilians like me must press them or at least show who stands to win in every district,” Sanyo said.

2018-04-05,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian oil firm DNO (DNO.OL) has again increased its stake in Britain’s Faroe Petroleum (FPM.L), it said on Thursday, boosting its holding to 27.7 percent the day after it bought its first shares. DNO on Wednesday purchased 25.4 percent of Faroe, adding it would become a long-term strategic owner while insisting it did not plan a full takeover. Britain’s takeover code dictates that a firm publishing a “no intention to bid statement” must refrain for at least six months from crossing the 30 percent ownership threshold, at which an obligation to make a mandatory offer is triggered. DNO returned to the North Sea last year after years of expansion in the Middle East, with the aim of growing via acquisitions and other investments. Faroe Petroleum’s shares rose 3.2 percent in early trade to 1.216 pounds, just shy of the 1.25 pounds paid by DNO, while the Norwegian company’s shares rose by 1.6 percent. DNO’s transactions supported the view that Faroe’s shares are undervalued, brokers DNB Markets said in a note to clients, reiterating a Buy recommendation for the British firm and a share price target of 1.45 pounds.

2018-04-05,"DOHA, (Reuters) - - OPEC and its allies should maintain oil supply curbs to guarantee healthy price levels which will allow increased investment in the industry and help avoid a big supply and price shock in the long run, OPEC member Qatar said. Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada told Reuters he also supported the idea of creating a permanent platform for OPEC’s cooperation with Russia even after the current round of joint oil supply cuts ends. “There is a clear recovery in oil prices. But it has not been met with an increase in investments ... Investment has been very low. My concern is that medium- to long-term demand is met comfortably,” Sada said in an interview. “Investors are still cautious and over-conservative”. Sada said that global oil demand was set to rise by at least 1.5 million barrels per day a year or by a healthy 1.5 percent. But the global oil investment purse of around $400 billion (£284.7 billion) was still too small to guarantee the required level of investment to replace production from mature fields and the launch of new projects.  “I would see the need to keep the (OPEC cooperation) momentum ... We need to restore investments. It could take months ... OPEC could start being concerned about gross over-tightening.” OPEC and its allies led by Russia have reduced production since the start of 2017 to ease a global oil glut stemming from the U.S. shale oil boom that saw oil prices crashing to below $30 per barrel and investment in the oil sector falling by over $1 trillion in the past three years. OPEC’s production restraints have helped cut global oil stocks in industrialised nations from as high as 350 million barrels to as low as 50 million barrels, Sada said.  The tightening of the market propelled oil prices above $70 per barrel this year but also encouraged U.S. shale oil drillers to increase investments and return to record production growth. “Even with shale, the market is heading for balance,” said Sada. He said record U.S. shale output was almost fully absorbed by demand increases but elsewhere investments were not growing. Some 6.5 million bpd of U.S. shale production have become an integral part of the global supply portfolio and demand could absorb even more as production was falling in places like Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia and China, said Sada. Russia has been hinting that OPEC should start considering exiting the cuts sooner rather than later to avoid giving too much of a boost to U.S. shale oil output. OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia has said cuts could be extended in one form or another into 2019 and also said Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to extend their short-term oil cuts alliance to as long as 10 or even 20 years. Sada said he supported the idea of longer term OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation: “The platform should stay. It is in the interest of everybody. The agreement on supply curbs is another thing”.

And both countries have a lot to lose by escalating a trade war.” Many investors viewed U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs plan as part of his negotiation strategy, rather than his final policy. Indeed, Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, when asked whether the latest U.S. tariffs plan may never go into effect and may be a negotiating tactic, told reporters: “Yes, it’s possible. It’s part of the process.” He called the announcements by the two countries mere opening proposals. The U.S. trade actions will not be carried out immediately, giving the two countries room for manoeuvre and providing investors with hope of a compromise. The proposed 25 percent U.S. tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products from China now see a public comment and consultation period that is expected to last around two months. “Our view on the China-U.S. trade situation is that typically, the initial headline is worse than what we expect the implementation to ultimately turn out to be. So our expectation is it will remain a tense situation but will not break out, and to an all out trade war,” said Mike Lillard, chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey. Many suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on U.S. soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. It is considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing’s trade arsenal given the impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Trump in the election. “The U.S. administration will have to tread cautiously considering the risk this could hurt the election prospects,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities. Optimists also argued that the global economy is currently running so strong that it could cope with the impact of the proposed tariffs, which cover a fraction of the world’s trade.

2018-04-05,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Four marine refuelling barges owned and operated by Vermont UM Shipping Pte Ltd were seized in Singapore on Monday night, according to the website of Singapore’s Supreme Court. Singaporean law firm Rajah & Tann seized the vessels over unpaid claims on behalf of its client, Malayan Banking Berhad, or Maybank, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified as the person is not authorised to speak to the media. The source declined to specify the amount of the claims against Vermont UM Shipping.  The vessels - the Angel Sun, Angel Moon, Angel Star and Ansheng - were seized on Monday night, according to the Supreme Court website. The barges for marine refuelling, also known as bunkering, range between 4,999 and 6,964 deadweight tonnes, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. The vessels are qualified to deliver marine fuel oil and are equipped with mass flow meters, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).  Vermont UM Shipping did not respond when contacted for a comment on the seizure. Vermont UM Bunkering Pte Ltd, a now defunct Singapore-based marine fuels supplier, is a shareholder of Vermont UM Shipping, according to documents from Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.  In April 2016, the MPA stripped Vermont UM Bunkering of its operating licenses after finding discrepancies and wrongful declarations in records kept on board its bunkering vessels. In November of the following year, Vermont UM Bunkering and three of its executives were charged with cheating as part of a government crackdown on short deliveries of fuel to vessels. In 2015, Vermont UM was ranked by the MPA as the 18th-largest marine fuel supplier in Singapore by volume. In 2017, Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass flow meters for marine fuel oil deliveries to boost transparency.

2018-04-05,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) BLT.L said on Thursday it had made a final decision to leave the World Coal Association (WCA) over differences on climate change but would remain a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. BHP has largely quit mining coal for power plants, but is the world’s largest exporter of coal for steel-making. It said in December it had taken a preliminary decision to withdraw from the WCA, pending a full review. The miner came under pressure from Australian green groups last year to leave any industry associations with policies that fail to match the company’s support of the 2015 Paris climate accord. “In light of the material difference identified by the review and the narrow range of activities of benefit to BHP from membership, BHP has reached a final view that it will cease membership of the WCA,” BHP said in a statement. The WCA said it was disappointed with BHP’s decision, especially given that BHP had been involved in developing the association’s position on energy and climate change. “The WCA’s position has always been clear; we support a balanced approach that integrates climate and energy policy that works towards a low emission future,” said Benjamin Sporton, Chief Executive of the Word Coal Association. “We believe a balanced approach should not exclude high efficiency, low emissions power generation and carbon capture and storage,” Sporton said. BHP said that while it had identified material differences in its stance with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby, there were other benefits from the activities with the group. “On the basis of these broader benefits, and in light of the Chamber’s willingness to engage further on climate and energy issues through an invitation extended to BHP to join its Energy and Environment Committee, BHP has determined to remain a member of the Chamber,” BHP said. BHP said it would also continue to work with the Minerals Council of Australia in relation to its updated Energy and Climate Policy Position.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery was up 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $63.56 a barrel by 0140 GMT after settling down 14 cents. Front-month London Brent crude for June delivery was up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $68.22, having ended down 10 cents. Before the rebound late on Wednesday, after the release of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory data, WTI and Brent had hit two-week lows after China proposed a broad range of tariffs on U.S. exports, feeding fears of a trade war. U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 246,000 barrels, EIA data showed on Wednesday. Gasoline stocks fell by 1.1 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations for a 1.3 million barrels drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 537,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.1 million barrels drop.

2018-04-05,"(Repeats April 4 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - The United States and China have fired the opening shots in a trade war that may be hard to stop. Washington has published a target list of 1,300 items imported from China worth an estimated $50 billion that would be hit with an extra tariff of 25 percent (“Notice of determination”, USTR, April 3). Beijing has responded with a target list of 106 items imported from the United States worth a similar amount that would be hit by the same ad valorem tariff (“China retaliates for U.S. tariffs”, Reuters, April 4). The United States has appeared eager to impose tariffs to create leverage and force China into concessions on the bilateral trade deficit, intellectual property protection and forced technology transfer. President Donald Trump has insisted trade wars are winnable and pushed his officials to increase the scope of the target list. For its part, China has appeared anxious to avert a trade conflict but threatened a proportionate response to any unilateral U.S. action. Both sides have been careful to leave time for further negotiations in an effort to prevent the tariffs from taking effect. Most investors still seem convinced a last-minute deal can be reached without damaging the world’s two largest economies. The Trump administration has a track record of announcing aggressive and headline-grabbing trade policies and then diluting or abandoning them in the face of stiff opposition and in exchange for comparatively minor concessions. Trade wars, however, are like real wars in that they are easy to start, but, once underway, the course is unpredictable and they can be difficult to halt. As a result, trade war between the United States and China must be seen as one of the biggest risks to the global economy and commodity prices in 2018 and 2019. Neither Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping can afford to be seen to lose a trade conflict or make many concessions without securing something in return. Trump made trade a central plank of his presidential campaign in 2016 and faces tough mid-term congressional elections in just seven months. Fair trade and dealing with China’s perceived abuses is an important issue for the U.S. president’s core supporters and has qualified backing from some elements of the U.S. business community. In China, Xi has just been re-elected as Communist Party chief and had the constitution changed to allow him to extend his tenure as president based largely on his promise of strong leadership. Like a real war, the trade measures announced by both sides are largely for domestic political consumption and designed to play to a nationalist audience. Behind the scenes, both sides are trying to negotiate a settlement, and have been leaking some details to the media in an effort to calm concerns about the economic impact. There are plenty of possible options to settle the dispute. The problem is that any compromise must allow both sides to save face. And that will be much harder now that tariffs have been announced. Both sides are likely to come under business and economic pressure to de-escalate, avoiding a major disruption of global trade and with it the increased likelihood of a recession. But with the domestic political credibility of the leaders of both countries now on the line, just as in a real war, the scope for a mutually face-saving climb-down has narrowed. The trade conflict is really just one aspect of the increasing strategic competition between the United States and China. The United States wants to maintain its military, diplomatic and economic superiority over all other countries while China is determined not to accept second place and to achieve parity. The problem has been termed the Thucydides Trap, after the conflict in ancient Greece between Sparta (the incumbent superpower) and Athens (the rising superpower) that led to the Peloponnesian War. The problem of how to manage the rising power of China and its challenge to the superiority of the United States has been evident for two decades (I remember discussing it frequently with colleagues in the late 1990s). China has appeared anxious to avoid the problem, and the government-run Xinhua news agency has published numerous articles on averting the Thucydides Trap in recent years. The issue has been extensively discussed by officials, including the president and foreign minister, as well as in opinion commentaries (“China voice: Ten reasons China, U.S. can avoid Thucydides Trap”, Xinhua, 2017). Even with this level of awareness, however, the two countries have already blundered into the Thucydides Trap on trade. The list of areas where the two powers are in increasingly pointed strategic competition now covers trade, overseas investment, advanced technology, naval and military armaments. Intensifying diplomatic competition also covers multiple regions including the South China Sea, Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, the Korean peninsula, Africa and Latin America. There are compelling economic reasons for the United States and China to avoid imposing extensive tariffs on bilateral trade, but both sides face tricky domestic political constraints. It is possible to envisage a grand bargain that can resolve many if not all of the outstanding differences between the two countries on business issues. There is still time for negotiations and opportunities for a mutually face-saving deal, though the uncertainty in the meantime is likely to be extremely damaging. And just as real wars are often the result of unpredictable and unplanned escalation, trade wars can also spiral out of control.

2018-04-05,"(Repeats with no changesThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Options open interest by month: tmsnrt.rs/2q9NoKP * Call options by strike: tmsnrt.rs/2q2M6RC By Andy Home LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Is that it for the zinc price or does the market have one last hurrah before the bull cycle turns? London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc for three-month delivery hit a 10-year high of $3,595.50 per tonne on Feb. 15, the culmination of a gradual but relentless tightening of the supply chain that had been playing out over several years. Since then zinc has been dragged lower in the broader risk-off pull-back in the industrial metals space and is currently trading either side of the $3,250-per tonne level. Analysts, such as Max Layton of Citi, believe there is still the potential for one last leg higher to $3,800-4,000 per tonne. But time is running out. “The zinc price in the next three to six months is the best we’re going to see for the next three to five years,” he told last month’s Metal Bulletin Zinc Conference in London. The LME options market seems to agree, judging by the concentration of bull positioning over the next three months. Thereafter, open interest drops off sharply until December, when bearish views predominate. The consensus, it seems, is for zinc’s bull cycle to peak sooner rather than later before a multi-year down cycle. But zinc confounded the bulls several times on the way up. Might it equally confound the bears on the way down? Graphic on LME zinc options open interest, calls and puts, through December: tmsnrt.rs/2q9NoKP Graphic on LME zinc call options by major month and major strike: tmsnrt.rs/2q2M6RC The landscape of options positioning in the zinc market can’t tell us where the price is going, but it does give a fair idea of where the market thinks the price might be going. And in the short term the market still seems to be collectively bullish. The number of call options, which confer the right to buy, dwarfs the amount of put options, which confer the right to sell, in April, May and June. The April options expire today but as of last night’s close there were 9,006 lots (225,150 tonnes) of call option open interest versus just 4,503 lots of put open interest. The upside skew is even more extreme in June with 18,349 tonnes of open interest on calls versus 4,301 lots on puts. The June market positioning is clustered on three main strike prices, namely $3,500 (7,902 lots), $3,700 (8,200 lots) and $4,000 (1,628 lots). The very highest strike price open is $4,400, with 40 lots sitting there on each of the front three months. After June, however, options open interest falls off a cliff up to December, which tends to be a liquid month for options positioning in any given year. And although there are 4 lots of wildly optimistic call options open on the $5,000 strike in December, upside interest is eclipsed by downside put option positioning. The market, in other words, appears to agree with the view of Citi’s Layton and other analysts. If there’s going to be one last bull hurrah, it’s going to happen by July, after which options open interest and bull exuberance both plummet. This narrative of one last price peak is predicated on a building supply response to recent high prices. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) expects some 880,000 tonnes of additional mine supply to enter the market this year, according to Joao Jorge, the Group’s director of market research, speaking at the same London conference. The ILZSG is forecasting mine production growth to accelerate from 3.6 percent in 2017 to 6.0 percent this year. The mine surge will result from a combination of restarts, such as that announced by Glencore last December and new mines such as Vedanta’s Gamsberg project in South Africa. The single biggest addition to global supply, however, will come from the Century zinc mine in Australia. Century closed in 2015 but New Century Resources aims to produce zinc concentrates from the old tailings at the mine site. The company is guiding towards a restart of activity in the third quarter of this year with a one-year ramp-up to full capacity of 264,000 tonnes per year of contained metal. That’s around half of what Century was capable of producing in its heyday. Century, it’s worth remembering, repeatedly dashed bulls’ hopes in the long build-up to this year’s high prices by staying open much longer than expected. The very fact it is coming back at all is astonishing, but will new Century, like old Century, spring more surprises on the unwary, this time by taking longer to ramp up than expected? If you’re looking to the concentrates part of the market for an answer, you’re in for a disappointment. This year’s benchmark treatment charges for the processing of concentrates into metal should provide some insight into the state of play in the raw materials segment of the supply chain. But after two fruitless rounds of meetings smelters and miners are still far apart on how much new supply to expect and how quickly to expect it. Uncertainty around these changing supply dynamics this year is going to remain a key unknown for many months. A more immediate threat to the zinc consensus might come from visible stocks. LME inventory has fallen from almost 900,000 tonnes in 2012 to a current 209,500 tonnes, just about all of it in the U.S. port of New Orleans. The occasional “arrival” of more zinc in LME warehouses in the city, such as the 79,000 tonnes that were warranted in a single day on March 2, has unsettled the market. There’s nothing new to this New Orleans zinc roundabout but with visible stocks so low, what’s happening to “invisible” stocks sitting in off-market storage takes on added significance. Quite evidently, if more zinc miraculously turns up in the Big Easy, it puts at risk the potential for that widely-anticipated bull charge to new 10-year highs. There again, with only 143,225 tonnes of LME stocks available, the London price is going to remain highly sensitive to further cancellations and drawdowns. Maybe that’s what the bull with the December calls on the $5,000 strike price is hoping for. No-one else is, though.

2018-04-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved the request of 25 small refineries to be exempted from the nation’s biofuels laws, an agency source said on Wednesday, marking a big increase from previous years and triggering an outcry from farm groups worried the move will hurt ethanol demand. The expansion of the waiver program represents the Trump administration’s latest clash with the powerful corn lobby, as it seeks to help merchant refiners that claim the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  The decade-old law requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year, or purchase blending credits from other companies - a policy intended to provide a boost to Midwestern corn growers, reduce pollution and cut fuel imports. In the past, the EPA has issued between six and eight waivers from the RFS per year to small refining operations of less than 75,000 barrels per day that can demonstrate they are struggling financially to comply, according to a former official familiar with the waiver program under past administrations. This time that number has ballooned. “While the applications continue to come in, EPA has granted roughly 25 so far,” said the EPA source, who asked not to be named discussing the waivers. The source said the waivers cover the refineries’ obligations for 2017, which would come due this year. A spokeswoman for the EPA, Liz Bowman, said nothing had changed under the administration of President Donald Trump. “The criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations,” she said. Reuters had reported on Tuesday that Andeavor, one of the nation’s biggest refining companies, recently won exemptions from the EPA covering its 2016 obligations at three of its smallest refineries - the first evidence of the agency providing relief to a large and profitable company. Biofuel groups blasted the EPA for apparently expanding the use of the hardship waivers, with two of them calling on the agency to immediately halt issuing new exemptions until the public gets a chance to review the agency’s actions.  EPA does not disclose the waiver recipients, arguing the information is business confidential.  “EPA appears to be operating under the cover of night in a secretive process where the agency acts as judge, jury, and executioner to effectively reduce the overall demand for biofuels in this country absent any public discourse,” said Emily Skor, CEO of biofuel producer Growth Energy. The National Farmers Union said it was particularly incensed by the waiver Andeavor had acquired. “Hardship waivers were not designed for large corporations who net billions in profit each year. The National Farmers Union (NFU) is deeply disturbed by these reports, and requests that EPA cease granting these waivers,” it said in a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The news of the number of waivers EPA has granted drove down prices for biofuel blending credits to their lowest levels since 2015, on fears that refiners that typically have to buy them would sell them instead, traders said. Lower demand for ethanol could hurt biofuel and agricultural companies like Archer Daniels Midland Co, POET and Green Plains Inc.  Refiners have applied for the waivers in larger numbers after a federal appeals court ruling last year that said the EPA must expand the guidelines for approving them.  They have also been encouraged to apply by the Trump administration’s recent efforts to broker a deal between the oil and corn industries to reduce the costs of the RFS, industry sources said. Those talks have not yielded a deal. Refiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance. Prices of U.S. renewable fuel (D6) credits plunged to as low as 29 cents each on Wednesday, the first time they fell below 30 cents since September 2015, according to the Oil Price Information Service. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican who represents Iowa - the nation’s largest corn-growing state - and who backs the biofuels industry, said late on Tuesday that the expansion of the waiver program raised legal questions. Giving Andeavor “a free pass when other companies are required to follow the law of the land isn’t just unfair, it may be illegal,” Grassley told Reuters late Tuesday.  Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said he was concerned EPA’s Pruitt was using the waivers to gut a program he dislikes. “Mr. Pruitt is eviscerating a law the president supports – in complete secrecy,” he said, pointing out Trump had campaigned on a promise to support the RFS.

2018-04-05,"RIO DE JANEIRO, April 4 (Reuters) - The Brazilian state of Minas Gerais slapped a 125.6 million real  ($37.73 million) fine on Anglo American on Wednesday for pollution caused by one of two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the company’s Minas-Rio mine. The leak in the pipeline, which carries slurry to a port in Rio de Janeiro state, occurred on March 12 and forced the miner to suspend operations until March 27. A second leak in the same pipeline 400 meters away and two days after the resumption prompted the company to again halt operations for 90 days while it completes an inspection. The initial spill “caused pollution and environmental degradation that resulted in damage to water resources and may have caused harm to public health and the wellbeing of the population,” Minas Gerais’s environmental regulator Semad said in a statement. Semad also said it required the company to clean the stream where the spill occurred and resume water supply to the local population which was interrupted due to the incident. In a statement, Anglo said it was analyzing the notice from Semad. The company said it took “all measures to minimize the effects of the incidents on March 12 and 29,” including cleaning the stream and being in contact with residents. The state watchdog also said it was still studying the second leak and would announce a fine in that case as well.
