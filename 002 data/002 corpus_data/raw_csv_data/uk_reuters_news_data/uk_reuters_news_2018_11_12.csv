2018-11-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell sharply on Monday, with tech stocks in both regions getting hammered, while the U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in 16 months against a basket of currencies amid concern about European political risks. Major U.S. stock indexes dropped about 2 percent or more. Indexes were weighed down by a 5.0 percent slump in index heavyweight Apple (AAPL.O), after an iPhone parts supplier cut its outlook. Oil prices gave up an initial rally and turned negative, which may have contributed to the steeper sell-off in U.S. equities at the end of the session. “The concerns are all about global economic growth, specifically demands for the products of companies like Apple,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Investors are becoming more concerned about faster-growing companies and whether they will continue to grow at that pace.”     The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 602.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to 25,387.18, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 54.79 points, or 1.97 percent, to 2,726.22 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 206.03 points, or 2.78 percent, to 7,200.87. Apple shares fell as the main supplier for its Face-ID technology, Lumentum Holdings Inc (LITE.O), slashed revenue and profit forecasts, citing reduced orders from a major customer. Lumentum shares tumbled 33.0 percent and shares of other Apple suppliers also dropped. The S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT, a main driver of the long U.S. bull run in stocks, sank 3.5 percent.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shares fell 7.5 percent, weighing on the financials sector .SPSY and the Dow industrials, after a report that Malaysia would seek full refund of fees paid to the bank related to state fund 1MDB. “It’s an ugly sell-off across the board, led by Apple and Goldman,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. European shares were lower led by a sell-off in technology stocks after earnings and M&A news from German heavyweights Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and SAP (SAPG.DE). The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 1.01 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.60 percent, its third straight session of declines. In Europe, fears about a no-deal Brexit and a growing rift over Italy’s budget put pressure on the euro and the pound. The dollar also gained strength as investors built bets on a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increase next month.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.81 percent, with the euro EUR= down 1.04 percent to $1.1216. U.S. crude prices fell for the 11th consecutive session, the most on record since the contract began trading, retreating from a rally early in the session as U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions. Trump’s comment followed remarks from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister saying OPEC was considering cutting supply next year, citing softening demand. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 26 cents a barrel to settle at $59.93. Brent crude futures LCOc1 reversed course late in the session, settling down 6 cents at $70.12 a barrel.  Both U.S. and Brent contracts continued to drop in post-settlement trading.

2018-11-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will announce plans to propose new rules to significantly decrease emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxide from diesel-powered heavy-duty trucks, an agency official said.  Industry groups and state environmental officials have urged the EPA to set new nationwide rules as the state of California has been moving forward with plans to set new state emissions limits. California also wants nationwide rules, in part because more than half of all trucks delivering goods in the state are registered in other states. The EPA said in a statement it had scheduled a formal announcement on Tuesday with industry executives and state environmental officials regarding its “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” but did not immediately disclose details. The effort to impose a new regulatory limit by the EPA comes as the Trump administration has generally touted its efforts to eliminate regulations. But the effort on nitrogen oxide (NOx) is backed by industry, which wants to avoid a patchwork of federal and state standards, the official said. The official asked not to be identified because the announcement was still pending. In December 2016, the Obama-led EPA said in response to petitions to impose new standards that it acknowledged “a need for additional NOx reductions from on-highway heavy-duty engines, particularly in areas of the country with elevated levels of air pollution” and said it planned to propose new rules that could begin in the 2024 model year. Local and state air quality and other agencies including New York City, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Los Angeles, Washington State had petitioned for the rules. Another administration official said Monday the new proposed emissions rules may not be written and announced until 2020. Nitrogen oxide emissions are linked to significant health impacts and can exacerbate asthma attacks, the EPA has said. The current heavy-duty truck rules for NOx were adopted in 2000 and took effect over the following decade. In the aftermath of Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) light-duty diesel emissions scandal, in which the German automaker admitted to secretly using software to evade emissions rules, the EPA has taken steps to insure that diesel cars and SUVs are meeting emissions requirements in on-road use. The new NOx heavy-duty truck rules may also include new tests or other regulatory steps to ensure that vehicles and their engines are complying during real-world driving, the official said.

2018-11-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices fell for the 11th consecutive session, the most on record since the contract began trading, retreating from a rally early in the session as U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions. Trump’s comment followed remarks from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister saying OPEC was considering cutting supply next year, citing softening demand. Saudi Arabia has expressed concerns that U.S. sanctions have removed less oil from the market than expected. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 26 cents a barrel to settle at $59.93. The fall marked the 11th consecutive daily decline, the most since the contract began trading, according to data from CME Group. The contract continued to drop in post-settlement trading, falling $1.48 to $58.71 a barrel by 3:34 p.m. EST (1834 GMT).  Brent crude futures LCOc1 reversed course late in the session, settling down 6 cents at $70.12 a barrel. Brent also traded lower in post-settlement activity, dropping $1.13 to $69.05 a barrel. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” U.S. crude turned negative and extended losses after the tweet.  Oil prices had strengthened early in the session, after Saudi Arabia said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners believed demand was softening enough to warrant an output cut of 1 million barrels per day next year. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies agree that technical analysis shows a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million bpd from October levels. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would cut its shipments by half a million bpd in December due to seasonal lower demand. “We’re kind of back to square one: It must feel like November 2016 to them, a lot,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York, referring to the time period when OPEC and its allies agreed to initiate production cuts. “The Saudis and Russians, especially, rushed production to market to offset losses that aren’t materializing.”  The market had anticipated that exports from OPEC member Iran would fall precipitously following the institution of U.S. sanctions in November. However, the U.S. has granted waivers to certain major importers of Iranian crude, diminishing the expected cuts.    OPEC and the International Energy Agency release their respective monthly reports on the outlook for oil supply and demand later this week.  Oil prices have fallen around 20 percent in the last month, hit by an increase in global supply and the threat of a slowdown in demand, especially from customers whose currencies have weakened against the dollar and eroded their purchasing power. Output from the world’s top oil producers Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia has risen by 1.05 million bpd in the last three months, based on official output figures. PRODN-SA C-RU-OUT C-OUT-T-EIA This has left OPEC scrambling to adjust its own output, which, at around 33.3 million bpd, accounts for roughly a third of global supply.  An official from group member Kuwait said on Monday major oil exporters had over the weekend “discussed a proposal for some kind of cut in (crude) supply next year”, although the official did not provide any detail. One of OPEC’s biggest problems is the surge in U.S. output.  “One thing that is abundantly clear, OPEC is in for a shale shocker as U.S. crude production increased to a record 11.6 million barrels per day and will cross the 12 million threshold next year,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

2018-11-12,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s parliament on Monday approved over $400 million (£311.3 million) in extra-budgetary spending on power station fuel, avoiding a new electricity supply crisis but adding to a gaping budget deficit. With no sign of a final deal to form a national unity government led by Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri six months after elections, parliament began a two-day legislative session on Monday to process urgent laws. Last week Algerian oil company Sonatrach agreed to unload fuel needed to avoid more power cuts on the promise that parliament would meet this week and authorise payment from the finance ministry.  Finance Minister Hassan Ali Khalil had said he was unwilling to implement extra-budgetary spending without parliamentary approval. Lebanon has the world’s third largest public debt as a proportion of the economy and stagnant growth. It is in dire need of a government able to make economic reforms - including to the power sector - that are seen as more pressing than ever.  Khalil said subsidised state power provider Electricite du Liban (EDL) needed an extra 642 billion Lebanese pounds ($430 million/331.4 million) above the 2,100 billion allocated in the 2018 budget to cover fuel needs for the rest of the year. Lebanon has suffered chronic daily power shortages of between three and 18 hours since the end of the civil war in 1990. Those that can afford to, pay for costly and polluting private sector generators to fill the supply gaps. An EDL source on Monday said the fuel had been unloaded.  Before the deal with Sonatach was reached, EDL had begun reducing power production and had said it would have to gradually shut down power plants if a payment solution was not found.  The number one task facing a new Lebanese government is to reduce the twin budget and current account deficits and tackle the country’s rising debt, which the World Bank estimates will be around 155 percent of GDP by end-2018.  The first step on this path should be reforming the electricity sector, the World Bank says, describing EDL subsidies as a “staggering burden” on national finances. Last year the government spent $1.3 billion on EDL - 13 percent of primary expenditure. At a meeting of international donors in April in Paris, where more than $11 billion of investment was pledged in return for reforms, Hariri promised to reduce the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP by five percent over five years.

2018-11-12,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 12 (Reuters) - California utility stocks plummeted for a second day on Monday after deadly wildfires killed at least 31 people and left hundreds missing, with property losses estimated at over $2 billion and the companies facing potential liability. PG&E Corp, which operates in the northern part of California, dropped 16 percent, bringing its loss over two sessions to 29 percent, equivalent to $8 billion. Edison International, the owner of Southern California Edison Company, slumped 11 percent, leaving its stock market value $5 billion lower since Thursday when the fires broke out. PG&E was deemed responsible for wildfires in 2017 that ravaged wine country north of the San Francisco Bay area and killed 46 people, and this week’s fires create new uncertainties for investors in California’s utilities. The so-called Camp Fire in northern California, the state’s most destructive blaze on record, had left at least 228 people missing as of early Monday after burning down more than 6,700 homes and businesses in the town of Paradise. In southern California, the Woolsey Fire had forced authorities to issue evacuation orders for a quarter million people in Ventura and Los Angeles counties and beachside communities including the Malibu beach colony. Both utilities reported to regulators in recent days that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas where fires were reported, just before or close to the time they started. SunTrust analyst Ali Agha in a note to clients said the sell-off in Edison International was likely overdone because total acres and property burned so far in its territory were smaller than in fires last year. He noted that new legislation could help reduce the potential costs related to possible liability. The fire in northern California has probably caused between $2 billion and $4 billion in insured property damage, Morgan Stanley estimated in a report on Monday. Shares of insurance companies covering homes and businesses in California also fell, with Allstate, Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd and Hartford Financial each down more than 1 percent. PG&E recorded a $2.5 billion in pre-tax expense for the second quarter related to last year’s fires after a report said some of them were sparked by trees toppling into PG&E power lines. Both utilities said the causes of the current fires have not been determined. PG&E said that as of Saturday, 25,000 customers were without electricity and that it had turned off gas for another 12,000 customers. Southern California Edison said 9,500 of its customers were without power due to the Woolsey fire in southern California. In September, the state passed a bill allowing utilities to pass on to customers some of the costs incurred from liabilities related to wildfires.

Citing nine sources, Reuters on Friday exclusively reported that VTB had provided around $6 billion to the Qatari fund (QIA)  for the 10.2 billion euro deal in 2016 in which a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft was sold to QIA and commodity trader Glencore. VTB said it did not issue a loan to the QIA. A Reuters spokesman said: “We stand by our story.” VTB said in a statement on Monday it had repeatedly said that it had not granted a loan to QIA to buy Rosneft shares. “To resolve this dispute, we suggest that media outlets disseminating this information enter into legally binding agreements with VTB: if their claims are incorrect, each of them will pay RUB 1bn to VTB Bank through a transfer to our account,” the bank said in its statement. “VTB Group would like to once again state and emphasize that since 2014, it has not granted any loans to QIA.” The QIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The nine sources who told Reuters about the VTB loan to Qatar included a source close to VTB management, a Russian central bank official and a Russian government source familiar with foreign investments in Russia.

2018-11-12,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has continued to implement the main nuclear restrictions set by its 2015 deal with major powers even as the United States reimposed sanctions against Tehran, a U.N. atomic watchdog report showed on Monday. Iran has kept its stock of low-enriched uranium as well as the level to which it refines uranium within the limits set by the landmark deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency report to IAEA member states, obtained by Reuters. Several of the main items curbed under the deal, designed to lengthen the time Iran would need to build a nuclear bomb if it ever chose to do so, were verified shortly before U.S. sanctions were reimposed on Nov. 5 as a follow-up to Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear accord announced in May. A senior diplomat, however, later said that there was no sign Iranian behaviour had changed since that date. “There is nothing that indicates that Iranian cooperation or the Iranian attitude has changed since the 5th of November.” Iran’s reserve of low-enriched uranium remained well below the deal’s 202.8 kg limit at 149.4 kg, the quarterly report by the Vienna-based IAEA showed.  Its stock of heavy water - a less sensitive material that can be used as a moderator in nuclear reactors but is still restricted under the deal - was roughly unchanged at 122.8 tonnes.  Iran continued production but 1.7 tonnes were shipped abroad while 1.5 tonnes were used to make medical compounds, the report said. The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran into stricter limits on its nuclear programme, and a halt to its development of ballistic missiles as well as to its support for proxy forces in conflicts around the Middle East.  Iran has said it will stick with the deal, which lifted most international sanctions, but only if the other signatories - three European powers, Russia and China - make good on pledges to preserve its trade benefits.  Britain, Germany and France have been scrambling to shield companies from the effects of new U.S. sanctions and protect Iranian oil revenues, though many diplomats doubt those efforts will be enough to ultimately save the deal.

2018-11-12,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Swiss court has issued an injunction barring the operators of the Nord Stream gas pipeline from making payments to Gazprom (GAZP.MM) as part of a legal dispute between the Russian gas producer and Ukraine’s Naftogaz, Gazprom said. All payments from Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG to Gazprom are to be directed to the Swiss bailiffs, Gazprom said in a programme for a Eurobond issue dated Nov. 9. Gazprom intends to challenge the injunction in court, TASS news agency quoted the company’s chairman, Viktor Zubkov, as saying.  Nord Stream is a 1,224 km (760 mile) pipeline carrying gas from Russia to Europe. Another pipeline, Nord Stream 2, is under construction. Zubkov was quoted as saying he hoped the injunction would not affect the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would transport Russian gas to Germany.  In June 2014, Gazprom and Naftogaz lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with the Stockholm arbitration court, which resolves commercial disputes. Naftogaz says Gazprom owes it $2.56 billion after a Stockholm court found in Naftogaz’s favour following a lengthy legal battle. Naftogaz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Nord Stream 2 consortium declined comment on the legal proceedings but said they had no impact on the implementation of the pipeline construction project. In the prospectus for a possible Eurobond issue that was obtained by Reuters, Gazprom also said that on May 30, the District Court of Amsterdam provisionally seized Gazprom’s shares in BSPC, the operator of the Blue Stream pipeline, and barred Gazprom’s Dutch subsidiaries from making any payments to the Russian gas producer.Blue Stream carries gas from Russia to Turkey. Gazprom did not elaborate further.  Nord Stream is a joint venture of Gazprom and Germany’s Wintershall (BASFn.DE), PEG Infrastruktur/E.ON (EONGn.DE), Gasunie [GSUNI.UL] of the Netherlands and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA). Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is taking on half of the planned costs of 9.5 billion euros ($10.70 billion), with five European energy companies shouldering the remainder. In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe.

2018-11-12,"PARIS (Reuters) - The energy branch of France’s hardline CGT union on Monday announced strikes by workers at state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA), in protest over wage negotiations and a possible government-led restructuring of the company. The CGT said some 500 staff from EDF’s nuclear plants would gather at the firm’s Paris headquarters for a protest on Tuesday, and added that power output was expected to be reduced due to the action from Monday night. Another strike is scheduled for Nov. 29, with the aim of keeping pressure on EDF and the government over salary negotiations, and the future of the utility. The government is expected to present a new long-term energy policy at the end of the month, which is expected to outline how France will reduce its dependence on nuclear power, boost renewables and curb carbon emissions, and which might indicate how EDF could be restructured.  “We are in a period of uncertainty with regards to French energy policy and this concern is very high among workers in gas and electricity companies,” Sebastien Menesplier, Secretary General of CGT’s mines and energy branch FMNE, told a news conference.     He added that EDF had offered a 0.3 percent salary increase, which the CGT had rejected because inflation is expected at 2 percent. To keep the pressure on EDF, the union has been delaying the restart of several reactors during planned maintenance, costing EDF several millions of euros for every day of delay. Sources have said that there are various scenarios under consideration for a possible restructuring of EDF, which could involve putting its nuclear activities in a separate, fully-state-owned entity.  “Breaking up the EDF model would be a purely capitalistic move, which we are against,” Menesplier said.  French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy has said the government was considering all options for EDF, including the status quo.  CGT warned that just as it has done with partially state-owned energy group Engie, (ENGIE.PA) a former gas monopoly, the government wants to break up EDF so as to get cash from the sale of various units. Such a breakup could be harmful to consumers, workers and France’s security of power supply, the union said.

2018-11-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell sharply on Monday, with tech stocks in both regions getting hammered, while the U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in 16 months against a basket of currencies amid concern about European political risks. Major U.S. stock indexes dropped about 2 percent or more. Indexes were weighed down by a 5.0 percent slump in index heavyweight Apple (AAPL.O), after an iPhone parts supplier cut its outlook. Oil prices gave up an initial rally and turned negative, which may have contributed to the steeper sell-off in U.S. equities at the end of the session. “The concerns are all about global economic growth, specifically demands for the products of companies like Apple,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Investors are becoming more concerned about faster-growing companies and whether they will continue to grow at that pace.”     The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 602.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to 25,387.18, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 54.79 points, or 1.97 percent, to 2,726.22 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 206.03 points, or 2.78 percent, to 7,200.87. Apple shares fell as the main supplier for its Face-ID technology, Lumentum Holdings Inc (LITE.O), slashed revenue and profit forecasts, citing reduced orders from a major customer. Lumentum shares tumbled 33.0 percent and shares of other Apple suppliers also dropped. The S&P 500 technology sector .SPLRCT, a main driver of the long U.S. bull run in stocks, sank 3.5 percent.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N) shares fell 7.5 percent, weighing on the financials sector .SPSY and the Dow industrials, after a report that Malaysia would seek full refund of fees paid to the bank related to state fund 1MDB. “It’s an ugly sell-off across the board, led by Apple and Goldman,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. European shares were lower led by a sell-off in technology stocks after earnings and M&A news from German heavyweights Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and SAP (SAPG.DE). The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 1.01 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 1.60 percent, its third straight session of declines. In Europe, fears about a no-deal Brexit and a growing rift over Italy’s budget put pressure on the euro and the pound. The dollar also gained strength as investors built bets on a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increase next month.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.81 percent, with the euro EUR= down 1.04 percent to $1.1216. U.S. crude prices fell for the 11th consecutive session, the most on record since the contract began trading, retreating from a rally early in the session as U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions. Trump’s comment followed remarks from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister saying OPEC was considering cutting supply next year, citing softening demand. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 26 cents a barrel to settle at $59.93. Brent crude futures LCOc1 reversed course late in the session, settling down 6 cents at $70.12 a barrel.

2018-11-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will announce plans to propose new rules to significantly decrease emissions of smog-forming nitrogen oxide from diesel-powered heavy-duty trucks, an agency official said.  Industry groups and state environmental officials have urged the EPA to set new nationwide rules as the state of California has been moving forward with plans to set new state emissions limits. California also wants nationwide rules, in part because more than half of all trucks delivering goods in the state are registered in other states. The EPA said in a statement it had scheduled a formal announcement on Tuesday with industry executives and state environmental officials regarding its “Cleaner Trucks Initiative,” but did not immediately disclose details. The effort to impose a new regulatory limit by the EPA comes as the Trump administration has generally touted its efforts to eliminate regulations. But the effort on nitrogen oxide (NOx) is backed by industry, which wants to avoid a patchwork of federal and state standards, the official said. The official asked not to be identified because the announcement was still pending. In December 2016, the Obama-led EPA said in response to petitions to impose new standards that it acknowledged “a need for additional NOx reductions from on-highway heavy-duty engines, particularly in areas of the country with elevated levels of air pollution” and said it planned to propose new rules that could begin in the 2024 model year. Local and state air quality and other agencies including New York City, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Los Angeles, Washington State had petitioned for the rules. Another administration official said Monday the new proposed emissions rules may not be written and announced until 2020. Nitrogen oxide emissions are linked to significant health impacts and can exacerbate asthma attacks, the EPA has said. The current heavy-duty truck rules for NOx were adopted in 2000 and took effect over the following decade. In the aftermath of Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) light-duty diesel emissions scandal, in which the German automaker admitted to secretly using software to evade emissions rules, the EPA has taken steps to insure that diesel cars and SUVs are meeting emissions requirements in on-road use. The new NOx heavy-duty truck rules may also include new tests or other regulatory steps to ensure that vehicles and their engines are complying during real-world driving, the official said.

2018-11-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices fell for the 11th consecutive session, the most on record since the contract began trading, retreating from a rally early in the session as U.S. President Donald Trump said he hoped there would be no oil output reductions. Trump’s comment followed remarks from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister saying OPEC was considering cutting supply next year, citing softening demand. Saudi Arabia has expressed concerns that U.S. sanctions have removed less oil from the market than expected. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 fell 26 cents a barrel to settle at $59.93. The fall marked the 11th consecutive daily decline, the most since the contract began trading, according to data from CME Group. The contract continued to drop in post-settlement trading, falling $1.48 to $58.71 a barrel by 3:34 p.m. EST (1834 GMT).  Brent crude futures LCOc1 reversed course late in the session, settling down 6 cents at $70.12 a barrel. Brent also traded lower in post-settlement activity, dropping $1.13 to $69.05 a barrel. “Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!” U.S. crude turned negative and extended losses after the tweet.  Oil prices had strengthened early in the session, after Saudi Arabia said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners believed demand was softening enough to warrant an output cut of 1 million barrels per day next year. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies agree that technical analysis shows a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million bpd from October levels. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would cut its shipments by half a million bpd in December due to seasonal lower demand. “We’re kind of back to square one: It must feel like November 2016 to them, a lot,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York, referring to the time period when OPEC and its allies agreed to initiate production cuts. “The Saudis and Russians, especially, rushed production to market to offset losses that aren’t materializing.”  The market had anticipated that exports from OPEC member Iran would fall precipitously following the institution of U.S. sanctions in November. However, the U.S. has granted waivers to certain major importers of Iranian crude, diminishing the expected cuts.    OPEC and the International Energy Agency release their respective monthly reports on the outlook for oil supply and demand later this week.  Oil prices have fallen around 20 percent in the last month, hit by an increase in global supply and the threat of a slowdown in demand, especially from customers whose currencies have weakened against the dollar and eroded their purchasing power. Output from the world’s top oil producers Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia has risen by 1.05 million bpd in the last three months, based on official output figures. PRODN-SA C-RU-OUT C-OUT-T-EIA This has left OPEC scrambling to adjust its own output, which, at around 33.3 million bpd, accounts for roughly a third of global supply.  An official from group member Kuwait said on Monday major oil exporters had over the weekend “discussed a proposal for some kind of cut in (crude) supply next year”, although the official did not provide any detail. One of OPEC’s biggest problems is the surge in U.S. output.  “One thing that is abundantly clear, OPEC is in for a shale shocker as U.S. crude production increased to a record 11.6 million barrels per day and will cross the 12 million threshold next year,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

European shares were set to open higher, however, ignoring a broad flight from riskier assets seen in Asia, where equity markets wobbled on concerns about slowing global economic growth, particularly in China. Financial spreadbetters expected London’s FTSE to open 0.8 percent higher, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC seen up 0.5 to 0.6 percent. Facing resistance in her cabinet, May was forced to abandon plans for an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday to approve a Brexit deal, the Independent reported. Sterling fell three-quarters of a percent to $1.2877, with Brexit pessimism spreading to the euro, on growing investor worries over whether an orderly deal to leave the European Union would be achieved. The retreat in the pound and euro helped push the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, to its highest level in 16 months. In Asia, investors reduced exposure to riskier assets following weakness on Wall Street on Friday and ahead of a brace of Chinese activity data this week which could give further clues on the extent of its economic slowdown. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan fell 0.5 percent, giving up early gains. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended 0.09 percent higher. The fall in the broad MSCI index appeared to run counter to regional benchmarks, with Australian shares closing up 0.33 percent and Chinese blue chips gaining 1.2 percent after the government and regulators announced more measures to support the private sector. But the stronger dollar helped to eat away at dollar-denominated indexes in the region, including the MSCI index tracking Korean shares, which fell 0.7 percent, shares in Taiwan, which lost 0.1 percent and Indian shares which fell 0.8 percent. Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia ex-Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets, said markets were concerned about both China’s economic growth in general and its significant debt burden. “There’s no way the economy can really can get back on a nice recovery path unless they can seriously compress the debt significantly ... all this deleveraging we’ve been talking about hasn’t really delivered any results,” he said. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd added to the uncertain outlook in China, recording the slowest-ever annual growth in sales for its annual “Singles’ Day” event. Its sales outlook has weakened amid rising trade tensions between China and the United States that have taken a bite out of China’s economy. An index tracking consumer staples firms in China was 0.4 percent lower. Riskier assets have been under intense pressure of late as fears of a peak in earnings growth added to anxiety about slowing global trade and investment. A spike in U.S. bond yields, driven by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep raising borrowing costs, has also shaken emerging markets as investors poured money into U.S. dollar assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.77 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 lost 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.65 percent. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds closed at 3.189 percent on Friday. The Wall Street losses came after the Fed held rates steady earlier in the week but stayed on track to tighten policy next month. The Fed’s stance disappointed some investors who had hoped that October’s rout in equities might have prompted policy makers to take a more cautious approach on interest rates. “Markets are pricing in a 25bp hike in December, with data flow suggesting pipeline inflation pressures are building,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. Elsewhere in markets, the dollar rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 114.17, while the euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.1279. In commodities, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister took some pressure off a sharp drop in oil prices last week with comments on Sunday that Riyadh plans to reduce its oil supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. That jolted oil prices higher on Monday, with U.S. crude rising 1.43 percent to $61.05 a barrel and Brent crude gushing 2.07 percent higher to $71.12 per barrel. However, Saudi Arabia’s supply cut may prove to be a temporary solution to falling prices as global growth slows, with two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - expected to report a contraction in output in coming days. “Supply-side surprises appear to be the main culprit, but concern that global demand is slowing may also be creeping into markets and weighing on risk appetite,” the ANZ analysts said. Spot gold fell on the strengthening dollar, dropping 0.19 percent to $1,206.88 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-11-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - The race is on for liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers to build export terminals as demand soars, but the criteria for financing such mega-projects have shifted as traditional relationships with LNG consumers have begun to disintegrate. Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.AS) final investment decision (FID) taken last month for a $30 billion LNG Canada project was a shot in the arm for the LNG industry, which is emerging from almost three years of low prices and investment. As a vote of confidence in the LNG market, Shell’s decision is expected to get the ball rolling on a wave of approvals for dozens of similar projects around the world that have been planned for years but not yet finalized. But the FID represented a different financing structure, unreliant on commitments from large buyers as previous mega-projects had been, such as the recently commissioned Ichthys facility in Australia or the U.S. Sabine Pass plant.  Instead, Shell will absorb the cost into its budget and will effectively worry about the ultimate buyers later - as one of the largest corporate purchasers of LNG in the world, it can absorb the new volumes into its global portfolio. Demand for LNG is there - it is expected almost to double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, leaving room for plenty more export terminals despite an influx of fresh supply from new, mostly U.S., terminals. But projects have struggled to find offtakers as the world’s biggest buyers in Japan and South Korea seek nimbler terms while others such as India and Pakistan are less creditworthy. “Projects that require buying commitments are really struggling to find buyers to sign up ... I don’t see a lot that is happening,” said Vivek Chandra, chief executive of Texas LNG, which plans a medium-sized project of the same name. “I don’t know what the buyers are waiting for because the golden opportunity to sign up for deals was yesterday,” he told a conference this month, referring to historically low LNG prices in recent years before they began rising last winter.  Aside from 50 mtpa of supply due from U.S. projects under construction, 17 new U.S. terminals like Texas LNG need FIDs. Other plans dot the world from Qatar’s expansion to plants in Russia and Mozambique as well as Southeast Asia. Of all these projects, only a handful in the United States will ultimately be built and for others, the ability for the operator to absorb LNG into its portfolio will be key. “The projects that we might see now are the ones that don’t rely on offtake agreements,” said Frank Konertz, LNG analyst at S&P Global.  Irrespective of price, long-term offtake commitments are risky today because the global LNG market is undergoing fundamental changes as it grows and increases liquidity.  It needs to solve quandaries such as the pricing mechanism for LNG, traditionally linked to oil, and absorb new technology that shifts the commercial calculations of trading the gas.  “The whole market is in an in-between phase,” LNG analyst Emma Richards at Fitch Solutions said. “LNG is becoming more akin to oil with greater spot and liquidity trading referencing benchmarks, but it’s a long process and it’s creating headaches.” Partly as a result of these uncertainties, and because the market is gaining liquidity, the average duration of offtake deals has halved to less than eight years from almost 20 years in 2010 with volumes per contract falling to 0.75 mtpa from 2.25 mtpa, according to data from Shell’s 2018 LNG outlook. Crucially, about 50 percent of such contracts have no credit rating at all compared to 100 percent in 2010 being A- or B-rated, Shell’s outlook showed. Shorter, smaller, less creditworthy contracts make financing multi-billion-dollar projects simply more difficult. This makes projects by large portfolio players such as Shell, Total (TOTF.PA) and Exxon, which has promised FIDs in Mozambique and Texas next year, easier to finalize. For U.S. projects, the field is getting tighter - Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest exporter of LNG, said an FID for the Golden Pass project with Exxon was due in the next few months. Qatar’s own huge expansion, expected to get FID next year, would increase capacity to 110 mtpa from current production rates of 77 mtpa.   And some non-U.S. projects have become attractive in light of China’s tariffs on U.S. LNG imposed in the midst of a trade war. Canadian projects in particular - there are five planned - will come at a cost to the Gulf Coast plans. “For a lot of projects looking to sanction now, it’s a race against time,” Konertz said.

2018-11-12,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales outlined plans on Monday to speed development of A$2.6 billion ($1.9 billion) worth of transmission capacity to hook up more wind and solar power. The move comes as renewable energy developers have run into problems lining up agreements to hook up new solar and wind farms due to congestion on transmission networks, making it hard to secure customers and slowing financing for new projects. New South Wales alone has A$27 billion worth of solar and wind projects with 20 gigawatts of capacity on the drawing board.  “For every 20 projects looking to connect only one can. So we’re going to change that,” New South Wales Energy Minister Don Harwin said.   The state is working with transmission operator Transgrid to speed up planning and feasibility work on four projects needed between 2022 and 2024 to boost connections between New South Wales and its neighboring states — Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Renewable energy makes up about 19 percent of power generation in Australia, which still relies mainly on coal, but this is forecast to jump to 74 percent by 2040. The existing grid is much more geared to transmitting power from coal-fired power plants, while new solar and wind farms are generally being built in outlying areas with limited transmission capacity. Federal and state governments facing elections over the next six months are also desperate to drive down politically sensitive power prices and avert blackouts due to the rise of of wind and solar power and closures of older coal-fired plants. Improved grid connections giving power retailers better access to regions where there is surplus power from wind and solar could lead to A$2.4 billion of savings on energy bills out to 2040, New South Wales estimated. “Australia needs this investment to reflect our changing electricity market,” Harwin told Reuters in an interview. Transgrid, owned by a consortium led by Spark Infrastructure Group, said the state had agreed to provide a funding guarantee for early planning work for the four transmission projects while the company seeks regulatory approval for its plans. “Although these projects have a construction cost, the benefits they deliver through increased competition and reduced wholesale prices will deliver greater benefits, and therefore savings, to New South Wales consumers,” Transgrid said in an emailed comment.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.07 percent, trimming earlier losses on a bounce in Chinese shares, but struggling to break into positive territory. Australian shares added 0.13 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 0.11 percent.

E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd added to the uncertain outlook in China, recording the slowest-ever annual growth in sales for its annual “Singles’ Day” event,. Its sales outlook has weakened amid rising trade tensions between China and the United States that have taken a bite out of China’s economy. An index tracking consumer staples firms in China was 0.95 percent lower, even as the blue-chip CSI300 index rebounded from last week’s string of losses to gain 0.68 percent. Risk asset markets have been under intense pressure of late as fears of a peak in earnings growth added to anxiety about slowing global trade and investment. A spike in U.S. bond yields, driven by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep raising borrowing costs, has also shaken emerging markets as investors poured money into U.S. dollar assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.77 percent on Friday, the S&P 500 lost 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.65 percent. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds closed at 3.189 percent on Friday. The Wall Street losses came after the Fed held rates steady earlier in the week but stayed on track to tighten policy next month. The Fed’s stance disappointed some investors who had hoped that October’s rout in equities might have prompted policy makers to take a more cautious approach on interest rates. “Markets are pricing in a 25bp hike in December, with data flow suggesting pipeline inflation pressures are building,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. Taking some pressure off a sharp drop in oil prices last week, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Sunday that Riyadh plans to reduce its oil supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. That helped to lift oil prices on Monday, with U.S. crude rising 1.08 percent to $60.84 a barrel and Brent crude gaining 1.34 percent to $71.12 per barrel. However, Saudi Arabia’s supply cut may prove to be a temporary solution to falling prices as global growth slows, with two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - expected to report a contraction in output in coming days. “Supply-side surprises appear to be the main culprit, but concern that global demand is slowing may also be creeping into markets and weighing on risk appetite,” the ANZ analysts said. In currency markets, the dollar rose 0.18 percent against the yen to 114.03, and the euro was down 0.11 percent on the day at $1.1322. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.12 percent at 97.022. The British pound was off 0.35 percent to fetch $1.2929. Sterling has been under pressure over the past few weeks as investors worried over whether an orderly Brexit deal would be achieved. Spot gold gained 0.07 percent to $1,210.09 per ounce.

2018-11-12,"MELBOURNE, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales outlined plans on Monday to speed development of A$2.6 billion ($1.9 billion) worth of transmission capacity to hook up more wind and solar power. The move comes as renewable energy developers have run into problems lining up agreements to hook up new solar and wind farms due to congestion on transmission networks, making it hard to secure customers and slowing financing for new projects. New South Wales alone has A$27 billion worth of solar and wind projects with 20 gigawatts of capacity on the drawing board. “For every 20 projects looking to connect only one can. So we’re going to change that,” New South Wales Energy Minister Don Harwin said. The state is working with transmission operator Transgrid to speed up planning and feasibility work on four projects needed between 2022 and 2024 to boost connections between New South Wales and its neighbouring states — Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Renewable energy makes up about 19 percent of power generation in Australia, which still relies mainly on coal, but this is forecast to jump to 74 percent by 2040. The existing grid is much more geared to transmitting power from coal-fired power plants, while new solar and wind farms are generally being built in outlying areas with limited transmission capacity. Federal and state governments facing elections over the next six months are also desperate to drive down politically sensitive power prices and avert blackouts with the increased adoption of wind and solar power. Improved grid connections giving power retailers better access to regions where there is surplus power from wind and solar could lead to A$2.4 billion of savings on energy bills out to 2040, New South Wales estimated. “Australia needs this investment to reflect our changing electricity market,” Harwin told Reuters in an interview. He said the state was “creating the climate in which industry will invest” but declined to give financial details. Transgrid, owned by a consortium led by Spark Infrastructure Group, was not immediately available to comment.

2018-11-12,"NEW DELHI/DUBAI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - India plans to lease out half of its Padur strategic oil reserve site in southern India to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) for storing crude, sources said. Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) will sign an initial agreement with ADNOC on Monday in the presence of oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The agreement will allow ADNOC to sell oil to local refiners but give the government of India the first right to the oil in the case of an emergency. It will be the second such deal with ADNOC, which is already storing oil at the Mangalore strategic storage in southern Karnataka state. “We will sign a memorandum of understanding with ADNOC to fill two compartments in Padur along the same lines as the Mangalore cavern,” said one source with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be named ahead of an official statement. In return for allowing ADNOC to store its crude at a strategic reserve site, India does not have to pay for the imports, only accessing the oil in emergencies. India’s oil ministry and ISPRL, a government entity that builds the caverns, did not respond to Reuters’ request for comments. An ADNOC spokesman said: “We are already working with India’s ISPRL in Mangalore and we hope to build on this positive working relationship in the future.” India’s cabinet last week approved a plan allowing foreign oil companies to store oil in Padur’s strategic storage. “Participation by foreign oil companies will significantly reduce budgetary support of government of India by more than 100 billion rupees ($1.38 billion) based on current prices,” Law Minister R. S. Prasad told a news conference last week. The Padur site is located about 5 km (3 miles) from the southwest coast and 40 km from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd’s refinery. India relies heavily on oil imports, which account for about 80 percent of its total demand. To protect itself from potential supply disruptions, it has built emergency storage in underground caverns at three locations, with a capacity to hold 36.87 million barrels of crude, or about 9.5 days of its average daily demand.

2018-11-12,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - What a difference a month can make. The crude oil market has gone from worrying about not having enough supply to fretting that prices are being overwhelmed by a glut. The main news from Sunday’s meeting of producers in Abu Dhabi is that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut the amount it supplies in December by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from November levels. While Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the reduction was because of a seasonal drop in demand, it’s not hard to read between the lines that the world’s largest crude exporter is growing increasingly concerned about the decline in prices. Having reached a four-year high in early October, Brent crude has slid by about 19 percent to close at $70.18 a barrel on Nov. 9. It’s no secret that the Saudis, and other producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, would prefer crude prices to remain north of $80 a barrel, a level that they believe is sustainable. The elephant in the room for OPEC and its allies, which include Russia, is U.S. President Donald Trump. Part of the reason oil prices have retreated is producers responded to Trump’s pressure for more supply in order to compensate for the expected loss of Iranian barrels with the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran on Nov. 4. However, the Trump administration decided at the last minute to grant waivers to eight users of Iranian crude, including top buyers China and India. The six-month waivers effectively kicked the can on Iranian sanctions down the road. While the problem of how effective the sanctions will eventually be is still there, it’s not an issue for the short term. What is also uncertain is exactly how Saudi Arabia, Russia and other producers feel about the actions of the Trump administration. The Saudis agreed in the middle of the year to supply more crude to the market largely in response to Twitter pressure from Trump. They may now feel they’ve been played by the U.S. president. Trump may have succeeded in getting oil prices to decline, with the Iran waivers seemingly being the last straw for any bulls left in the market. But now the Saudis have stepped in to try and prevent prices from falling further, with Brent gaining as much as 1.4 percent in early Asian trade on Monday. That gain may not seem too impressive, but it does mean that Brent has avoided, for now, falling into the traditional definition of a bear market. It briefly touched the threshold of a 20 percent decline during trade on Nov. 9, but avoided closing in bear territory. If the Saudis and other producers do take steps to limit supply in order to support prices, this will almost certainly spark the ire of the mercurial U.S. president. The United States still has considerable leverage in the Middle East, and Trump may be prepared to use this in order to keep oil prices low. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month remains a wild card. The exact role of the Saudi government and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is still to be clarified, even though Riyadh has acknowledged that its agents carried out a premeditated killing. While there are still uncertainties surrounding the outlook for crude oil, it seems the market is choosing to focus on the narrative of increasing supply. The market structure has shifted from backwardation, where prices for further-dated months are lower than those for prompt delivery, to contango, where prompt prices are lower than those for later delivery. This is usually a sign that the market is facing over-supply. While the contango is still modest, the risk is that it steepens if investors continue to take the view that there is no shortage of crude. Certainly, the rise to a 3 1/2-year high in the drilling rig count in the United States last week suggests that more supply is coming on stream. What the market will now have to assess is how successful the Saudis will be in restraining their own output, and that of their allies. Having completed a U-turn in the past few weeks, the market may well have to swing its views again in the coming weeks.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.17 percent in early trade. Australian shares were down 0.08 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index eased 0.12 percent. A combination of weak factory-gate inflation data in China and low oil prices weighed on global stocks on Friday, dragging MSCI’s gauge of global stocks to its worst day in two weeks. The index was last 0.11 percent lower. Risk asset markets have been under intense pressure recently as worries about a peak in earnings growth added to anxiety about slowing global trade and investment. A spike in U.S. bond yields, driven by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep raising borrowing costs, has also shaken emerging markets as investors poured money into U.S. dollar assets.

2018-11-12,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Swiss court has issued an injunction barring the operators of the Nord Stream gas pipeline from making payments to Gazprom (GAZP.MM) as part of a legal dispute between the Russian gas producer and Ukraine’s Naftogaz, Gazprom said. All payments from Nord Stream AG and Nord Stream 2 AG to Gazprom are to be directed to the Swiss bailiffs, Gazprom said in a programme for a Eurobond issue dated Nov. 9. Gazprom intends to challenge the injunction in court, TASS news agency quoted the company’s chairman, Viktor Zubkov, as saying.  Nord Stream is a 1,224 km (760 mile) pipeline carrying gas from Russia to Europe. Another pipeline, Nord Stream 2, is under construction. Zubkov was quoted as saying he hoped the injunction would not affect the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would transport Russian gas to Germany.  In June 2014, Gazprom and Naftogaz lodged multi-billion-dollar claims against each other with the Stockholm arbitration court, which resolves commercial disputes. Naftogaz says Gazprom owes it $2.56 billion after a Stockholm court found in Naftogaz’s favour following a lengthy legal battle. Naftogaz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Nord Stream 2 consortium declined comment on the legal proceedings but said they had no impact on the implementation of the pipeline construction project. In the prospectus for a possible Eurobond issue that was obtained by Reuters, Gazprom also said that on May 30, the District Court of Amsterdam provisionally seized Gazprom’s shares in BSPC, the operator of the Blue Stream pipeline, and barred Gazprom’s Dutch subsidiaries from making any payments to the Russian gas producer.Blue Stream carries gas from Russia to Turkey. Gazprom did not elaborate further.  Nord Stream is a joint venture of Gazprom and Germany’s Wintershall (BASFn.DE), PEG Infrastruktur/E.ON (EONGn.DE), Gasunie [GSUNI.UL] of the Netherlands and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA). Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year, is owned by Gazprom, which is taking on half of the planned costs of 9.5 billion euros ($10.70 billion), with five European energy companies shouldering the remainder. In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe.

2018-11-12,"PARIS (Reuters) - The energy branch of France’s hardline CGT union on Monday announced strikes by workers at state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA), in protest over wage negotiations and a possible government-led restructuring of the company. The CGT said some 500 staff from EDF’s nuclear plants would gather at the firm’s Paris headquarters for a protest on Tuesday, and added that power output was expected to be reduced due to the action from Monday night. Another strike is scheduled for Nov. 29, with the aim of keeping pressure on EDF and the government over salary negotiations, and the future of the utility. The government is expected to present a new long-term energy policy at the end of the month, which is expected to outline how France will reduce its dependence on nuclear power, boost renewables and curb carbon emissions, and which might indicate how EDF could be restructured.  “We are in a period of uncertainty with regards to French energy policy and this concern is very high among workers in gas and electricity companies,” Sebastien Menesplier, Secretary General of CGT’s mines and energy branch FMNE, told a news conference.     He added that EDF had offered a 0.3 percent salary increase, which the CGT had rejected because inflation is expected at 2 percent. To keep the pressure on EDF, the union has been delaying the restart of several reactors during planned maintenance, costing EDF several millions of euros for every day of delay. Sources have said that there are various scenarios under consideration for a possible restructuring of EDF, which could involve putting its nuclear activities in a separate, fully-state-owned entity.  “Breaking up the EDF model would be a purely capitalistic move, which we are against,” Menesplier said.  French Environment Minister Francois de Rugy has said the government was considering all options for EDF, including the status quo.  CGT warned that just as it has done with partially state-owned energy group Engie, (ENGIE.PA) a former gas monopoly, the government wants to break up EDF so as to get cash from the sale of various units. Such a breakup could be harmful to consumers, workers and France’s security of power supply, the union said.

2018-11-12,"DUBAI (Reuters) - SoftBank has hired Deutsche Bank to advise on its power investment plans in Saudi Arabia, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Japanese firm, which is planning to invest in a giant solar power plant in the kingdom, has also shown interest in electricity distribution in the world’s top oil exporter, they said. One source said SoftBank could consider purchasing a minority stake in Saudi Electricity from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) sovereign wealth fund. “They want to become a minority shareholder of influence,” the source told Reuters. PIF owns a 74 percent stake in Saudi Electricity. The other major shareholder is state oil giant Aramco, which owns a nearly 7 percent stake. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment. PIF and Deutsche Bank also declined comment. Saudi Electricity did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. In March, SoftBank Group Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said he had signed an agreement to create the world’s biggest solar power generation company in Saudi Arabia which would have a capacity of 200 gigawatts by 2030. More details on the project are expected to be disclosed in the first quarter of next year, a third source said. Son has defended SoftBank’s ties with Saudi Arabia following a global outcry over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country’s Istanbul consulate last month, saying his firm has a responsibility to Saudi citizens whose money is invested in its Vision Fund. Saudi Arabia has provided about half of the $93 billion raised by SoftBank for the fund, which has become one of the primary funding vehicles for technology firms around the world.  Saudi Arabia is embarking on a push to transform its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. It views solar power as a way to cut the amount of crude it uses to generate power at home and raise its overseas shipments. The government also wants to privatize Saudi Electricity as part of wider reforms to its energy sector. It had planned to split the Gulf’s largest utility firm into separate companies that would be offered either to local citizens through IPOs or to local or international corporate partners.     But the plan has been delayed as the kingdom reviewed energy subsidies to cut domestic consumption and reduce waste.  The state says it will gradually increase energy prices until 2020, helping the company to achieve a more sustainable financial model.     To meet rising demand, Saudi Electricity has had to increase its capex through borrowing. It has over 160 billion riyals ($42.7 billion) of debt, nearly half of it from commercial loans.

2018-11-12,"* Brexit uncertainty hits pound, euro, buoys dollar * MSCI Asia Ex-Japan index down 0.5 pct * U.S. dollar hits new 16-month high * Weak China data, U.S. Fed rate hike expectations weigh * Oil prices surge on Saudi production cut plans (Updates prices throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The dollar surged to nearly 17-month highs on Monday against a basket of major currencies as investors sought out the liquid and high-yielding asset against a backdrop of global growth worries and rising political risk in Italy and Britain. World stocks fell 0.3 percent for a third straight day in the red, receiving no respite from a rise in oil prices, while initial European equity gains fizzled amid growing fears for Italian lender Carige whose shares were suspended after reports of a capital hole. While Shanghai was lifted one percent by regulators’ promise to simplify share buybacks, Asian markets broadly weakened following Friday’s weak Wall Street close. New York trade will likely be thinned by the Veterans Day holiday and futures indicated the S&P500 and Dow Jones flat to lower but Nasdaq futures are marginally. Investors are fretting about signs of slowing growth worldwide but especially in China where e-commerce giant Alibaba was the latest to raise alarm bells, with the slowest ever annual sales growth during its Singles Day shopping event. Many also reckon that U.S. President Donald Trump could turn up the heat over trade, further damaging China’s economy. All that, coupled with European political risks, conspired to push the dollar 0.5 percent higher against a basket of currencies by 1230 GMT. “King dollar has staged a return,” Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole, said, adding that investors had piled back into the dollar after last week’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting confirmed a rate-tightening path. “Euro and pound are both hurt by political risk and that is aggravating underperformance versus the dollar,” Marinov said. Sterling lost more than one percent at one point, holding near a 10-day low hit earlier, while the euro, comprising more than 50 percent of the dollar index, fell 0.7 percent to its lowest since July 2017. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy came under attack from all sides, increasing the risk that her plan for leaving the European Union will be voted down by parliament, thrusting the United Kingdom towards a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit. The opposition Labour Party said that if May’s Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, it would push for a national election and possibly also another referendum. Latest futures data showed net short sterling positions registered their biggest weekly rise in 1-1/2 months Deutsche Bank analysts, however, predicted more pain, telling clients: “not enough risk is priced into sterling given the parliamentary problems ahead”. In the euro zone, Italy faces a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU, but its refusal so far to cut the draft deficit sets the stage for a collision with Brussels. Markets were also spooked by reports that Banca Carige would need around 400 million euros ($451 million) to plug a hole in its capital base and Italy’s deposit protection fund could fill only part of it. That raises the spectre of a banking crisis in the euro zone’s third-biggest economy, lifting Italy’s bond yield spread over Germany - the risk premium attached to Italian assets - back above the psychologically key 300 basis-point mark . Italian bank shares fell 1.2 percent. Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management, predicted the euro would tumble below $1.10 from the current $1.126 “as renewed eurozone and Brexit angst and a diverging economic outlook with a strong U.S. economy versus a weakening eurozone economy will trigger further euro selling pressure.” All of this has been good news for dollar bulls, who have benefited from safe-haven flows. Speculators’ net long dollar positions rose last week to the highest since January 2016, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, show. The other big move was in commodities, where Saudi Arabia’s energy minister jolted Brent crude futures around 2 percent higher with comments that Riyadh could reduce supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. Brent is trading around $71.4 per dollar, off seven-month lows touched last week. But slowing world growth could make supply cuts a temporary solution to falling oil prices. Two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - are expected to report a contraction in output in coming days. Reporting by Sujata Rao, additional reporting by Andrew

2018-11-12,"(Recasts, adds details, quotes) By Nidhi Verma and Rania El Gamal NEW DELHI/DUBAI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC) has signed a preliminary agreement to use half of the Padur strategic reserve facility in Southern India, which can store about 2.5 million tonnes or 18 million barrels of crude, the UAE firm said on Monday. Officials of Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) and ADNOC signed the memorandum of understanding in the presence of Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and ADNOC Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, is scouting for partners to fill the reserves and also to build storage to hold oil reserves and to cut costs. “It is our firm hope that we will be able to convert this framework agreement into a new mutually beneficial partnership that will create opportunities for ADNOC to increase deliveries of high-quality crude oil to India’s expanding energy market and help India meet its growing energy demand and safeguard its energy security,” the ADNOC CEO said in statement. The announcement confirmed an earlier Reuters report. India, which relies on oil imports for about 80 percent of its needs, has built underground emergency storage in three places to protect itself from any disruption. The reserves can hold 36.87 million barrels or about 9.5 days of average demand. ADNOC, the only foreign company with a deal to store oil in India’s strategic reserves, has a similar storage deal already at the Mangalore strategic storage in Karnataka. “This agreement reflects the strong bonds of cooperation between India and the UAE and provides a foundation for strengthening and expanding our strategic energy relationship,” Pradhan said in the statement. The agreement allows ADNOC to sell oil to local refiners but would give the government of India the first right to the oil held in the reserve in case of an emergency. Pradhan said earlier on Monday that India was also in talks with Saudi Arabia to store oil in Padur, after India’s cabinet approved a plan last week allowing foreign firms to store oil in the facility. “Participation by foreign oil companies will significantly reduce budgetary support of government of India by more than 100 billion rupees ($1.38 billion) based on current prices,” Law Minister R. S. Prasad told a news conference last week. The Padur site is about 5 km (3 miles) from the southwest coast and 40 km (25 miles) from Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd’s refinery.

2018-11-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds have sold the equivalent of almost half a billion barrels of crude oil and refined products in the last six weeks, as worries about slowing demand replaced earlier concern over sanctions on Iran. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts by another 108 million barrels in the week to Nov. 6. Portfolio managers have sold 479 million barrels of crude and products since the end of September, the largest reduction in any six-week period since at least 2013 and probably the largest ever in a comparable timeframe. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QCWjzw) Funds now hold fewer than four bullish long positions for every short bearish one, down from more than 12:1 at the end of September and the lowest ratio since August 2017. Most of the adjustment has come from the long side of the market, as formerly bullish hedge funds liquidate positions accumulated in the second half of 2017 and earlier in 2018. The number of bullish long positions has fallen to just 849 million barrels, from 1.195 billion six weeks ago and a record 1.625 billion at the start of the year. Bullish positions are now at the lowest level since September 2016, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges. But some fund managers have begun to turn outright bearish, with short positions now up to 228 million barrels from just 96 million barrels six weeks ago. Heavy selling by funds has helped push oil prices down more than $15 per barrel (17 percent) since Oct. 3. And since most hedge fund positions are held in contracts near to maturity, the selling has had a disproportionate impact at the front end of the futures curve, pushing crude futures prices deep into contango. Portfolio managers have reacted to an increasingly bearish news flow amid signs the oil market has passed its current cyclical peak. Production growth is accelerating while consumption growth is slowing - conditions reminiscent of cyclical peaks in mid-2014 and mid-2008. OPEC members and their allies have been boosting output, partly in response to political pressure from the White House. U.S. shale producers have ramped up their own production at the fastest rate on record, with output up by more than 2 million barrels per day in the 12 months to August. And the United States has issued waivers to allow some of Iran’s most important customers to continue buying oil despite the reimposition of sanctions, waivers that have been more generous than previously expected. At the same time, oil traders have become increasingly worried about the possibility of a global economic slowdown or even a recession hitting oil demand next year. And there are signs higher oil prices have begun to prompt increased interest in fuel efficiency and other behavioural changes among consumers, with consumption growth slowing from rapid rates in 2016 and 2017. With the market on course for oversupply, oil prices needed to fall from recent highs to curb production, boost consumption and avert a large buildup in excess inventories in 2019. Price falls have already begun to enforce the rebalancing process, with OPEC and its allies starting to discuss production cuts of as much as 1 million barrels per day. Some observers have expressed surprise at how quickly market commentary has shifted from the need for more oil to concerns about oversupply, but the speed of the shift is not unusual. In 2008 and 2014, market commentary shifted from fears about undersupply to oversupply within three to four months around the peak, and something similar appears to be happening this time.

2018-11-12,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s armed forces will protect Iranian oil tankers against any threats, an Iranian military official said on Monday after the United States called the ships a “floating liability” and warned ports operators not to allow them to dock. The United States resumed sanctions on Iran’s oil, shipping and banking industries last Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 international agreement curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in May. “Iran’s armed forces...are prepared today as in the past to protect our fleet of oil tankers against any threats so that it can continue to use marine waterways,” said Rear-Admiral Mahmoud Mousavi, a deputy commander of the regular armed forces, according to the semi-official news agency ISNA. His comments appeared to be a response to U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, who said last week that Iranian vessels would lose access to international insurance markets under the U.S. sanctions and so would be a risk to ports and canals which allowed them access. “From the Suez Canal to the Strait of Malacca and all choke-points in between, Iranian tankers are a floating liability,” Hook had said. Iranian media reported his remarks as a threat against Iranian tankers that carry Iran’s crude and oil products. Mousavi said that creating hindrances to transportation through international waterways would be unacceptable. “Iran’s armed forces have the preparedness to protect our commercial fleet...as they have in the past 40 years,” he said. Hook also raised the possibility that countries and port operators could face U.S. penalties for facilitating what he called Iran’s “illicit activities” if they allowed Iranian ships access to international waterways and port facilities. Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organization, said Tehran would file a complaint next week to the International Maritime Organization over “cruel U.S. sanctions and restrictions on maritime transport,” according to the state news agency IRNA. Hook had also said the sanctions had already cost Iran billions of dollars in oil revenue since May, but Iranian vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri said Iran had sold as much oil as it needed to. Iran has one of the world’s biggest tanker fleets but many of the ships are ageing and require valid insurance, testing, inspection and certification, known as ship classification, to be able to ply international waters again. Iranian officials have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the United States attempts to stop the Islamic Republic’s oil exports.

2018-11-12,"PALERMO, Italy (Reuters) - The U.N. envoy for Libya hopes another attempt to hold an election will take place by June after he scrapped a December plan, but said Libyans should first use a national conference in early 2019 to decide on the poll’s format.  U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame decided to abandon a plan to hold elections on Dec. 10 after a spike in violence in Libya, which has been gripped by conflict and paralysed by political deadlock since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.  Salame was speaking to Reuters before the start of a conference in Palermo organised by Rome with the aim of pushing forward a new U.N. plan. Salame said last week this plan would include an election in the spring, without elaborating.   At Monday’s interview, the envoy said this meant the vote would be held between late March and late June, but that the format of the poll would depend on what was decided at the national conference scheduled for early 2019.  “We want to ask at the national conference what type of election do you want, parliamentary or presidential, and what kind of law,” Salame said. The envoy said the national conference should “preferably” take place on Libyan soil.  He said surveys had shown that 80 percent of Libyans want elections to end the stalemate between Libya’s rival administrations, both of which are backed by armed groups.  Salame said he hoped the Palermo conference would put pressure on Libya’s internationally recognised parliament, the House of Representatives (HOR), which has refused to approve an election law. “The HOR has been sterile, has produced no law ... I think we need wider representation of the Libyans,” he said. Salame also called on the central bank to unify the exchange rate of the dinar to the dollar to prevent armed groups with access to cheap dollars from selling them on the black market at a premium. Libya had introduced a fee on hard currency transactions which had helped to lower the spread between official and black market rate but a unified rate was needed. “We applaud the results ... we want this exchange rate to go even lower,” he said.

2018-11-12,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 12 (Reuters) - What a difference a month can make. The crude oil market has gone from worrying about not having enough supply to fretting that prices are being overwhelmed by a glut. The main news from Sunday’s meeting of producers in Abu Dhabi is that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut the amount it supplies in December by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from November levels. While Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the reduction was because of a seasonal drop in demand, it’s not hard to read between the lines that the world’s largest crude exporter is growing increasingly concerned about the decline in prices. Having reached a four-year high in early October, Brent crude has slid by about 19 percent to close at $70.18 a barrel on Nov. 9. It’s no secret that the Saudis, and other producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, would prefer crude prices to remain north of $80 a barrel, a level that they believe is sustainable. The elephant in the room for OPEC and its allies, which include Russia, is U.S. President Donald Trump. Part of the reason oil prices have retreated is producers responded to Trump’s pressure for more supply in order to compensate for the expected loss of Iranian barrels with the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran on Nov. 4. However, the Trump administration decided at the last minute to grant waivers to eight users of Iranian crude, including top buyers China and India. The six-month waivers effectively kicked the can on Iranian sanctions down the road. While the problem of how effective the sanctions will eventually be is still there, it’s not an issue for the short term. What is also uncertain is exactly how Saudi Arabia, Russia and other producers feel about the actions of the Trump administration. The Saudis agreed in the middle of the year to supply more crude to the market largely in response to Twitter pressure from Trump. They may now feel they’ve been played by the U.S. president. Trump may have succeeded in getting oil prices to decline, with the Iran waivers seemingly being the last straw for any bulls left in the market. But now the Saudis have stepped in to try and prevent prices from falling further, with Brent gaining as much as 1.4 percent in early Asian trade on Monday. That gain may not seem too impressive, but it does mean that Brent has avoided, for now, falling into the traditional definition of a bear market. It briefly touched the threshold of a 20 percent decline during trade on Nov. 9, but avoided closing in bear territory. If the Saudis and other producers do take steps to limit supply in order to support prices, this will almost certainly spark the ire of the mercurial U.S. president. The United States still has considerable leverage in the Middle East, and Trump may be prepared to use this in order to keep oil prices low. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month remains a wild card. The exact role of the Saudi government and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is still to be clarified, even though Riyadh has acknowledged that its agents carried out a premeditated killing. While there are still uncertainties surrounding the outlook for crude oil, it seems the market is choosing to focus on the narrative of increasing supply. The market structure has shifted from backwardation, where prices for further-dated months are lower than those for prompt delivery, to contango, where prompt prices are lower than those for later delivery. This is usually a sign that the market is facing over-supply. While the contango is still modest, the risk is that it steepens if investors continue to take the view that there is no shortage of crude. Certainly, the rise to a 3 1/2-year high in the drilling rig count in the United States last week suggests that more supply is coming on stream. What the market will now have to assess is how successful the Saudis will be in restraining their own output, and that of their allies. Having completed a U-turn in the past few weeks, the market may well have to swing its views again in the coming weeks.

2018-11-12,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) By Rod Nickel CALGARY, Alberta, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest railroad says it is attracting interest from oil producers in its effort to move crude in solid, puck-like form, as clogged pipelines divert more oil to riskier rail transport. Congested pipelines have stranded much of Canada’s crude in Alberta, driving discounts to record-high levels. Canadian heavy crude traded on Friday for less than one-third of the U.S. benchmark light oil price. The latest blow to the sector landed on Thursday, when a U.S. court ruled construction must stop on TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline. Pipeline pressure has pushed more crude onto trains owned by Canadian National Railway Co and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. But crude movement by rail is costly and prone to spills and sometimes disastrous accidents, such as the 2013 derailment at Lac Megantic, Quebec that killed dozens of people. Enter CN’s patented Canapux product, which is solidified crude encased in plastic, named to evoke the country’s most popular sport, hockey. The railroad argues that solid crude, never before commercially shipped in the world, can be transported more cheaply, efficiently and with less environmental risk than liquid crude in tank cars. Since it floats, Canapux is easier to recover from a spill into a water body. Interest from crude producers, buyers and transport companies picked up after a Canadian court in August overturned Ottawa’s approval for the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion, said James Cairns, CN’s vice-president of petroleum and chemicals. “There have been a lot more discussions about, ‘How do we get this done?’” Cairns said. “Conversations are much more advanced than they were.” CN is seeking commercial partners to build a pilot plant that will process 10,000 barrels per day of undiluted heavy crude into Canapux. The plant, to be built either at the Alberta crude storage hub around Edmonton or on an oil producer’s site, is estimated to cost less than C$50 million ($37.8 million). It could be running as soon as 2020, Cairns said. CN’s oil pucks would move in gondola cars, which weigh less than tank cars, allowing the railroad to load them with more crude. They also do not require diluent, an ultra-light oil that is mixed with crude when it is shipped in liquid form by rail or pipeline. As a result, Canapux’ shipping costs would knock off nearly half the expense of rail transportation in liquid form, according to CN. Other entrepreneurs have pursued similar ideas for several years, from semi-solid blobs to pellets. Alberta inventor Cal Broder said two refineries in China are interested in his BitCrude product, which he intends to produce from bitumen. He plans a test shipment of several containers of his butter-like crude to Asia before year-end. Both BitCrude and Canapux still require government regulatory approvals. Success of either product also hinges on convincing oil refineries to make changes needed to convert solid crude back to liquid for processing. But the idea of shipping crude in solid form is compelling, said Alex Pourbaix, chief executive of Cenovus Energy, a major Canadian shipper of crude by rail. “I am quite intrigued by those technologies,” he said in an interview. “We’re going to make sure we take a hard look at them all.” $1 = 1.3222 Canadian dollars

2018-11-12,"(Adds details, quotes, background) ABU DHABI/MOSCOW, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Russia’s Lukoil sees no need to cut crude output in 2019, CEO Vagit Alekperov said on Monday, as global producers discuss the situation in oil markets. Russia is part of a group of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing nations that teamed up two years ago in an effort to rebalance the market. The group first decided to cut output but changed course in June as prices spiked on fears of a shortage. On Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies agreed that technical analysis showed a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from October levels. Vagit Alekperov, head of Russia’s second-biggest oil producer Lukoil, told reporters he saw no need for a cut next year. “I don’t see any point in cutting ... So far I don’t see any necessity for this,” he told reporters in Abu Dhabi. Lukoil is one of a number of Russian oil companies that have increased production since the deal was reversed in June. Russia’s average daily oil production stood at 11.39 million barrels between Nov. 1 and 11, a source familiar with Energy Ministry data told Reuters on Monday, down slightly from October’s 30-year high of 11.41 million bpd. October’s level was around 460,000 bpd more than the 10.947 million bpd it had initially agreed to produce. Russian oil companies supported the June decision to raise output, as many had put new projects on hold due to previous cuts. Lukoil, for example, has increased output by 30,000 bpd in line with the June agreement to ease curbs on production, Alekperov said earlier on Monday. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told state television Rossiya-24 in an interview broadcast on Monday that no decision on global oil production was taken at a joint OPEC/non-OPEC ministerial committee meeting over the weekend.

A 2-percent oil price jump initially supported European equities but the gains fizzled rapidly as fears grew for Italian lender Carige whose shares were suspended after reports of a capital hole. While Shanghai was lifted one percent by regulators’ promise to simplify share buybacks, MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.3 percent and Asian markets broadly weakened following Friday’s weak Wall Street close. Investors fretted about signs of slowing growth in China where e-commerce giant Alibaba was the latest to raise alarm bells, with the slowest ever annual sales growth during its Singles Day shopping event. Many also reckon that U.S. President Donald Trump could turn up the heat over trade, further damaging China’s economy. All that, coupled with European political risks, conspired to push the dollar 0.6 percent higher against a basket of currencies. Sterling fell 1 percent while the euro, which comprises more than 50 percent of the dollar index, fell 0.7 percent to its lowest since July 2017. “King dollar has staged a return,” Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole, said, adding that investors had piled back into the dollar after last week’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting confirmed a rate-tightening path. “Euro and pound are both hurt by political risk and that is aggravating underperformance versus the dollar,” Marinov said. In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to abandon plans for an emergency cabinet meeting to approve a Brexit agreement, the Independent news website reported, stoking fears that the government might not be able to secure a deal that satisfied both the European Union and members of the ruling party. The opposition Labour Party said that if May’s Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, it would push for a national election and possibly also another referendum. Latest futures data showed net short sterling positions registered their biggest weekly rise in 1-1/2 months Deutsche Bank analysts, however, predicted more pain, telling clients: “not enough risk is priced into sterling given the parliamentary problems ahead”. For the euro, Italy was the main focus, with Rome facing a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU, though it has so far refused to cut the draft budget deficit, setting the stage for a collision with Brussels. Markets were also spooked by reports that Banca Carige would need around 400 million euros ($451 million) to plug a hole in its capital base and Italy’s deposit protection fund could fill only part of it. That raises the spectre of a banking crisis in the euro zone’s third-biggest economy, keeping Italy’s bond yield spread over Germany - the risk premium attached to Italian assets - around the psychologically key 300 basis-point mark . Italian bank shares fell 0.6 percent Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management, predicted the euro would tumble below $1.10 from the current $1.126 “as renewed eurozone and Brexit angst and a diverging economic outlook with a strong U.S. economy versus a weakening eurozone economy will trigger further euro selling pressure.” All of this has been good news for dollar bulls, who have benefited from safe-haven flows. Against the Japanese yen the dollar gained 0.3 percent, touching its weakest since Oct. 4, while it also rose 0.4 percent to the Swiss franc. Speculators’ net long dollar positions rose last week to the highest since January 2016, calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, show U.S. trade is likely to be thinned by the Veterans Day holiday, with Treasury bond markets shuttered. Futures for the S&P500 were flat while the Dow Jones was marginally lower and the Nasdaq was indicated 0.2 percent firmer after sharp falls on Friday. The other big move was in commodities, where Saudi Arabia’s energy minister took some pressure off last week’s oil price drop, saying on Sunday that Riyadh could reduce supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. That jolted Brent crude futures up more than 2.07 percent to a high of $71.88 per barrel. However, the supply cut may prove to be a temporary solution to falling prices as global growth slows, with two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - expected to report a contraction in output in coming days. “Supply-side surprises appear to be the main culprit, but concern that global demand is slowing may also be creeping into markets and weighing on risk appetite,” the ANZ analysts said.

2018-11-12,"* China’s natural gas imports up 33 pct y/y over Jan-Oct * Japan’s LNG imports down 17 pct due to nuclear restarts * China’s gas demand to grow 10 pct next year -FGE analyst By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Nov 12 (Reuters) - China has overtaken Japan to become the world’s top importer of natural gas, as Beijing’s crackdown on pollution boosts its demand for the more environmentally friendly fuel, while the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan reduces its LNG imports. China’s total natural gas imports over January to October this year via pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG) were at 72.06 million tonnes, up a third from the same period last year, according to Reuters calculations based on General Administration of Customs data. Japan, on the other hand, imported about 69.35 tonnes of LNG over that period, according to ship-tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon, down 17 percent for the same 10 months of 2017. Japan imports all of its gas as LNG. China’s push to switch away from coal to natural gas is key to its rapid gas demand growth, said Edmund Siau, gas analyst with energy consultancy FGE. “Meanwhile, nuclear reactors continue to restart in Japan, which reduces demand for gas-fired power generation and consequently LNG demand,” Siau said. China - already the biggest importer of oil and coal - is the world’s third-biggest user of natural gas behind the United States and Russia, but it has to import around 40 percent of its total needs as domestic production can’t keep up with demand. China still lags behind Japan on LNG imports but could overtake its North Asia neighbour in the early 2020s, FGE’s Siau said. China’s surging demand pushed it past South Korea as the world’s second-biggest LNG importer in 2017. China last year started to move millions of households and many industrial facilities from coal to gas as part of efforts to clean its skies, sparking an unprecedented rally in overseas import orders. Its three biggest LNG suppliers are Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. Pipeline imports come from Central Asia and Myanmar, and a pipeline connecting China to Russia is under construction. “China has become a hotbed of contracting activity, with many suppliers courting the large Chinese national oil companies as well as the emerging buyers for long-term contracts,” Siau said. China’s natural gas demand is expected to grow about 10 percent next year, he said, while Japan’s gas demand will continue to fall.

2018-11-12,"* Falih: “We need to do whatever it takes to balance the market” * Oil prices set for largest one-day increase in a month * Falih: U.S. sanctions removed less Iranian oil than expected (Adds quotes, oil price) By Maha El Dahan  and Tuqa Khalid ABU DHABI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday OPEC and its allies agree that technical analysis shows a need to cut oil supply next year by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from October levels to balance the market. Speaking at an industry event in Abu Dhabi, he said demand from Saudi Arabia’s customers in December would fall by more than half a million bpd compared with November and there was a consensus not to allow oil inventory to build up. Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Monday, set for their largest one-day increase in a month after the Saudi comments. “If all things remain equal, and they almost certainly will not as things will change - it is a dynamic market - then the technical analysis we saw yesterday .... tells us that there will need to be a reduction of supply from October levels approaching a million barrels,” Falih said. “The consensus is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market. If that means trimming supplies by a million (bpd), we will.” U.S. sanctions against Iran had removed less oil than expected from the market, Falih said. Washington has granted exemptions to Iran’s biggest buyers. “Sanctions didn’t cut so much out of the market as anticipated,” Falih said. Saudi-led OPEC and its allies including Russia decided in June to relax output curbs in place since 2017, after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce oil prices and make up for supply losses from Iran. Oil prices have since come under downward pressure from rising supplies, despite the new U.S. sanctions on Iran. Forecasts of a 2019 supply surplus and slowing demand have also dented the market. Falih said Saudi Arabia was not preparing for a breakup of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and believed the group would long remain the global central bank for oil. Saudi Arabia’s top government-funded think-tank has been studying the possible effects on oil markets of a breakup of OPEC, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Falih said the think-tank was just trying “to think outside the box” and analyse all scenarios. “OPEC is essential for the stability of oil markets,” he said. On Sunday, Falih had announced plans by Saudi Arabia to reduce oil supply to world markets by 500,000 bpd in December as the country faces uncertain prospects in getting other producers to agree to a coordinated output cut. Falih told reporters that state oil company Saudi Aramco’s customer nominations would fall by 500,000 bpd in December versus November due to seasonal lower demand. The cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about 0.5 percent.

A 2 percent oil price jump initially supported European equities but the gains fizzled rapidly as fears grew for Italian lender Carige whose shares were suspended after reports of a capital hole. While Shanghai was lifted one percent by regulators’ promise to simplify share buybacks, MSCI’s world equity index was down 0.3 percent and Asian markets broadly weakened following Friday’s weak Wall Street close. Investors fretted over signs of slowing growth in China where e-commerce giant Alibaba posted the slowest ever annual sales growth during its Singles Day shopping event . Many also reckon that U.S. President Donald Trump could turn up the heat over trade, further damaging China’s economy. All that, coupled with European political risks, conspired to push the dollar 0.6 percent higher against a basket of currencies. Sterling fell almost 1 percent while the euro, which comprises over 50 percent of the dollar index, lost 0.7 percent to its lowest since July 2017. “King dollar has staged a return,” Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole, said, adding that investors had piled back into the dollar after last week’s U.S. Federal Reserve meeting confirmed a rate-tightening path. “Euro and pound are both hurt by political risk and that is aggravating underperformance versus the dollar,” Marinov said. In Britain, there is doubt the government will be able to secure a Brexit agreement that satisfies the European Union as well as members of the ruling  party, and Prime Minister Theresa May was forced to abandon plans for an emergency cabinet meeting to approve a deal, the Independent reported. The opposition Labour Party said that if May’s Brexit deal was voted down in parliament, it would push for a national election and also possibly another referendum. Deutsche Bank analysts suggested more pain ahead, telling clients: “not enough risk is priced into sterling given the parliamentary problems ahead.” For the euro, Italy was the main focus, with Rome facing a Tuesday deadline to submit a revised budget to the EU, though it has so far refused to cut the draft budget deficit, setting the stage for a collision with Brussels. Markets were also spooked by reports that Banca Carige would need around 400 million euros ($451 million) to plug a hole in its capital base and Italy’s deposit protection fund could fill only part of it. That raises the spectre of a banking crisis in the euro zone’s third-biggest economy, weakening Italian shares and keeping Italy’s bond yield spread over Germany — the risk premium attached to Italian assets — around the psychologically key 300 basis-point mark. Bernd Berg, global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management predicted the euro to tumble below $1.10 from the current $1.126 “as renewed eurozone and Brexit angst and a diverging economic outlook with a strong U.S. economy versus a weakening eurozone economy will trigger further euro selling pressure.” All of this has been good news for dollar bulls, who have benefited from safe-haven flows. Against the Japanese yen the dollar gained 0.3 percent, touching its weakest since Oct. 4, while it also rose 0.4 percent to the Swiss franc. U.S. shares were set to open flat during a session likely to be thinned by the Veterans Day holiday, with Treasury bond markets shuttered. Futures for the S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq were flat to slightly firmer after sharp falls on Friday. The other big move was in commodities, where Saudi Arabia’s energy minister took some pressure off last week’s oil price drop, saying on Sunday that Riyadh could reduce supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. That jolted Brent crude futures more than 2.07 percent to a high of $71.88 per barrel. However, the supply cut may prove to be a temporary solution to falling prices as global growth slows, with two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - expected to report a contraction in output in coming days. “Supply-side surprises appear to be the main culprit, but concern that global demand is slowing may also be creeping into markets and weighing on risk appetite,” the ANZ analysts said.

2018-11-12,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - What a difference a month can make. The crude oil market has gone from worrying about not having enough supply to fretting that prices are being overwhelmed by a glut. The main news from Sunday’s meeting of producers in Abu Dhabi is that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut the amount it supplies in December by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from November levels. While Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the reduction was because of a seasonal drop in demand, it’s not hard to read between the lines that the world’s largest crude exporter is growing increasingly concerned about the decline in prices. Having reached a four-year high in early October, Brent crude has slid by about 19 percent to close at $70.18 a barrel on Nov. 9. It’s no secret that the Saudis, and other producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, would prefer crude prices to remain north of $80 a barrel, a level that they believe is sustainable. The elephant in the room for OPEC and its allies, which include Russia, is U.S. President Donald Trump. Part of the reason oil prices have retreated is producers responded to Trump’s pressure for more supply in order to compensate for the expected loss of Iranian barrels with the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran on Nov. 4. However, the Trump administration decided at the last minute to grant waivers to eight users of Iranian crude, including top buyers China and India. The six-month waivers effectively kicked the can on Iranian sanctions down the road. While the problem of how effective the sanctions will eventually be is still there, it’s not an issue for the short term. What is also uncertain is exactly how Saudi Arabia, Russia and other producers feel about the actions of the Trump administration. The Saudis agreed in the middle of the year to supply more crude to the market largely in response to Twitter pressure from Trump. They may now feel they’ve been played by the U.S. president. Trump may have succeeded in getting oil prices to decline, with the Iran waivers seemingly being the last straw for any bulls left in the market. But now the Saudis have stepped in to try and prevent prices from falling further, with Brent gaining as much as 1.4 percent in early Asian trade on Monday. That gain may not seem too impressive, but it does mean that Brent has avoided, for now, falling into the traditional definition of a bear market. It briefly touched the threshold of a 20 percent decline during trade on Nov. 9, but avoided closing in bear territory. If the Saudis and other producers do take steps to limit supply in order to support prices, this will almost certainly spark the ire of the mercurial U.S. president. The United States still has considerable leverage in the Middle East, and Trump may be prepared to use this in order to keep oil prices low. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month remains a wild card. The exact role of the Saudi government and the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is still to be clarified, even though Riyadh has acknowledged that its agents carried out a premeditated killing. While there are still uncertainties surrounding the outlook for crude oil, it seems the market is choosing to focus on the narrative of increasing supply. The market structure has shifted from backwardation, where prices for further-dated months are lower than those for prompt delivery, to contango, where prompt prices are lower than those for later delivery. This is usually a sign that the market is facing over-supply. While the contango is still modest, the risk is that it steepens if investors continue to take the view that there is no shortage of crude. Certainly, the rise to a 3 1/2-year high in the drilling rig count in the United States last week suggests that more supply is coming on stream. What the market will now have to assess is how successful the Saudis will be in restraining their own output, and that of their allies. Having completed a U-turn in the past few weeks, the market may well have to swing its views again in the coming weeks.

2018-11-12,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan index down 0.17 pct * Weak China data, U.S. Fed rate hike expectations weigh * Oil prices rebound on Saudi production cut plans By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Monday, extending weakness in global equity markets at the end of last week as soft Chinese economic data and falling oil prices rekindled anxiety about the outlook for world growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.17 percent in early trade. Australian shares were down 0.08 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index eased 0.12 percent. A combination of weak factory-gate inflation data in China and low oil prices weighed on global stocks on Friday, dragging MSCI’s gauge of global stocks to its worst day in two weeks. The index was last 0.11 percent lower. Risk asset markets have been under intense pressure recently as worries about a peak in earnings growth added to anxiety about slowing global trade and investment. A spike in U.S. bond yields, driven by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep raising borrowing costs, has also shaken emerging markets as investors poured money into U.S. dollar assets. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.77 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.65 percent. The Wall Street losses came after the Fed had earlier in the week held rates steady but stayed on track to tighten policy next month. The Fed’s stance disappointed some investors who had hoped that the rout in equities in October might have prompted policy makers to take a more cautious approach on the outlook for rates. “Markets are pricing in a 25bp hike in December, with data flow suggesting pipeline inflation pressures are building,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. Taking some pressure off a sharp drop in oil prices last week, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Sunday that the country plans to reduce its oil supply to world markets by 500,000 barrels per day in December, representing a global reduction of about 0.5 percent. That helped to lift oil prices, with U.S. crude rising 0.90 percent to $60.73 a barrel and Brent crude gaining 1.13 percent to $70.97 per barrel. However, the Saudi supply cut may prove to be a temporary solution to falling prices as global growth slows, with two of the world’s biggest economies - Germany and Japan - expected to report a contraction in output in the coming days. “Supply-side surprises appear to be the main culprit, but concern that global demand is slowing may also be creeping into markets and weighing on risk appetite,” the ANZ analysts said. In currency markets, the dollar rose 0.07 percent against the yen to 113.90, and the euro was down 0.06 percent on the day at $1.1327. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up at 97.004. The British pound was off 0.3 percent to fetch $1.2934. The sterling has been under pressure over the past few weeks as investors worried whether an orderly Brexit deal would be achieved. Spot gold gained 0.15 percent to $1,211.03 per ounce.

International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were at $71.11 per barrel at 0051 GMT, up 93 cents, or 1.3 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $60.73 per barrel, up 54 cents, or 0.9 percent from their last settlement. Saudi Arabia plans to reduce oil supply to world markets by 0.5 million barrels per day in December, its energy minister said on Sunday, as the OPEC power faces uncertain prospects in its attempts to persuade other producers to agree a coordinated output cut. Khalid al-Falih told reporters that Saudi Aramco’s customer crude oil nominations would fall by 500,000 bpd in December versus November due to seasonal lower demand. The cut represents a reduction in global oil supply of about 0.5 percent. The announcement came after crude prices declined by around 20 percent over a month, as supply has surged, especially by the top-three producers USA, Russia and Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia has stepped in front of the oil market bears, proactively announcing they will reduce exports,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. A big concern for Saudi Arabia and other traditional producers from the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is the surge in U.S. output. U.S. energy firms last week added 12 oil rigs in the week to Nov. 9 looking for new reserves, bringing the total count to 886, the highest level since March 2015, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. The rig count is an indicator that U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, already at a record 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd), will increase further. “One thing that is abundantly clear, OPEC is in for a shale shocker as U.S. crude production increased to a record 11.6 million barrels per day and will cross the 12 million threshold next year,” Innes said.

2018-11-12,"(Repeats Friday’s story with no changes to text) * Officials hailed Rosneft privatisation in 2016 as success * Said sale showed Russia open for business despite sanctions * But state-owned bank VTB secretly financed much of deal-sources * Loaned around $6 bln to Qataris, over half value of sale-sources * Bank denies issuing loan to Qatari sovereign wealth fund By Tatiana Voronova, Oksana Kobzeva and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW/LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - It was billed as the deal that proved Russia remained open for business. “I want to congratulate you”, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his trusted ally Igor Sechin, after greeting him with a warm handshake in the Kremlin in December, 2016. Sechin had just announced the sale to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and giant commodity trader Glencore of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft, the state oil giant that he runs. The 10.2 billion euro ($11.57 billion) privatisation deal was designed to replenish Russia’s coffers, depleted by falling energy prices and Western sanctions. Some Russian officials hailed it as proof that despite growing political isolation from the West the country could still attract global investors. But now, nearly two years after the sale was first announced, nine sources with knowledge of the transaction have told Reuters that VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, itself financed a large share of the acquisition, undermining the deal’s stated aim to bring foreign money into the country. Based on accounts from five of the sources, the value of the Russian loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund is around $6 billion. VTB denied it issued a loan to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, called the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). “VTB has not issued and is not planning to issue a loan to QIA to finance the acquisition.” VTB data for September published by the Russian central bank showed that VTB loaned 434 billion roubles ($6.7 billion) for up to three years to unnamed foreign borrowers after having raised 350 billion roubles via loans from the central bank itself. VTB’s financial results, published on Nov. 8, showed that during the third quarter the volume of loans to its 10 biggest borrowers had gone up by 403 billion roubles, or approximately $6 billion. VTB declined to comment on the transactions, and the central bank did not respond to questions. The QIA declined to comment. The Kremlin did not comment. Rosneft did not respond to questions about the VTB loan to Qatar. Rosneft - the world’s biggest listed oil company by output - is the jewel in Russia’s corporate crown. But with Russia under sanctions, and facing the prospect of more sanctions to come, Sechin faced an uphill task in finding buyers or creditors willing to risk their own money to acquire a stake in Rosneft. The sanctions, imposed by the United States and European Union in the aftermath of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, limit the access of Russian firms to international debt markets. In the end, to get foreign investors on board, Russia has had to loan them billions, according to the sources’ account. Two sources familiar with the deal said that having a third party finance a large part of the acquisition was a condition for Qatar taking the stake. With oil prices today significantly higher than in late 2016, Russia’s need for foreign money has subsided. But should it need to tap international markets again, the story of the Rosneft sale points to the challenges it could face in bringing investors on board, especially as the United States levies more sanctions against Russia. The nine sources who told Reuters about the VTB loan to Qatar included a source close to VTB management, a Russian central bank official and a Russian government source familiar with foreign investments in Russia. At least four of the sources were directly involved in preparations for the loan. All the sources requested anonymity because they are not authorised to discuss the deal. In response to questions about how the privatisation of its stake as a whole was conducted, Rosneft said the deal was market-based and transparent and in the interests of all shareholders. It said all decisions relating to the deal underwent the relevant procedures for corporate approval, that the deal was supported by governments where participants are based, and was subject to compliance procedures in the relevant jurisdictions. “This is a unique example of an effective privatisation,” Rosneft said in a statement. As the end of 2016 drew nearer, Sechin, one of Putin’s closest lieutenants, was under pressure. The government had publicly announced it would sell a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft by the end of the year. The state budget, battered by a collapse in oil prices, an economic slump and the impact of Western sanctions, was showing a deficit of 3.5 percent. Russia’s economy was in its second year of recession and there was no prospect of a quick improvement in public finances. By the autumn, Sechin, who is now 58, thought he had a buyer: the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. According to two sources familiar with the developments, Mubadala agreed to buy the stake. But negotiations hit a snag after Rosneft twice changed the price tag, the two sources said, prompting the Emiratis to walk away from the deal. Mubadala declined to comment. Rosneft did not address questions about the Mubadala discussions. Sechin turned east and started talks with Japanese officials, according to a Russian government official, a source close to Rosneft and a recording of a conversation involving Sechin that emerged as part of an unrelated court case in which Sechin was a witness. The talks were held primarily with the Japanese Economy, Trade and Industry minister, Hiroshige Seko. If the deal was agreed, the owner of the stake would have become a large state Japanese investment fund such as GPIF, the government pension investment fund which has over $1.4 trillion assets under management, or state-run Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp (JOGMEC), three sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. That deal also ran into difficulties, according to Sechin’s account in the recording played in court, when Japan insisted on linking it to progress in a territorial dispute with Russia dating back to the end of World War Two. Eventually, the deal collapsed. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry did not respond to questions. Rosneft did not address Reuters’ questions about discussions with Japan. JOGMEC’s press service said it could not comment. GPIF said it could not comment on a discussion between governments because it was not directly involved. Still without a buyer, Sechin focused on two new potential suitors: Qatar’s investment fund QIA and global commodities trader Glencore. Neither was prepared to put up all of the asking price, according to three sources. In the past, Rosneft had gone to major Western banks, such as Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, to finance transactions, but the big international lenders have announced no major new loan deals with Rosneft since sanctions were imposed in 2014. In stepped Intesa Sanpaolo, a mid-sized Italian lender which had little experience in large Russian corporate deals. By early December, 2016, financing for the deal was falling into place. The buyers put in some of their own money: Qatar gave 2.5 billion euros and Glencore 300 million euros. The rest was debt, of which Intesa put up 5.2 billion euros. The balance, according to Glencore at the time, would come from unnamed Russian banks. The amount coming from the Russian banks was about $2.5 billion. Two banking sources close to Rosneft told Reuters that VTB was one of the banks that between them put up $2.5 billion in loans back in 2016. Those sources said the other Russian banks involved were Gazprombank and Otkritie, which, like VTB, have Kremlin connections, although Otkritie was privately held at the time. It is not clear what share of the $2.5 billion each of the three banks contributed. That contribution from VTB towards the $2.5 billion was separate to around $6 billion that, according to the nine sources, VTB provided to Qatar this year. In response to questions about the initial $2.5 billion in loans, VTB said it did not provide financing but it was the coordinating bank on behalf of Rosneft. Otkritie declined to comment. Gazprombank did not respond to questions. For the larger portion of the financing — the 5.2 billion euros loaned by Intesa — the Italian bank’s intention was to syndicate the loan, a common industry practice designed to spread the risk and dilute the burden on the bank’s own capital. But two banking sources and a source familiar with the Italian side of the deal said the syndication failed because European banks approached by Intesa were worried about the risk that providing finance for Rosneft, even if indirectly, would result in them falling foul of Western sanctions on Russia. Rosneft and Sechin are both subject to U.S. sanctions. Intesa declined to comment. At the time of the December 2016 announcement and in the weeks afterwards, Russian officials spoke publicly of a long-term partnership with the new Rosneft shareholders, Qatar and Glencore. But it became clear that the agreement was still in flux when, in September 2017, Sechin said a deal had been signed for Chinese energy firm CEFC to buy 14.2 percent of Rosneft from Qatar and Glencore. Explaining why the original deal had not stuck, he told Russian state television the new shareholders were finding the cost of servicing the debt too high. The Chinese deal though, was never closed. Before it was sealed, CEFC’s founder and chairman Ye Jianming was taken in for questioning and investigated by Chinese authorities for suspected economic crimes. Since then there has been no word on the status of the investigation, or if Ye has been charged. He was named, however, in a high-profile graft trial of a senior Communist Party official, state broadcaster CCTV reported last month. Neither Ye nor CEFC responded to calls from Reuters seeking comment. Once again, Sechin was in search of a buyer. Finally, in May this year, Qatar agreed to take on the part of the stake that had been covered by Intesa. Officially, no one has said how the new deal with Qatar is being financed, or who is providing the finance. It is clear that Intesa’s role has ended. A document dated Sept. 6, 2018 and lodged with Singapore’s official business register, where the vehicle that held the stake on behalf of Qatar and Glencore is registered, stated that Intesa had ceased to be the creditor for the stake and no longer held shares as collateral. The document did not state who was the new creditor. According to the nine sources familiar with the arrangement, that new creditor is VTB. At a reception at the Italian embassy in Moscow last November to receive an award “for services to Italy”, Sechin, champagne glass in hand, linked arms with a grey-haired Russian man in fashionable glasses. It was Andrey Kostin, the chief executive of the bank that helped to finance the privatisation – Russia’s VTB.

2018-11-12,"BARCELONA, Nov 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Finance to provide electric power to nearly 1 billion people who live without it is rising - but too slowly to meet a global goal to reach everyone by 2030, an international body said on Monday. Meanwhile, funding to expand cleaner, more energy-efficient cooking has declined, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) said in a report that compared financing levels in 2015 and 2016 with the preceding two-year period. In 20 countries that are home to four-fifths of those who lack access to power, electrification finance rose by 56 percent to an average of about $30 billion per year in 2015-2016. But that is still far below the $52 billion needed each year, the report said. And more than a quarter of the annual investment in 2015 and 2016, or $8 billion per year, was for grid-connected fossil fuel plants, double spending on them in 2013-14 - something “the global community may be concerned to note”, it added. China provided a fifth of that fossil-fuel expansion money. SEforALL CEO Rachel Kyte, who is also special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for energy access, said the funding uptick for electric power was “nowhere near sufficient for us to reach the goal, or to meet the needs, or to make these communities resilient in the face of climate change impacts”. In seven developing countries, including Nigeria, Malawi, Sudan and Afghanistan, investment in electrification dropped by 50 percent or more in 2015 and 2016 compared to 2013-14, with sub-Saharan Africa as a whole receiving less money. India, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Kenya garnered 86 percent of investment in 2015-2016 for expansion of electricity access among the 20 countries studied. Within that, the same four received the most money for new coal-fired power plants, which often do not help the poorest where they are not connected to the power grid, the report said. “The benefits (fossil fuel plants) may bring in terms of energy access are countered by the negative impacts on human health and their contributions to global climate change,” it said. The study looked at both international and domestic sources of funding averaged over two years. The research highlighted the tiny fraction of funding going into off-grid renewable electricity, including solar. A growing number of policy makers and experts view such systems as the fastest and most cost-effective way to boost electricity access, it said. Annual investment in off-grid electricity rose to an average of $380 million in both 2015 and 2016, from $210 million per year in 2013 and 2014, but that investment accounted for just 1.3 percent of the total finance tracked, the report said. Kyte told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the figures pointed to “an under-appreciation of how important off-grid is going to be for these countries”. She urged development banks to focus more on decentralised clean energy when helping countries expand power supplies. Last week, close to 60 environment and anti-poverty groups based in Africa and beyond sent an open letter to the African Development Bank (AfDB) urging it to step up financial support for clean energy access on the continent. After launching a “New Deal on Energy for Africa” in 2016, the bank’s financing for off-grid and mini-grid power rose to 6.6 percent of its energy project approvals for 2016-2017, from less than 2 percent in the two years before, the letter noted. Under the New Deal, a partnership that aims to achieve universal access to electricity in Africa by 2025, the AfDB has committed to invest about $12 billion between 2016 and 2020, while leveraging up to $50 billion in co-financing. But the civil society letter cited new data from the International Energy Agency estimating that, as sub-Saharan Africa’s population grows, 600 million of its people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, mainly in rural areas, “unless there are major changes to the status quo”. SEforALL’s Kyte said development banks were also failing to get to grips with the massive need for cleaner cooking, despite some states such as Rwanda and Indonesia ramping up efforts to wean people off polluting fuels like kerosene and charcoal. Nearly 3 billion people around the world still cook with dirty fuels that cause indoor air pollution responsible for over 4 million deaths a year, especially among women and children. Yet funding to catalyse a switch to cleaner cooking methods and heat sources remains “abysmally low”, dropping 5 percent to $30 million per year in 2015-16, the SEforALL report said. “There is something profoundly off in the way we are approaching this,” Kyte said. The best way to boost clean energy access overall is for governments to put in place supportive policies, and to develop their capital markets to entice investment - but many still require international assistance to make that happen, she noted.
