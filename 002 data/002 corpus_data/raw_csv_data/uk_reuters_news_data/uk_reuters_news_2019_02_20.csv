2019-02-20,"MELBOURNE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Australia’s three east coast liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants are unlikely to ever run at their combined full capacity of 25.3 million tonnes a year as there is not enough gas to feed them and meet local demand, a study released on Thursday said. The three plants - Queensland Curtis LNG, Australia Pacific LNG and Gladstone LNG - were the world’s first LNG exporters to use coal seam gas rather than gas from conventional fields. But the wells they source their gas from in Australia’s Surat and Bowen basins in Queensland state have turned out to be less productive than expected. As a result, the three plants - each with two processing units - have been running below capacity, operating at average 82 percent in 2018. “Unfortunately, there are serious headwinds coming and the outlook is less rosy as the industry over-reached by building three projects of six trains,” EnergyQuest CEO Graeme Bethune said in a statement. QCLNG, run by Royal Dutch Shell averaged 87 percent capacity, and GLNG, run by Santos, only 65 percent, EnergyQuest, an industry consultancy, said. In a detailed study of government and company drilling and production data and reserves booked at coal seam gas (CSG) prospects and licenses, it found that only 56 percent of booked proven and probable reserves had shown any commercial productivity. “The emerging and critical shortages are resulting from the fact the CSG LNG projects were sanctioned on ambitious estimates of proved and probable (2P) reserves, not proven reserves (1P) that underpin conventional LNG projects,” Bethune said. He predicted that by 2025 at least two trains would have to be shut to keep four trains running at full capacity, which would reduce medium-term exports to around 17 million tonnes a year, down from about 21 million tonnes in 2018. About 70 percent of exports go to China, 16 percent to South Korea and 9 percent to Japan. Exacerbating the problem, the producers have come under pressure to step up gas sales into the domestic market, with supply in Australia’s southeast falling as ageing offshore fields dry up and as states restrict drilling onshore. The three projects supplied about 25 percent of Australia’s eastern demand in 2018. “With dwindling production from southern gas fields, the political pressure on the LNG producers to divert gas to the domestic market is likely to intensify,” Bethune said.

2019-02-20,"(Corrects typos in paragraphs 8, 9 and 12) * Agreement similar to 2017 framework deal * Acacia says has not seen deal yet * Sources say Barrick and Acacia to meet next week By John Benny Feb 20 (Reuters) - Canadian miner Barrick Gold outlined on Wednesday details of a deal it reached with the government of Tanzania to settle its disputes with Acacia Mining , including a $300 million payment to resolve tax claims in the country. The news sent London-listed shares in Acacia, which is 63.9 percent owned by Barrick, up 6 percent to their highest since October 2017, when an initial framework agreement was announced. Barrick’s announcement confirms the 2017 deal which called for the creation of a local firm in Tanzania to manage Acacia’s assets, a 50-50 split of economic benefits and a $300 million payment to resolve all outstanding tax claims in the East African country. Acacia, which was not allowed to negotiate for itself, and Tanzania’s government have been locked in a prolonged conflict with the government tearing up mining contracts, hiking taxes and royalties, and banning exports of raw minerals. Sources have said initial agreement had been difficult to reach due to differing views from the government and the two companies about how the $300 million would be paid. “While the original deal details have been known for over a year now, we believe that the actual execution of the US$300 million payout ... will remove a major overhang for Barrick and Acacia,” Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. This also marks a victory for Barrick’s new Chief Executive Mark Bristow, who took the helm in January after the gold company merged with Randgold Resources. “Significant amounts of real value have been destroyed by this dispute and, in Barrick’s view, this proposal will allow the business to focus on rebuilding its mining operations in partnership with their respective stakeholders,” Barrick’s Bristol said in a statement. Separately, Acacia said it had not yet received Barrick’s proposal. Barrick said the proposal would soon be presented to Acacia’s independent directors. A source at Acacia said the company planned to meet Barrick next week to get more details. The deal is expected to be implemented by the end of March, the Tanzanian government said in a statement. “This announcement provides opportunity for Bulyanhulu to be restarted and some value to be recreated within the company,” said Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat, referring to a mine where Acacia lowered operations due to the export ban. Acacia’s troubles in Tanzania began after President John Magufuli, nicknamed “The Bulldozer”, swept to power in 2015 pledging to secure a bigger share of resource wealth and cut corruption. It was handed a $190 billion tax bill - about four times the country’s gross domestic product - for underreporting output. That was later revised down to $300 million.

2019-02-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of stocks across the globe hit a more than four-month high on Wednesday on hopes for progress in trade talks between the United States and China, and a supportive backdrop from major central banks also helped push risk assets higher. Crude prices rose to their 2019 highs helped by output cuts from top producers as well as U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Stocks started with a rally in Asia that pushed the MSCI world equity index to its highest since October after U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1. Many had feared U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (153 billion pounds) worth of Chinese imports would rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal was reached by then. European stock indexes also strengthened, with a region-wide index at a four-month high. On Wall Street, stocks wobbled before ending higher after Federal Reserve policymakers signaled they will soon lay out a plan to manage the bank’s $4 trillion balance sheet, but policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted “patient” stance on U.S. rates policy will last. The tone of the Fed meeting “was decidedly noncommittal, and the minutes recreated this noncommittal message in more detail,” said Jefferies analysts led by Ward McCarthy in a note. “The FOMC is on track to curtail the normalization of the balance sheet without providing any solid reasoning for doing so.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.12 points, or 0.24 percent, to 25,954.44, the S&P 500 gained 4.94 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,784.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.30 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,489.07. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.67 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.19 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.13 percent higher. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1 percent to close at the highest level since August. While hopes for a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies are seen as the primary driver for world stocks, dovish central bank messages from the United States to Asia and the ECB are also playing a part. On currency markets, the dollar index rose 0.04 percent, with the euro down 0.02 percent to $1.1338 while sterling was last trading at $1.3047, down 0.11 percent on the day. The Japanese yen weakened 0.20 percent versus the greenback at 110.87 per dollar after Japan recorded its biggest annual drop in exports in January for more than two years, and on recent dovish Bank of Japan signals. The offshore yuan rose 0.4 percent against the dollar after touching a three-week high of 6.7067. U.S. oil prices rose above $57 per barrel for the first time in three months supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown kept the market wobbly.  U.S. crude rose 1.47 percent to $57.28 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.14, up 1.04 percent on the day. U.S. Treasury yields ticked up after the Fed minutes showed committee members were undecided on whether to hike interest rates again this year.

2019-02-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. federal officials have decided to end negotiations with California over the Trump administration’s plans to roll back fuel economy rules designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a government official said on Wednesday. California and 19 other states have demanded the Trump administration abandon a proposal made in August to freeze fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and strip California of the ability to impose stricter rules. Aside from the threat of increased pollution, Detroit automakers have the greatest financial interests at stake.  General Motors, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles generate most of their global profits from sales of fuel-thirsty large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States. All three have discontinued or planned to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups to focus on trucks and SUVs. The rules to require automakers to roughly double average fuel efficiency by 2025 – with a corresponding decline in carbon dioxide emissions – were one of the Obama administration’s most significant climate policy actions.  Since taking office, Trump has worked to roll back a broad range of Obama environmental policies that were opposed by the oil and coal industries.  As the 2020 election cycle heats up, the fight over automotive emissions promises to be a dividing line between Trump and Democrats, many of whom are embracing a platform of aggressive action to curb climate emissions in what they call the Green New Deal. Scrapping the talks also comes as power struggle between California and Trump grows. The Trump administration on Tuesday canceled $929 million in federal funds for a California high-speed rail project. California’s governor quickly linked that move to California leading a 16 state coalition challenging Trump’s national emergency to obtain funds for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.    The California Air Resources Board (CARB), California’s top clean air regulator, has been meeting with officials from the White House, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department over Trump administration efforts to stop California from tightening vehicle emissions rules in the state. The government official offered no further details on the end of the talks and it was not immediately clear when an announcement would be made. California officials already have filed suit to block the Trump administration proposal to roll back federal fuel economy targets for 2022-2025. It is not clear how the industry would respond to the formal adoption of Trump’s proposed freeze, and likely litigation by California and other states. CARB Chair Mary Nichols last year said the state was willing to give automakers more flexibility to comply with vehicle greenhouse gas limits.  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Nichols met two weeks ago in San Francisco but there were no substantive discussions, said CARB spokesman Stanley Young.  “The administration broke off communications before Christmas and never responded to our suggested areas of compromise — or offered any compromise proposal at all. We concluded at that point that they were never serious about negotiating,” Young said. A source familiar with those discussions said EPA officials did not work on the rule during the government shutdown. “There was no real effort to get to yes,” the source said. Trump’s EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed a rule in August that would maintain emissions standards at 2020 levels rather than requiring that they improve. Scientists have linked rising fossil fuel emissions to higher temperatures that have worsened drought conditions in California blamed for devastating fires.     California officials and environmental groups have said the Trump administration proposal would deal a blow to efforts to contain that damage. Ford Motor Co on Wednesday said it was “disappointed” in reports the talks had fallen apart. “The auto industry needs regulatory certainty, not protracted litigation,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of global operations said in a statement.  Fiat Chrysler declined comment. General Motors and the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Trump’s proposed freeze would result in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. The administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade. The administration was supposed to finalize the new rules by the end of March in order for the softer requirements to take effect by the 2021 model year, but some automakers and officials have questioned if it will meet that deadline. Most automakers oppose freezing the requirements but also want relief from standards approved during the Obama administration that called for a roughly 5 percent annual reduction in carbon emissions - targets that translate to fuel efficiency requirements for various classes of vehicles.

2019-02-20,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by two Pennsylvania boys and an environmental group seeking to stop U.S. President Donald Trump from rolling back regulations addressing climate change, saying the court does not have power to tell the White House what to do. Disagreeing with a judge overseeing a similar case in Oregon, U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond in Philadelphia ruled on Tuesday that the Constitution does not guarantee what the boys and the Clean Air Council called a due process right to a “life-sustaining climate system.” Diamond also said the boys, who were 7 and 11 when the lawsuit was filed in November 2017, could not trace their respective severe allergies and asthma to White House policies. He said this meant the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue Trump, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and other defendants who had moved to dismiss the case. “Plaintiffs’ disagreement with defendants is a policy debate best left to the political process,” wrote Diamond, an appointee of President George W. Bush. “Because I have neither the authority nor the inclination to assume control of the Executive Branch, I will grant defendants’ motion.” Joseph Minott, executive director of the Clean Air Council, said the plaintiffs will review their options as the White House’s “deliberate indifference” to climate change increases “the frequency and intensity of its life-threatening effects.” The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has long cast doubt on the science of climate change. He has announced his intention to withdraw the United States from a two-year-old global agreement to combat climate change, and a proposal to overhaul former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan with new rules that would ease pollution controls. In November, Trump rejected findings in a congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, which said climate change could reduce U.S. gross domestic product more than 10 percent by the end of this century. (here) The Eugene, Oregon case was brought by 21 children and young adults also challenging government policies affecting climate change. Diamond accused U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken, the appointee of President Bill Clinton overseeing that case, of contravening or ignoring “longstanding authority” by finding a due process right to “a climate system capable of sustaining human life.” The case is Clean Air Council et al v U.S. et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 17-04977.

2019-02-20,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Crude prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest level this year on hopes that oil markets will balance later this year, helped by output cuts from top producers as well as U.S. sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela. Market fears over trade talks between the United States and China had helped push oil prices lower in early trade, but the market reversed after signs of progress emerged on Wednesday and strengthened equity markets. [.N] U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1, when tariffs on $200 billion (153 billion pounds) worth of Chinese imports are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent. “We’re in a market waiting for the next headline to drive us higher or lower,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, adding U.S.-China trade talks are among the issues that market participants have focused on the most.  Brent futures rose 63 cents, or 0.95 percent, to settle at $67.08 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) for delivery in March settled at $56.92 a barrel, up 83 cents, or 1.48 percent, ahead of the contract’s expiry. The more active April contract settled at $57.16, up 71 cents, or 1.38 percent. “The market this week has pushed to three-month highs on expectations of tightened supplies,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “OPEC and Russia are enacting cuts and concerns about reduced Venezuelan exports have helped push markets up.”  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed to reduce oil supply by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 this year. A monitoring committee for OPEC and its allies found the group’s compliance with its agreement at 83 percent, four delegates told Reuters on Wednesday. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped the oil market would be balanced by April and that there would be no gap in supplies due to U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. “You could take that as a signal that Saudi Arabia will continue to take a proactive approach,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Some supply disruptions have further tightened supplies. Saudi state oil firm Aramco last week shut part of its Safaniyah offshore oil field after a power cable was inadvertently cut. Production at Libya’s contested El Sharara field has been halted since December. U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela have also helped to reduce the availability of crude on the global market.  However, price gains were capped as those supply disruptions were offset by expectations of inventory builds in the United States following a sharp reduction in refineries’ capacity utilization in the U.S. Midwest. U.S. crude stockpiles were expected to have risen by 3.1 million barrels last week, the fifth consecutive weekly build, an extended Reuters poll showed. Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the main U.S. oil storage hub, will grow largely because U.S. data shows refinery capacity utilization in the Midwest dropped to 84.2 percent from 92.9 percent the previous week, following a string of planned and unplanned outages, analysts said.  “That will leave a lot of barrels on the sidelines,” said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.  Weekly U.S inventory data is delayed by a day due to the Presidents Day holiday on Monday. The American Petroleum Institute will release its data at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT), while the U.S. Energy Information Administration report is due on Thursday at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). The EIA said on Tuesday shale production alone will hit a record 8.4 million bpd next month, suggesting little chance of a near-term slowdown in overall U.S. crude output. BNP Paribas said surging U.S. output would feed into lower oil prices toward the end of the year, with Brent to dip to an average of $67 by the fourth quarter and WTI to average $61. “U.S. oil production growth, driven by shale, will be increasingly exported in greater volumes to international markets while the global economy is expected to witness a synchronised slowdown in growth,” the bank said.

2019-02-20,"* Budget forecasts slower growth, wider deficits * Funds Eskom by reprioritising spending, borrowing more * Analysts say utility’s underlying problems remain * Ramaphosa struggles with divided party before May vote (Adds Moody’s, market reaction, Eskom chair, more Mboweni) By Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo, Wendell Roelf and Mfuneko Toyana CAPE TOWN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - South Africa will bail out state utility Eskom with 69 billion rand ($4.9 billion) over three years, the centrepiece of a budget that exposed the limited room President Cyril Ramaphosa has to fix the economy ahead of an election in May. Ramaphosa, who is fighting rifts within his own party before the parliamentary election, has made reforming Eskom one of his top priorities as its 420 billion rand debt pile poses a direct threat to Africa’s most developed economy. Analysts said the financial support would give the ailing power firm several years to implement a restructuring plan which will see it split into separate entities for generation, transmission and distribution. But it still leaves Eskom, which last week subjected South Africa to the worst series of power cuts in several years, facing an uncertain future with unsustainable debts, crippling costs and stagnant sales. “The money for Eskom is insufficient given the length of time over which the Eskom reorganisation will occur and the practical and political pitfalls that are ahead,” said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex. Those pitfalls include major job cuts, an option that was unlikely to be implemented before the election amid fierce opposition from leftist sections of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and powerful trade unions. The ANC is expected to win the election, but only a handsome victory would give Ramaphosa the mandate to push through painful reforms that are opposed by those within the governing party still loyal to his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma. In his maiden budget speech, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni told parliament the emergency funds for Eskom would be financed through reprioritised spending and increased borrowing, but he rejected Eskom’s request that the state take on 100 billion rand of its debt. “Pouring money directly into Eskom in its current form is like pouring water into a sieve,” Mboweni said. “I want to make it clear: the national government is not taking on Eskom’s debt.” He raised the possibility of selling off more than 100 parastatals, often cited as a risk to the public purse. “Isn’t it about time the country asks the question: do we still need these enterprises?” Mboweni asked. The rand and benchmark 2026 government bond initially fell as the budget forecast wider deficits, rising debt and slower economic growth, before later strengthening as it became clear the state would not carry Eskom’s debt. Eskom’s 2023 and 2025 dollar bonds also strengthened. But rising government debt levels in a low growth environment will remain a concern for ratings agencies. “South Africa’s budget highlights the government’s limited fiscal flexibility. The budget shows a further erosion in fiscal strength,” Moody’s, the last of the top three agencies to have South Africa at investment grade, said of the budget. Moody’s is due to announce a ratings decision at the end of March. Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza said Wednesday’s support would cover two-thirds of the company’s annual debt-servicing needs. “It is never going to be enough, but it is what can be found in the circumstances,” Mabuza told CNBC Africa. “We need to put more pressure on our operational costs.” He said the utility hoped the energy regulator would agree to the large tariff hikes Eskom had requested when it announces a decision around mid-March. The regulator has in the past tended to approve smaller increases that Eskom has asked for. Some business leaders wanted more detail on how Eskom’s debt mountain would be reduced over the longer term. Eskom received a 60 billion rand bailout in 2008 via a loan which was later converted into equity. The government later sold state assets to give it another 23 billion rand. “We were hoping that the government was going to look at debt and take some of the burden off the utility, but unfortunately that didn’t materialise,” said Tanya Cohen, chief executive of Business Unity South Africa. Eskom’s turned off the lights across swathes of the country last week due to plant-related problems, diesel shortages and planned maintenance. The outages exposed the risks to the economy from Eskom’s virtual monopoly and the failure of successive governments to take on labour unions and factions in the ANC who consider any form of privatisation as a red line. The finance ministry said on Wednesday that strategic equity partners would be invited to provide capital and strengthen oversight in a new Eskom transmission subsidiary.

2019-02-20,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s re-investment in Suncor Energy Inc highlights the benefits of being an integrated oil company and could revive investor interest in the languishing Canadian energy sector, fund managers said.  The move is also seen by some as a wager the energy sector could benefit from a change in the guard in Canada’s oil-rich Alberta province, which has an election this year. Berkshire’s new 0.7 percent stake in Suncor, valued at C$488 million ($370.54 million) at current prices, is already worth 23 percent more since Berkshire bought it in the last quarter. It comes more than two years after it sold for $618 million a 1.4 percent stake it had bought in 2013 and added to in 2015.  Its re-entry is seen by analysts as a validation that Canada’s biggest oil and gas company has catalysts - such as a new incoming CEO and the eventual removal of Alberta oil curtailments - that could propel the stock higher. Berkshire has not publicly discussed its reasons for its recent investment in Suncor, and did not comment when reached by Reuters.  While a bet on Suncor is not seen as a play on the entire industry, major Berkshire shareholder Warren Buffett’s stature as a value investor is expected to prompt other funds to wade back into the Canadian energy sector. “People always pay attention when Warren Buffett makes a play, and I don’t think it will be any different this time around,” said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.  “It’s a great signal that foreign capital is starting to flow back to Canada as this will ultimately be the main driver of stock prices.”  Investors and some foreign majors have shunned Canada’s oil patch in recent years due to high production costs, environmental concerns, and difficulties moving crude due to clogged pipelines. Berkshire has largely avoided big-cap energy stocks with the exception of an investment in Exxon Mobil Corp, which it owned for more than a year before selling the more than $3 billion stake in late 2014 as oil prices fell. Suncor, however, is positioned to weather more adverse market conditions than many producers because it owns refineries and has committed pipeline space, allowing it to access U.S. markets. “Berkshire is typically a countercyclical value investor, so we are not surprised the interest was renewed in a name like Suncor,” said Cavan Yie, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which manages about $364 billion in assets. Suncor is one of his largest positions. “Suncor is somewhat insulated from these risks given the fact that they have a strong downstream operation, which financially benefits from oil bottlenecks and that is unique to Suncor, which you can’t get with many other companies in the energy space.” Suncor shares are up 23 percent year-to-date giving it a $54.6 billion market value, compared with 11 percent for the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index. Buffett has found an “attractive entry point for an out-of-favor sector” and a “good high-quality company that is industry leading”, said Brian Pow, vice president of research and equity analyst at Acumen Capital Finance Partners. In another Canadian investment, Buffett bought into Home Capital in 2017 when the Canadian alternative mortgage lender was under pressure and made a big profit by largely exiting the position late last year. Some investors are betting that a change in government in Alberta after a spring election could benefit the oil industry. The governing New Democrats have taken big steps to help the industry, including leasing rail cars this week to move oil, but badly needed pipelines remain stalled due to opposition from environmentalists. “While a new governing party may not change the actual end outcomes of the pipeline discussion, it may provide some optimism that a new set of solutions will be pursued,” AGF’s Archibald said.

2019-02-20,"LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s prime minister has given the nod to a multi-billion dollar LNG supply deal with Swiss trader AOT Energy but the energy ministry will make a final decision on whether it goes ahead, an official at the premier’s office said on Wednesday. The deal with AOT to supply 1.25 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 15 years has long been in the works, with terms agreed last February. Last month, the gas company that oversees Bangladesh’s LNG supplies, Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co, said the deal would not go ahead. However, a document issued by the office of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Jan. 28, and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, showed the government has not scrapped the plan. “In reference to the letter of (the) global head of AOT Energy, the Energy Ministry has been asked to take necessary action for finalising a long-term deal for LNG with AOT Energy,” the document said, referring to communication the prime minister’s office had received from AOT about finalising a deal. Tarikul Islam, director of the prime minister’s office, confirmed the letter. However, he said this did not seal the deal. “Based on a letter from AOT Energy, we have sent a letter to the energy ministry to take necessary action. But this is the ministry’s call whether they want to go ahead with them or not,” Islam said. The energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment. AOT declined to comment. The terms of the deal are secret but broadly speaking, using current LNG prices, the deal would be worth $6.3 billion. This would be AOT’s first long-term LNG contract although it trades LNG on the spot market and has short-term contracts. Its pipeline gas and LNG volumes amounted to 6.5 billion cubic metres last year, roughly 4.7 million tonnes’ worth of LNG. Bangladesh is new to LNG and only began importing it last year. Industry players say it is still on a learning curve and that its strategy has been haphazard at times. One government official conceded the nation had taken on too many projects without proper planning. The country received its first cargo of LNG last April. Qatar supplies one terminal under a 2.5 million tonnes a year (mtpa) deal. A 1 mtpa deal with Oman will kick in once a second terminal starts operations in March. Bangladesh has imported around 1 million tonnes since September when regular supplies began, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. With indigenous gas production dwindling, the nation of 160 million people is set to be a significant player in the global LNG market, alongside Pakistan and India. However, it has tempered its initial enthusiasm. Officials at one point were considering a dozen import projects but have since pared the list down and shifted focus to building onshore rather than floating facilities.

2019-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity firm HitecVision is seeking to sell its British North Sea oil and gas production unit Verus Petroleum, which last year completed a string of large acquisitions ramping up its output, industry and banking sources said. The sale process is being run by investment bank Jefferies and could fetch $500 million (382 million pounds), according to the sources. HitecVision and Verus Petroleum did not respond to requests for comment. A Jefferies spokeswoman declined to comment.  Aberdeen-based Verus Petroleum outlined last November plans to move to “a new phase of growth” after its oil and gas production rose 12 fold to 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) following three key acquisitions.  Verus Petroleum last year bought Cieco, the North Sea subsidiary of Japanese commodity trading house Itochu for $400 million. It also bought Premier Oil’s interest in the Babbage gas field and Equinor’s stake in the Alba field.  The deals were funded by equity provided by HitecVision, cash and debt. Verus Petroleum’s production averaged 15,500 boed in 2018 at an average cost of $11 a barrel, according to its website. The North Sea has seen a slew of investments in recent years as long-standing oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP reduce their presence in the ageing basin while new, often private equity-backed firms see opportunities to squeeze profits from fields in the region through more nimble operations. Verus Petroleum’s sale process comes as a number of companies are also trying to sell assets in the basin including Chevron, France’s Total and ConocoPhillips.

2019-02-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is readying a presidential panel that would question U.S. military and intelligence reports showing human-driven climate change poses risks to national security, according to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The effort comes as President Donald Trump seeks to expand U.S. production of crude oil, natural gas, and coal, and unwind regulatory hurdles on doing so.  The panel, to be formed by an executive order by Trump, would be headed by William Happer, a retired Princeton University physics professor currently on the White House’s National Security Council. Happer disagrees with mainstream climate science and believes that emissions of the main greenhouse gas that scientists blame for climate change - carbon dioxide - benefits the planet by helping plants grow. The document calls into question U.S. government reports that say climate change poses risks to national security, including the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment from the office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Dan Coats.  “These scientific and national security judgements have not undergone a rigorous independent and adversarial scientific peer review to examine the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, as well as implications for national security,” the document said. The annual DNI report, issued in January, said droughts, floods, wildfires and rising seas made worse by climate change and environmental degradation pose global threats to infrastructure and security. In January, the Department of Defence said climate change was a national security issue and listed 79 domestic bases at risk from floods, drought, encroaching deserts, wildfires and in Alaska, thawing permafrost. U.S. officials have also said that climate change can burden the military by increasing the number of global humanitarian missions in which it participates.  The White House is holding a meeting on Feb. 22 in the situation room to discuss an upcoming executive order by Trump to set up the committee, made up of 12 or fewer people, said the document, dated Feb. 14. The document was first reported by the Washington Post. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change, arguing that the causes and impacts are not yet settled. As a temporary blast of frigid cold hit the Midwest last month he said on Twitter “What the Hell is going on with Global Wa(r)ming. Please come back fast, we need you!” Happer, who does not have a background in climate, has served on the NSC since 2018 as deputy assistant to the president for emerging technologies, and complained that carbon dioxide emissions have been maligned, a position strongly opposed by a vast majority of climate scientists.  Happer said on CNBC in 2014 that the “demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler.” The White House did not have a comment on the document.  Francesco Femia, the co-founder of the Center for Climate & Security, a non-profit research and policy group, called the panel a “sham committee” that could put a chill on further analysis of climate risks from some members of military and intelligence agencies.  “I am worried there will be a reticence among some in the future to include those risks in their public reports for fear of having to deal with this political committee in the White House, because ultimately the heads of departments and agencies serve at the pleasure of the president,” Femia said.

2019-02-20,"(Recasts with government closing border) Feb 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s government on Wednesday said it had closed the country’s maritime border with the Dutch Caribbean islands due to the opposition’s plan to bring in humanitarian aid this Saturday to alleviate an economic crisis it denies exists. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said Venezuela’s relations with the islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire were under revision and the border closure would be in place for an “undefined period of time.” “The fact that Curacao has decided to join this show, whose only aim is the takeover of Venezuela, means Venezuela has not only closed our border but also is revising our relations with these countries,” Rodriguez said in comments broadcast on state television. She said the government made the decision after Curacao’s government said the island would help store aid destined for Venezuela. A regional military command in the state of Falcon, the closest to the islands, had closed the border on Tuesday, but then reversed that decision earlier on Wednesday. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognized by dozens of countries as the legitimate head of state, has said that food and medicine provided in part by the United States would enter Venezuela by land and sea on Saturday. President Nicolas Maduro’s government has pledged to block offers of foreign aid, denying widespread shortages and insisting the country’s economic problems are the result of sanctions by Washington. The United States has sent tons of aid to Colombia’s border with Venezuela, an effort Maduro has mocked as a “cheap show.” Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of state institutions including the military. Also on Wednesday, Guaido said he spoke to the president of Switzerland to try to freeze bank accounts belonging to Venezuela after “irregular movements” were discovered.

2019-02-20,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil refiner HollyFrontier Corp’s quarterly profit beat was overshadowed by weak performance in its lubricants and specialty products business, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent on Wednesday. The company has been building up its lubricants and specialty products business through acquisitions to provide a more steady revenue stream. As part of the strategy, HollyFrontier bought specialty hydrocarbons maker Sonneborn and locomotive engine oil supplier Red Giant Oil Co last year. Sales in the unit, which sells higher-margin products such as greases, waxes and white oils, fell about 7 percent in the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31.  Rack Back, or the value between feedstock cost and base oil market prices, at the unit was negatively impacted by “very weak base oil markets and the turnaround at the Mississauga plant,” Chief Executive Officer George Damiris said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Like other refiners, HollyFrontier also highlighted the steep drop in the difference between Canadian crude and U.S. benchmark prices following the output curbs imposed by the provincial government in Alberta to ease a supply glut. “We saw differentials go from $47 down to $9,” said Thomas Creery, a vice president at HollyFrontier, during the call. When Alberta implemented the quarter system, it tended to “over correct” the problem, he said. The steep gap, fueled by pipeline bottlenecks that hampered moving out surging Canadian oil production, has helped U.S. refiners report fattened refining margins.  In the fourth quarter, HollyFrontier’s refinery gross margins, or the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products, surged 77 percent to $22.17 per barrel.     Excluding items, the company posted a profit of $2.25 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.92, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net profit attributable to the company’s shareholders fell to $141.9 million, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter, from $521.1 million, or $2.92 per share, a year earlier. Sales and other revenue rose 8.8 percent to $4.34 billion. Shares of the company were down almost 2 percent at $56.6 Wednesday morning.

2019-02-20,"ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc will expand barge-loading capacity at its ethanol terminal in Chicago to help relieve a supply glut there that is driving down global prices for the biofuel, three people briefed on the company’s plans told Reuters. Tens of thousands of barrels of ethanol change hands at the Kinder Morgan Argo terminal daily, and prices there are used as the benchmark for deals across the country, and are also baked into international contracts. Trade at the terminal has come under scrutiny, however, after one of the world’s largest commodities merchants, Archer Daniels Midland Co, switched from its typical role as a buyer in late 2017 to a big seller, flooding the hub with ethanol and helping drive the price to near-record lows. ADM declined to comment on its commercial activity but said in a statement its “ethanol trading practices are proper and compliant with all laws and regulations.” Because the Argo hub has a limited capacity to ship barrels out, many of ADM’s rivals are now struggling to find ways to get their product to coastal markets where prices may be higher. Several ethanol plants have idled or shut altogether. The situation has added pain to a critical Midwest agricultural industry that is already struggling with a loss of export markets due to the U.S. trade war with China, and mixed signals from the Trump administration on its support of the nation’s biofuel laws. Kinder Morgan told traders at an industry conference in Orlando, Florida last week that it plans to help by at least doubling the number of ethanol barges that can load and unload at its two existing Argo docks, possibly by the end of the year, three sources briefed on the meetings told Reuters.  It will also build a new 50,000-barrel storage tank at its Stony Island facility near Argo, which loads and unloads ethanol trains, the sources said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long said the company declined to comment for the story. The increased capacity should help reduce the chances of a big supply glut at the 1.3-million-barrel storage hub. “If you can send barrels in faster than you can take out, then you can drive down the price faster and for a longer period. This will help equalize that and level the playing field,” said one ethanol trader.  Currently, Argo can unload roughly 120 to 150 tank cars of ethanol each week, or roughly 4 million gallons, and can load two barges, or roughly 1.2 million gallons, at a time.  Train flows into the terminal run fairly smoothly as tank cars can wait outside of Chicago before unloading, but bottlenecks at the slower-moving docks have significantly delayed efforts to move ethanol out, traders said. In the past, Kinder Morgan has proposed expanding capacity but wanted producers and trading houses to help fund it through long-term contracts.  Not this time, traders said. “I think they know people are upset and they want to make sure they retain their customer base,” said another trader. ADM’s heavy selling into Argo has also prompted its rivals to seek other changes to how the Chicago market works. Huge U.S. ethanol producer POET LLC, for example, has asked the CME Group Inc to change the way it prices a key swap contract that is settled based on the cash market at Argo. POET argued that the connection to Argo made the swap contracts prone to manipulation. The rival ICE exchange is also contemplating offering an alternative to CME’s product after discussions with frustrated biofuels companies, Reuters previously reported. Also Argus Media met with a number of traders earlier this month in Houston to gauge interest in establishing a new cash benchmark that would rival the existing one set by S&P Global Platts, sources tell Reuters. ADM can produce roughly 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol annually, about 10 percent of U.S. capacity. Despite its massive production, it has often been a buyer on the cash market to supplement its long-term supply deals or to support a market view, dealers said. The Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse accounted for roughly 70 percent of the ethanol sold at the Chicago hub late last year, according to the data reviewed by Reuters. Previously, ADM had been a regular buyer: In September and October of 2017, for example, ADM bought 810,000 barrels, 32 percent of the 2.495 million total trades in the Chicago hub during that stretch, according to the data.

Sterling shot up in mid-morning New York trading to turn positive on the day versus the U.S. dollar after Bloomberg News reported the Spanish foreign minister said a Brexit accord was being “hammered out.” Stocks started with a rally in Asia that pushed the MSCI world equity index to its highest since October after U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1. Many had feared U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports would rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal was reached by then. European stock indexes also strengthened, with a regional index at a four-month high. Wall Street stocks were little changed, with the S&P 500 hovering near its 2019 high. Traders awaited the release on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, at which policymakers effectively signaled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to balance sheet normalization. “Investors expect more details regarding the shrinking of the Fed’s balance sheet and obviously more clues on the Fed pause,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, wrote in a client note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.35 points, or 0.07 percent, to 25,910.67, the S&P 500 gained 2.95 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,782.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.07 points, or 0.24 percent, to 7,504.83. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.70 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.49 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.48 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.29 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.60 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1 percent to close at the highest level since August. While hopes for a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies are seen as the primary driver for world stocks, dovish central bank messages from the United States to Asia and the ECB are also playing a part. On currency markets, the dollar dipped against a basket of major currencies after the Brexit-linked rise in sterling also pulled the euro higher. The dollar index fell 0.16 percent, with the euro up 0.19 percent to $1.1361 while Sterling was last trading at $1.3073, up 0.08 percent on the day. The Japanese yen weakened 0.06 percent at 110.71 per dollar, after Japan recorded its biggest annual drop in exports in January for more than two years, and on recent dovish Bank of Japan signals. The offshore yuan rose 0.5 percent against the dollar to a three-week high of 6.7131. U.S. oil prices rose above $57 per barrel for the first time in three months supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown kept the market wobbly. U.S. crude rose 1.63 percent to $57.37 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.14, up 1.04 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.65 percent, from 2.645 percent late on Tuesday. The 30-year bond last fell 11/32 in price to yield 3.0055 percent, from 2.988 percent late on Tuesday. Additionmal reporting by Kate Duguid and Richard Leong in New

2019-02-20,"(Adds quotes, details) ABUJA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Nigeria is willing to reduce oil output to help secure higher prices, the spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement on Wednesday, after an envoy from Saudi Arabia called on the African nation to adhere to a deal on production cuts. Nigeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is party to a pact to curb output to support prices, although OPEC data showed its output rose in January. Saudi Arabia is OPEC’s biggest producer. The president told the visiting Saudi envoy, Ahmed Qattan, that “Nigeria was willing to go along with the Saudi initiative in limiting output so that prices would go up,” the presidential spokesman said in a statement after a meeting in Abuja. “I will speak with the minister of state petroleum. I will call for the latest production figures. I know that it is in our interest to listen. We will cooperate,” Buhari told the envoy, according to the statement.

2019-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - A surprise delay in Nigeria’s presidential ballot has served foreign asset managers another reminder of political risk and volatile investment returns in Africa’s biggest economy - just days after piling into assets in a bet on a smooth election run.  The electoral commission announced a week’s delay to voting in the early hours of Saturday, citing logistical problems, even  as some of Nigeria’s 84 million registered voters were already making their way to polling stations. The vote pitches President Muhammadu Buhari against former vice president Atiku Abubakar, in what is seen as a tight race.   The delay adds to uncertainty for investors, who have endured a wild ride in the West African country: The 2014 oil price crash, and election in 2015 followed by currency controls and dollar shortages that tipped the oil-exporting economy into recession in the same year, its first in more than two decades. Its bonds got ejected from key indexes. A new exchange rate mechanism launched in 2017 drew back some investors but concern has built around the election that  has proved hard to call, threatens to spark violence and promises little material change.  “The likelihood of violence is now higher than before,” said Thierry Larose at Vontobel Asset Management. “And we have seen some effect on markets.” Below are five charts that show foreign investor exposure and positioning in Nigeria.  Lured by a rekindled appetite for emerging markets and an upbeat oil price outlook, foreign investors have recently raised exposure to Nigeria, according to flow tracker EPFR.  Nigeria’s debt in particular has seen a sharper acceleration of inflows since the start of the year than emerging market debt more widely. (Graphic: EPFR: Nigeria  and EM Flows - tmsnrt.rs/2BGB0Yo) Nigeria’s debt may have got kicked out of key indexes, but its stocks escaped a similar fate. They comprised a chunky 6.4 percent in 2017 in MSCI’s frontier market index of smaller and often riskier stocks. Year-to-date, MSCI’s Nigeria index has risen just over 2 percent, with an 8 percent jump in February making up for losses earlier in the year. Broader frontier and emerging equities have performed better, however.  Moreover, trading volumes have decreased steadily overall, and the percentage of foreigners trading has also shrunk to 48 percent from a peak of 65 percent in September 2017, according to stock exchange data. (Graphic: Nigeria stock market - tmsnrt.rs/2GOrplz) “This is a deeply unloved market whether measured by overall market volumes, foreign participation, valuation relative to history, or performance versus frontier or oil-exporter peers,” said Hasnain Malik at Exotix Capital. “That level of despair usually means opportunity.”      With the International Monetary Fund estimating Nigeria’s debt-to-GDP ratio at just under 27 percent in its 2018 outlook, the country compares favorably to the Sub-Saharan average of 50 percent.  Nigeria’s dollar-denominated debt has long been a favorite off-benchmark play. The issues have outperformed both wider emerging market sovereign debt and African peers, returning some 10 percent year-to-date. “Eurobond valuations still look attractive as yields are likely to remain anchored regardless of outcome and the election means we are unlikely to get issuance until 3Q,” said Diana Amoa, emerging market debt portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management. (Graphic: Nigeria Eurobonds Outperform - tmsnrt.rs/2TVAyMP) Investors are split on local debt markets. On T-bill markets, the arbitrage between high yields and stable hedging costs through currency forwards delivers solid returns for anything up to a year. The picture is less clear further out.  “We continue to like the t-bill trade as it’s an attractive carry play on oil,” said Kevin Daly, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. Data from Lagos-based FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange showed monthly trading volumes of local currency bills and FX has broadly risen in recent months. January volumes stood at just over 15 trillion naira ($49 billion) compared to 11.9 trillion naira just over a year earlier. According to traders, offshore funds account for more than half of all the trades.  (Graphic: Rising trade - tmsnrt.rs/2V84bLi) Others say the local t-bill trade has become too crowded. And plans by presidential contender Abubakar to possibly float the naira currency makes it a risky play.  “It is like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller -you pick up a lot of pennies, but the losses are huge if the steamroller gets you,” said Lutz Roehmeyer at Capitulum Asset Management.

2019-02-20,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors have launched a probe into Daimler for allegedly failing to prevent diesel emissions cheating, possibly resulting in a fine for the carmaker, as its legal woes mount up over the affair. German carmakers, among the global leaders in diesel technology, have been caught in the crosshairs of courts and regulators around the globe after Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to using engine control devices to cheat U.S. diesel emission tests. Germany’s transport ministry said last June that 774,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe had been found to contain unauthorized defeat devices resulting in higher emissions. It ordered Daimler to recall more than 200,000 cars in Germany. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) are also investigating emissions of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. Prosecutors in Stuttgart, where Daimler is headquartered, launched an investigation into individual employees of the company some two years ago, which is still ongoing. “We have now also initiated proceedings against Daimler as a company,” a prosecution spokesman said, adding the company may have neglected its supervisory duties. Last June, the Stuttgart prosecutors said they were considering probes against Daimler, VW’s Porsche unit and automotive supplier Bosch over potential emissions cheating. Earlier this month, they launched proceedings against auto supplier Robert Bosch for providing Volkswagen with engine management software that the carmaker used to cheat vehicle emissions tests in 2015. It was unclear what level of fine Daimler could face. A spokeswoman for the company said Daimler was cooperating fully. Volkswagen in June was fined one billion euros ($1.13 billion) for diesel emissions cheating, one of the highest ever fines imposed by German authorities.

2019-02-20,"OSLO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Finland’s electricity consumption reached an all-time monthly high in January, industry lobby group Finnish Energy (ET) said on Wednesday, citing increased industrial needs due to the economy’s upturn and a colder than usual winter. Reliability of power supply is crucial to Finnish industry, which includes large power consumers such as pulp and paper makers UPM and Stora Enso. Finnish Energy said last year the country’s growing energy demands could outstrip supply and firms risked having to cut their power usage in case of a technical failure due to the system’s tight balance. Finland consumed a record 9,335 gigawatt hours during the month and had to import a quarter of that, approaching an import record set in 2016. January in Finland was colder than previous years and in large cities the average temperature was about four degrees colder than the same month in 2018. “Electricity consumption was boosted by the use of electricity from industry driven by a good economic cycle. Τhe chemical industry and metal processing increased their electricity consumption by about three percent,” ET said in a statement. Housing, agriculture, services and construction also increased their consumption, it added. Finland was counting on putting online a major nuclear plant, Olkiluoto 3, but delays to the project mean it will still rely on importing power mainly from Sweden and Russia. Finland is now home to a growing, power-hungry data centre industry, and hopes to convince more Silicon Valley giants to build facilities in the country. In January ET reported that Finland used 2 percent more electricity in 2018 year-on-year, reaching a total of 87 terawatt hours, with industry consumption growing by the same percentage, needing 47 percent of Finland’s electricity. The previous monthly consumption record was on January 2016 and it was broken on last month’s final day.

2019-02-20,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil exporter, is in talks on  possible investments in Indian projects involving companies including Reliance Industries, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, its chief executive said on Wednesday. Major oil producers like Aramco are targeting Asia, where fuel demand is growing, as a stable outlet for their oil, and are splashing out on improvements in refining capacity there. Saudi Aramco and UAE national oil company ADNOC last year  teamed up with state run Indian refiners in a plan to build a 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) refinery and petrochemical project in Maharashtra state.  “We are looking at additional investment in India so we are in discussions with other companies as well, including Reliance,” Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told reporters at an industry event in New Delhi. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said he wants Saudi Aramco and SABIC, the Kingdom’s petrochemical company, to be household names in India. Falih and Nasser are traveling with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is in India for a one-day visit. Falih said the Maharashtra refinery was not the end of Aramco’s planned Indian investments. “Saudi Aramco is also looking for other opportunities in India because one investment no matter how large is not big enough. “It is the drive of (the) Royal Highness that India is number one on our priority for investment outside Saudi Arabia,” Falih added. Reliance Industries, controlled by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, is India’s biggest refining and petrochemicals company and runs a 1.4 million bpd refining complex at Jamnagar in western India. It plans to expand capacity to 2 million bpd by 2030, according to plans shared with the Indian government. Falih in December attended the wedding of Ambani’s daughter and since then Ambani has travelled to the Kingdom at least twice, discussing joint investment among other issues, according to tweets by Falih and Aramco. Saudi Arabia is keen to expand further into refining and petrochemicals.  “India is an investment priority for Saudi Aramco. India takes from us almost 800,000 barrels a day and by 2040 India’s total consumption will be around 8.2 million barrels per day,” Nasser said.  India is the world’s third-biggest crude oil consumer with a demand of 4.7 million bpd, according to government figures. However, Aramco is facing delays in the refinery planned for Maharashtra, as thousands of farmers have refused to surrender land for it. Reuters reported on Tuesday the Maharashtra government is looking to move the refinery’s location.

2019-02-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. investigators have identified perpetrators of pervasive rape and killings and torture in secret safe houses in South Sudan, and believe oil revenues have driven much of the violence in its civil war, a report said on Wednesday. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan recommended further investigation of evidence that proceeds from South Sudan’s oil-based economy had been channeled to government forces and militias linked to reported war crimes. The Commission said the army, national security, military intelligence, rebel forces and affiliated armed groups had committed serious human rights breaches, and it had drawn up a confidential list of suspects including army and opposition commanders, two state governors and a county commissioner.  Its 212-page report detailed people being held for years and tortured in secret, vermin-ridden detention centers, children being run down by tanks, rape of girls as young as seven, and babies being drowned, starved or smashed against trees. In some stricken areas, 65 percent of females and 36 percent of males may have been sexually abused, according to the report.      Although South Sudan’s main warring parties signed a peace deal in September, widespread violence, especially rape, has continued. A member of the three-person commission, Andrew Clapham, said it was outraged by reports of further fighting between government forces and the rebel National Salvation Front, which was not part of the peace agreement, in the Yei River area. “There are thousands of civilians who have been forcibly displaced following a scorched-earth policy in which the parties to the conflict are attacking the villages, torching the homes, killing civilians and raping women and girls,” Clapham said. The United States, Britain and Norway jointly expressed their alarm at the reports of escalating violence in Yei. “These military actions, and the trading of blame, must stop,” they said in a joint statement. Clapham said that more than 5,000 refugees had reached neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and up to 20,000 people were expected to be displaced by the latest fighting. The report cited a close connection between oil and the conflict. A law ensuring that South Sudan’s oil-producing regions and communities received two and three percent of its oil revenue respectively had triggered a redrawing of provincial boundaries and ethnic conflict.  “We feel the national security services are very much involved in the siphoning off of oil money,” said Clapham. The Human Rights Council should get to the bottom of the sums involved and where the money was going, he told reporters, noting that health and education spending was “minuscule”. “If you are involved in oil extraction in that area and you are asked to assist one side or the other, you could be accused of complicity in war crimes. There are Council members that we think have a responsibility to look more carefully at this.” South Sudan is one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. This year the United Nations needs $1.5 billion for live-saving aid for its population and $2.7 billion for its refugees.

2019-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has resumed its traditional role as the swing producer, sharply reducing its own output to tighten the oil market and push prices higher. The de facto OPEC leader has demonstrated, once again, that it can always tighten the physical market, boost prices and push the calendar spread into backwardation - if it is prepared to cut its own production enough. The familiar problem is that protecting prices comes at the expense of market share: the more the kingdom cuts its own production and tightens the market, the more it encourages increased output from other sources. In this case, rising prices threaten to extend the oil drilling and production boom in the United States, which would ultimately force Saudi Arabia to make even deeper cuts or abandon its price-defence strategy. Saudi Arabia has never been able to escape from this dilemma and the country’s oil policy has cycled between a priority on price defence and volume defence. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TYmwu1) The kingdom has always struggled to craft an exit strategy from periods of output restraint. Policymakers pursue production curbs for too long, tighten the market too much and drive prices to an unsustainable level. The result is usually a slowdown in consumption growth and an acceleration of non-Saudi sources of production that pushes the market back towards surplus and necessitates a new round of output cuts. The kingdom made the same mistake in 2008, 2014 and 2018, failing to raise production early enough, creating the conditions for unsustainable price inflation and sowing the seeds of the subsequent downturns. Like any oil exporter Saudi Arabia will always benefit from an increase in prices in the short term, but it can then prove difficult to put a lid on the market. Saudi Arabia’s informal price targets tend to ratchet up as realised prices rise, with its targets tending to be somewhat elastic. In the first nine months of 2018 Saudi Arabia allowed the market to tighten too much, pushing prices above $80. That proved unsustainable and triggered a slowdown in consumption growth and a surge in U.S. shale. The kingdom’s market management was not helped by a mercurial White House, which threatened to push Iran’s oil exports to zero and then granted generous sanctions waivers. The question is whether the Saudis will make the same mistake again in 2019. Experience suggests it will. Senior Saudi officials have often sought to downplay the swing-producer tag since the mid-1980s, when the kingdom cut production even as other countries raised theirs. They have been keen to emphasise the importance of spreading cuts across Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and more recently an enlarged group including Russia and Oman (OPEC+). But the historical record shows that cuts by Saudi Arabia have been decisive in influencing spot prices and calendar spreads, and that Saudi Arabia, rather than OPEC or OPEC+, is the true swing producer. By cutting its own production, Saudi Arabia has always been able to engineer a rise in Brent spot prices and push the calendar spread into backwardation, as the attached charts illustrate. The kingdom’s influence is enhanced when the global oil economy and oil consumption are growing strongly and when the output of rival producers is disrupted by war, sanctions or civil unrest. Saudi Arabia has preferred to assemble coalitions of other producers to maximise its price leverage and for diplomatic reasons (OPEC and OPEC+ provide a useful shield against international criticism). But Saudi output policy has been the primary driver of market prices and spreads as the kingdom has been the only exporter with the scale and flexibility to shift the global production-consumption balance. The recent round of production cuts, agreed by OPEC+ at the start of December, has conformed to this pattern (“The 5th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting concludes”, OPEC, Dec. 7). The enlarged group agreed to cut by a total of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first six months of 2019, with reductions to be shared between OPEC (0.8 million bpd) and its Russia-led allies (0.4 million bpd). In the event, Saudi Arabia cut its own output by 380,000 million bpd in January, exceeding its pledged share of 320,000 bpd and accounting for more than half of the total cuts achieved by OPEC in the first month. Saudi Arabia’s aggressive reductions have compensated for poor compliance with the agreement by some other OPEC and OPEC+ members (“OPEC oil output falls by 890,000 bpd in January”, Reuters, Jan. 31). The kingdom has gone further and pledged to reduce its output by more than 1 million bpd from 11 million-plus in November to only 9.8 million in March, Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said in a recent interview with the Financial Times. The kingdom’s shift has helped to boost front-month Brent futures prices by more than $15 a barrel (30 percent) since late December and push the six-month calendar spread from a $1.70 contango to 45 cent backwardation. The price impact has been assisted by increased optimism that the global economy will avert recession as well as the impact of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil production and position-building by hedge funds. Provided that the global economy avoids recession or a prolonged slowdown this year, the oil market will tighten progressively over the course of 2019. Given their approach last year, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ are likely to prolong their output restraint until prices are well above $70, perhaps breaching $80. The result will be another spurt of U.S. shale production and a slowdown in oil consumption growth, pushing the market back towards surplus and necessitating another round of cuts. If Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ want to halt this cycle of instability, they need to be pro-active and start relaxing output curbs gradually as prices climb above $70. But OPEC has never been great at fine-tuning and the track record suggests prices are likely to overshoot on the upside to set the cycle in motion all over again.

2019-02-20,"* 2018 net profit rises 7.5 pct * 2018-2022 targets included 32 bln-euro spending * Networks, renewables investment favourites (Adds timeframe, CFO quotes, dividend) By Isla Binnie and Andrés González MADRID, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Leading global wind power producer Iberdrola pledged to speed up its growth plans by one year on Wednesday after reporting a 27.7 percent annual rise in core profit in 2018. Helped by growth in Latin America and a recovery in its hydropower business in Spain, the company raked in 3 billion euros in net profit, a 7.5 percent rise from 2017. Chief Executive Ignacio Galan said he now expected to reach 2022 targets, which included achieving a net profit of 3.5 -3.7 billion euros, one year ahead of schedule. The supplier of energy to more than 30 million people in Spain, the United States, Brazil and Britain invested 5.3 billion euros last year, of which almost 78 percent was poured into its networks and renewables businesses. That formed part of a 32 billion-euro investment programme as part of the four-year strategy to 2022, which Galan pledged on Wednesday to accelerate, before a scheduled update next week. Core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), surged 27.7 percent to 9.35 billion euros in 2018. Adding regulated network assets, 5,871 megawatts of generation capacity and increasing efficiency will lead to “mid-single digit growth at the EBITDA and net profit level in 2019”, the company said. “We are still betting on investing in networks and renewables,” Chief Financial Officer Jose Sainz Armada told Reuters. “We have been investing in all these areas, in all these countries, and this is what we are starting to see in 2019 ... we have grown in all businesses and in all countries,” he added. The company raised its dividend by 7.7 percent to a gross 0.351 euros per share and said it would ask shareholders to approve a complementary dividend of 0.20 euros. Iberdrola shares led market gainers at the open in Madrid, rising more than 1 percent. Galan said last year he expected core earnings to rise more than 20 percent to over 9 billion euros, and net profit to climb to around 3 billion euros. Iberdrola’s Brazilian unit Neoenergia, which was fully absorbed into the business in mid-2017, contributed 570 million euros to core profit in the course of the year. Neoenergia was granted contracts to build and operate four new transmission network projects stretching 3,000 kilometres in northern Brazil in December, adding to the 2,500 kilometres of power lines and 28 sub-stations it already manages. In Spain, rivers and reservoirs filled up again after a prolonged drought in 2017, leading to a 72 percent rebound in hydropower generation. An increase in capacity commissioned in Mexico and a return to normal in retail conditions and operating expenses in the United Kingdom also provided a boost, the company said. Both core and net profit came in slightly ahead of a Refinitiv Eikon analyst poll.

2019-02-20,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Socialist government announced a 47 billion euro (£40.66 billion) public investment plan on Wednesday to tackle climate change over 10 years, which would be partly financed by issuing green bonds. The proposal, which sets a goal to make Spain carbon neutral by 2050, is a statement of intent as the government faces a general election on April 28. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the plan would also be partly financed by EU funds but did not give details. The draft package includes a plan to offset job losses in polluting industries. “We aren’t proposing anything fanciful,” Sanchez told a news conference at the energy and environment ministry, which he merged when he took power in June. “It’s necessary and moreover it’s possible,” he added. As well as a draft law, the package includes a delayed national plan to combat climate change, which is due to be approved at a cabinet meeting on Feb. 22 and sent to the European Union for its sign-off. While there is probably time for the plan to be sent to Brussels, April’s snap election makes it unlikely the draft bill will be approved under the current government.     The government will set out a calendar of capacity auctions to work toward a target of producing 74 percent of Spain’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050, it said in a statement. European Union climate chief Miguel Arias Canete has called on Europe to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Overall, Spain’s plan will generate investment worth 200 billion euros, the government said, and should cut its reliance on imported energy to 59 percent from 74 percent over the decade. This would help the state save 75.4 billion euros in fossil fuel costs over the next 10 years, it said. Sanchez’s Socialists are leading in opinion polls ahead of the election but the polls forecast the party will fall well short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament.

2019-02-20,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian fuel suppliers have cut the price of petrol to encourage people to travel to vote in presidential elections this Saturday after the poll was delayed by a week, the information minister said on Wednesday. The electoral commission announced the delay early last Saturday just Nigeria’s 84 million registered voters were preparing to head to the polls. The election is now scheduled to take place this Saturday.   Both of the main parties have expressed concern that this would result in a reduced voter turnout, in part because people who were registered to vote in a different part of the country to where they live would be unable to afford to travel after a wasted trip last Saturday.   Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) had cut the price of petrol at the pumps to 140 naira per litre from 145 naira. The discount will apply from Friday to Monday. Mohammed also told reporters the National Union of Road Transport Workers, which has about 2 million members who operate bus routes nationwide, had agreed to provide discounts to travellers “looking to travel to their respective voting points”.  Two airlines had also offered discounts to people who showed their voting cards.  President Muhammadu Buhari faces a tight contest against businessman and former vice president Atiku Abubakar, the main opposition candidate, to lead a country that has Africa’s largest economy and is its top oil producer but is plagued by corruption and a wide gap between rich and poor. The election has been fought over Buhari’s handling of the economy amid fragile growth and growing unemployment as Nigeria  recovers from a recession in 2016.

2019-02-20,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Wednesday he expected investment opportunities worth more than $100 billion (£76.71 billion) in India over the next two years as he began his first official visit amid tensions between arch foes India and Pakistan. India rolled out the red carpet for the crown prince as it seeks diplomatic support against Pakistan following a militant attack in the disputed region of Kashmir. The crown prince, whose country is facing frosty ties with Western countries after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was also given a lavish welcome this week in Pakistan where the two sides signed memoranda of understanding valued at about $20 billion to help prop up Pakistan’s economy. In a joint press appearance after talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the crown prince said terrorism was a common concern and Saudi Arabia was ready to share intelligence with India to tackle it. The two countries will start a security dialogue at the level of national security advisors and set up a working group on counter-terrorism, said T.S. Tirumurti, who handles economic relations at India’s foreign ministry. “Both leaders called on all countries to renounce the use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy,” Tirumurti told a press briefing. India blames Pakistan for not doing enough to counter militant groups that operate from its soil including the one that claimed responsibility for the Kashmir car bombing last Thursday. Pakistan denies any involvement in cross-border terrorism and has said it would retaliate against an Indian attack.  “We face similar challenges, chief among them extremism and terrorism … and we reaffirm to India that we are ready to work in the intelligence and political arenas to coordinate our efforts…” the crown prince said. Saudi Arabia’s domestic security structure helped put down an al Qaeda bombing campaign over a decade ago. But the kingdom continues to face occasional attacks by Sunni Islamic State fighters and Shi’ite militants in its Eastern Province. Riyadh leads a coalition of Arab states fighting in support of Yemen’s internationally recognised government against the Iran-aligned Houthi fighters, who regularly fire rockets across the kingdom’s southern border. NON-OIL TRADE On trade relations, the crown prince said “we expect the opportunities we are targeting in India in various fields to exceed $100 billion in the coming two years”. Sectors of interest included energy, infrastructure, agriculture and manufacturing, Tirumurti said, adding that Saudi Arabia’s focus was on expanding non-oil trade with India. Giant petroleum and natural gas company Saudi Aramco said it was in talks with India’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS) for possible investments and was seeking other opportunities. [L3N20F2KE]  Both India and Pakistan had expected a scaling up of investments on the crown prince’s first tour of the region since the storm over the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.  The killing has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West and battered the prince’s image abroad. He is also visiting China on this trip. The European Commission has added Saudi Arabia to an EU draft list of countries that pose a threat to the bloc because of lax controls against terrorism financing and money laundering, sources told Reuters last month.[nL8N1ZP528] Modi has sought to use India’s fast-growing economy to attract more investment from Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations since he took office.

2019-02-20,"(Repeats item with no changes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell NEW DELHI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - India’s demand for electricity is expected to double in the next two decades, and coal has been long forecast to be the fuel of choice for power generation. But this may no longer be the case. It’s not that India doesn’t have plentiful reserves of coal. It does, and it is the world’s second-largest producer and importer, following China. It’s not even that India’s reserves are expensive to mine. They aren’t. It’s not even that transporting coal from where it’s mined to where it’s needed is too difficult. Yes, it is an issue, but this challenge could be overcome with sufficient investment in rail and other infrastructure. No, the main reason coal may battle to fuel India’s future energy needs is that it’s simply becoming too expensive relative to renewable energy alternatives such as wind and solar. In recent months, power supply auctions have shown that renewables can be offered at less than 3 rupees (4 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour, a tariff that coal-fired generators have difficulty matching. There is also zero chance that new coal generators can produce electricity at rates competitive to renewables, given higher capital and operating costs. Rajit Desai, the head of engineering, procurement and construction at major private generator Tata Power, told a forum at this week’s Coaltrans India conference that his company wasn’t looking at developing any new coal plants. Tata Power is instead focusing on buying coal-fired power plants that are effectively distressed assets. Many of these plants started construction in the past seven years, when power demand and price forecasts for electricity were bullish. Some of the plants under construction or newly completed, though, have been unable to secure power purchase agreements with high enough prices for them to operate profitably. This means a company such as Tata Power can buy these brownfield plants at a discount steep enough to make them viable at the electricity prices currently being offered. The coal sector’s struggles are starting to show in data compiled by the Global Coal Plant Tracker. As of January, India had 36.12 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity under construction and 220 GW operating, according to the data. The data also shows, however, a total of 491 GW of planned capacity additions were cancelled in the past eight years, a fairly dramatic scale-back of India’s coal-fired aspirations. The government’s National Electricity Plan assumes that 94 GW of new coal-fired capacity will be added between the 2017/18 and the 2026/27 fiscal years. But with only 22 GW currently permitted, the pipeline of new plants would appear to be considerably lower than what the government is forecasting. A further issue for India’s coal sector is that banks are becoming reluctant to lend to new ventures, and insurers are also becoming less keen to offer cover. This is largely because the risk that new coal plants are unviable is rising, with 40.1 GW of Indian coal plants currently assessed as “stranded assets,” according to research published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Thus, it’s becoming increasingly likely that private companies in India will not build any new coal-fired power plants, leaving only companies like state-controlled major generator NTPC as potential builders. NTPC’s website discloses that the company currently plans to add 18.67 GW of new capacity by 2032 by itself or in joint ventures, with the majority being coal-fired. This is some way short of the government’s plans. It’s also possible the retirement of older coal-fired units over the forecast period may be close to, or even exceed, new capacity additions. If coal is becoming unattractive in India, the question then is whether renewables can really meet the expected increase in demand for electricity. While it will certainly be possible to install sufficient renewable capacity, the challenge will be integrating this intermittent power source onto the grid, and also installing sufficient storage in the form of batteries or pumped hydro to ensure stability. Coal won’t disappear in India, with the existing fleet likely to generate power for at least two more decades. But coal’s share of generation is likely to slip, and power companies will have to do more to prepare for the increasingly likelihood that renewable energies are going to provide most of the new capacity in coming years.

2019-02-20,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility RWE has given assurances it will not touch a forest it had hoped to clear for lignite mining until late 2020, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state said on Wednesday, amid a debate about Germany’s planned exit from coal. “This means that there will not be any felling of trees until the autumn of 2020,” said Armin Laschet in the state parliament in Duesseldorf. A government-appointed commission said last month Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest.   The Hambach forest has become a symbol of the anti-coal protest.  Laschet said preserving Hambach long-term would be subject to negotiations between RWE and the government over how to handle the national coal withdrawal plan. He added protesters squatting in the forest to signal their opposition to the mining of lignite, also called brown coal, and the burning of it in nearby power plants should go home. A spokesman for RWE confirmed the company had agreed to the moratorium but added the decision “implies significant operational limitations.”  RWE chief executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said last month that preserving the forest could cost tens of millions of euros, given the space needed for mining waste. Mining has come to a standstill in the area since a court order in October. RWE is Germany’s largest operator of coal-fired power plants and employs about 10,000 staff in the Rheinische coal mining area, which also includes power plants.

2019-02-20,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) CAPE TOWN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - South Africa will give power utility Eskom a total of 69 billion rand ($4.88 billion) but will not take on 100 billion rand of debt as requested by the struggling firm, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Wednesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa wants to reform Eskom, which generates 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity but is drowning in 420 billion rand of debt, to lift the economy before an election expected in May. The rand extended losses in response to a budget statement that also forecast wider deficits, rising debt and slower economic growth. Government bond yields gained. In an effort to make Eskom more efficient, Ramaphosa said earlier this month the utility would be split into three separate entities - generation, transmission and distribution. In its 2019 budget, the Treasury said the first step in splitting Eskom would be to transfer a portion of the utility’s assets to a new transmission subsidiary that will invite the participation of strategic equity partners to provide capital and strengthen oversight. Further financial support to Eskom would depend on economic growth, electricity tariffs and the implementation of the company’s strategy, the Treasury said in its 2019 budget statement. Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza last year urged the government to take on 100 billion rand of the utility’s debt, but Mboweni ruled this out. “Pouring money directly into Eskom in its current form is like pouring water into a sieve,” Mboweni said in his budget speech. “I want to make it clear: the national government is not taking on Eskom’s debt.” Eskom subjected South Africa to the worst power cuts in several years last week due to plant-related problems, diesel shortages and planned maintenance. The outages exposed the risks to the South African economy from Eskom’s virtual monopoly and the failure of successive government to take on labour unions and leftists in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) who oppose job cuts. “We have had very very difficult conversations with the ratings agencies ... if we are doing practical things to fix Eskom the electricity sector, in my view, that should be viewed as positive,” Mboweni told journalists ahead of his speech.

U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1. Up to now, it was assumed U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports would rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal was reached by then. Asian shares soared on Trump’s comment, and European stock indices also strengthened, with a pan-European index gaining 0.3 percent, pushing the MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, to a four-month high. U.S. stock futures suggested that Wall Street would hold on to Tuesday’s strong gains, and open about flat. “I’d say the market is very much pricing in a deal at this stage, and there’s some merit to this as I don’t think you engage in such a solid period of talks over a number of weeks unless you feel you are getting somewhere,” said Craig Erlam, chief market analyst at OANDA, an FX brokerage. “The talk of an extension suggests Trump is positive about the direction of travel.” He added, however, that the market remains vulnerable to any further setbacks. While hopes for a trade deal between the world’s two largest economies are seen as the primary driver for world stocks, dovish central bank messages are also playing a part. New York Fed President John Williams on Tuesday said he was comfortable with the level U.S. interest rates were at and that he saw no need to raise them again unless economic growth or inflation shifted to an unexpectedly higher gear. Investors are also looking to the release on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, at which policymakers effectively signalled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to its balance sheet normalisation. In Europe, expectations have been growing that the European Central Bank will restart a programme to provide long-term cheap loans to banks to boost a faltering economy, while the Bank of Japan has flagged its readiness to ease further. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1.1 percent to mark its highest levels since Oct. 2. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained as much as 1.3 percent to six-month highs, while Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s index recovered to levels last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent to two-month highs. On currency markets, the dollar steadied against a basket of major currencies, after suffering its biggest one-day loss of the month on Tuesday. It had also recorded big slides against the euro and sterling. The greenback strengthened 0.2 percent against the yen after Japan recorded its biggest annual drop in exports in January for more than two years, and on recent dovish Bank of Japan signals. Markets were also focused on newsflow on the Brexit front, with sterling holding most of its gains following a 1 percent surge on Tuesday as British Prime Minister Theresa May headed to Brussels to try push negotiations forward. The yuan rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar , its biggest intra-day gain in more than a month, after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States was seeking to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue the currency as part of a trade deal. Oil prices came off 2019 highs, hit by U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. International Brent crude futures dropped 0.65 percent at $66.02 per barrel, having hit a three-month high of $66.83 per barrel earlier this week, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela.

2019-02-20,"ORLANDO, Fla., Feb 20 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc will expand loading capacity at its ethanol terminal in Chicago to address producer concerns that trade at the terminal - a benchmark for global ethanol prices - is vulnerable to manipulation, three people briefed on the company’s plans told Reuters. Tens of thousands of barrels change hand at the hub every day, but many more barrels across the country depend on the price. Ethanol trade in the cash market at the Kinder Morgan Argo hub is used in contracts for the biofuel across the country, and is also baked into international contracts. Trade at the terminal has come under scrutiny after one of the world’s largest commodities merchants, Archer Daniels Midland Co, switched from its typical role as a buyer in late 2017 to a big seller, flooding the pricing hub with ethanol and helping drive the price to near record lows. Farmers are struggling with a loss of export markets due to the U.S. trade war with China and mixed signals from the Trump administration on its support of the nation’s biofuel laws. Plants have idled or shut altogether in recent months as U.S. ethanol prices have dropped below $1.20 a gallon, the lowest in about 13 years. Kinder Morgan told traders at an industry conference in Orlando, Florida last week that it plans to at least double the amount of ethanol barges that can load and unload at its two existing Argo docks and it is exploring allowing a third petrochemical dock to also move ethanol, three sources briefed on the meetings told Reuters. Kinder will also build a new 50,000 barrel-per-day storage tank at its Stony Island facility near Argo, the sources said. The Stony Island location loads and unloads ethanol trains. The additions could be ready before the end of the year, traders said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long said the company declined to comment for the story. The increased takeaway capacity will make it more difficult to drive up inventories at the 1.3 million barrel storage hub and drive down price, traders said. “If you can send barrels in faster than you can take out, then you can drive down the price faster and for a longer period. This will help equalize that and level the playing field,” said one ethanol trader. Currently, Argo can unload roughly 120 to 150 tank cars of ethanol each week, or roughly 4 million gallons, and can load two barges, or roughly 1.2 million gallons, at a time. Train flows into the terminal fairly smoothly as tank cars can wait outside of Chicago before unloading, but bottlenecks at the slower-moving docks have significantly delayed trade at times, traders said. In the past, Kinder Morgan has proposed expanding capacity but wanted producers and trading houses to help fund it through long-term contracts. Not this time, traders said. “I think they know people are upset and they want to make sure they retain their customer base,” said another trader. ADM’s heavy selling prompted top U.S. ethanol producer POET LLC to ask the CME Group Inc to change the way it prices a key swap contract that is settled based on the cash market at Argo. Poet argued that the connection to Argo made the swap contracts prone to manipulation as well as the cash market. ADM declined to comment on its commercial activity but said in a statement its “ethanol trading practices are proper and compliant with all laws and regulations.” The rival ICE exchange is contemplating offering an alternative to CME’s product after discussions with frustrated biofuels companies, Reuters previously reported. Argus Media met with a number of traders earlier this month in Houston to gauge interest in establishing a new cash benchmark that would rival the existing one set by S&P Global Platts, sources tell Reuters. ADM can produce roughly 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol annually, about 10 percent of U.S. capacity. Despite its massive production, it has often been a buyer on the cash market to supplement its long-term supply deals or to support a market view, dealers said. The Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse, a major ethanol producer, accounted for roughly 61 percent of the 9.5 million barrels sold at the Chicago hub between November and August of last year, according to the data reviewed by Reuters. Late last year, the number went above 70 percent of the sales, Reuters reported. Previously, ADM had been a regular buyer: In September and October of 2017, for example, ADM bought 810,000 barrels, 32 percent of the 2.495 million total trades in the Chicago hub during that stretch, according to the data.

2019-02-20,"PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM pledged new efficiency gains to offset higher fuel costs this year, as the Franco-Dutch airline group deepens cooperation between its two main carriers. Presenting 2018 earnings for the group he joined in September, Chief Executive Ben Smith promised better-coordinated networks and fleets, after overcoming KLM resistance to closer integration with Air France in a new boardroom deal. “These first achievements pave the way for our ambition to regain a leading position in Europe and worldwide,” Smith said. After opening lower, Air France-KLM shares rose 4.1 percent to 10.80 euros at 1125 GMT. Underlining Smith’s challenge, fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 20 pct to 776 million euros ($880 million) as the fuel bill mounted, despite a 4.1 percent revenue gain to 6.54 billion. Unit revenue fell 0.6 pct in the last three months of 2018 and will decline further in the current quarter, the group said. Air France-KLM has trailed rivals Lufthansa and British Airways on profitability, held back by restrictive French union deals and strikes that last year wiped 335 million euros off earnings and forced out its previous CEO. But Smith, an Air Canada veteran, has restored labor peace by granting wage hikes in return for increased flexibility with which he now hopes to make better and more profitable use of the group’s aircraft and networks. On the eve of the results presentation, Air France-KLM struck a new pay deal with its French pilots and resolved a standoff with KLM and the Dutch division’s popular leader Pieter Elbers, over Smith’s integration plans. Wariness on the Dutch side is partly explained by the relative underperformance of Air France, whose 2018 operating margin was 1.7 percent, or 4 percent excluding the impact of strikes - compared with 9.8 percent for KLM. Almost 15 years after the Air France-KLM merger, decisions on networks, fleets and commercial strategy will now be taken by the group rather than the individual carriers, under the plans unveiled on Tuesday - which also see Elbers and Air France counterpart Anne Rigail become deputy group CEOs. The financials were broadly in line with expectations of 786 million euros of EBITDA on 6.52 billion in revenue, based on the median of seven analyst estimates in a poll by Infront Data. “While a new CEO with an impressive track record has been appointed and short-term pay deals agreed with the French unions, we await details of his new strategy,” Liberum analysts said in a note. The fuel bill rose by 451 million euros in 2018 and will climb another 650 million this year as hedges expire, Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey told reporters on a call. Overall unit costs, up 0.6 percent last year before currency and fuel-price impacts, were “well under control”, Gagey said, adding that while a later Easter holiday will likely lead to lower unit revenue in the first quarter, summer bookings are already “better positioned”. The group said 2019 costs are expected to come in somewhere between flat and a 1 percent decline, on the same basis. Passenger traffic rose 3.4 pct to 24.46 million in the last quarter, the group said, while crossing the 100 million threshold for the full year. The low-cost Transavia arm was a bright spot, posting a 9 percent 2018 operating margin for its French operations as it expand services by 9-11 percent in 2019, with a more modest 2-3 percent growth at group level - to include eight new Air France destinations from mid-year. The new labor deals should provide a financial lift in 2019, the CFO said, avoiding the strikes and disruption that led to a spike in Air France’s customer compensation bill last year. The rollout of new digital sales platforms will also generate savings, along with improvements to long-haul network planning and the gradual replacement of less fuel-efficient four-engined Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 planes. The newly-announced management changes may boost efforts to increase synergies in areas such as purchasing - which lacked a single group-wide chief procurement officer until last year. Smith’s centralization push builds on years of painstaking integration that had already assigned some 18,000 staff to group-wide services and managers, said Gagey, who joined Air France in 1997. “It’s not as if we just realized we should begin to look for synergies,” he said.

Novatek, controlled by CEO Leonid Mikhelson and businessman Gennady Timchenko, a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, launched Yamal LNG in the Arctic in December 2017 as part of Russia’s plan to raise its share on global energy markets. Moscow-traded shares in Novatek, Russia’s biggest gas producer which is not owned by the state, rose 1.3 percent. Other stakeholders in the project with annual capacity of 16.5 million tonnes per year are Novatek’s shareholder and French energy major Total, as well as China’s CNPC and the Silk Road Fund. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange differences, as well as the one-time effect from the disposal of interests in joint ventures, profit jumped 49 percent to 232.9 billion roubles. Higher oil and gas prices helped lift earnings, the company said. Last-year revenues rose by 42.6 percent to 831.8 billion roubles, while natural gas production increased 8.5 percent to 68.8 billion cubic metres, oil and gas condensate output edged up by 0.3 percent to 11.8 million tonnes. $1 = 65.6900 roubles

2019-02-20,"(Adds upcoming bond issuance, analyst comment) CAIRO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Egypt has issued $4 billion in dollar denominated bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years in a sale that was five times oversubscribed, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday. The issue included $750 million in five-year bonds with a return of 6.2 percent, $1.75 billion in 10-year bonds with a return of 7.6 percent and 1.5 billion in 30-year bonds, with a return of 8.7 percent, the ministry said. The issue attracted $21.5 billion in bids, the ministry said. The money raised will be used to finance the state budget, said Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kouchouk. Most bids were for longer maturity 10- and 30-year bonds, Kouchouk told Reuters, adding that he considered the yield on the bonds “very good” for Egypt, in line or lower than prevailing yields. Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said Egypt will return to the international bond market before the end of the fiscal year in June to issue bonds in a currency other than the dollar. Egypt struggled through years of political and economic turmoil after its 2011 uprising. It has borrowed heavily from abroad since it began an economic reform programme backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in late 2016. Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage, estimated that as much as $13 billion in Egypt’s principal commitments for the 2019 calendar year are likely to be rolled over. The newly sold $4 billion in dollar-denominated bonds along with another $2-3 billion in non-dollar foreign currencies planned over the coming few months should be enough to cover the rest, he said. “This year, total external debt dues amount to about $17 billion, is what we hear,” Sandeep said. “For the rest, the issuance would provide a good cushion, making sure the reserve base remains stable, at the least.” Reporting by Ehab Farouk and Patrick Werr;

2019-02-20,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco’s trading arm plans to open an office in London soon as it expands its international business, sources familiar with the move said. Aramco Trading Co (ATC) also opened an office in the bunkering hub of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates in December to trade oil products and hired two traders from Trafigura and PetroChina to run operations there, the sources said.  “Last June, a trading office was inaugurated in Singapore, and last December (another) in Fujairah and very soon in London, just like any trading house,” one of the sources said. Another source said: “They have moved a few trading desks to Singapore and Fujairah. London is surely next.” A third source said the London office might be inaugurated as early as next week during International Petroleum (IP) Week, an industry event held annually in the British capital. Saudi Aramco, the parent company, already has an office in Marylebone, London. The ATC London operations may be located in the same place as the parent company and are likely to start with a handful of crude oil traders, one of the sources said. ATC did not immediately respond to a request to comment. The trading sector faces increased rivalry between national oil companies (NOCs), international oil firms and Swiss merchants. NOCs have cheap feedstock and strength in refining, allowing them to compete aggressively with oil majors and especially traders that lack their own production. ATC aims to boost its trading volumes in crude and refined products to 6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020 and the company’s headquarters will remain in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, ATC’s chief executive told Reuters last year.  The CEO, Ibrahim al-Buainain, also said the plan to open an ATC regional office in Europe - either London or Geneva - was set for the first quarter of 2019. Middle East oil producers are venturing into buying and selling oil to boost their incomes as a sharp drop in crude prices since mid-2014 has forced the industry to become more efficient and commercially focused. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co is establishing a new trading operation along with Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV. ATC was set up in 2012 initially to market refined products, base oils and bulk petrochemicals, but has since expanded into crude trading mainly to feed international Aramco joint ventures such as the U.S. Motiva refinery and S-Oil in South Korea. Aramco, the world’s top oil producer and exporter, aims to become the largest integrated energy firm, with plans to expand refining operations and petrochemical output. It pumps around 10 million bpd of crude, of which it exports about 7 million bpd. The company plans to raise its refining capacity - inside Saudi Arabia and abroad - to 8-10 million bpd, from around 5.4 million bpd now. Aramco is expanding its refining business at home as well as in new markets particularly in Asia.

2019-02-20,"(Repeats story issued on Tuesday, no change to text) * Big-ticket projects boost image of Macky Sall as he seeks re-election * Critics concerned by President’s authoritarian stance * Weakened opposition not expected to put up a fight By Sofia Christensen DAKAR, Feb 20 (Reuters) - President Macky Sall is the strong favourite to win Senegal’s election on Sunday, boosted by a modernising first term that propelled economic growth although critics accuse him of jailing his rivals for political gain. Sall, 57, is facing only four contenders in the first round of voting - the smallest presidential field since 1988 - after two of Senegal’s best-known opposition figures were ruled out because of corruption convictions. Rights groups say this represents a crackdown on dissent in a country long seen as West Africa’s most stable democracy, which has seen peaceful transitions of power via the ballot box since independence from France in 1960. But many voters and foreign backers applaud Sall for boosting economic growth to over six percent, one of the highest rates in Africa last year. The growth was driven in part by a series of infrastructure projects including a new airport, 221 km (137 miles) of multi-lane motorways, a wrestling stadium and an express train that will connect the capital to a new city that has begun to rise from the semi-desert outside Dakar. Billboards of Sall in a suit dot Dakar’s main coastal road and tout his achievements as the “Builder of Modern Senegal”. “We are happy,” said fisherman Diabel Mbeguere, pulling his brightly-painted wooden boat onto Dakar’s Yoff beach after a day at sea. “There are highways here now, many things the president has done.” “Electricity used to be a big problem,” he added. Long power cuts that used to blight urban Senegal are rarer under Sall. Thousands of villages have gained access to electricity for the first time too, although more than half remain without power, according to the International Monetary Fund. Opinion polls are banned in the run-up to elections, but a widely cited survey conducted by a Senegalese data company in November gave Sall 45 percent support. None of the other candidates had more than 16 percent. His main challengers are former prime minister and third-time runner Idrissa Seck, 59, and 44-year old political rookie Ousmane Sonko, who is popular among Senegalese youth. It is not yet clear how voting will be affected by the exclusion from the race of presidential hopefuls Khalifa Sall, a popular ex-mayor of Dakar who is no relation to Macky, and Karim Wade, the son of former President Abdoulaye Wade. Under Senegalese law, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade are barred from running as they were jailed for graft and corruption in 2018 and 2015 respectively. The opposition says this was a strategy to boost the president’s chances of winning, a charge the ruling party denies. Sall and Wade denied the charges. Khalifa Sall has urged his supporters to vote for Seck, with whom he forged an alliance from behind bars earlier this month. Meanwhile Karim Wade’s father Abdoulaye says the vote is rigged and told supporters during a political meeting this month to take out the electoral roll and “douse it with petrol”. His comments have been criticised by other opposition candidates and civil society groups and election day is not expected to be disrupted by widespread protests. Even so, frustration with the incumbent is palpable among the educated youth, who struggle to find jobs in an economy based on exports of fish, phosphates and cement, and where more than half the population works in agriculture. “Macky Sall promised to create 500,000 jobs for young people, but this never happened,” said 29-year old Romuald Preira, who recently completed a law degree at Dakar’s Cheikh Anta Diop university. “I can’t even find a small job or an internship, and I’m not the only one.” In response to a social media campaign, a televised debate between candidates is scheduled to take place on Thursday. The event is a first for Senegal, but Sall has refused to take part. More than 6.5 million people are registered to vote, with polls opening on Sunday at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and closing at six (1800 GMT). If no candidate secures a majority in the first round, the top two will face each other in a second round on March 24.

2019-02-20,"CAPE TOWN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A rescue package for Eskom, South Africa’s most important state firm, is expected to dominate Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s budget speech on Wednesday, with the struggling power utility at risk of collapse without a large bailout. Eskom supplies 90 percent of South Africa’s electricity but is drowning in 420 billion rand ($30 billion) of debt after a decade of financial decline marred by corruption scandals and mismanagement. It carried out some of the worst power cuts in several years last week and is cited by ratings agencies as the biggest risk to the economy as it no longer generates enough profit to meet its over 25 billion rand a year of finance costs. President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged to split Eskom into three entities this month and said financial support measures would be contained in Mboweni’s speech. In December, Eskom’s chairman asked the government to take 100 billion rand of the company’s debt onto its balance sheet, but Ramaphosa said other options needed to be considered. “Eskom will obviously dominate the budget, and we remain of the view that the government is unlikely to agree to the 100 billion rand bailout that Eskom is hoping for,” said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at the Eurasia Group consultancy. Mboweni’s room for manoeuvre is limited by a large fiscal deficit which means there is little spare cash in the budget. He is also at pains to preserve South Africa’s last investment grade credit rating from Moody’s, which is expected to review the rating next month. Mboweni’s options include the state agreeing to pay some or all of Eskom’s debt-servicing costs, or cash injections spread over a period of several years. The money could come from tax hikes, unspent money from previous budgets which the finance ministry has on deposit or government bond issuance. Analysts have cautiously welcomed Ramaphosa’s plan to split Eskom as a sign the government is finally addressing the firm’s monopolistic structure, but they want to see evidence that officials will take tough decisions like trimming its bloated workforce.

2019-02-20,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya set the stage for the country’s first green bond with new rules on Wednesday, part of efforts to diversify its capital markets. Like other African nations, Kenya needs to raise billions of dollars to invest in infrastructure projects including roads, water and irrigation, railways and power generation. “The legal framework is now in place and the rules are now out there,” Geoffrey Odundo, Chief Executive Officer of the Nairobi Securities Exchange, said.  So-called green bonds are fixed income securities that raise capital to help finance projects in renewable energy, energy-efficiency, green transport and wastewater treatment. “We are introducing a verifier component, because there is need for verification of green assets and green financing ... it’s what makes it possible for issuance of green bonds,” Odundo said, adding that the target was to issue one in 2019 to provide  “traction” for other issuers.  “The government of Kenya have come up strongly, that they are looking at doing a green bond and its one of the ones we are keenly talking to,” he said. In January, HSBC said global green bond issuance is seen at $140-$180 billion this year, from $149.2 billion in 2019. Nuru Mugambi, director of public affairs at the Kenya Bankers Association, said that there are two strong potential issuers from the banking sector with one at an advanced stage.  But commercial lending rates capped in September 2016 at 4 percentage points above the central bank’s benchmark rate, may make it difficult for banks to price the products. “The rate cap is making it difficult for banks to come into the capital markets to raise capital, therefore it’s limiting the bonds, but more so it’s limiting the potential that we see within the green bonds space,” she said.  Last week, Kenya Electricity Generating Company said that it plans to raise funds from the market later this year and it may opt to issue the country’s first green bond.  In 2018, finance ministry officials said that there was room to raise funding through green bonds for infrastructure projects, with an initial aim of about $50 million.

2019-02-20,"* MSCI’s World Index hits highest since October * European stocks strengthen after Asia soars * FOMC minutes due as central bank doves dominate * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - World stocks hit a four-month high on Wednesday on hopes of progress in trade talks between the United States and China, with a dovish backdrop at major central banks also helping push markets back into the black. U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China were going well and suggested he was open to extending the deadline to complete them beyond March 1. Up to now, it was assumed U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports would rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal was reached by then. Asian shares soared on Trump’s comment, and European stock indices also strengthened, pushing the MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, to a four-month high. Deutsche Bank’s chief strategist Jim Reid said the newsflow was encouraging, despite signs that more progress was needed. “The overall feeling is that it is one step forward, three-quarters of a step back at the moment. So positive momentum but still fragile,” he said in a note. While hopes for a trade deal between the world’s two largest economy are seen as the primary driver for world stocks, dovish central bank messages are also playing a part. New York Fed President John Williams on Tuesday said he was comfortable with the level U.S. interest rates were at and that he saw no need to raise them again unless economic growth or inflation shifted to an unexpectedly higher gear. Investors are also looking to the release on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, at which policymakers effectively signalled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to its balance sheet normalisation. In Europe, expectations have been growing that the European Central Bank will restart a programme to provide long-term cheap loans to banks to boost a faltering economy, while the Bank of Japan has flagged its readiness to ease further. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1.1 percent to mark its highest levels since Oct. 2. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained as much as 1.3 percent to six-month highs, while Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s index recovered to levels last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent to two-month highs. On currency markets, the dollar steadied against a basket of major currencies, after suffering its biggest one-day loss of the month on Tuesday. It had also recorded big slides against the euro and sterling. The greenback strengthened 0.2 percent against the yen after Japan recorded its biggest annual drop in exports in January for more than two years, and on recent dovish Bank of Japan signals. Markets were also focused on newsflow on the Brexit front, with sterling holding most of its gains following a 1 percent surge on Tuesday as British Prime Minister Theresa May headed to Brussels to try push negotiations forward. The yuan rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar , its biggest intra-day gain in more than a month, after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States was seeking to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue the currency as part of a trade deal. Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but further gains were capped by soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. International Brent crude futures stood at $66.30 per barrel, having hit a three-month high of $66.83 per barrel earlier this week.

2019-02-20,"NEW DELHI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on Wednesday terrorism was a common concern with India and that his country was ready to share intelligence to tackle it. Speaking at a joint press conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, the crown prince said Saudi Arabia was ready for political cooperation with India. “On the issue of extremism and terrorism, which is a common concern, we want to tell India that we will cooperate in every way, including intelligence sharing,” the crown prince said. The crown prince’s visit comes days after a militant attack in the disputed region of Kashmir which involved a bombing of a security convoy in which 40 Indian paramilitary police were killed. The attack was claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group. During the press briefing, Modi said he had agreed with Saudi Arabia to strengthen cooperation on counter-terrorism, naval and cyber security. Earlier in the day, the crown prince received a ceremonial welcome at New Delhi’s imposing red sandstone presidential palace.

2019-02-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s capital city Beijing has pledged to improve air quality this year but did not commit to a specific target, suggesting the country’s air-pollution campaign is stalling as the easily attainable measures have already been taken.  “Beijing will keep improving air quality, with average annual concentrations of small particles (PM2.5) and three-year rolling average PM2.5 level continuing to be lowered,” said Beijing Municipal Government in a statement on Wednesday. Average concentrations of PM2.5, or particulate matter that measures 2.5 microns, in 2018 fell 12.1 percent from 2017 to 51 micrograms per cubic meter, as a result of its stringent push to trim coal consumption and to clear out polluting plants.  However, Beijing’s 2018 PM2.5 levels were still much higher than China’s average of 39 micrograms per cubic meter and national target of 35 micrograms per cubic meter. PM2.5 is a closely monitored air pollutant because its small size allows the particles to lodge deep in the lungs. The World Health Organization recommends an air quality standard for PM2.5 of no more than 10 micrograms per cubic meter. The Beijing government said it will target emissions from vehicles, the biggest PM2.5 source in the city, construction sites and manufacturing plants in 2019. However, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) warned in a news briefing last month that “emission cuts in Beijing itself will be not enough to support a large scale of PM2.5 cuts”. The ministry reckons Beijing will also need to reduce external impacts from other regions, in particular from the coal-mining hub of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. “In a word, Beijing’s target this year is to maintain current (anti-smog) achievements...Public should be prepared to see a rising PM2.5 reading if there is adverse weather condition,” Liu Bingjiang, the head of the atmospheric environment department at the MEE, said at the briefing. Average PM2.5 level in Beijing was 52 micrograms per cubic meter in January, up 52.9 percent from a year ago, according to the MEE data. The city also aims to improve its water quality and tackle soil pollution in 2019 by improving the efficiency of fertilizer usage in rural area and tightening heavy-metal disposal standards, according to the government statement.

2019-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - A surprise delay in Nigeria’s presidential ballot has served foreign asset managers another reminder of political risk and volatile investment returns in Africa’s biggest economy - just days after piling into assets in a bet on a smooth election run. The electoral commission announced a week’s delay to voting in the early hours of Saturday, citing logistical problems, even as some of Nigeria’s 84 million registered voters were already making their way to polling stations. The vote pitches President Muhammadu Buhari against former vice president Atiku Abubakar, in what is seen as a tight race. The delay adds to uncertainty for investors, who have endured a wild ride in the West African country: The 2014 oil price crash, and election in 2015 followed by currency controls and dollar shortages that tipped the oil-exporting economy into recession in the same year, its first in more than two decades. Its bonds got ejected from key indexes. A new exchange rate mechanism launched in 2017 drew back some investors but concern has built around the election that has proved hard to call, threatens to spark violence and promises little material change. “The likelihood of violence is now higher than before,” said Thierry Larose at Vontobel Asset Management. “And we have seen some effect on markets.” Below are four charts that show foreign investor exposure and positioning in Nigeria. Lured by a rekindled appetite for emerging markets and an upbeat oil price outlook, foreign investors have recently raised exposure to Nigeria, according to flow tracker EPFR.  Nigeria’s debt in particular has seen a sharper acceleration of inflows since the start of the year than emerging market debt more widely. Nigeria’s debt may have got kicked out of key indexes, but its stocks escaped a similar fate. They comprised a chunky 6.4 percent in 2017 in MSCI’s frontier market index of smaller and often riskier stocks. Year-to-date, MSCI’s Nigeria index has risen just over 2 percent, with an 8 percent jump in February making up for losses earlier in the year. Broader frontier and emerging equities have performed better, however. Moreover, trading volumes have decreased steadily overall, and the percentage of foreigners trading has also shrunk to 48 percent from a peak of 65 percent in September 2017, according to stock exchange data.   ”This is a deeply unloved market whether measured by overall market volumes, foreign participation, valuation relative to history, or performance versus frontier or oil-exporter peers,” said Hasnain Malik at Exotix Capital. “That level of despair usually means opportunity.” With the International Monetary Fund estimating Nigeria’s debt-to-GDP ratio at just under 27 percent in its 2018 outlook, the country compares favourably to the Sub-Saharan average of 50 percent. Nigeria’s dollar-denominated debt has long been a favourite off-benchmark play. The issues have outperformed both wider emerging market sovereign debt and African peers, returning some 10 percent year-to-date. “Eurobond valuations still look attractive as yields are likely to remain anchored regardless of outcome and the election means we are unlikely to get issuance until 3Q,” said Diana Amoa, emerging market debt portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management.  Investors are split on local debt markets. On T-bill markets, the arbitrage between high yields and stable hedging costs through currency forwards delivers solid returns for anything up to a year. The picture is less clear further out. “We continue to like the t-bill trade as it’s an attractive carry play on oil,” said Kevin Daly, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. Others say the trade has become too crowded. And plans by presidential contender Abubakar to possibly float the naira currency makes it a risky play. “It is like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller -you pick up a lot of pennies, but the losses are huge if the steamroller gets you,” said Lutz Roehmeyer at Capitulum Asset Management.   Interactive: tmsnrt.rs/2GOrplz Reporting by Karin Strohecker in London; Additional reporting by Tom Arnold in London; Editing by Frances Kerry",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nigeria-election-investors/analysis-graphics-pennies-before-a-steamroller-nigerian-vote-delay-a-reminder-of-investment-risk-idUKL5N20A5II,20 Feb 2019,"A surprise delay in Nigeria's

2019-02-20,"TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Commonwealth LNG has received commitments from European buyers to take almost half of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its planned 8.4-million-tonnes-per-year export terminal in Louisiana, Chief Executive Officer Paul Varello said on Wednesday. The Commonwealth project is one of more than 10 LNG export terminals under development or construction in the United States along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico to take advantage of soaring demand for the supercooled fuel amid booming gas production. “We are exchanging documents with counterparties that will represent three to four million tonnes” of capacity, Varello told Reuters in an interview, adding he expects to sign so-called heads of agreements (HoA) shortly. “We have to work hard to get closer to the full 8 million tonnes in heads of agreements to allow us to feel good about getting 6 million tonnes in final agreements,” he said, because prospective buyers are overcommitting to projects. “Our bankers say that if we can decent pricing with 6 million tonnes that will give us enough debt coverage to make it work,” Varello said. The prospective buyers are European end-users with their own importing terminals, he said. Varello said the company will process natural gas into LNG at the terminal at “well below” $2.50 per million British thermal units for buyers signing 20-year supply contracts. The company expects to make a final investment decision by the third or fourth quarter of next year after getting final environmental approvals and aims to begin shipping LNG in 2024. Varello, who is in Tokyo pitching LNG to importers in the country while attending an industry conference, said Japanese buyers were reluctant to sign off-take agreements. The resistance to signing long-term contracts is coming because electric utilities are getting nuclear reactors back online after prolonged shutdowns following the 2011 Fukushima disaster and the rising use of renewables, Varello said. The Commonwealth project is one of many that could be approved this year and next, as worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year by 2030. U.S. gas production has soared to new records, bolstered by shale production, increasing the need for export capacity to absorb the supply. Energy companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per year of LNG capacity this year, a record. Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp said earlier this month they will proceed with a $10 billion project that will expand a LNG export plant in Texas.

2019-02-20,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s demand for electricity is expected to double in the next two decades, and coal has been long forecast to be the fuel of choice for power generation. But this may no longer be the case. It’s not that India doesn’t have plentiful reserves of coal. It does, and it is the world’s second-largest producer and importer, following China. It’s not even that India’s reserves are expensive to mine. They aren’t. It’s not even that transporting coal from where it’s mined to where it’s needed is too difficult. Yes, it is an issue, but this challenge could be overcome with sufficient investment in rail and other infrastructure. No, the main reason coal may battle to fuel India’s future energy needs is that it’s simply becoming too expensive relative to renewable energy alternatives such as wind and solar. In recent months, power supply auctions have shown that renewables can be offered at less than 3 rupees (4 U.S. cents) per kilowatt hour, a tariff that coal-fired generators have difficulty matching. There is also zero chance that new coal generators can produce electricity at rates competitive to renewables, given higher capital and operating costs. Rajit Desai, the head of engineering, procurement and construction at major private generator Tata Power, told a forum at this week’s Coaltrans India conference that his company wasn’t looking at developing any new coal plants. Tata Power is instead focusing on buying coal-fired power plants that are effectively distressed assets. Many of these plants started construction in the past seven years, when power demand and price forecasts for electricity were bullish. Some of the plants under construction or newly completed, though, have been unable to secure power purchase agreements with high enough prices for them to operate profitably. This means a company such as Tata Power can buy these brownfield plants at a discount steep enough to make them viable at the electricity prices currently being offered. The coal sector’s struggles are starting to show in data compiled by the Global Coal Plant Tracker. As of January, India had 36.12 gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity under construction and 220 GW operating, according to the data. The data also shows, however, a total of 491 GW of planned capacity additions were cancelled in the past eight years, a fairly dramatic scale-back of India’s coal-fired aspirations. The government’s National Electricity Plan assumes that 94 GW of new coal-fired capacity will be added between the 2017/18 and the 2026/27 fiscal years. But with only 22 GW currently permitted, the pipeline of new plants would appear to be considerably lower than what the government is forecasting. A further issue for India’s coal sector is that banks are becoming reluctant to lend to new ventures, and insurers are also becoming less keen to offer cover. This is largely because the risk that new coal plants are unviable is rising, with 40.1 GW of Indian coal plants currently assessed as “stranded assets,” according to research published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Thus, it’s becoming increasingly likely that private companies in India will not build any new coal-fired power plants, leaving only companies like state-controlled major generator NTPC as potential builders. NTPC’s website discloses that the company currently plans to add 18.67 GW of new capacity by 2032 by itself or in joint ventures, with the majority being coal-fired. This is some way short of the government’s plans. It’s also possible the retirement of older coal-fired units over the forecast period may be close to, or even exceed, new capacity additions. If coal is becoming unattractive in India, the question then is whether renewables can really meet the expected increase in demand for electricity. While it will certainly be possible to install sufficient renewable capacity, the challenge will be integrating this intermittent power source onto the grid, and also installing sufficient storage in the form of batteries or pumped hydro to ensure stability. Coal won’t disappear in India, with the existing fleet likely to generate power for at least two more decades. But coal’s share of generation is likely to slip, and power companies will have to do more to prepare for the increasingly likelihood that renewable energies are going to provide most of the new capacity in coming years. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-india/column-coal-going-from-winner-to-loser-in-indias-energy-future-russell-idUKL3N20F2CW,20 Feb 2019,"India's demand for electricity

2019-02-20,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Ex-Japan Asia MSCI hits highest since early Oct * Investors expect U.S., China to reach trade deal next month * Spreadbetters see flat opening in Europe * Minutes of Fed’s Jan 29-30 policy meeting in focus By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced to 4-1/2-month highs on Wednesday as investors bet that Chinese and U.S. trade negotiators would be able to secure a deal to de-escalate their year-long tariff war. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose as much as 1.1 percent to mark its highest levels since Oct. 2. It last traded up 0.9 percent on the day. Financial spread-betters expected a flat opening in Europe, with London’s FTSE seen 2 points lower at 7,177, Frankfurt’s DAX 1 point lower at 11,308 and Paris CAC up 1 point at 5,161. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained as much as 1.3 percent to six-month highs, while Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s index recovered to levels last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.6 percent to two-month highs. China’s bluechip shares rose 0.3 percent, extending their run of gains to 18 percent from their Jan. 4 trough, thanks to inflows of foreign funds. The gains in Asia topped those in Tuesday’s Wall Street session, where the S&P 500 tacked on 0.2 percent, helped by upbeat results from Walmart. The Nasdaq also rose 0.2 percent, logging its seventh straight session of gains. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are currently scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal is reached by March 1. Investors now expect Trump to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month, likely after China’s annual congress meeting starting from March 5, to strike a deal, or secure a “memorandum of understanding.” “They will likely agree on China importing a larger amount of natural gas and agricultural products,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities, adding that China will also “open up a part of its domestic financial services and possibly some manufacturing sectors”. But he predicted China “will not back down on so-called structural issues. The two countries may perhaps agree to set up a body to continue discussing those issues. Markets are already in the middle of pricing in these things.” The two countries started a new round of talks to resolve their trade war on Tuesday, and sessions at a higher level are planned later this week, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visiting Washington on Thursday and Friday. Investors are also looking to the release later on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January policy-setting meeting, where policymakers effectively signalled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to its balance sheet normalisation. New York Fed President John Williams told Reuters he was comfortable with the level U.S. interest rates are at now and that he sees no need to raise them again unless economic growth or inflation shifts to an unexpectedly higher gear. But he also suggested the balance sheet rolloff would continue at least into next year at its current pace, dampening speculation that the Fed could end the process this year. In the currency market, the euro was little changed at $1.1380, but ahead of Friday’s three-month low of $1.1234, on the back of improving risk appetites. The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 110.84 yen, edging near Thursday’s seven-week peak of 111.13 . The British pound soared to $1.3063 on Tuesday, gaining 1.1 percent, a move some traders attributed to rising hopes Prime Minister Theresa May will make progress in seeking changes to her Brexit deal with the European Union. It last stood at $1.3053. The Chinese yuan rose as much as 0.6 percent against the dollar, its biggest intra-day gain in more than a month, after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States was seeking to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue its yuan currency as part of a trade deal. The yuan’s strength also sparked bids for Asian currencies, with the Thai baht hitting five-year highs. Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but further gains were capped by soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.16 per barrel, up 0.1 percent on the day and not far off their 2019 high of $56.33 hit earlier this week. International Brent crude futures stood at $66.32 per barrel, having hit a three-month high of $66.83 per barrel earlier this week. Gold rose 0.4 percent to 10-month highs of $1,346.73, extending its rally sparked in part by signs that the world’s central banks are turning dovish. The yellow metal has also attracted safety bids on worries about Brexit, said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. Palladium rose as much as 1.4 percent to yet another record high, having risen about 19 percent so far this year, on expectations of increased demand due to stricter emissions standards.

2019-02-20,"NEW DELHI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - India rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday at a time when it is trying to build diplomatic support against Pakistan following a militant attack in the disputed region of Kashmir. The crown prince this week was given a lavish welcome in Pakistan where the two sides signed memoranda of understanding valued at about $20 billion to help prop up Pakistan’s economy. But the Kashmir attack threatens to overshadow the India trip as New Delhi seeks to drum up support against Pakistan. India will forcefully raise the issue of cross-border terrorism during the talks with the Saudi delegation later in the day, officials said. Pakistan says it only gives diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for self-determination. The crown prince hailed the relationship with India, a top consumer of Saudi crude oil, after a ceremonial welcome at the imposing red sandstone presidential palace. “Today we want to be sure that this relation is maintained and improved for the sake of both countries. With the leadership of the president and the PM, I am sure we can create good things for Saudi Arabia and India,” he said in brief remarks before heading into talks with Indian leaders. The prince is also expected to visit China during a tour that will be his first through the region since the storm over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. While the killing of Khashoggi, a known critic of the crown prince, has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West and battered the prince’s image abroad, both India and Pakistan had expected a scaling up of investments during his trip. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who broke with government protocol to welcome the crown prince at the airport on Tuesday, has vowed a strong response to the bombing of a security convoy in Kashmir in which 40 paramilitary police were killed in an attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

2019-02-20,"PARIS, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Air France-KLM pledged to eke out efficiency gains to offset higher fuel costs this year, as the Franco-Dutch airline group deepens cooperation between its two main carriers. Presenting 2018 earnings for the group he joined in September, Chief Executive Ben Smith promised better-coordinated networks and fleets after overcoming KLM resistance to closer integration with Air France, in a boardroom deal struck on Tuesday. “These first achievements pave the way for our ambition to regain a leading position in Europe and worldwide,” Smith said in a company statement. Underlining the challenge, fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 20 pct to 776 million euros ($880 million) as the fuel bill mounted, despite a 4.1 percent revenue gain to 6.54 billion. Blighted by restrictive French union deals and strikes that last year wiped 335 million euros off earnings and forced out its previous CEO, Air France-KLM has trailed rivals Lufthansa and British Airways on profitability. But Smith, an Air Canada veteran, has restored labour peace by granting wage hikes in return for increased flexibility with which he now hopes to make better and more profitable use of the group’s aircraft and networks. On the eve of its results presentation, Air France-KLM struck a new pay deal with its French pilots and resolved a standoff with KLM and the Dutch division’s popular leader Pieter Elbers, over Smith’s integration plans. Almost 15 years after the merger that created Air France-KLM, decisions on networks, fleets and commercial strategy will be taken at group level rather than by the individual carriers under the plans unveiled on Tuesday, which also see Elbers and his Air France counterpart become deputy group CEOs. The financials were broadly in line with expectations of 786 million euros of EBIDTA on 6.52 billion in revenue - based on the median of seven analyst estimates in a poll by Infront Data. The fuel bill rose by 451 million euros in 2018 and will climb another 650 million this year as hedges expire, Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey told reporters. Overall unit costs, up 0.6 percent last year before currency and fuel-price impacts, were “well under control”, Gagey said, and forward bookings for the summer season are “better positioned” than a year ago. Passenger traffic rose 3.4 pct to 24.46 million in the last quarter, the group said, while unit revenue - a measure of proceeds in relation to capacity - fell 0.6 pct. The low-cost Transavia arm was a bright spot, posting a 9 percent full-year operating margin for its French operations as it prepares to expand capacity by about 10 percent in 2019. The rollout of new digital platforms to travel agents will generate savings in 2019, the CFO said, along with improvements to long-haul network planning and the gradual replacement of four-engined Airbus A340 and Boeing 747 planes, less fuel-efficient than twin-engined alternatives. The newly announced management changes should also boost efforts to increase synergies in areas such as purchasing, which was nominally integrated in 2008 but lacked a single group-wide chief procurement officer until last year. Smith’s new centralisation push nonetheless builds on years of painstaking integration that has already assigned some 18,000 workers to group-wide services and managers, said Gagey, who joined Air France in 1997. “It’s not as if we just realised we should begin to look for synergies,” he said.

Beijing’s statement, released late on Tuesday, comes after the world’s second-largest economy saw its weakest growth in 28 years in 2018 and remains entangled in a trade war with Washington. “Under the complicated situation of increasing downward pressure on the economy and profound changes in the external environment, it is of special importance to do a good job in agriculture and rural areas,” the government said in the document issued by the State Council and published by official news agency Xinhua. Known as the “No. 1 document”, this year’s policy reiterated a rural rejuvenation strategy first laid out in 2017 to improve income levels and living standards in China’s countryside. It also highlighted a plan to boost domestic soybean production but did not offer further details. Industry analysts said on Wednesday they were eagerly awaiting further details to assess the impact of the plan, which had already been flagged by Agriculture Minister Han Changfu earlier this month. China has been overhauling its crop structure in recent years, reducing support for corn after stocks ballooned, and seeking to promote more planting of oilseeds that it mostly imports. That goal has become increasingly important since a trade war with the United States, which led China to slap tariffs on soybean imports, tightening domestic supplies. Han has previously urged authorities in China’s northeast to support soybean production through subsidies and called for rotating of soybeans with other crops including corn and wheat.  Beijing also aims to support the production of rapeseed in the Yangtze River Basin, according to the document. As in previous years, it also called for stable grain production, but also an increase in imports of agriculture products where there are shortages in the domestic market. “The focus now is on retaining production capacity, in the form of high quality farmland, and using the international market to make up production shortfalls,” said Even Rogers Pay, an agriculture analyst at China Policy, a Beijing-based consultancy. The reference to imports is positive for trade partners like the United States, said Cherry Zhang, analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd, who said it raised the likelihood that China will buy more U.S. agriculture products. Shares of Chinese livestock companies, along with pig and poultry breeders, rose on Wednesday following the release of the policy paper. The document also outlines plans to accelerate development of a new farm subsidy policy system and further crack down on the smuggling of agriculture products. Additionally, the government said it plans to strengthen the monitoring and control of African swine fever outbreaks, after more than 100 cases were reported in China since August. Other plans include continuing to tackle rural pollution and promoting recycling of agricultural waste such as manure and agricultural film.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose nearly 1.0 percent to reach its highest levels since Oct. 2. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 1.1 percent to six-month highs, while Korea’s Kospi and Taiwan’s index recovered to levels last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.75 percent to two-month highs. Chinese shares rose 0.4 percent, extending their run of gains to 18 percent from their Jan. 4 trough, thanks to inflows of foreign funds. The gains in Asia topped those in Tuesday’s Wall Street session, where the S&P 500 gained 0.15 percent, helped by upbeat results from Walmart. The Nasdaq rose 0.19 percent, logging its seventh straight session of gains. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that trade talks with China were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports are currently scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no trade deal is reached by March 1. Investors now expect Trump to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month, likely after China’s annual congress meeting starting from March 5, to strike a deal, or secure a “memorandum of understanding.” “They will likely agree on China importing a larger amount of natural gas and agricultural products,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities, adding that China will also “open up a part of its domestic financial services and possibly some manufacturing sectors”. But he predicted China “will not back down on so-called structural issues. The two countries may perhaps agree to set up a body to continue discussing those issues. Markets are already in the middle of pricing in these things.” The two countries started a new round of talks to resolve their trade war on Tuesday, and sessions at a higher level are planned later this week, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He visiting Washington on Thursday and Friday. Investors are also looking to the release later on Wednesday of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January policy-setting meeting, where policymakers effectively signalled no further rate hikes and possible tweaks to its balance sheet normalisation. New York Fed President John Williams told Reuters he was comfortable with the level U.S. interest rates are at now and that he sees no need to raise them again unless economic growth or inflation shifts to an unexpectedly higher gear. But he also suggested the balance sheet rolloff would continue at least into next year at its current pace, dampening speculation that the Fed could end the process this year. In the currency market, the euro firmed to $1.1350, bouncing back from Friday’s three-month low of $1.1234, on the back of improving risk appetites. The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 110.80 yen, edging near Thursday’s seven-week peak of 111.13. The British pound soared to $1.3063 on Tuesday, gaining 1.09 percent, a move some traders attributed to rising hopes Prime Minister Theresa May will make progress in seeking changes to her Brexit deal with the European Union. It last stood at $1.3070. The Chinese yuan rose more than 0.5 percent to 6.7243 per dollar, its highest level in about three weeks after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the United States was seeking to secure a pledge from China that it will not devalue its yuan currency as part of a trade deal. The yuan’s strength also sparked bids for Asian currencies, with the Thai baht hitting five-year highs. Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but further gains were capped by soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.01 per barrel, down 8 cents from their last settlement, but not far off their 2019 high of $56.33 reached earlier this week. International Brent crude futures stood at $66.33 per barrel, having hit a three-month high of $66.83 per barrel earlier this week. Gold rose 0.4 percent to 10-month highs of $1,346.50, extending its rally sparked in part by signs that the world’s central banks are turning dovish. The yellow metal has also attracted safety bids on worries about Brexit, said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. Palladium rose 1.4 percent to yet another record high, having risen about 19 percent so far this year, on expectations of increased demand due to stricter emissions standards.

2019-02-20,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru on Tuesday launched a drive to eliminate illegal gold mining in one of the Amazon’s most biodiverse corners, sending 1,500 police and military officers to a region that has suffered rising deforestation from wildcat mining. President Martin Vizcarra’s government said it was suspending civil liberties and tasking the military with restoring law in Madre de Dios, a rainforest region known for its biodiversity, carbon-rich forests and indigenous tribes that shun contact. The state of emergency was declared for two months and 300 troops were sent to the area for six months. The operation got off to a rough start, with two police officers and a prosecutor killed when a bus transporting security forces flipped over, the interior ministry said. If successful, the effort would mark the first time Peru has managed to stop the illegal mining, which releases tonnes of mercury into the environment and drives sex trafficking and child labor in mining camps. The crackdown might also impact gold shipments from Peru, the world’s No. 6 producer, as some illegal ore makes its way into the legal supply chain through shell companies. The illegal gold rush in Madre de Dios, focused on extracting gold from alluvial deposits in river beds, was fueled by high prices for the metal during the 2009-2010 financial crisis.    “It’s been growing for better part of a decade,” said Luis Fernandez, a Wake Forest University ecologist who has studied the issue since 2007. “In every town there are little shops that buy gold from miners.”  Previous governments that have sent troops to destroy illegal mines in the region have failed to stop their expansion into a nature reserve.  Wildcat miners in Madre de Dios are often tipped off about government plans, allowing them to flee before regrouping once security forces leave. Environmentalists say criminal groups in the region are now more organized and violent. In 2018, deforestation from wildcat mining in southern Peru, where Madre de Dios is located, peaked at 9,280 hectares (22,931 acres), according to a report by Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which uses satellite images to track deforestation for Amazon Conservation.

2019-02-20,"(Repeats Feb. 19 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2GVTxDc By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy lost a lot of momentum during the fourth quarter and suffered a serious wobble in December, which should give policymakers pause before doing anything that could unsettle fragile sentiment further. Freight movements by road, rail, air, barge and pipeline fell more than 3 percent in December compared with November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). Freight shrank by the most in any one month since March 2009 and was just 1.4 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier, the weakest performance for more than two years. Road freight slumped more than 4 percent in the final month of 2018, according to data sourced from the American Trucking Associations (“December 2018 freight transportation services index”, BTS, Feb. 13). Truck freight has been losing momentum since the middle of last year but the drop in December was the worst for nearly seven years (tmsnrt.rs/2GVTxDc). Separately, loaded container movements through the major gateways of Los Angeles and Long Beach slowed sharply, according to container counts from the port operators. Faltering freight volumes are consistent with other data showing the manufacturing sector hit a soft patch towards the end of last year. Manufacturing output hit a cycle high in October but fell in each of the three following months and was down more than 3 percent by January (“Industrial production and capacity utilization”, Federal Reserve, Feb. 15). Purchasing managers also reported an abrupt deceleration in the rate of expansion, with the Institute for Supply Management’s composite business activity index registering its worst decline in December since the financial crisis. In recent months, some observers have commented on the apparent disconnect between plunging financial markets, wobbling business surveys, and solid economic data. In retrospect, however, the data is all coherent. The drop in U.S. equity valuations and flattening of the yield curve in the fourth quarter are consistent with hard economic data showing a rapid cooling in the economy late in 2018. The critical question is whether the slide in freight and manufacturing activity near the end of last year turns out to be a brief soft patch or heralds a more sustained period of weakness - even a recession. Equity prices rallied strongly in January and the Institute for Supply Management’s composite activity indicator reversed some of the losses the month before, both of which suggest the economy will continue to expand. But both remain well below their pre-October highs and the yield curve has not steepened significantly, which point to a more sustained loss of momentum and an elevated risk of recession. Taken together, the available financial and real economic data suggests an economy poised between continued growth at a slower rate or the onset of a recession. Like expansions, recessions are driven by positive-feedback mechanisms which amplify the effect of an initial disturbance, often quite a small one, so the next few months will be critical. In the circumstances, the U.S. economy can ill afford any more negative shocks, and that includes an escalation of the trade battle with China.

2019-02-20,"* U.S. sanctions on Iran, Venezuela tighten markets * But soaring U.S. shale output offsets some of the disruptions * Economic slowdown to weigh on oil prices by Q4 -BNP Paribas By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices hovered near 2019 highs on Wednesday, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, but capped by soaring U.S. production and expectations of an economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $55.93 per barrel at 0042 GMT, down 16 cents from their last settlement, but not far off their 2019 high of $56.33 reached earlier this week. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. They also hit a 2019 high of $66.83 per barrel this week. Prices have been driven up by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC’s - and the world’s - biggest oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to reduce shipments of light crude oil to Asia in March as part of the effort to tighten markets. OPEC as well as some non-affiliated producers such as Russia agreed late last year to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent a large supply overhang from swelling. “We have lowered Saudi crude oil output in line with announcements ... (and) are now assuming that Saudi Arabia will produce in the first three quarters of 2019 less than the 10.31 million bpd target it agreed to at the 7 December OPEC, non-OPEC meeting,” French bank BNP Paribas said in a note. Because of the cuts, BNP said it expected oil prices “to rally through Q3 2019”, with Brent to average $73 per barrel by then and WTI to average $66. Another key oil price driver has been U.S. sanctions on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela. Despite the sanctions, Iran’s crude exports were higher than expected in January, averaging around 1.25 million bpd, according to Refinitiv ship tracking data. Many analysts had expected Iran oil exports to drop below 1 million bpd after the imposition of U.S. sanctions last November. Standing against the supply cuts and sanctions is U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA, which soared by more than 2 million bpd in 2018 to a record 11.9 million bpd, thanks to booming shale oil production, which the Energy Information Administration on Tuesday said was expected to keep rising. BNP Paribas said surging U.S. output would feed into lower oil prices towards the end of the year, with Brent to dip to an average of $67 a barrel by the fourth quarter and WTI to average $61. “U.S. oil production growth, driven by shale, will be increasingly exported in greater volumes to international markets while the global economy is expected to witness a synchronised slowdown in growth,” the bank said.
