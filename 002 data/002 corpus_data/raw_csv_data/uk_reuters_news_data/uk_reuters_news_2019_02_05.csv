2019-02-05,"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Plains All American Pipeline LP said on Tuesday it expects the reversed Capline crude pipeline, from the U.S. Midwest to the Gulf Coast, to begin service in the third quarter of 2020. The target in-service date for the reversed line is third quarter 2020 for light oil service and early 2022 for heavy oil service, the company said on its quarterly earnings call with analysts. “The capacity from Cushing (Oklahoma) down to St. James (Louisiana) should be available on a quicker time frame than heavy moving down from Patoka (Illinois),” Chief Executive Officer Willie Chiang said on the call. Pending a successful open season, in which companies gauge shipper interest for the proposal, the Cushing to St. James movement would include a 200,000 barrel a day of expansion and a modest extension of the Diamond JV pipeline that will connect to Capline, Plains said. Capline is the largest crude pipeline that currently runs from the Gulf Coast to refineries in the Midwest. Volumes on Capline, once a major artery for imports and Gulf of Mexico crude used by U.S. Midwest refiners, have declined sharply as the U.S. shale boom pushed inland crude to the East Coast and Gulf Coast. The company said it is also making progress on its Cactus II pipeline with partial service expected in late third quarter of 2019 and full service plan by April 2020. Plains said its Corpus Christi, Texas and St. James facilities could both could explored further for crude export capabilities. “We think we’re the best solution to get barrels to the coast and what we strive to do is to have connectivity to the many, many docks that are being expanded to be able to get access to water ... so far there’s been a lot of interest in us being able to get connections,” Chiang said. Plains has previously said it was monitoring demand for building a crude export facility capable of handling supertankers. Several midstream companies have announced multimillion-dollar crude terminals along the Gulf Coast looking to take advantage of a surge in U.S. crude exports. Plains said it has a 20 percent ownership interest in the joint venture with ExxonMobil and Lotus Midstream for a pipeline system that is expected to provide more than 1 million barrels per day of crude and condensate capacity from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. Plains expects a net 2019 capital investment of about $250 million towards the project.

2019-02-05,"(Adds details from earnings release, context) HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Roughly 20 percent of the hydraulic fracturing fleets that were active in mid-2018 have now been idled or are being idled, as lower oil prices prompt producers to tighten their budgets, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc estimated on Tuesday. The company in its fourth-quarter earnings said a number of customers made last-minute decisions to defer well completions, in part because of a drop in oil prices at the end of last year. U.S. oil prices fell by almost 40 percent in the fourth quarter of last year amid concerns of growing supply and slowing economic growth. The steep decline has negatively impacted many oilfield service companies that are still working to recover from the 2014 price crash. Liberty said its customers are still finalizing budgets for 2019 and that it expected more clarity on 2019 completions demand by the end of the first quarter. The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of 27 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimates of 31 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Fourth-quarter revenues of $473 million also missed consensus estimates of $496.9 million.

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday, falling from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market, and a stronger dollar also weighed.  Prices sagged after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. That, coupled with disappointing U.S. factory orders data a day earlier, stoked worries about softer demand, analysts said.  Brent crude futures fell 53 cents to settle at $61.98 a barrel. They touched their highest level in more than two months at $63.63 the previous day. U.S. crude futures dropped 90 cents to settle at $53.66 a barrel, or down 1.7 percent.  Futures held lower after the close, when the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.5 million barrels last week, more than analyst expectations. Oil also felt pressure from a strengthening dollar, which rallied for a fourth straight session, which makes crude more expensive for non-U.S. buyers. “It really seemed to be a dollar influence here today,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. “It was interesting that we didn’t catch a bid along with the stock market because that had been the correlation.”  Investors were shifting assets into equities and away from markets more sensitive to Washington-Beijing trade relations and movements in the dollar, said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.  “Oil is just not in favor today, and they are going after the equity markets,” he said. Wall Street was slightly higher on Tuesday. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have been viewed as supportive of prices by helping tighten global supplies. Numerous tankers are currently in the water off the Venezuelan coast, unable to move because state-owned PDVSA is demanding payment, which would run afoul of U.S. sanctions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed to production cuts effective from last month to beat back supply growth. A Reuters survey found that supply from OPEC states had fallen the most in two years.  Concerns about the pace of global economic growth were fanned by a weak start for the year for euro zone businesses. A Tuesday survey showed demand declined for the first in over four years.  New orders for U.S.-made goods fell unexpectedly in November, according to data released a day earlier.

2019-02-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Holiday airline Germania collapsed on Tuesday and canceled all flights immediately, the latest to succumb to turbulence in the European airline industry as it failed to secure financing to navigate a short-term cash squeeze. The insolvency of the German company, which carried about 4 million passengers a year, followed the failure of Germany’s second-biggest carrier, Air Berlin, in 2017. Britain’s Monarch Airlines and Alitalia also filed for insolvency in 2017. German charter carrier Small Planet Airlines hit financial trouble last year after an expansion drive.  Germania cited rising fuel prices, a stronger dollar, delays in integrating new aircraft into its fleet and high maintenance costs. “Unfortunately, we were ultimately unable to bring our financing efforts to cover a short-term liquidity need to a positive conclusion,” Chief Executive Officer Karsten Balke said in a statement. The carrier’s 37 aircraft mainly flew German sun-seekers to more than 60 destinations in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The Berlin-based company, founded in 1986, also offered flights to less conventional destinations including Iran, Iraq and Armenia.  It said all flights had been halted overnight after it filed for bankruptcy late on Monday. A spokesman for the airline’s administrators said it was unclear whether operations could resume and whether the company could continue. CEO Balke thanked Germania’s staff and apologized to passengers who had booked directly and would not be entitled to alternative flights. A Germania spokesman declined to comment on the number of passengers or staff affected. “I have no idea whether we are going to be put on another flight or whether we can book our own new flight through another carrier. No idea,” passenger Iris Fenske told Reuters TV at Duesseldorf airport. The Federal Association of the German Aviation Industry said other airlines, including Condor, Tui Group’s TUIfly and those belonging to the Lufthansa Group, would offer stranded Germania passengers special rates to return to Germany. Tour operators will organize alternative travel arrangements for holidaymakers who have booked package deals, the German Travel Association (DRV) said.  Germany’s Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a conservative, said he had no specific plans to offer help to Germania, adding the government would watch the situation closely. The Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, vowed to push for creation of a European system to protect passengers in the event of bankruptcies, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported late Tuesday. “The new EU commission and the new European parliament must tackle this urgent problem,” it quoted the party’s legal spokesman, Johannes Fechner, as saying. “The horror for German air travelers continues,” Klaus Mueller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, said of the airline’s demise. On Monday, Europe’s largest budget airline Ryanair, posted its first quarterly loss since 2014 and said it expects further consolidation over the next 12-18 months because of overcapacity. It predicted a further rise in oil prices would hit smaller airlines that cannot afford to increase their oil price hedging. In a video message on Twitter, Ryanair’s chief operating officer on Tuesday said the airline will offer Germania pilots, engineers and cabin crew “immediate” starts if they apply for vacancies in Germany, Austria and across Europe.  Germania’s financial problems emerged at the start of January when it said it was examining several financing options to secure short-term liquidity. On Jan. 19 it said it had a commitment for 15 million euros ($17 million) in funding that would secure its medium- and long-term future, but at the end of last week it confirmed media reports that it had delayed paying wages.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday they are investing in a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, as companies race to meet global demand for the fuel. Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin early this year. The project will add production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024. Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.   “Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said of the final investment decision. Woods and Qatar Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi signed the deal at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington in the presence of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The deal is proof that two of the world’s top energy producers can work together and “support rather than subvert an open energy marketplace,” Perry said. The Trump administration has promoted gas drilling and LNG exports in part to offer European customers alternatives to piped natural gas from Russia, while slashing Obama-era environmental regulations on energy operations. “To understand how critical this is, imagine how Europe feels when the winter winds begin to blow and Russia has its hand on the pipe valve,” Perry said. Russia has in recent years slashed gas shipments to Europe through Ukraine during pricing disputes. Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds 70 percent. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon has signed an agreement to buy a 12.4 percent interest in the existing terminal and a pipeline from ConocoPhillips, and the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals, both companies said.   The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-24. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country. Energy industry construction firm McDermott International Inc and its partners, Chiyoda International Corp and Zachry Group, have won a contract worth more than $1 billion to build the export project, McDermott said separately on Tuesday. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year.

2019-02-05,"(Adds comment from EQT, recasts) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Two of the founders of Rice Energy, which EQT Corp bought in 2017, are pushing for a change in the company’s strategy and replacement of its board due to its ongoing underperformance. Appalachian-focused EQT acquired rival Rice Energy for $6.7 billion, making it the largest natural gas producer in the United States. However, its share price has tumbled more than 30 percent since the merger, which brothers Toby and Derek Rice blame on operational and managerial mismanagement. In a presentation to shareholders on Tuesday, the brothers proposed appointing Toby Rice, former chief operating officer of Rice Energy, as the company’s new chief executive. When EQT released its 2019 guidance in January, the brothers said they would challenge the board in a shareholder ballot. The brothers, who own around 3 percent of EQT, said in their presentation they could improve EQT’s free cash flow by $500 million per year. They proposed streamlining aspects of the organization, digitizing workflows, and improving planning to reduce well costs. A spokeswoman for EQT said on Tuesday the company disagreed with the analysis put forward by the Rices and that the firm looked forward to continued discussions with shareholders. “EQT remains focused on reducing costs and generating substantial free cash flow to create further value for EQT shareholders,” she added. Shares of EQT were down 2.4 percent to $19.31 in afternoon trading on Tuesday and are off 28 percent in the past 52 weeks. EQT’s average Marcellus well cost for a 12,000-foot lateral was $1,250 per foot in 2018, while Rice Energy, before its merger with EQT, averaged $790 per foot for wells with laterals reaching 8,800 feet in the same region, according to the Rice presentation. The brothers also said EQT has “erroneously adjusted downwards” its well costs. In a presentation, the brothers said operations could be improved by altering well designs to include more sand, water and stages per foot. The presentation also said they had initiated dialogue with EQT to improve its business, but claimed those suggestions have been ignored, prompting it to bring their concerns to shareholders. The Rice brothers owns 7.5 million shares in EQT, worth more than $145 million. Reporting by Liz Hampton

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a fresh two-month high on Tuesday to keep up their fast start to 2019 while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a fourth straight session as investors looked toward an annual address by the U.S. president later in the evening. Boosted by U.S. and European equity performance, MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.64 percent, increasing for a sixth straight session as it hit a two-month high.  President Donald Trump was due to give his State of the Union speech at 2100 ET (0200 GMT), with investors awaiting indications of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and watching for signs of tensions with Democrats following a 35-day partial federal government shutdown. The Federal Reserve’s dovish recent statement on interest rate policy, along with optimism over U.S.-China tensions, has fueled recent risk appetite, even as estimates for U.S. corporate earnings have been falling. “We could move significantly higher if the geopolitical environment improves, and we could also decline if things break down,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “There will be lots of hints tonight about the U.S. political landscape.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.15 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,411.52, the S&P 500 gained 12.83 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,737.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 54.55 points, or 0.74 percent, to 7,402.08. Shares of Estée Lauder Cos and Ralph Lauren reacted favorably to the companies’ respective quarterly reports. “The main focus of the market has just been that people are getting more comfortable that the prices for stocks are reasonable,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. Fourth-quarter earnings for companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index were on track to have climbed 15.8 percent, but profit in the first quarter is now expected to rise by only 0.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.41 percent, helped by a recovery in banks and a solid update from BP. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.21 percent, up for a fourth straight session, with the euro down 0.23 percent to $1.1409. Continued recovery in investors’ appetite for risk taking exerted pressure on safe-haven currencies, dragging the Swiss franc to an 11-week low against the dollar.    U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors priced in the Fed’s dovish interest rate outlook amid an uncertain global economic outlook. “Yields are consolidating around levels that are more consistent with the new position at the Fed,” that it could effectively hold rates steady over the next six months, said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.7001 percent, from 2.724 percent late Monday.    Oil prices pulled back from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market and a stronger dollar also weighed.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has sent food and medicine to Colombia’s border with Venezuela, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, although it is still unclear how the aid will get past the objections of President Nicolas Maduro, who has blocked shipments in the past. Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the aid will be staged at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta. One official said more supplies would be staged in Brazil and in the Caribbean. “I anticipate having perhaps a dozen locations all around Venezuela where such aid will be staged,” the official said. The U.S. officials said trucks carrying the aid, including high-protein foods, would arrive in Cucuta this week at the request of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself to be the South American nation’s interim president. Opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro told reporters in Caracas on Tuesday that Guaido’s team would talk about how the aid would move once it was in place. Shipments were also coming from Venezuelan companies abroad, Colombia, Canada and Germany. A senior U.S. administration official said it was up to Guaido to decide when and how to move the supplies into the country. “We will seek to help him to do so by whatever means possible,” the official said. Prepositioning aid in warehouses or in truck convoys at border posts for weeks, or sometimes months, is common while officials negotiate safe passage. Franklin Graham, chief executive of relief group Samaritan’s Purse and the son of renowned Christian evangelist Billy Graham, said until humanitarian groups had access inside Venezuela, most aid likely would remain outside. Samaritan’s Purse has operated for the past three years in Cucuta, giving food, medicine and backpacks to Venezuelans heading to Colombia on foot. The group also has managed to get a small amount of aid inside the country, which Graham called “a drop in the bucket” compared to what is needed. “The government of Venezuela needs to open the borders, that’s it: Open the borders and let food convoys come into your country, open up your airports and let food flights fly in,” said Graham, who said he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump about the situation in December. “We are preparing to fly in as soon as we get the green light,” he said. The Cucuta crossing was mainly quiet on Tuesday, but police officials told Reuters that more migrants have been asking where humanitarian aid will be delivered. In the nearby border town of La Parada, hundreds of people, some in wheelchairs, lined up in the hot sun to buy medicine. Maria Gomez, a 53-year-old seamstress, arrived from San Cristobal in northern Venezuela to buy her elderly mother the Losartan pills she needs for hypertension. “It’s cheap here, I always come,” she said as a pharmacist handed over the pills. “We cannot buy drugs in Venezuela, you die before you get them.” Pressure is growing on Maduro to step down after more than a dozen European Union nations on Monday joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognising Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. However Russia, China and Turkey continue to back Maduro, accusing Western nations of meddling. The 35-year-old Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, has galvanized the opposition with a hopeful message. He has repeatedly called on Venezuela’s military, which has remained loyal to Maduro, to support a transition to democracy. The United States could attempt to seek the approval of the United Nations Security Council to deliver aid without Maduro’s cooperation, but Russia would likely block such a move. So far, Maduro has rejected foreign aid. “We are not beggars. You want to humiliate Venezuela, and I will not let our people be humiliated,” he said on Monday. Maduro’s government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations for recognising Guaido, accusing them of submitting to a U.S. “strategy to overthrow the legitimate government.” With Maduro in control of Venezuela’s military and all the territory, getting aid in will be hard, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, who cautioned against politicizing the assistance. “The more it looks like an overt attack on the authority of Maduro, that makes the aid more of a target,” said Konyndyk, who has led U.S. government responses to international disasters.

The Federal Reserve’s dovish recent statement on interest rate policy, along with optimism over U.S.-China tensions, has fueled recent risk appetite, even as estimates for U.S. corporate earnings have been falling. “Despite the State of the Union tonight, investors seem increasingly certain that we are going to avoid any escalation of the trade tensions with China and avoid another government shutdown,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “Investors are viewing policy considerations offsetting falling earnings expectations,” Kleintop said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.25 points, or 0.39 percent, to 25,338.62, the S&P 500 gained 2.88 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,727.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.91 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,372.44. Shares of Estée Lauder Cos and Ralph Lauren reacted favorably to the companies’ respective quarterly reports. Fourth-quarter earnings for companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index were on track to have climbed 15.8 percent, but profit in the first quarter is now expected to rise by only 0.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 1.41 percent, helped by a recovery in banks and a solid update from BP. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.17 percent, up for a fourth straight session, with the euro down 0.17 percent to $1.1415. Continued recovery in investors’ appetite for risk taking exerted pressure on safe-haven currencies, dragging the Swiss franc to an 11-week low against the dollar. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors started to price in the Fed’s dovish interest rate outlook amid an uncertain global economic outlook. “Yields are consolidating around levels that are more consistent with the new position at the Fed which is ... it is effectively on hold at least in the next six months,” said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.6983 percent, from 2.724 percent late Monday. Oil prices pulled back from two-month highs after weak U.S. factory orders data rekindled economic slowdown worries. U.S. crude fell 1.43 percent to $53.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $62.10, down 0.66 percent. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Saqib

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp will proceed with a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, Exxon said on Tuesday.  Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project, in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin in early 2019. The project will add  production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024. Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.   “Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,” said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods in a press release. Executives from Exxon and Qatar Petroleum were due to make a joint announcement with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry Tuesday afternoon, the Energy Department said on Monday. Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion (15 billion pounds) in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-2024. Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. Qatar left the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country.

2019-02-05,"(Adds vote count, comment from environmental group) By Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A key Senate committee approved U.S. President Donald Trump’s new pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, putting the former coal lobbyist a step closer to becoming the permanent head of America’s top environmental regulator. Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a Washington insider with years of experience in Congress, was nominated by Trump last month to replace Scott Pruitt, who resigned in July after widespread criticism for alleged ethical missteps. His nomination has cheered business interests keen to see reduced regulation, but upset Democrats and conservation groups worried that environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration are going too far. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works advanced Wheeler’s nomination with 11 Republican members in favor and 10 Democrats against. A full Senate vote must now be scheduled to complete his confirmation. “Mr. Wheeler has done an outstanding job as the acting administrator over the past six months,” Republican Senator John Barrasso, chairman of the committee, said. Shelley Moore Capito, Republican Senator from West Virginia, said Wheeler worked to improve transparency at the agency. Wheeler was not present at the meeting. Democratic Senators questioned Wheeler’s years of past experience serving for the interests of the industries that he would be regulating. “In many instances, Mr. Wheeler has gone further than his predecessor in his rejection of important measures,” Democrat Senator Tom Carper, ranking member of the committee, said in his opening remarks. While running EPA on an interim basis, Wheeler oversaw the weakening of Obama-era rules limiting carbon and mercury emissions from power plants, and advanced an initiative to lift a summertime ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline that was enacted to curb smog. Like Pruitt, he held nearly 20 times more meetings with industry representatives than with conservationists during his first two months on the job, according to a copy of his schedule reviewed by Reuters. And during his confirmation hearing last month, he said he did not believe climate change was not a major crisis - a stance that resonates with Trump’s skepticism but which clashes with the scientific consensus that global warming will have devastating consequences if not addressed urgently. “Andrew Wheeler is ... a coal lobbyist masquerading as the EPA Administrator,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement.

2019-02-05,"KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwanda said on Tuesday it had signed a $400 million deal to produce bottled gas from Lake Kivu, which emits such dense clouds of methane it is known as one of Africa’s “Killer Lakes”.  The project by Gasmeth Energy, owned by U.S. and Nigerian businessmen and Rwandans, would suck gas from the lake’s deep floor and bottle it for use as fuel. This should, in turn, help prevent toxic gas bubbling to the surface.  The seven-year deal, signed on Friday, was announced on Tuesday. Rwanda already has two companies that extract gas from Lake Kivu to power electricity plants.  Clare Akamanzi, chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, told Reuters bottled methane would help cut local reliance on wood and charcoal, the fuels most households and tea factories use in the East African nation of 12 million people.     “We expect to have affordable gas which is environmentally friendly,” she said. “We expect that people can use gas instead of charcoal, the same with industries like tea factories instead of using firewood, they use gas. It’s part of our green agenda.” The deep waters of Lake Kivu, which lies in the volcanic region on Rwanda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, emit such dense clouds of methane that scientists fear they might erupt, killing those living along its shore.  Eruptions from much smaller methane-emitting lakes in Cameroon, one causing a toxic cloud and another sparking an explosion, killed a total of nearly 1,800 people. The shores of Lake Kivu are much more densely populated.  Gasmeth Energy said it would finance, build and maintain a gas extraction, processing and compression plant to sell methane domestically and abroad. The bottled gas should be on sale within two years, Akamanzi said, adding that prices had yet to be determined.

2019-02-05,"(Repeats Feb. 4 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming steadily less bearish towards oil as OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela remove large volumes of crude from the market amid increasing confidence a global recession can be averted. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of another 30 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to position data from ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers have been net buyers in seven of the last eight weeks and have increased their position by 96 million barrels since Dec. 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4). In common with previous weeks, fund managers mostly closed out old bearish short positions (-18 million barrels) rather than opening new bullish long ones (+12 million). Bearish short positions have fallen by more than 60 percent from a peak of 122 million barrels on Dec. 11 to 48 million as fund managers have become convinced that the fourth-quarter sell-off is over. In contrast, bullish long positions have risen by just 27 million barrels over the same period, as portfolio managers remain cautious. However, weekly increases have started to accelerate, in a sign of growing confidence. Funds now hold almost 6 bullish long positions for every bearish short one, up from a ratio of 2:1 in mid-December, and the most bullish overall position since mid-October. OPEC’s early and aggressive output reductions have removed some of the downside supply risk to oil prices even as traders remain uncertain about the risk of recession and the potential hit to consumption growth in 2019. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA, since broadened to include third-country purchasers of Venezuela’s heavy crude, are also likely to reduce global oil supplies. Besides crude, fund managers were buyers of 7 million barrels of European gasoil futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to exchange data. Net long positions in gasoil have risen in each of the last four weeks and now stand at 22 million barrels, up from just 2 million barrels at the end of 2018. Gasoil is the part of the barrel most closely geared to the business cycle, so cautious buying suggests fund managers see a reduced probability of recession this year.

2019-02-05,"SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched up on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply amid U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.73 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 16 cents from their last settlement. They closed down 1.3 percent on Monday, after earlier touching their highest since Nov. 21 at $55.75 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. Analysts said that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela had focused market attention on tighter global supplies. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to but slightly less extensive than those imposed on Iran last year, experts said on Friday after looking at details posted by the Treasury Department. Oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October.

The Federal Reserve’s cautious turn last month was continuing to drive up appetite for riskier assets but there were also a number of idiosyncratic factors feeding outsized moves. News that oil giant BP had doubled it profits and another tickup in crude prices overnight pushed the oil and gas sector up 1.5 percent. Miners were also up sharply as traders digested news that Brazil had ordered Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, to close eight of its dams following a deadly collapse that killed over 300 people last month. Iron ore prices surged 14 percent at the end of last week in anticipation of the move and are now at a near 2-year high. “Our fundamental view is there no reason for this incredible move, so is it just speculation, a frenzy about possible stimulus in China?,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. “What should we do with it? I don’t know, but it should be noted.” China and large parts of Asia were closed for Lunar New Year celebrations overnight but the bits that were open made some headway too. Japan’s Nikkei average marked its highest level in seven weeks at one point before fading to finish slightly lower. Australian shares suffered no such fatigue. They jumped 2 percent, with long-battered financials surging on short-covering after a special government-appointed misconduct inquiry left the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained on Monday, with technology and industrials the biggest winners, 100-day moving averages sliced through and the VIX “fear gauge,” dropping to its lowest in four months. With Europe continuing to rally, MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe reached a two-month high. It has just had its best January on record, rising more than 13 percent from a near two-year low hit in late December. Having changed tack on rate rises last week the Fed took the unusual step of issuing a statement on Monday saying that its head Jerome Powell had told President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that “the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information.” In the currency markets, the dollar held on to recent gains against its major peers as investors continued to lap-up Friday’s strong payrolls number and a manufacturing survey. The dollar index against six major currencies was a fraction higher at 95.916, having gained 0.27 percent the previous day. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1420, as data showing Euro zone business growth almost stalled in January knocked it further away from a three-week high of $1.15405 set last week. The Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7260 , erasing earlier losses, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left policy unchanged at its first meeting this year but sounded less dovish than the markets had wagered on. The Aussie had earlier fallen fell as much as 0.5 percent after a slump in retail sales reinforced concerns about the health of the economy. Traders’ focus was already shifting to U.S. President Donald Trump’s delayed State of the Union address, due at 2100 ET Tuesday/0200 GMT Wednesday, as well as U.S. ISM non-manufacturing figures, also due later in the day. Trump told a White House event over the weekend that he might declare a national “emergency” because Democrats in Congress weren’t moving toward a deal to provide money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Such a step would likely prompt a court challenge from Democrats. “If President Trump persists in his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the upcoming address, it would cap the dollar’s rally,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities.

The United States granted the two countries exemptions along with six others - Turkey, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - allowing them to temporarily continue buying Iranian oil as Washington reimposed sanctions on Iran’s banking and energy sectors. “No European country is buying oil from Iran except Turkey,” Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency. “Greece and Italy have been granted exemptions by America, but they don’t buy Iranian oil and they don’t answer our questions,” he said.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP joined its competitors in posting a strong 2018 performance, with a doubling of profits driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following a large U.S. shale acquisition.     Record utilization of its oil and gas fields and refining capacity further helped BP seal what was a transformational year as the aftermath of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster eased. But while the London-listed firm’s revenue beat forecasts, debt rose and the pace of its share buyback scheme slowed in the last quarter after it paid the first and largest tranche of the $10.5 billion BHP acquisition. BP shares rose more than 3.3 percent in early trade, hitting their highest since early December.  “We now have a powerful track record of safe and reliable performance, efficient execution and capital discipline. And we’re doing this while growing the business,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement on Tuesday. Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron all reported stronger-than-forecast earnings last week driven by higher production in U.S. shale basins where Oil Majors have invested billions in recent years. The strong gains came despite a sharp drop in crude prices at the end of the year that wiped out most gains made in share prices throughout the year. Uncertainty over the outlook for oil prices as well as concerns over global economic growth and sino-American trade tensions are likely to continue to weigh on the sector. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters he expected Brent crude prices to hold around current levels of $60 a barrel in 2019, while demand was expected to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 million barrels per day, a similar pace to that seen in 2017. Capital expenditure will be $15 to $17 billion this year, after reaching $15.1 billion in 2018, Gilvary said. BP plans to sell $10 billion of assets over the next two years to help pay for the BHP deal, including a suite of fields in the United States as it focuses on the most attractive basins, he added. After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the BHP deal which is its largest in 30 years. For the year, BP’s profit rose to a five-year high of $12.7 billion, double the previous year’s $6.17 billion and above analyst expectations of $11.88 billion. “Overall, we see this as a strong set of results, with stronger underlying earnings translating into cash,” Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.  Graphic: BP annual results - tmsnrt.rs/2Bl1O05 Graphic: BP quarterly profits - tmsnrt.rs/2HNkHOO Production rose to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 after BP completed the acquisition of BHP’s onshore U.S. shale portfolio and thanks to the start up of new fields including the 120,000 barrel per day Clair Ridge project in the North Sea.  Excluding its share of production from its 20 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft, BP’s production was up 8.2 percent from 2017. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 30.3 percent at the end of 2018 from 27.4 percent a year earlier. Net debt was $44.1 billion at the end of last year.

2019-02-05,"(Adds quotes, details) KUWAIT, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The head of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp, Hashem Hashem, said on Tuesday that global oil supply could be hit this year by big reductions in exports from Venezuela. The Trump administration has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States and at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “One of the known risks of supply shortage in 2019 would include the continuing decline of Venezuelan crude oil production beyond current expectations,” Hashem told an industry conference in Kuwait. “However the wild card recently has been market perceptions of potential shortages mainly from geopolitical pressures that have caused supply disruptions in the past and therefore pose a real threat for 2019.” Hashem also said that the threat of a U.S.-China trade war and mixed messages from the United States on whether it would raise interest rates is causing volatility in the global equity markets and could increase oil price volatility this year. OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Hashem said OPEC+ actions should help re-balance the oil markets this year but he also warned of the impact of underinvestment in the oil industry which could cause a supply crunch by 2025. “OPEC and the non-OPEC producing countries... have successfully provided stability to the market since 2017 and reduced volatility in oil prices. The resultant prices, are critical to stimulate investment and growth,” he said. Reporting by Ahmed Hagagy; Writing by Rania El Gamal; editing

2019-02-05,"TOKYO (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that her country would withdraw from coal-fired power production by 2038, showing her support for the deadline recommended by a government-appointed commission. The so-called coal commission said last month that Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest and proposed at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to coal-mining states affected by the phase-out. “We want to be out of coal in 2038. Then we need more gas,” Merkel said in a speech at Keio University in Tokyo, in her first clear indication that she supported the recommendation. The proposals highlight Germany’s shift to renewables, which made up more than 40 percent of its energy mix last year, surpassing coal for the first time. They must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. The plan, however, has drawn criticism from some in industry who fear the impact of higher energy prices. A senior legislator from the most pro-business wing in Merkel’s party hinted in a weekend newspaper interview that the phase-out could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline created problems for the security of electricity supply.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.4 to $54.79 a barrel, after hitting a 2-1/2-month high of $55.75 in the previous session, while Brent crude futures were last up 0.4 percent at $62.77. Gold prices held near one-week lows hit in the previous session, pressured by a firmer dollar and as investor appetite for riskier assets picked up.

2019-02-05,"(Repeats Feb. 4 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming steadily less bearish towards oil as OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela remove large volumes of crude from the market amid increasing confidence a global recession can be averted. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of another 30 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to position data from ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers have been net buyers in seven of the last eight weeks and have increased their position by 96 million barrels since Dec. 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4). In common with previous weeks, fund managers mostly closed out old bearish short positions (-18 million barrels) rather than opening new bullish long ones (+12 million). Bearish short positions have fallen by more than 60 percent from a peak of 122 million barrels on Dec. 11 to 48 million as fund managers have become convinced that the fourth-quarter sell-off is over. In contrast, bullish long positions have risen by just 27 million barrels over the same period, as portfolio managers remain cautious. However, weekly increases have started to accelerate, in a sign of growing confidence. Funds now hold almost 6 bullish long positions for every bearish short one, up from a ratio of 2:1 in mid-December, and the most bullish overall position since mid-October. OPEC’s early and aggressive output reductions have removed some of the downside supply risk to oil prices even as traders remain uncertain about the risk of recession and the potential hit to consumption growth in 2019. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA, since broadened to include third-country purchasers of Venezuela’s heavy crude, are also likely to reduce global oil supplies. Besides crude, fund managers were buyers of 7 million barrels of European gasoil futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to exchange data. Net long positions in gasoil have risen in each of the last four weeks and now stand at 22 million barrels, up from just 2 million barrels at the end of 2018. Gasoil is the part of the barrel most closely geared to the business cycle, so cautious buying suggests fund managers see a reduced probability of recession this year.

2019-02-05,"SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched up on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply amid U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.73 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 16 cents from their last settlement. They closed down 1.3 percent on Monday, after earlier touching their highest since Nov. 21 at $55.75 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. Analysts said that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela had focused market attention on tighter global supplies. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to but slightly less extensive than those imposed on Iran last year, experts said on Friday after looking at details posted by the Treasury Department. Oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October.

2019-02-05,"* Long-battered Australian financial shares jump * Strong U.S. data still supporting sentiment * Multiple Asian markets closed for Lunar New Year * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Recent U.S. data and the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn kept lifting Asian stocks early on Tuesday, while the dollar held the upper hand against its rivals. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.4 percent before erasing gains while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.3 percent. Australian shares jumped 1.95 percent, with long-battered financials surging on short-covering after a special government-appointed inquiry excoriated Australia’s financial sector for misconduct but left the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. Elsewhere in Asia, trade was light, with markets in greater China, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia are all closed for the Lunar New Year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained, with technology and industrials the biggest risers as investors braced for another big week of fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports. After the bell, Google operator Alphabet fell about 3 percent as its higher spending in the fourth-quarter worried investors even as its revenue and profits beat Wall Street’s expectations. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe reached a two-month high, having risen more than 13 percent from its near two-year low late in December, helped by the Fed’s change of tack. Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled its three-year tightening drive may be coming to an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Data announced on Friday showed U.S. job growth surged in January while a key gauge of U.S. manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience after December’s shocking fall, allaying fears of immediate slowdown in the U.S. economy. Hiroshi Nakamura, senior manager of investment planning at Mitsui Life Insurance, said financial markets’ positive reaction to the U.S. data is diminishing with time,  but hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal “will continue to support markets until the two sides come to formal decisions”. The U.S. dollar strengthened across the board, as investors took heart from Friday’s strong payrolls number. The dollar’s index against six major currencies rose to 95.843, having gained 0.27 percent on Monday. The euro eased to $1.1436, off three-week high of $1.15405 set on Thursday. The dollar firmed to 109.92 yen, having risen to 110.165 the previous day, its highest level in five weeks. The British pound slipped to $1.3035, having quickly erased brief gains on Monday following a newspaper report that goods shipped to Britain from the European Union could be waved through without checks in the event of a “no-deal” Brexit. The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to $0.7196 after local retail sales and trade data reinforced concerns about a slowing growth in Australia. At a meeting on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to keep interest rates on hold, though some market players now expect a cut later this year due to mounting signs of economic weakness. Oil prices were supported by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.4 to $54.76 a barrel. They hit 2 1/2-month high of $55.75 on Monday.
