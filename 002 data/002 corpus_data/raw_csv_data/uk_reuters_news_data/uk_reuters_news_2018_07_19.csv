Wall Street’s main equity indexes fell as investors also responded to a raft of corporate earnings and news the European Union may retaliate if United States slaps tariffs on EU cars. Chinese policymakers are pumping more liquidity into the financial system, and Beijing looks set to further loosen monetary conditions to mitigate threats to growth from a heated Sino-U.S. trade war. China’s yuan fell to a one-year low against the dollar. “Over the past month or two, you have had strength in equities that hasn’t been supported by what you have seen in commodities and what you have seen in bonds,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “With this headline from China, people’s eyes are opened a little bit...For today at least, it looks like stocks are taking their cue from commodities and bond yields.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 63.92 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,135.37, the S&P 500 lost 6.57 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,809.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.78 points, or 0.14 percent, to 7,843.67. Declines in eBay, Travelers and Philip Morris following their results weighed on indexes. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.36 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.23 percent, as shares of France’s Publicis tumbled after its report. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, hitting its lowest in more than 48-1/2 years, as the labor market continued to strengthen. In the wake of the U.S. data and news out of China, the dollar index rose 0.43 percent to 95.487, with the euro down 0.34 percent to $1.1599. Sterling dived below $1.30 for the first time in 10 months, sent lower by weak economic data, a resurgent dollar and uncertainty about how Britain’s approaching exit from the European Union will play out. The U.S. yield curve flattened, close to levels not seen in 11 years, as encouraging readings on jobs and business activity reinforced the view of further increases from the Federal Reserve. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.8564 percent, from 2.875 percent late on Wednesday. Copper prices plunged to one-year lows as fund selling accelerated due to worries about demand from the trade tussle between the United States and top consumer China. Copper lost 1.47 percent to $6,059.50 a tonne. Other metals such as zinc also fell. Oil prices rose after Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor said the kingdom’s crude exports will fall by about 100,000 barrels per day in August, overshadowing market pressure from a rising dollar and record high U.S. crude production. U.S. crude rose 1.53 percent to $69.81 per barrel and Brent was at $73.13, up 0.32 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones in London; Editing by

2018-07-19,"* Russia increased oil output by 100,000 bpd in June * Part of that came from storage - three sources * Russia has around 200,000 bpd storage capacity-sources, calculations * Saudi Arabia has spare capacity of 2 mln bpd * Russia, Saudi oil output graphic (Adds graphics, more comments from Transneft) By Olesya Astakhova and Gleb Gorodyankin MOSCOW, July 19 (Reuters) - Russia used stocks held in tanks at its oilfields to help boost crude production in June, three industry sources told Reuters, in a sign of supply flexibility as OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia pushes other major producers to increase spare output capacity. Russian oil production last month rose by around 100,000 barrels per day from May. From July 1-15, the country’s average oil output was 11.215 million bpd, an increase of 245,000 bpd from May, two industry sources said. Saudi Arabia increased its oil output by 458,000 bpd in June from May, pumping an average of 10.488 million bpd and selling even more, with some of that supply coming from storage, OPEC sources told Reuters. The difference between the two countries’ numbers lies in the scale and sustainability of the increase: thanks to the geological structure of Saudi fields, state-run producer Saudi Aramco can quickly add and cut supply. Such adjustments are harder to perform in Russia, where oilfields and production equipment in Siberia, for example, are beset by freezing temperatures. But the country does have some flexibility thanks to spare capacity in the Transneft pipeline system and in oil tanks at fields, sources say. Oil production “has restarted so quickly thanks to stocks in reservoirs (tanks) in western Siberia. They belong both to Transneft and to the oil companies,” a senior oil executive told Reuters. Another oilman and an industry source confirmed that Russian oil companies had boosted production partially thanks to their stocks. They did not say how much of June’s 100,000-bpd increase came from stocks. According to the sources and an analyst, Russia has around 200,000 bpd in spare capacity that can be used to stock oil. Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia agreed to ease global output cuts, adding around 1 million bpd to the market from July 1. Of that increase, Moscow promised to contribute 200,000 bpd. Under an agreement that took effect at the start of 2017, Russia’s initial cut was 300,000 bpd. In May, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was concerned about possible shortages of spare crude output capacity. “We certainly don’t feel we are where we need to be with complete market stability,” Falih said. Transneft’s system can hold around 16 million tonnes of stocks, equal to about 11 days of Russian crude production, according to the state-controlled pipeline monopoly. But much of that capacity is needed for pumping and mixing different types of crude, sources say, estimating that only a third can be used for stockpiling oil. Igor Dyomin, an adviser to Transneft’s president, said in emailed comments to Reuters that the company’s inventory capacity was not used for long-term oil storage. “The inventories capacity of Transneft is not used for long-term storage of oil, including from the oil companies. It is a part of the system which ensures the technological process of seamless oil and oil products transportation from the producers to the consumers,” he said. “For the past three years these volumes have been alternating insignificantly on a monthly basis and are not related to the production curbs within the deal with OPEC,” Dyomin said. Another two industry sources said Russian oil firms combined had storage facilities with a capacity of around 17 million tonnes located at their fields. These facilities house the mixture of mostly water and oil that producers extract from the ground. Given that many oilfields in western Siberia have significant water content, such storage can stockpile 3-4 million tonnes of pure crude oil, according to estimates by Mikhail Sheybe, an analyst with Sberbank CIB. This brings total spare capacity to as much as 10 million tonnes of oil, equal to 200,000 bpd. In June, Russian average oil output exceeded 11 million bpd for the first time since April 2017. Saudi Arabia, by its own estimates, has 2 million bpd of spare capacity that could be deployed to help compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran. One source said Russia’s oil storage was overloaded by the time Moscow negotiated an easing of global production cuts with Saudi Arabia and other crude-producing nations. “The covers (on tanks) had been torn off at many (oil production sites),” that source said. Not all of the increase in Russian supply came from storage, as oil companies were ramping up production following the easing of output curbs, the sources said. They did not provide a breakdown or identify the companies. According to analysts, top Russian oil producer Rosneft was believed to be able to restore 70,000 bpd of output in just two days. Gazprom Neft promised half of that. Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil producer, has increased output by 29,000 bpd, Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov said on Wednesday, thanks to what he said was the restart of previously suspended wells. Russia’s Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil and the Energy Ministry did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment. Additional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Vladimir Soldatkin and

2018-07-19,"(In July 18 item, in 4th paragraph corrects reference to barrels, not barrels per day for Serene Sea) By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, July 18 (Reuters) - An Aframax tanker is scheduled to deliver the largest shipment of crude oil from Vancouver to China since January 2015 later this month, Thomson Reuters trade flow data show. For years, Canadian officials have pushed for an escalation in crude exports to rapidly growing Asian markets, but companies in oil-rich Alberta have limited capacity to move crude to the nation’s western coastline. That makes Canadian crude exports from Vancouver to Asia rare, but shipments have picked up in recent months, with oil tankers to China, Thailand and South Korea departing in April and July. Most of the crude shipped from Vancouver - which has limited export capacity - is carried to the U.S. West Coast. The Serene Sea, an Aframax tanker carrying about 514,000 barrels, loaded at Kinder Morgan’s Westridge Marine Terminal in Vancouver and departed on July 4. The vessel is scheduled to arrive in Guangdong, a southern Chinese province, on July 26, bringing Canadian exports to China to 16,600 barrels per day (bpd) for the month. The voyage follows that of the Solomon Sea, which in April left Vancouver for ports in Thailand and South Korea. Another tanker, Diva, departed Vancouver for Zhejiang in eastern China the same month. They carried a combined 742,000 barrels to Asian buyers, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The Brent-WTI spread has narrowed and there’s less call for U.S.-based crude,” said Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group LLC. “There is an opportunity for Canada to send material to China, but I don’t think demand is going to be overwhelming.” In another rare Asian transaction earlier this month, the Shenlong Spirit carried 953,000 barrels from Alaska’s Petrostar refinery to China, the first U.S. oil export from Alaska to China since May 2017. Separately, two vessels loaded with 2.6 million barrels left Texas for Japan earlier this month, the biggest shipments since December. As U.S. oil companies fear Chinese tariffs on U.S. crude, and as Gulf Coast ports become more efficient at loading Very Large Crude Carriers, known as VLCCs, which can carry roughly 2 million barrels of oil, U.S. exports will “go into more and more markets in Asia,” said Olivier Jakob, head of Petromatrix.

He said the company’s hydrogen ambitions are at a research and development stage, but it was choosing the electrolysis production method as more environmentally friendly than a natural gas alternative. “Even though producing hydrogen from natural gas can be cheaper, we are a renewable energy company and injecting the CO2 would make it a costlier option,” he said.

2018-07-19,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2LwLCMl * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2JzsiMI By John Kemp LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Releasing crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in response to a rise in prices resulting from the reimposition of sanctions on Iran would be a mistake and ultimately self-defeating. The SPR has sufficient crude to offset any loss of exports from Iran for many months, especially if stock releases are combined with increased oil production by Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC. The statutes governing the operation of the SPR grant the U.S. president broad discretion to order a drawdown, and any order is unlikely to be constrained by Congress or the courts. But the SPR was established to deal with short-term interruptions of crude supplies and is not suited to managing long-term changes in the supply situation. In particular, if the purpose is to relieve upward pressure on prices, it would blunt the signal needed to help the market adapt to sanctions. If the SPR release succeeded in holding down prices, it would discourage the rise in production needed to replace lost Iranian barrels, while allowing rapid consumption growth to remain unchecked. Deploying the SPR to manage a loss of Iranian oil supplies would ultimately prove self-defeating, and deplete the reserve if pursued for any length of time. Like a buffer-stock management system, which can even out short-term shifts in supply and demand, but not enduring ones, the SPR is best employed to deal with short-term supply interruptions, not long-term changes. The United States is considering releasing crude stocks from the SPR, possibly in conjunction with its partners in the International Energy Agency (IEA), according to news reports, to prevent a sharp rise in oil prices. “The Trump administration is actively assessing whether to dip into the country’s emergency oil stocks while it simultaneously pushes other countries to boost output,” the Wall Street Journal reported on July 13. A drawdown is not imminent but being considered if increased output from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members fails to avert another sharp increase in prices, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The president has broad authority to order a drawdown in response to a “severe energy supply interruption” under the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (PL 94-163). The law authorises the president to direct a drawdown in response to an interruption in physical supplies (42 USC 6202) or a significant rise in prices that is likely to have a major adverse impact on the economy (42 USC 6241). While the decision is subject to conditions set out in the statute, they are written so vaguely that the president has almost complete flexibility. Congress and the courts have traditionally deferred to the president on national security, so it is unlikely either would constrain a drawdown order. Presidents have twice ordered emergency drawdowns, in response to the first U.S.-Iraq Gulf War (1991) and Hurricane Katrina (2005). And the White House has once ordered a non-emergency sale, in response to supply interruptions in Libya and other countries (2011), as part of coordinated action with other IEA member states. Other sales have been authorised to test the release process, or mandated by Congress for budgetary reasons (“History of SPR releases”, U.S. Department of Energy). The reserve has also swapped or loaned oil to refiners on a number of occasions to deal with short-term, location-specific shortfalls. If the administration determines that a release of crude from the SPR would be advantageous, for policy or political reasons, there is nothing to prevent the president from ordering it in the coming months. “The SPR’s formidable size ... makes it a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool of foreign policy,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s website. The reserve contains around 660 million barrels of crude, down from a peak of 727 million barrels in January 2010, mostly as a result of budget-related sales (tmsnrt.rs/2LwLCMl). Even so, the SPR holds enough crude to cover refiners’ net import requirements for more than 102 days, which provides a huge degree of supply security. Import cover has continued to climb in recent years, even as the number of barrels in storage has fallen slightly (tmsnrt.rs/2JzsiMI). Thanks to the shale revolution, U.S. oil production has risen, and net crude imports have fallen from almost 10.1 million barrels per day in 2006 to 6.8 million bpd in 2017. As a result, the SPR’s import cover has climbed from a recent low of just 59 days at the end of 2000 and 72 days at the end of 2006 to 106 days at the end of 2017. Some analysts argue the SPR now holds more barrels than is needed for national and economic security reasons (“DOE needs to strengthen its approach to planning the future of the emergency stockpile”, GAO, June 2018). In these circumstances, the president could easily direct the release of 30 million, 50 million or even 100 million barrels without compromising its ability to meet future supply shortages. Releasing 100 million barrels would be enough to offset the complete loss of Iranian exports for more than a month. Assuming some exports continued, Saudi Arabia boosted its own production, and SPR releases were matched by other IEA members, a drawdown could make up for the loss of Iranian barrels for many months. The SPR contains enough crude to enable the United States to enforce a total or partial oil blockade against Iran for at least six to 12 months, and perhaps longer, while trying to limit the rise in oil prices. In theory, the United States could try to cut off Iran’s oil exports, partially or completely, while ensuring global oil supplies remained unchanged. U.S. policymakers appear to be exploring this option, if recent briefings given to journalists are anything to go by. It is consistent with the president’s repeated public messages on Twitter and television calling on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production. It would facilitate the Trump administration’s policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran while trying to avoid an economically and politically damaging spike in prices. The administration is likely to be especially sensitive to the political fallout, with congressional elections due on Nov. 6. But the problem with employing the SPR to manipulate prices is that it will create growing distortion in the global market. Using the SPR to hold down prices at a point in the cycle when they need to rise to boost production and restrain consumption growth will ultimately add to volatility. Releasing the SPR might have some value as economic “shock and awe”, especially if the number of barrels offered for sale was large. However, like every other attempt to manipulate the market, employing the SPR to manage oil prices is unlikely to be successful in the medium term. It might have a short-term calming effect, allowing the administration to subject Iran to an intense economic siege for several months, in the hope Tehran buckles under the pressure. But the longer any SPR release is sustained, the more distorting it will become.

2018-07-19,"(Reuters) - Rogers Communications Inc (RCIb.TO) topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday as it drew greater numbers of subscribers into high-priced postpaid mobile phone contracts, but it stopped short of upgrading annual profit guidance. Canada’s largest wireless provider has been investing heavily in customer service and its various networks, leading to a net addition of 122,000 postpaid wireless subscribers, who pay for services monthly, during the quarter.  That was up from the 93,000 users it added at the same time last year and 95,000 in the previous quarter.  Several sector analysts, however, were taken aback that the company had not seen enough to raise its forecasts for this year and shares in the company fell 2.5 percent after opening in Toronto. “We were surprised that management did not raise guidance despite the strong year-to-date,” Phillip Huang of Barclays Capital Inc wrote in a note. Other analysts asked managers during an earnings call why the company was being conservative on its outlook given the results. The Toronto-based company said on average wireless customers paid 4 percent more per month in the quarter ended June 30. The postpaid churn rate - the pace at which subscribers leave - fell to its lowest in nine years at 1.01 percent. Efforts to improve services for customers has “reflected in reduced churn, reduced calls into our call center, along with the solid uptick in digital adoption,” chief executive Joseph Natale said on a call with analysts. An attempt by Peer Shaw Communications (SJRb.TO) to break into Canada’s mobile market by undercutting existing players on price has put pressure on Rogers, Telus Corp (T.TO) and BCE Inc (BCE.TO). Rogers said it invested C$240-million in its wireless business in the second quarter, up 52 per cent from the same time last year. For cable, it upped investment 24 percent to C$352 million. The company, which has been testing streaming device Ignite TV in Ontario in the face of competition from BCE’s upgraded fiber network, said the “soft-launch” had drawn positive reviews from customers in the second quarter. Natale said that Ignite TV was “just the beginning” of a connected home solution, that could remotely control everything from home security to lighting and temperature control. Rogers’ net income rose to C$538 million ($406.34 million), or C$1.04 per share, in the quarter, from C$528 million, or C$1.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to C$3.76 billion from C$3.62 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned C$1.07 per share, while analysts had on average expected C$1.05, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-07-19,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is nearing a deal to invest in 50Hertz to fend off China’s State Grid as an auction for a 20 percent stake in the German high-voltage energy network operator draws to a close, people close to the matter said.  State Grid last week made a final offer worth just below 1 billion euros (924.35 million) for a 20 percent stake in the company that Australian infrastructure fund IFM had put on the block, they said.  While no other suitor participated in the final round of bidding, German state bank KfW is still poised to pocket the stake due to the right of first refusal held by Belgian majority shareholder Elia (ELI.BR), they said.  Highly indebted Elia is expected to draw the right by a July 28 deadline and then sell the stake on to KfW, they added. “The deal is as good as done,” one of the people said. Germany’s economy ministry declined to comment, while State Grid and Elia were not immediately available for comment. A final decision is expected to be taken at Elia’s end-July board meeting, the people said.  “Germany views 50Hertz as part of its crucial infrastructure and has asked Chinese officials to understand this,” another source said, referring to high-level China-Germany meetings earlier this month.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed in Berlin the two countries’ economic ties, reiterating commitments to a multilateral global trade order. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, however, had said in June that he saw a problem in letting critical infrastructure fall into the hands of investors whose motivation and background were not clear, citing 50Hertz as an example. In March, Elia exercised its right to buy a first 20 percent stake in the network operator for 976 million euros ($1.13 billion), beating State Grid, which had already negotiated the planned purchase. Sources familiar with the situation said Elia lacked the financial firepower for a second large transaction. They added that KfW was likely eventually to hand the investment on to an investor deemed suitable.  German politicians have viewed State Grid’s interest in 50Hertz critically, amid fears that China was taking control of key technologies while protecting its own companies against foreign takeovers. IFM and Elia bought 50Hertz from Swedish utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL] in 2010 for 810 million euros, meaning IFM was able to sell a 20 percent stake at six times the amount it paid. 50Hertz operates a grid of some 10,000 km in northern and eastern Germany, supplying about 18 million people with electricity.

Asian shares had struggled following the moves and most of Europe was in the red as traders there banked some of the gains that had hoisted the STOXX 600, DAX and France’s CAC40 to one-month highs. Wall Street was also expected to ease off five-month highs , while Britain’s pound was below $1.30 for the first time in 10 months as mixed retail sales figures added to constant political turmoil and Wednesday’s weak inflation data. The yen at 113 per dollar, euro at $1.16 and most other European currencies were all weaker too. Instead of politics, though, they fell because they just couldn’t fend off the dollar’s latest charge. “Sentiment right now is still very much in favour of buying the dollar,” said Crédit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri. “It is positively correlated with risk appetite, and risk appetite remains supported by the U.S. earnings season, and there is a very strong notion among clients that there is further room for improvement.” That appetite had got its latest boost as S&P 500 rose to its highest in more than five months on Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed for a fifth session and the “FAANGs” group of big tech giants hit fresh all-time highs. Ongoing trade jitters and developments in China, however, made Asia a different picture. Sources told Reuters that China’s central bank plans to motivate banks to expand lending to companies, a proposal that points to another shot of stimulus. China’s foreign-exchange regulator, meanwhile, said it would keep currency markets stable amid intensifying trade frictions with the United States. The worries had pummeled the yuan to a one-year low of 6.7800 per dollar and 6.7427 in offshore and onshore trade. The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite stocks index shed 1.0 percent and Shanghai Composite index fell 0.6 percent to head back towards a 1 1/2-year low it had set earlier this month. “Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People’s Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.” She noted that although the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it reached during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015, when the central bank was seen intervening heavily. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC on Thursday that Donald Trump’s trade strategy with China was not as disruptive as many describe. “We got two economies that add up to around $30 trillion in annual GDP. The amount of trade we’re affecting with the tariffs is a rounding error compared to that,” he said during an interview at the White House. Investors remain unconvinced. Metals markets were also in the firing line again. China is the world’s biggest consumer of most industrial metals so worries about its economy can have a serious impact. Copper and nickel were both down over 2 percent on London’s metal exchange. Zinc was down more than 3 percent and lead down 2.5 percent. Oil and gold also dropped again. Gold hit another one-year low of $1,215 per ounce, while Brent and WTI U.S. crude futures were down 80 and 53 cents at $72.10 and $68.20 a barrel respectively. Brent has fallen almost 9 percent from last week’s high above $79 on emerging evidence of higher production from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and the United States. “The outlook remains negative,” said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. In fixed-income markets, expectation that the United States would continue to raise interest rates this year lifted its two-year bond yields, which move inversely to the bond’s price, to a new decade high. Italy’s short-dated yields tumbled to a one-month low with traders citing reports that the country’s new prime minister has said that its euro membership was irreversible. That helped ease worries caused anti-euro rhetoric during its recent election campaign. Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Tomo

2018-07-19,"OSLO (Reuters) - A U.S.-China trade dispute sent Norway’s REC Silicon (REC.OL), a supplier to the solar industry, plunging to a quarterly loss on Thursday, but the company’s shares rose after it indicated it would not need to issue new equity this year. REC Silicon’s shares initially slumped by 16 percent after the Oslo-listed firm reported a pre-tax loss of $374 million in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $60 million in the first quarter and a loss of $46 million a year ago. The company took an impairment charge of $340 million “due to the market disruption from the curtailment of solar incentives in China, as well as continued trade barriers that prevent access to primary markets inside China,” it said. However, the shares rose after Chief Financial Officer James May told an earnings presentation: “We have sufficient liquidity to maintain operations over the short-run, for at least the next 12 months, using fairly conservative assumptions.” Investor relations contact Nils Kjerstad told Reuters this meant that the company would not need to raise new capital. The shares were up 4.42 percent at 1045 GMT. Despite the company’s assurances, Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Jonas Meyer said he believed an equity increase this year remained a risk. “We believe the cash position of $42 million is very slim and there is a high risk for an equity issue in 2018,” he said. REC has two plants in the United States making polysilicon, the key ingredient in solar panels, but has been unable to export goods made there to China since 2014, when China imposed tariffs on U.S. polysilicon imports. It also has a joint venture in China. On July 2, REC warned it would have to cut 100 U.S. jobs and write down the value of assets, calling on Washington and Beijing to resolve a situation that has worsened since the United States imposed new tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels in January. “We need the U.S. and Chinese governments to cooperate in ending the solar trade dispute ... to prevent additional job losses and to enhance the value of the solar industry in the U.S. and China,” Chief Executive Tore Torvund said on Thursday. REC Silicon’s two U.S. plants are in Butte, Montana and Moses Lake, Washington. It has expanded the factories since acquiring them in the 2000s.  At the time, REC Silicon was part of REC Group, which also made solar panels and focused on the U.S. market.  The companies were split in 2013, with REC Silicon concentrating on becoming a supplier of polysilicon to solar-panel makers worldwide.

2018-07-19,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Alwyn Scott and Stanley Carvalho NEW YORK and ABU DHABI, July 19 (Reuters) - One of General Electric Co’s largest and most valuable customers, Saudi Arabia, is lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work, according to five people familiar with the situation. State-controlled Saudi Electricity Co (SEC) has qualified at least two companies - Power Systems Mfg LLC and Combustion Parts Inc - to provide service or parts for some of SEC’s more than 50 GE-made F-class turbines, and is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the SEC plants over many years, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The qualifications for the first time puts SEC in position to break GE’s hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the F-Class fleet - among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry - when the existing contracts come up, according to the sources and industry databases. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, has grown increasingly cost conscious, and under its “Vision 2030” reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence, lower state budget deficits and create jobs. The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies, according to a source with direct knowledge of SEC. The utility is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services, rather than relying on GE as the sole provider, because qualifying competitors will lower prices, the source said. Saudi Electricity Co previously created competition for an earlier-generation of turbines known as the E-class, according to the sources. After bidding began, GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40 percent, sources said. One side effect of Saudi Electricity Co qualifying third-party firms to repair its F-Class is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi Arabia, potentially threatening portions of GE’s service business globally, three sources said. For bidders, qualifying also provides inroads to selling to other utilities and even other industries because SEC is seen as technically sophisticated and other companies would rely on its qualification, one of the sources said. SEC declined to comment, as did Power Systems Manufacturing, a unit of Ansaldo Energia SpA of Genoa, Italy, and San Diego-based Combustion Parts Inc. In response to questions from Reuters, GE said: “At present, GE’s F-class units in SEC continue to be covered under long-term service agreements.” GE Chief Executive John Flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to GE’s power business, where profit fell 45 percent last year. The division, which makes equipment for gas, coal and nuclear power plants, is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants. As a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue, GE in May posted videos on YouTube saying it is offering high-tech upgrades to turbines made by rivals Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems. Saudi Electricity Co has not yet offered any substantial F-Class contracts to new bidders, and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids, the sources said. One source with knowledge of GE’s service history in Saudi Arabia said some F-Class turbines that SEC purchased more recently may not be under long-term agreements because the service price was high, and those could be opened for bidding by SEC at any time. In addition to PSM and CPI, two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on SEC’s F-Class plants: Chromalloy, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and Al Masaood John Brown, in Dubai. Both said they already work on SEC’s E-Class turbines. Al Masaood John Brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain F-Class components at its Dubai facility. It plans to present this to SEC as a way of “kick starting” the formal pre-qualification process, General Manager Brian Waddell said in an email. Chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on SEC’s F-Class turbines for the long term. “We’re definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with SEC on that,” said spokesman Jeff Romaine. “We’re looking at doing parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term,” he added. “That’s what SEC is asking us for.” Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York, Stephen Kalin in Saudi

2018-07-19,"(Repeats for addional clients with no changes to text) By Julia Symmes Cobb and Nelson Bocanegra ACACIAS, Colombia July 19 (Reuters) - Splattered with mud, a dozen workers wrestled a drill bit into position on a rain-soaked oil rig platform in central Colombia, readying it for work once the storm passed. The rig, at the Castilla oil field in the wide central plains of Meta province, is one of a fleet deployed by Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol under a $3.5-$4 billion investment plan this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has boosted its investment by more than $1 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier, to finance drilling 620 wells in 2018. Ecopetrol is targeting output of 725,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and gas equivalent by the end of the year, up from about 700,000 now, and the has set a more aggressive target of 870,000 bpd by 2020. Castilla, Ecopetrol’s most profitable oil field, is pumping about 115,000 bpd but should approach 125,000 by the end of next year, said Jose Cotello, vice-president for the Orinoquia region in eastern Colombia, which includes Castilla. The expansion would make it the country’s biggest producing field. It pumps heavy oil, which typically sells at a discount to lighter crude that is easier to refine. Right now, however, heavier crude is in demand among refineries worldwide because of a fall in output of similar oil from neighboring Venezuela, where lack of investment has pushed production to its lowest level in decades. Ecopetrol has earmarked $1.1 billion of the investment budget for the Orinoquia region, nearly double the year before, but had to halt drilling for a month because protests closed Castilla and other nearby fields in February. Protesters angered by Ecopetrol’s alleged violations of labor agreements have blocked roads, invaded fields and burned buildings, including a control room. The disruptions led to about $100 million in losses over a month and delayed the start of operations at five wells. “The big question is on drilling, because we were stopped for a month,” Cotello said in an interview after visiting the Castilla field. Nationwide, Ecopetrol will double the number of rigs in operation this year from last. It will operate 28 rigs in the second half of the year, and an additional 25 rigs in joint operations with partners. The number of rigs had dwindled since the oil price crash of 2014-2015. The company is equally focused on finding more oil that it can produce in the future, Cotello said. The reserves on the company’s books have dipped to the equivalent of about 7.1 years of production, according to Ecopetrol. The country’s energy ministry has a less optimistic estimate of 5.6 years. Both are well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies. Investors look at reserves as a gauge for the long-term sustainability of oil and gas firms. Ecopetrol needed a big boost in spending after several years of underinvestment, said an executive working for an international oil company working in a joint venture with Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol expects to quicken investment in the second half of the year after spending just $405.4 million of the total budget during the first quarter of 2018. The country’s presidential election slowed spending, because anti-corruption laws make it difficult for public companies to open bidding processes for contracts during the electoral process, Ecopetrol said. Colombia’s incoming President Ivan Duque will be inaugurated in August and has promised to help the energy industry. He has said he will invest in the state-run company’s refineries and crack down on militant groups that have attacked oil pipelines. He has also promised tax cuts across the economy, including for the energy industry, although has yet to disclose detailed proposals. Colombia has struggled to attract investment and maintain energy output as conflict, protests and attacks by criminal gangs have frequently interrupted operations. Pumping through the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline restarted last week after 180 days stoppage due to repeated attacks by Marxist ELN rebels, military and industry sources said on Tuesday. The 485-mile-long (780-km) pipeline has been attacked 58 times this year by the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group, according to military sources. Although the latest outage was one of the most extensive since the pipeline opened in the mid-1980s, activity in the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp and located in the northern Arauca province, has not been affected. The protests and attacks threaten to slow the momentum the company has gained since stabilizing its finances and reinvesting in production, said Jairo Lastra, investment manager at Lastra Capital Management, who previously worked at the money desk at Ecopetrol. This year’s expanded investment marks a big change for a company that cut drilling and shuttered an oil field when it lost more $1 billion in 2015, after oil prices crashed. The rise in crude prices to 3.5-year highs has given the company the cash it needs to rebuild. Profits rose by more than 300 percent year-on-year in 2017 to more than $2 billion. In the first quarter of this year, Ecopetrol’s profit topped $900 million, executives say. “The crisis is in the rear view mirror,” Cotello said.

2018-07-19,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco IPO-ARAM.SE said on Thursday it is looking to buy a strategic stake in Saudi petrochemical maker SABIC 2010.SE, a move that could boost the state oil giant’s market valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering. Aramco said in a statement that it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) to acquire the stake in SABIC via a private transaction. It has no plans to acquire any publicly held shares, it said. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the PIF, Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals (79.24 billion pounds). Reuters reported on Wednesday that Saudi Aramco had invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The size of the stake Aramco is interested in acquiring is not known. Aramco said it had been evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities, both local and global, in line with its strategy of rebalancing its portfolio by moving further into downstream, particularly the petrochemical sector. In a separate statement, the PIF said that talks on a sale were in the early stages. “There is a possibility that no agreement will be reached in relation to this potential transaction,” the PIF said. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer, possibly by next year. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract investors for the IPO.  Shares in SABIC, the largest listed company in the Gulf, were down by 0.3 percent at 0945 GMT on Thursday. Aramco invited the banks to pitch for a potential SABIC deal last month, the sources told Reuters on Wednesday, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities. The Aramco IPO is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil. Prince Mohammed has said the IPO will value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, although some analysts’ estimates are between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion. Preparations for the IPO, which may be the biggest in history, have slowed with some sources close to the process say the plans for a domestic and international listing might be pushed further into next year or even beyond. A final decision has yet to be made by Prince Mohammed, who oversees the kingdom’s economic and oil policies, the sources said. The complexity of the listing, legal worries and conflicting recommendations from different advisers have delayed decision-making, they added. “The decision (by Prince Mohammed) is pending,” said one of the sources familiar with the IPO process. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said last month it would be “nice” to see Aramco floated in 2019, adding the timing was not critical to the government. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand. The oil giant is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants. Aramco’s push into chemicals includes a mega-project it is building at home with SABIC. The $20 billion project would be to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage.

2018-07-19,"ROME, July 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From New Zealand to the United States and Kenya to Colombia, scientists are on a mission to fight global warming by making livestock less gassy. Livestock are responsible for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). According to calculations by some experts, this puts the livestock sector on par with transport. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says transport is responsible for 14 percent of emissions. Ruminants such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats produce nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide and methane, which is the most emitted gas and is released through belching. Scientists are working on ways to reduce those emissions, including by breeding animals that burp less, adjusting their diets so they produce less methane and planting trees in pastures. “We domesticated ruminants over 10,000 years ago and relatively little has changed. It’s time that got an upgrade,” said Elizabeth Latham, co-founder of Texas-based Bezoar Laboratories. Her company is working on a type of probiotic - helpful bacteria or yeasts in the digestive system - which has shown a 50 percent reduction of methane emissions in cattle during research. Although less prevalent than carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, methane is more potent because it traps 28 times more heat, according to a 2016 study by the Global Carbon Project, which groups climate researchers. Bezoar’s probiotic can be put in water or feed, and even sprinkled on grass, said Latham, who won a Unilever Young Entrepreneurs Award in 2017 for the patent-pending product. Thousands of miles away, New Zealand’s AgResearch has bred sheep to produce 10 percent less methane. “In a single sheep, a 10 percent drop maybe not so significant. But when there’s 19 million sheep in the country, it starts to make a huge impact,” said Suzanne Rowe, a geneticist at the government institute. The low-methane sheep are the result of a decade of research, and they are also leaner and grow more wool, she said. “The beauty of breeding the animal to be low methane… is it’s permanent,” Rowe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding the team is conducting similar research on cattle and deer. Agriculture accounts for nearly half of New  Zealand’s total greenhouse gas emissions, and transforming the sector is key to meeting the target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, Climate Change Minister James Shaw has said. Attempts to reduce methane emissions from livestock are not limited to the world’s most affluent nations. In India, a national programme to boost the milk production of cows and buffalos by improving their diet is also helping the environment, according to Rajesh Sharma, senior manager at the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). The NDDB uses software to assess the ideal diet for an animal, based on its physical profile and environment. Changes usually include adjusting the feed quantity and adding locally-available mineral supplements. The tailored diet means each animal produces 12 to 15 percent less methane, according to Sharma. Over the past five years, the programme has reached about 2.6 million of the nearly 300 million cows and buffalos recorded in India’s 2014 livestock census, he said. In Kenya, scientists are testing various local grasses to see if they improve the productivity of livestock, which would reduce the amount of emissions per kg of milk, meat or eggs. Cows are placed in respiration chambers where scientists measure the methane emissions from different feeds available in East Africa, said Lutz Merbold, senior scientist at the Mazingira Centre, a Nairobi-based research institution. Results are expected in mid-2019, according to Merbold, who hopes to persuade farmers to adjust feed practices by appealing to their concerns on climate change. “If you have a well-fed cow and drought hits you, it will probably survive longer than a less well-fed cow,” he said. Improvements in productivity alone could reduce up to 30 percent of methane emissions from livestock globally, said Anne Mottet, FAO’s livestock policy officer. Her department has developed a web application that allows farmers and researchers to calculate how changes in animal feed may affect emissions. Latin American ranchers are experimenting with silvopastoralism - planting trees in pastures where they absorb greenhouse gases and offset emissions, while restoring degraded soil and improving biodiversity. “They can be different types of trees - for timber, fruit trees, even trees that animals can eat,” said Jacobo Arango, a researcher at the Colombia-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. As consumers have become more environmentally conscious, ruminants have been vilified for their emissions, as well as the amount of land and water they require. Beef farming in particular has been heavily criticised, as it accounts for 41 percent of the livestock sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to FAO. In a March report, Greenpeace warned that a continued increase in the consumption of meat and dairy could undermine Paris Agreement targets to stop temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. The environmental group called for global meat and dairy production and consumption to be cut by half by 2050. Yet, campaigns to abandon meat sometimes ignore the reality of small-scale farmers in Asia, Africa and South America who depend on animals for their health and livelihoods, according to experts. Merbold, of the Mazingira Centre, said consumers in richer countries have the privilege of turning away from meat-heavy diets. “But if you’re living in certain regions in Africa, livestock provides you with essential nutrition you can’t get somewhere else,” he said. The animals are also used to transport water and plough land, as well as producing manure to fertilise crops, said FAO’s Mottet. What is needed is balance, she said. “We have countries that consume about 100 kg of meat (per person each year). In others, it’s about four.” (Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Jared Ferrie(Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, corruption and climate change.

2018-07-19,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir said he is ready to accept a peace deal to end a civil war and set up an inclusive new government. The deal being negotiated in Sudan would give the country five vice presidents and also covers security and power sharing. “The people of South Sudan are looking for peace and if that arrangement can bring about peace to the people of South Sudan, I am ready to take it,” said Kiir late on Wednesday at a swearing-in ceremony for his foreign minister. “People talk about exclusivity, nobody is to be left out of the government. I accept it,” he said. South Sudan erupted in conflict in 2013 because of a dispute between Kiir and his former vice president Riek Machar. Tens of thousands have been killed, a quarter of the population has fled their homes and the oil-dependent economy has been wrecked. A 2015 peace deal briefly halted the fighting but it fell apart after Machar returned to the capital the following year. The conflict has mostly been fought along ethnic lines, pitting Kiir’s dominant Dinka tribe and its rival, the ethnic Nuer of Machar. This week Kiir named Nhial Deng Nhial, ex presidential advisor and also his chief negotiator in the Khartoum talks as his new foreign minister, replacing Deng Alor.

2018-07-19,"* S&P 500 index at 5-month peak on solid U.S. earnings * China markets lag, yuan hits 1-year low on tariff issues * European shares seen flat to slightly softer * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed strong but metal markets buckled badly on Thursday, as signs that China was resorting to credit-fuelled stimulus again and trade jitters helped drive its currency to a one-year low. Asian shares had struggled following the moves and Europe’s bourses were also in the red as traders banked some of the recent gains that had hoisted the STOXX 600, the DAX and the CAC40 to 1-month highs. Britain’s Brexit-bruised pound was still suffering, falling below $1.30 for the first time in ten months, as stronger retail sales figures did little to repair the damage done by constant political turmoil and Wednesday’s weak inflation data. The yen at 113 per dollar, euro at $1.16 and most other European currencies were all weaker too. Instead of politics though they were just unable to fend off another advance from a dollar now near a 1-year high. “Sentiment right now is still very much in favour of buying the dollar,” said Crédit Agricole FX strategist Manuel Oliveri. “It is positively correlated with risk appetite and risk appetite remains supported by the U.S. earnings season and there is a very strong notion among clients that there is further room for improvement.” That appetite got its latest boost as S&P 500 rose to its highest in more than five months on Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed for a fifth session and the ‘FANGs’ group of big tech giants hit fresh all-time highs. Ongoing trade jitters and developments in China however meant Asia had been a different picture. China central bank plans to incentivise banks to expand lending to companies, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, a proposal that points to another shot of stimulus. China’s foreign-exchange regulator meanwhile said it would keep currency markets stable amid intensifying trade frictions with the United States. The worries had pummeled the yuan to a one-year low of 6.7800 per dollar and 6.7427 in offshore and onshore trade. The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite stocks index shed 1.0 percent and Shanghai Composite index fell 0.6 percent to head back towards a 1-1/2-year low it had set earlier this month. “Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People’s Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.” She noted that although the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it hit during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015 when the central bank was seen intervening heavily. Metals markets were also in the firing line again. China is the world’s biggest consumer of most industrial metals so worries about its economy can have a serious impact. Copper and nickel were both down over 2 percent on London’s metal exchange, while zinc was down more than 3 percent and lead shed 2.5 percent. Oil and gold also dropped again. Gold hit another one-year low of $1218.34 per ounce, while Brent and WTI U.S. crude futures were down 80 and 53 cents at $72.10 and $68.20 a barrel respectively. Brent has fallen almost 9 percent from last week’s high above $79 on emerging evidence of higher production from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as Russia and the United States. “The outlook remains negative,” said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.

2018-07-19,"TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Japanese imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in June fell to the lowest in more than two years as the country’s utilities switched on more nuclear reactors that had been shut in the wake of the Fukushima atomic disaster in 2011. Japan has six reactors operating and three others have passed safety inspections and could be operating by October, allowing utilities to switch away from LNG. Spot prices for the fuel LNG-AS rose to three-and-a-half-year high in June. Japan, the world’s biggest importer of LNG, brought in 5.55 million tonnes of the fuel in June, down more than 10 percent from a year earlier, official data showed on Wednesday. That was the lowest monthly import number since May 2016. Imports of thermal coal also fell in June, down 18.3 percent from a year earlier, and the lowest since May 2017, the data showed. The Fukushima disaster in March 2011 sparked the country’s worst energy crisis in the post-war period, forcing it to import huge amounts of LNG and driving prices to record highs. They also turned to cheaper coal imports. All of the country’s reactors were eventually shut down to be relicensed under new safety rules after the disaster highlighted regulatory and operator failings. Nine out of 40 commercially operable units have been relicensed under the new rules. One of the three not operating has been shut down by a court order that expires in September, while the other two are under regular maintenance and refuelling and due to start operating within weeks. Still, nuclear power remains unpopular in the country and many hurdles remain to getting more units operating beyond the nine approved, analysts have said.

2018-07-19,"* First ever LNG cargo to China via Northern Sea Route * Drastically cuts delivery time to Asian customers (Writes through, adds detail) MOSCOW, July 19 (Reuters) - Russian natural gas producer Novatek delivered on  Thursday the first ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo to China via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) alongside the Arctic coast, which drastically cuts delivery time to Asian consumers. The shipments of LNG from Yamal LNG project via the NSR to China cuts transportation time and costs in comparison to other routes such as Suez Canal. Novatek said a ceremony was held to commemorate the arrival of LNG tankers Vladimir Rusanov and Eduard Toll with cargo capacity over 170,000 cubic meters each to the Chinese port of Jiangsu Rudong. “Utilizing the Northern Sea Route as a viable transportation route contributes to the development of the northern regions and is very important for our country’s economic development,” Novatek’s head Leonid Mikhelson said in a statement. China’s National Energy Administration said China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) will start lifting at least 3 million tonnes of LNG from Yamal starting in 2019. The passageway is important for Yamal because it cuts shipping times to its main customers in Asia by nearly half - to 15 days - and thus saving time and Suez Canal fees incurred on the westward route. The $27 billion Yamal LNG plant developed by Novatek and France’s Total despite U.S. sanctions started exporting in December, but cargoes ferried on ice-class LNG tankers have only sailed to Europe so far. The NSR, which is crucial for Yamal LNG, typically opens for summer navigation from June until November but severe ice conditions this year have delayed the start of deliveries. From there, Yamal’s LNG was transferred on to standard tankers for onward shipment to Asia via the Suez Canal or else sold and used in Europe at a time when the NSR was shut. Novatek also plans to develop another large-scale project of producing the frozen gas - Arctic LNG 2, which is set to start producing LNG in 2022-2023. TASS news agency, citing Mikhelson, said Novatek was in talks with CNPC and the Silk Road Fund on participating in the Arctic LNG 2 project. Novatek hopes to complete the talks in the near future in order “to take an official investment decision on this project by the middle of 2019,” Mikhelson was quoted as saying. Total agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the Arctic gas project under a deal struck during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Russia in May. Novatek is interested in Saudi Aramco joining the Arctic LNG-2 plant as a partner, Mikhelson said in February, highlighting growing ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2018-07-19,"* Industry body gives detail on timing of potential import halt * Comes as U.S. demands nations stop taking oil cargoes from Iran * Shippers tell Japan refiners will not carry Iran oil -sources (Adds comment, detail, graphic) By Osamu Tsukimori TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Japanese oil refiners will likely stop loading Iranian crude by mid-September with final shipments arriving in the first half of October, the head of the nation’s oil refiners association said on Thursday, as the U.S. pressures countries to halt such imports. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has demanded nations cut all their imports of Iranian oil from November as it reimposes sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme. Although it has said that some allies who are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies may be granted waivers that would give them more time to wind down shipments. “Japanese oil refiners have been making preparations for lifting plans on the assumption that U.S. sanctions are to be applied,” the president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ), Takashi Tsukioka, said. “Considering that payment is to be finished by end of October, it is important that the refiners would finish loading (Iranian oil) before mid-September.” Tsukioka added that the industry is asking the Japanese government to push to maintain current levels of Iranian imports in talks with the United States. But a Japanese government source, who declined to be identified, said winning a waiver was seen as “difficult”. PAJ had said last month that Japanese refiners would likely stop importing from Iran, but on Thursday gave more details on potential timings. Many refiners in Japan, the world’s fourth-biggest oil importer, say they are resigned to completely halting imports from one of their historically important suppliers, unlike during a previous round of sanctions when they substantially reduced imports from the Middle Eastern country. Three industry sources familiar with the matter said shipping companies had told refiners in Japan that they would stop carrying oil cargoes from Iran. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. That would follow similar announcements by the world’s biggest shipping companies including A.P. Moller-Maersk of Denmark. Unlike Japan, China and some countries in Europe have significantly raised purchases following the lifting of previous sanctions. “It would be unreasonable for (Japanese refining) industry to be influenced similarly by such countries,” said Tsukioka, who also serves as chairman of Japan’s second-biggest refiner, Idemitsu Kosan. Japan’s largest banks had already said they would stop handling all Iran-related transactions to meet the November deadline set by Trump, Reuters reported last week. Japanese refiners are looking to secure alternative supplies from the Middle East and the U.S. among others, industry sources have said. Japan last year imported 172,216 barrels per day of Iranian crude, down 24.2 percent from a year earlier, with Iranian oil accounting for 5.3 percent of the nation’s total imports.

2018-07-19,"(Repeats July 18 story; no changes to text) By Julia Payne LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan’s Socar is refocusing its trading arm’s activities on LNG and its new Turkish refinery while winding down less profitable trades as it feels the sting of weak profits, sources familiar with the matter said. Many trading houses had weaker performances in 2017 due to a less lucrative, backwardated market structure for much of the year and relatively low volatility. Geneva-based Socar Trading also was stung, costing its chief executive Arzu Azimov his job. The firm was set up in 2007 and has become a global player in the last few years, having previously been only a marketer of its country’s crude, Azeri Light. Poaching top traders from established rivals, it moved into paper trading and third-party oil. At the end of May, executive chairman Adnan Ahmadzada was appointed and the CEO role was taken by Mariam Almaszade, formerly of trading firm Maddox. Last year the firm traded 1.54 million barrels per day of crude, of which about 1.06 million bpd was third-party, the company said. Combining crude and oil products, it traded 104 million tonnes. The firm closed its back office in Estonia’s capital Talinn last month and plans to exit fuel oil trading by the end of the year, one of the sources said. At least four traders in the heavy distillates division have left, including manager Pino Petricone, the sources said. Adding impetus is an upcoming change in shipping fuels. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will ban ships using fuel with a sulphur content higher than 0.5 percent, compared to 3.5 percent now, unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulphur emissions. The industry expects demand for fuel oil to plummet as few ships have such equipment. Socar has previously grappled with some over-stretches. The firm announced the closure of its Calgary office at the end of 2017 to focus on its Houston one instead. It also previously left middle distillates, such as diesel. For traders, liquefied natural gas is the flavour of the month. As the market slowly becomes more liquid, firms are rapidly expanding their LNG divisions and investing in infrastructure. Socar sold its first cargo of LNG in 2017 as part of its investment in an LNG-to-power project in Malta. It is studying several options in Africa and Asia and plans to increase its headcount in London, including with more LNG-focussed hires, one of the sources said. Looking forward, the firm may beef up products trading once more after its Star refinery in Turkey starts up, including a return to middle distillates depending on possible export volumes and how the market looks after the IMO change, they said. Socar is sending a cargo of Azeri Light and Russian Urals crude to start the commissioning of its new 200,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Turkey. The process is expected to be complete by the end of October and the plant will later run mainly on medium sour grades, namely Russian and Iraqi oil, one of the sources added.

2018-07-19,"* S&P 500 index at 5-month peak on solid U.S. earnings * China markets lag, yuan hits 1-year low on tariff issues * European shares seen flat to slightly softer By Tomo Uetake and Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares on Thursday struggled to hold earlier gains made after upbeat Wall Street earnings, as trade war jitters rattled China’s stock and currency markets, with the yuan hitting fresh one-year lows. The dollar was off a three-week high as investors cashed in on gains the currency made after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony reinforced a strong economic outlook but was underpinned by the relative U.S. economic strength. European shares are expected to open steady to slightly lower, with spread-betters seeing a flat open in Britain’s FTSE and a lower start of 0.1 to 0.2 percent in France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan last stood up less than 0.1 percent, giving up much of its earlier gains of 0.56 percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.13 percent. “At the moment, the markets seem to think that the U.S. economy is strong enough to weather the impact of trade frictions. The Chinese growth looks more vulnerable at least relatively speaking, given recent softness in Chinese data,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The Shanghai Composite index declined 0.6 percent, giving up about a half of its recovery from a 1-1/2-year low set earlier this month. The technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite shed 1.0 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.22 percent to hit a more than five-month high, while the Nasdaq Composite declined marginally by 0.01 percent. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to have increased 21.4 percent in the second quarter, up from an estimate of 20.7 percent on July 1. Of the 48 companies in the index that have reported so far, 87.5 percent posted earnings above analyst expectations. “While strong U.S. corporate earnings certainly helped boost sentiment...that’s not enough to push the stocks meaningfully higher from here,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. Wall Street was also supported by Powell reiterating that the U.S. economy was healthy, even though he warned that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to the global economic expansion. The Fed’s Beige book released on Wednesday also highlighted potential risks, saying manufacturers in every one of the central bank’s 12 districts expressed concern about the impact of tariffs, even as the U.S. economy continued to expand at a moderate to modest pace. “Trade war fears are something that won’t go away overnight. Investors need to be prepared for various possibilities, such as the United States versus China and the United States versus European Union,” said Libra’s Sakuma. Still, given an absence of hard economic data showing damage from the trade war, investors have been parking funds in U.S. assets, which has supported the dollar. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell in price to yield 2.875 percent, from 2.862 percent on Tuesday. The U.S. yield curve remained near its flattest in nearly 11 years. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies held near the top of its recent range, having hit a three-week high of 95.41 on Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar hit a 6-1/2 month high of 113.140 yen on Wednesday and last stood at 112.80 yen. The euro fetched $1.1644, having hit a two-week low of $1.1602 the previous day. Worries about the trade war between the United States and China pummeled the yuan, which hit one-year low of 6.7800 per dollar and 6.7427 in offshore and onshore trade. “Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People’s Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.” She noted that although the spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it hit during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015 when the central bank was seen intervening heavily. As the dollar broadly gains, spot gold dropped 0.4 percent in Asian trade, after falling to a one-year intra-day low of $1221.50 per ounce on Wednesday. Oil prices maintained gains after U.S. government data indicated bullish demand for gasoline and distillates, which overshadowed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories and U.S. crude oil production’s hitting 11 million barrels per day for the first time. U.S. crude last traded at $68.69 per barrel, down 0.1 percent in Asia after Wednesday’s 1.0 percent rise, while Brent was down 0.3 percent at $72.70.

Aramco said in a statement that it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund to acquire the stake in SABIC via a private transaction. It has no plans to acquire any publicly held shares, it said. In a separate statement, the PIF also said that talks about a sale were in early stages. “There is a possibility that no agreement will be reached in relation to this potential transaction,” it said. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Saudi Aramco had invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer, possibly by next year. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract investors for the IPO. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($102.7 billion). The Aramco IPO is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil. Aramco made the invitation for the SABIC deal to the banks last month, said the sources, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand. The oil giant is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants. Aramco’s push into chemicals also includes a mega project it is building at home with SABIC. The $20 billion project would build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage. $1 = 3.7503 riyals

2018-07-19,"ACACIAS, Colombia (Reuters) - Splattered with mud, a dozen workers wrestled a drill bit into position on a rain-soaked oil rig platform in central Colombia, readying it for work once the storm passed. The rig, at the Castilla oil field in the wide central plains of Meta province, is one of a fleet deployed by Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol ECO.CN under a $3.5-$4 billion investment plan this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has boosted its investment by more than $1 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier, to finance drilling 620 wells in 2018. Ecopetrol is targeting output of 725,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and gas equivalent by the end of the year, up from about 700,000 now, and the has set a more aggressive target of 870,000 bpd by 2020. Castilla, Ecopetrol’s most profitable oil field, is pumping about 115,000 bpd but should approach 125,000 by the end of next year, said Jose Cotello, vice-president for the Orinoquia region in eastern Colombia, which includes Castilla. The expansion would make it the country’s biggest producing field. It pumps heavy oil, which typically sells at a discount to lighter crude that is easier to refine.  Right now, however, heavier crude is in demand among refineries worldwide because of a fall in output of similar oil from neighbouring Venezuela, where lack of investment has pushed production to its lowest level in decades. Ecopetrol has earmarked $1.1 billion of the investment budget for the Orinoquia region, nearly double the year before, but had to halt drilling for a month because protests closed Castilla and other nearby fields in February. Protesters angered by Ecopetrol’s alleged violations of labour agreements have blocked roads, invaded fields and burnt buildings, including a control room. The disruptions led to about $100 million in losses over a month and delayed the start of operations at five wells. “The big question is on drilling, because we were stopped for a month,” Cotello said in an interview after visiting the Castilla field.  Nationwide, Ecopetrol will double the number of rigs in operation this year from last. It will operate 28 rigs in the second half of the year, and an additional 25 rigs in joint operations with partners. The number of rigs had dwindled since the oil price crash of 2014-2015. The company is equally focused on finding more oil that it can produce in the future, Cotello said. The reserves on the company’s books have dipped to the equivalent of about 7.1 years of production, according to Ecopetrol. The country’s energy ministry has a less optimistic estimate of 5.6 years. Both are well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies. Investors look at reserves as a gauge for the long-term sustainability of oil and gas firms. Ecopetrol needed a big boost in spending after several years of underinvestment, said an executive working for an international oil company working in a joint venture with Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol expects to quicken investment in the second half of the year after spending just $405.4 million of the total budget during the first quarter of 2018.  The country’s presidential election slowed spending, because anti-corruption laws make it difficult for public companies to open bidding processes for contracts during the electoral process, Ecopetrol said. Colombia’s incoming President Ivan Duque will be inaugurated in August and has promised to help the energy industry. He has said he will invest in the state-run company’s refineries and crack down on militant groups that have attacked oil pipelines. He has also promised tax cuts across the economy, including for the energy industry, although has yet to disclose detailed proposals. Colombia has struggled to attract investment and maintain energy output as conflict, protests and attacks by criminal gangs have frequently interrupted operations. Pumping through the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline restarted last week after 180 days stoppage due to repeated attacks by Marxist ELN rebels, military and industry sources said on Tuesday.     The 485-mile-long (780-km) pipeline has been attacked 58 times this year by the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group, according to military sources.      Although the latest outage was one of the most extensive since the pipeline opened in the mid-1980s, activity in the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) and located in the northern Arauca province, has not been affected. The protests and attacks threaten to slow the momentum the company has gained since stabilizing its finances and reinvesting in production, said Jairo Lastra, investment manager at Lastra Capital Management, who previously worked at the money desk at Ecopetrol. This year’s expanded investment marks a big change for a company that cut drilling and shuttered an oil field when it lost more $1 billion in 2015, after oil prices crashed.

2018-07-19,"NEW YORK and ABU DHABI (Reuters) - One of General Electric Co’s largest and most valuable customers, Saudi Arabia, is lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work, according to five people familiar with the situation. State-controlled Saudi Electricity Co (SEC) has qualified at least two companies - Power Systems Mfg LLC and Combustion Parts Inc - to provide service or parts for some of SEC’s more than 50 GE-made F-class turbines, and is in talks with two others over investments to set up facilities to service the SEC plants over many years, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The qualifications for the first time puts SEC in position to break GE’s hold on that work by having others bid against GE on maintaining the F-Class fleet - among the largest owned by a single entity and among the most lucrative service portfolios in the industry - when the existing contracts come up, according to the sources and industry databases.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, has grown increasingly cost conscious, and under its “Vision 2030” reform plan it aims to reduce oil dependence, lower state budget deficits and create jobs. The kingdom also wants to obtain the best possible prices on large contracts with big companies, according to a source with direct knowledge of SEC. The utility is in the process of getting other companies involved in bidding for power plant services, rather than relying on GE as the sole provider, because qualifying competitors will lower prices, the source said. Saudi Electricity Co previously created competition for an earlier-generation of turbines known as the E-class, according to the sources. After bidding began, GE ended up with less work and prices for the work fell by about 40 percent, sources said. One side effect of Saudi Electricity Co qualifying third-party firms to repair its F-Class is that it is large enough to enable competitors to set up operations that they could use to sell the parts and repair services to customers outside Saudi Arabia, potentially threatening portions of GE’s service business globally, three sources said. For bidders, qualifying also provides inroads to selling to other utilities and even other industries because SEC is seen as technically sophisticated and other companies would rely on its qualification, one of the sources said. SEC declined to comment, as did Power Systems Manufacturing, a unit of Ansaldo Energia SpA of Genoa, Italy, and San Diego-based Combustion Parts Inc. In response to questions from Reuters, GE said: “At present, GE’s F-class units in SEC continue to be covered under long-term service agreements.” GE Chief Executive John Flannery has said service revenue is important to restoring growth to GE’s power business, where profit fell 45 percent last year. The division, which makes equipment for gas, coal and nuclear power plants, is coping with a steep drop in orders for new plants. As a sign of its emphasis on increasing its own service revenue, GE in May posted videos on YouTube saying it is offering high-tech upgrades to turbines made by rivals Siemens AG and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems. Saudi Electricity Co has not yet offered any substantial F-Class contracts to new bidders, and it is unclear how soon it intends to seek bids, the sources said. One source with knowledge of GE’s service history in Saudi Arabia said some F-Class turbines that SEC purchased more recently may not be under long-term agreements because the service price was high, and those could be opened for bidding by SEC at any time. In addition to PSM and CPI, two other service companies said they are in talks to qualify to work on SEC’s F-Class plants: Chromalloy, based in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, and Al Masaood John Brown, in Dubai. Both said they already work on SEC’s E-Class turbines. Al Masaood John Brown shareholders have approved investment to enable it to repair certain F-Class components at its Dubai facility. It plans to present this to SEC as a way of “kick starting” the formal pre-qualification process, General Manager Brian Waddell said in an email. Chromalloy said it is considering a large investment to enable it to work on SEC’s F-Class turbines for the long term.  “We’re definitely willing to make that commitment and are in discussions with SEC on that,” said spokesman Jeff Romaine.  “We’re looking at doing parts repairs or manufacturing of parts for the long term,” he added. “That’s what SEC is asking us for.” Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York, Stephen Kalin in Saudi Arabia and Stanley Carvalho in Abu Dhabi; editing by Joe White and Edward Tobin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ge-saudi/exclusive-general-electrics-power-unit-faces-threat-in-saudi-arabia-idUKL1N1U119G,19 Jul 2018,"One of General

2018-07-19,"(Reuters) - As the trade war between China and the United States escalates, fewer vessels carrying U.S. liquefied natural gas have gone to China over the past two months. China, which purchased 14 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped between February 2016-April 2018, has taken delivery from just one vessel that left the United States in May and none in June compared with 14 during the first four months of the year. However, there are a number of reasons for the slowdown, including seasonal factors and rising Australian LNG production. An LNG official, who could not be named, with a Chinese state-run energy giant said the decline was seasonal. (For a graphic on U.S. LNG shipments to China, see tmsnrt.rs/2L6Zwsg) To be sure, one vessel that left the United States in July is on its way to China. There are three other tankers in the Pacific that left the United States in June or July without a destination listed; they could still end up in China. As the trade war between the two nations heated up, China threatened in June to put levies on U.S. energy exports, though it did not include LNG in that mix. China, which became the world’s second biggest LNG importer in 2017, is buying more gas as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to reduce pollution. The United States is expected to become the world’s third biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019.

2018-07-19,"NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners ran full-tilt in the second quarter, fueled by cheap domestic crude and fat margins that should boost earnings, though their heavy activity could eventually saturate the market with gasoline, sapping profits down the road. U.S. independent refiners, including Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp, are expected to announce strong results due to the heavy discounts for U.S. and Canadian crude, along with strong fuel demand and lower costs to comply with the nation’s biofuel laws, analysts said. Strong crack spreads - the margin on turning crude oil into diesel, gasoline and other products - have spurred refiners to keep production high. That margin CL321-1=R averaged about $21.07 per barrel in the second quarter, its highest since 2015. (For a graphic on daily crack spreads, see: tmsnrt.rs/2L5jSSB) Among the largest independent refiners, Marathon, CVR Energy , and Hollyfrontier Corp rank in the top 10 percent in Thomson Reuters analyst revisions models, which weighs recent changes in estimates for revenue and per-share earnings, suggesting positive trends headed into reporting season for refiners, which begins next week. The discount on crude prices in Midland, Texas widened by nearly $10 a barrel against benchmark futures WTC-WTM during the second quarter, as production in the Permian surged beyond pipeline capacity to move oil out of the region. Increased export demand also led to high utilization rates, a positive, said Sandeep Sayal, vice president in the refining and marketing group at IHS Markit. The United States exported about 5.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of products through the second quarter, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Refinery utilization rates hit their highest levels since 2005 in June as they processed record amounts of crude oil in June, according to the EIA. However, high utilization rates could lead to oversupply of gasoline in the coming months, which would dampen refiners’ future profit margins. “The next month or month-and-a-half, you might have some question marks around the gasoline market,” Justin Jenkins, lead refining analyst at Raymond James in Houston, said. The outlook is a tale of two stories, analysts said. Gasoline inventories have swelled amid high runs and tepid demand growth, which will hurt the margin for further processing of gasoline. However, stockpiles of distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, have sunk below four-year lows this summer amid surprising domestic demand and continued pull from Latin America. As the winter approaches, the traditional season for heating oil demand, that could again help refining margins. “It’s going to be a real tug of war: the higher price of diesel versus a weakening gasoline market,” Zachary Rogers, a refining analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said. Refiners have already begun switching yields to distillates to chase margins, despite being in the heart of the busy summer driving season, Rogers said. However, they can only alter their yield by a few percent, particularly because refiners are flush with light U.S. crude that produces gasoline-friendly naphtha, Rogers said. Refiners such as Delek US Holdings Inc and HollyFrontier, which source a majority of their crude from the Permian and are capable of processing mostly light, sweet crude, stand to benefit from cheap feedstock. U.S. gasoline days of supply stood at 24.40 days last week, just shy of the highest on record for this time of year, EIA data showed. Overall inventories are 4 percent above the historical average, data shows. Refiners may have to consider more dramatic measures such as refinery run cuts if gasoline inventory does not clear out. At the same time, U.S. distillate inventories are at their lowest seasonally since 2014 and about 20 percent below the same time last year. Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly

The dollar retreated from a three-week high as investors cashed in on gains the currency made after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s two-day testimony reinforced a strong economic outlook. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.32 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei and the Australian benchmark advanced 0.30 percent and 0.40 percent, respectively. Bucking the regional rally, the Shanghai Composite index declined 0.13 percent and the technology-heavy Shenzhen Composite shed 0.43 percent. “While strong U.S. corporate earnings certainly helped boost sentiments, but that’s not enough to push the stocks meaningfully higher from here,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.22 percent to hit a more than five-month high, while the Nasdaq Composite declined marginally by 0.01 percent. Stock markets were also supported by the Powell reiterating that the U.S. economy was healthy, even though he warned that rising world protectionism would over time pose a risk to the global economic expansion. In the foreign exchange market, worries about the trade war between the United States and China kept the offshore yuan at 6.7695 per dollar and its onshore counterpart at 6.7408, both hitting their lowest levels since July 2017. “Market players are looking at both the onshore and offshore exchange rate to determine whether or not the People’s Bank of China is intentionally allowing a weaker yuan,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank. “If the difference between the two markets becomes too big, that could mean the PBOC is intervening in the market.” She noted that although the current spread between offshore and onshore yuan had widened recently, it was still far from the levels it hit during the Chinese financial market shock in 2015 when the central bank was seen intervening heavily. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies , rose to a three-week high of 95.4 and against the yen, the dollar hit a 6-1/2 month high of 113.140 yen on Wednesday. In his two-day congressional testimony, the Fed’s Powell said he believed the United States was on course for years more of steady growth, and played down the risks to the U.S. economy of an escalating trade conflict. However, in the Fed’s Beige book released on Wednesday, manufacturers in every one of the central bank’s 12 districts expressed concern about the impact of tariffs, even as the U.S. economy continued to expand at a moderate to modest pace. “Trade war fears are something that won’t go away overnight.

A Reuters poll taken before the data release had forecast that gasoline stocks would be unchanged and distillate stockpiles would show a build of around 900,000 barrels. U.S. crude stocks rose by 5.8 million barrels last week, compared with a forecast of a decline of 3.6 million barrels. Oil production reached a record 11 million barrels per day, the EIA said. The United States has added nearly 1 million bpd in production since November, thanks to rapid increases in shale drilling. Oil markets have fallen over the last week as Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia increased production and as some supply disruptions eased.

2018-07-19,"WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department’s watchdog said in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday that it was investigating a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton. The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said that the agency’s inspector general had launched the probe on July 16 to look into a development deal in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, between a group funded by David Lesar, Halliburton’s chairman, and the foundation. Neither the inspector general’s office nor the Interior Department, which comments on behalf of Zinke, replied to requests for comment. Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said in an email that Lesar’s “personal investment in a small land development in Montana has nothing to do with Halliburton, and the company is confident that any actions of the Interior Department will not be influenced by (his) personal investment.” The deal, reported by Politico in June, included a hotel, retail shops and microbrewery. The brewery would be set aside for Zinke and his wife Lola to own and operate, Whitefish city planner said in the Politico story, though the developer said at the time that no final decision had been made. Politico reported that Zinke’s foundation, the Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation, had pledged in writing to allow the Lesar-backed developer to build a parking lot for its Peace Park project. Zinke’s wife Lola is president of the foundation, a position she took over from her husband when he became secretary. The letter, first reported by Politico, was addressed to U.S. Representatives Raul Grijalva, Donald McEachin and Jared Huffman, all Democrats, who had asked the inspector general to investigate if Zinke had used taxpayer resources to advance land developments. The letter said the investigation had been opened because the lawmakers “expressed special concern about the reported funding by a top executive at Halliburton and assuring decisions that affect the nation’s welfare are not compromised by individual self-enrichment.” Zinke has pushed for opening federal lands for energy development as the Trump administration pursues a policy of energy dominance to maximize production of crude, natural gas and coal. The Interior Department’s inspector general has also been investigating Zinke over travel issues since late last year after reports that he had used a private plane owned by an oil executive while secretary.

Australia’s largest listed oil and gas explorer said production for the quarter ended June 30 rose to 22.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), from 20.7 mmboe a year ago. Sales revenue for the quarter was $1.08 billion, compared with $867 million a year ago.
