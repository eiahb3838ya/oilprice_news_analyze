2018-07-10,"(New throughout, adds quotes, details, changes dateline) By Tom Polansek CHICAGO, July 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop giving crop data under embargo to media starting next month in an attempt to make the release of market-moving information more fair, officials said on Tuesday. The change means news organizations will gain access to reports on global grain supplies and demand at the same time as the general public. The USDA for years allowed media, including Reuters, early access to crop data but barred news outlets from publishing the data until a specified time. Providing the information under an “embargo” gave reporters time to analyze the data, which can roil grain prices, and prepare news reports. But the USDA said the system effectively gave a two-second head start to customers of media outlets because USDA takes longer to publish the data on its website than the news sites. After public inquiries, the agency determined this gave some media users a trading advantage. “The new procedures will level the playing field and make the issuance of the reports fair to everyone involved,” USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue said. Evidence suggested that trading activity worth millions of dollars occurred in the two seconds after monthly crop reports were released at 12 p.m. eastern (1700 GMT). “The inference is that private agents are paying the news agencies for faster data transmission to get a jump on the market,” the USDA said. The news media are allowed access to crop data about 90 minutes early in a room at USDA headquarters in Washington D.C., with their reports embargoed until noon. “The media has a legitimate interest in getting access to that data so they can disseminate it to the public,” said Kirsten Wegner, chief executive of Modern Markets Initiative, which represents high speed and algorithmic traders. “If they’re making it available to all media and not a select few, then there should not be a problem with it.” The last report available to the media under embargo is scheduled for release on Thursday.

2018-07-10,"(Rewrites throughout, adds comments from more company executives) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Marcy Nicholson CALGARY, July 10 (Reuters) - Executives at Canada’s largest integrated oil and gas producers on Tuesday downplayed the severity of transportation bottlenecks to move oil in the near term, citing existing pipeline commitments and refining capabilities. Canadian producers have faced steep discounts for western Canadian heavy crude this year due to bottlenecks, while new pipeline projects have dealt with delays and protests from environmental groups. Still, executives at Husky Energy Inc and Suncor Energy Inc said their existing pipeline commitments would help overcome constraints in the short-term. “Right now, 100 percent of our production, including all of the production from Fort Hills (Alberta), we have pipeline access to get to markets,” said Mark Little, chief operating officer for Suncor. Husky has excess oil pipeline capacity to the U.S. and has enough capacity locked in to ship crude until about 2021, Chief Executive Rob Peabody said, speaking on the sidelines of the TD Securities Calgary Energy Conference. The company, which aims to grow production by about 5 percent annually over the next five years, has about 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) committed on the existing Keystone pipeline and also has space on Enbridge Inc’s Mainline crude pipeline system, Peabody said. Most executives also expressed optimism over the completion of three main projects that are seen as crucial for Canadian producers to transport oil to the U.S. and Canada’s western port: Line 3 replacement, Trans Mountain, and Keystone XL. A Minnesota regulator late last month approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline, angering environmentalists. “We’re definitely seeing progress. The innate logic of replacing a pipeline that needs to be replaced is finally being seen by courts,” Peabody said, referring to Line 3. The Keystone XL pipeline project has been a lightning rod of controversy for a decade, hotly contested by environmentalists even though Canadian oil producers say it is desperately needed. On the Trans Mountain pipeline, Peabody was optimistic the line will be built. “Every time I see the prime minister, he assures me it’s going to be built, so I believe that it will happen,” he said. To be sure, some companies are more cautious, maximizing the use of every barrel. Imperial Oil Ltd is boosting its refineries’ capabilities to handle more heavy oil, Chief Executive Richard Kruger said. “The whole objective is to minimize the amount of barrels that are exposed to Alberta and the price discounts,” Kruger said. Cenovus Energy Inc is awaiting more clarity on market access before it restarts construction on two deferred projects that will have a combined starting capacity of 75,000 bpd, said Cenovus Executive Vice President Al Reid. Longer term, the companies stressed the need for more infrastructure to plan and invest in projects. Reporting by Marcy Nicholson and Devika Krishna Kumar in

2018-07-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, supported by a larger-than expected U.S. stock draw and supply concerns in Norway and Libya, though gains were tempered by the United States’ indication that it would consider requests for waivers from Iranian oil sanctions. Brent crude futures gained 79 cents to settle at $78.86 per barrel. Earlier, the global benchmark hit a session high of $79.51. U.S. crude futures rose 26 cents to settle at $74.11, after hitting a high of $74.70. U.S. crude inventories fell last week by 6.8 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. That decline was larger than expected, causing crude futures to gain in post-settlement trading. [API/S] Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that crude stocks fell on average by 4.5 million barrels, ahead of government data at  10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. [EIA/S]      Crude’s rise on Tuesday was fuelled in part by “positive macro spillover from strong global equities,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.  All three major stock indexes rose on Tuesday, and the S&P 500 posted its highest close since Feb. 1. Both crude benchmarks retreated from near four-year highs after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States would consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions on Iranian oil. “That basically took the wind out of the sails from the market,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “But it isn’t unlike anything that they’ve said before. But it all depends on which countries they’re talking about. Is it big buyers of Iranian crude? Is it India? ... Is it temporary waivers?”  Last month, the United States said it wanted to reduce oil exports of fifth-biggest producer Iran to zero by November.     Still, Brent was buoyed by a strike by hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs, leading to the shutdown of one Shell-operated oilfield.   Also bullish to prices was plummeting production in Libya, where output has halved in five months to 527,000 barrels per day. “Working in the opposite direction of the Norwegian oil workers strike and the geopolitical situation” was the update on the Syncrude oil sands facility, said Yawger at Mizuho.  On Monday, Suncor Energy said its 360,000-barrel-per-day Syncrude facility would resume some production in July, earlier than expected, following an outage last month that disrupted total output and sent U.S. prices higher. The updated timeline has muted U.S. price gains and widened the difference between the two benchmarks, said Yawger.  Meanwhile, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, have agreed to boost output. Still, there is concern that doing so will use up global spare capacity and leave markets vulnerable to further or unexpected production declines.

2018-07-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 stock index closed at a more than five-month high on Tuesday, boosted by expectations for strong earnings, while the U.S. dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen as waning trade war fears drove a bid for riskier assets. World equities markets remained near three-week highs, supported by the optimism on U.S. company earnings and expectations that global economic growth can withstand trade tensions. “The market is in a very optimistic mood. The economic data is very strong and the labour markets are strong, and companies are making a lot of money,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. PepsiCo shares surged more than 5 percent after the soft drinks maker reported quarterly results that topped estimates on strong sales of snacks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 143.07 points, or 0.58 percent, to 24,919.66, the S&P 500 gained 9.67 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,793.84, and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.00 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,759.20. The S&P’s close was its highest since Feb. 1. [nL4N1U64PB] Oil rose on supply concerns in Norway and Libya, though gains were tempered by the United States’ indication that it would consider requests for waivers from Iranian oil sanctions. The gains helped drive energy shares higher on Wall Street.  Brent crude, up almost 20 percent this year, was last at $78.82, or 0.96 percent higher on the day. U.S. crude rose 0.26 percent to $74.04 per barrel.  U.S. companies are expected to report second-quarter earnings growth of over 20 percent across all sectors when earnings season kicks off this week, thanks to recent tax cuts, high oil prices and robust economic growth. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.40 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.26 percent. U.S. Treasury yields hit session highs after a weak 3-year notes auction, which caused the yield to flatten further with the spread between U.S. Treasury 5-year and 30-year yields contracting to under 20 basis points. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.8692 percent, from 2.86 percent late on Monday. The risk-on sentiment nudged the U.S. dollar closer to a seven-week high against the yen. The greenback could be poised for a further boost if consumer price inflation figures come in higher than expected on Thursday. The dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro down 0.05 percent to $1.1743. Emerging market currencies like the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble also rose on global economic momentum. In Turkey, President Tayyip Erdogan’s new cabinet lacked market-friendly names and included instead his son-in-law as finance minister. The Turkish lira gained ground. The U.S. dollar was down 0.6 percent against the lira.

2018-07-10,"July 10 (Reuters) - The sale of a remote Canadian refinery has been scuttled as two former oil traders running the company locked horns over the value of the plant, according to three people familiar with the discussions. The partners, former traders Neal Shear and Kaushik Amin, sought to sell the 130,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Come By Chance, Newfoundland last year to privately held Canadian refiner Irving Oil, which was seen as the leading bidder. The deal fell apart in recent months and is unlikely to be rekindled because Shear and Amin are at odds over the sale price, according to three people familiar with the firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the events were private. Shear was ready to sell to Irving for an undisclosed value that two of the people said was about C$250 million ($191 million). Amin, however, was pushing for a C$400 million price tag, according to the people. Shear’s name has since been removed from the firm’s website, and talks with Irving have been put on hold. There are no longer any immediate plans to try to sell the plant, the people said. Gloria Warren-Slade, communications manager for the Come By Chance refinery, did not respond to a request for comment. Irving Oil did not respond to requests for comment. The refinery’s value has fluctuated widely over the last 12 years. It was sold for C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) in 2006 and re-sold for C$930 million three years later, but the two bought it in 2014 for just C$97 million due to a slump in world oil prices. Having paid less than any other buyer of the plant, Amin and Shear wanted to use Come By Chance as a linchpin for later purchases of other fuel shipping infrastructure globally, or to sell quickly at a profit. Come By Chance’s value for suitors is hampered by its isolated locale, reducing its access to cheap domestic crude that has boosted margins for Gulf Coast or Midwest refiners, and because it lacks the processing scale of larger refineries. The refinery’s relative proximity to Europe and shorter shipping time to eastern ports in Latin America is an advantage, but it has still been hurt by slimmer margins than other North American refiners.

Starting this month, American said drinks in its airport lounges will no longer come with plastic utensils and will instead feature biodegradable straws and wooden stir sticks. The phase-out onboard its planes will begin in November, with plastic straws and stirrers to be replaced by environmentally friendly bamboo. “We’re cognizant of our impact on the environment and we remain committed to doing our part to sustain the planet for future generations of travelers,” Jill Surdek, vice president of flight service, said in a statement.  The carrier will also transition to “eco-friendly” flatware in its lounges.  American said that the move will eliminate more than 71,000 pounds (32,200 kg) of plastic each year.  The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier joins rival Alaska Airlines, which announced in May its plans to replace plastic straws with more environmentally friendly alternatives.

2018-07-10,"CALGARY, Alberta, July 10 (Reuters) - The president of OPEC urged Canada on Tuesday to invest in infrastructure to move oil and gas, or risk watching investment flow away to the United States. The Canadian government agreed in May to buy the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and a related expansion project from Kinder Morgan Canada for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion), highlighting the lengths deemed necessary to overcome stiff opposition to such projects. Insufficient space in the country’s oil pipelines has deepened the discount Canada’s heavy crude can attract from U.S. refiners, compared with U.S. light oil futures. “If you don’t have the major infrastructure, investors are going to go to your neighbor, where infrastructure is not an issue,” said Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries President Suhail al-Mazrouei. “Act and act quickly if you want to retain those investors. I am being frank because I want to be a true friend to the Canadians.” “I don’t want them to lose opportunities.” Mazrouei was speaking in Calgary at a TD investor conference during the city’s Stampede, an annual rodeo that is also the year’s major meet and greet for Canada’s energy sector. Mazrouei, the United Arab Emirates’ energy minister, also singled out Canada’s low-priced natural gas. Much of it is produced in landlocked Alberta, and the country lacks a robust liquefied natural gas (LNG) export sector to consume it. LNG Canada, a proposed C$40 billion export facility for the British Columbia coast, is being reviewed by its joint venture partners ahead of a final investment decision. “The solution is LNG and pipelines to export that natural gas,” Mazrouei said. “If you provide optionality for the gas, it’s going to fix itself.” ($1 = 1.3120 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Rod Nickel and Devika Krishna Kumar in Calgary, Alberta; Editing by Peter Cooney)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec/opec-to-canada-build-pipelines-or-watch-investment-flow-south-idUKL1N1U61FM,10 Jul 2018,"The president of OPEC

2018-07-10,"(Adds quotes from CME and analysts) By Scott DiSavino July 10 (Reuters) - CME Group Inc said on Tuesday it will develop the first physically deliverable U.S. liquefied natural gas futures contract as growing worldwide demand has made the United States a key LNG exporter. CME said the contract will take delivery at Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana. It could not say when it will launch the new product or provide details other than that it will trade on the CME’s New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) like its Henry Hub natural gas futures. Overall world LNG consumption has risen to a record 39.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2017 from just 29.1 bcfd in 2010 and is expected to keep growing by about 3 percent a year through 2050, according to U.S. energy data. While LNG trade on exchanges like the CME is still small, experts believe volumes will increase rapidly in the near future as the United States becomes one of the world’s biggest LNG exporters. Total U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 10.1 bcfd of gas in 2020 from 3.8 bcfd now, making the country the third-biggest LNG exporter in the world by capacity in 2019. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. “We have spoken to the market and they have expressed a desire to have a physically delivered LNG contract that can help them manage price risks,” said Peter Keavey, global head of energy at CME. Pricing at Cheniere’s Sabine Pass is currently linked to the Henry Hub gas benchmark traded on CME’s NYMEX. Sabine Pass was the first terminal in the U.S. lower 48 states to produce and deliver super-cooled LNG for export to the world. Cheniere is the biggest buyer of gas in the United States, consuming over 3.1 bcfd, and is expected to increase purchases as more liquefaction trains at Sabine Pass and its Corpus Christi LNG export terminal enter service. The company’s current consumption represents almost 4 percent of total projected U.S. gas production of 81.3 bcfd in 2018. “With Cheniere behind the CME futures contract...the odds would favor the CME contract especially if Cheniere immediately starts to sell its LNG on a Sabine Pass contract basis,” said Dominick Chirichella, director risk management, trading and advisory services at EMI DTN in New York. The LNG market is in transition with a shift from long-term towards shorter-term contracts. Current users of LNG derivatives include big commodity trading houses like Trafigura, Vitol and Gunvor. “I would surmise that in say five years there will be robust derivatives markets in LNG,” said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor specializing in commodities at the University of Houston.

2018-07-10,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Brussels on Tuesday, where he plans meetings on the sidelines of the NATO summit aimed at stepping up pressure on Iran and reassuring allies about alternative oil supplies, a State Department official said. Pompeo flew from Abu Dhabi, where he discussed Iran with leaders of the United Arab Emirates. Senior State Department officials have also completed three days of talks on Iran in Saudi Arabia, and “discussed new ways to deprive the regime of revenues,” a State Department official told reporters traveling on Pompeo’s plane. “In our meeting with the Saudi energy minister, we discussed maintaining a well-stocked oil market to guard against volatility,” he said. “We discussed U.S. oil sanctions to deny Iran revenue to fight against terrorism. We talked about minimizing market disruptions and helping partners find alternatives to Iran oil.” At NATO, Pompeo would discuss Iran with ministers from Britain, France and Germany, and in other bilateral meetings, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said a meeting with political directors of the so-called E-3 countries of France, Germany and Britain, who signed an international agreement on Iran that the Trump administration has withdrawn from, would now be held in Brussels on Wednesday or Thursday. He said it was postponed for a couple of days due to scheduling issues. The United States pulled out of a multinational deal in May to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures, with no exemptions. Since Trump’s decision to withdraw from the agreement, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to maintain the nuclear curbs required in the deal. But so far it has proven difficult to offset the impact of continued U.S. sanctions, with European firms reluctant to risk far-reaching U.S. financial penalties to do business in Iran. “No matter how much people write about trans-Atlantic rifts, in the case of Iran we agree on much more than we disagree,” the U.S. official said. “The European nations are as frustrated as we are with Iran’s missile program, the missile attacks that they are facilitating.” Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by David Alexander; Editing by Cynthia Osterman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nato-usa-iran/update-1-pompeo-to-stress-need-to-boost-pressure-on-iran-on-nato-sidelines-idUKL1N1U61A7,10 Jul 2018,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike

2018-07-10,"(Adds demand forecast, details on production outlook) NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is expected to average more than 12 million barrels per day late next year for the first time ever, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Tuesday. U.S. oil production has soared, boosted by improved technology for tapping shale formations. Output rose 5.6 percent last year and is expected to grow 15.4 percent this year. If the forecasts are realized, that will make the United States the world’s largest crude producer, surpassing Russia. “Production growth in the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Russia will make up the majority of total global supply growth in 2019,” EIA Administrator Linda Capuano said in a statement after the report was released. The agency increased its 2019 average forecast by 40,000 bpd to 11.80 million bpd, and increased its forecast for the fourth quarter of that year by 50,000 bpd to 12.02 million. U.S. crude production this year is expected to be 10.79 million bpd, unchanged from last month’s forecast, according to the agency, which is the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. The EIA expects production to average 10.91 million bpd this quarter and 11.29 million in the fourth quarter. Total U.S. oil demand is expected to be 20.35 million bpd this year, 60,000 bpd less than previously forecast. At the same time, the agency increased its 2019 demand outlook by 10,000 bpd to 20.68 million bpd. If EIA’s forecast is realized, 2019 gasoline consumption would be the highest annual average on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2017, Capuano said.

2018-07-10,"COLOMBO, July 10 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan state-run fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) raised petrol and diesel prices at its fuel stations with effect from Tuesday midnight, the government said, days after it rejected a finance ministry demand for a price hike. Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said CPC will increase the price of diesel by 8.3 percent to 118 rupees ($0.7412) a litre and gasoline by around 5.8 percent to 145 rupees. The price rise followed a meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, government officials said. Top state officials told Reuters that Sirisena was not in favour of a price hike, though his media unit denied this. On Friday, the finance ministry, which has the authority to revise prices, raised the prices in line with a new price formula to stem losses at the CPC. However, hours after the finance ministry announcement, CPC asked its fuel stations to reverse the price hike. CPC gave no reason for its reversal. Lanka IOC, a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation, however, went ahead with the price hike with effect from Friday. CPC has about two thirds of the island nation’s retail fuel market, while Lanka IOC has the rest. CPC had been under pressure to raise prices since incurring a loss of 9.9 billion rupees ($64 million) in the first two months of the year due to rising oil prices. The government cut petrol prices in January 2015 after Sirisena was voted into office. It did not increase prices until May this year, fearing unpopularity among voters. Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost revenue, Sri Lanka increased excise duty on diesel by 10 rupees to 13 rupees per litre from August last year but asked fuel retailers not to pass on the cost to consumers.

2018-07-10,"ABUJA, July 10 (Reuters) - Nigerian lawmakers voted on Tuesday to investigate the state oil firm over a shortfall in revenue remittances to government coffers, in a motion passed by the lower house of parliament. Last month, Nigeria’s finance minister called the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s (NNPC’s) payments to the government account “unacceptable”, as they were less than expected in light of higher crude oil prices. Those publicly-raised concerns triggered Tuesday’s vote by the House of Representatives to probe NNPC, which noted an “under remittance of about 100 billion naira ($327.65 million).” The house resolved to establish an ad-hoc committee to investigate crude oil sales and other sources of funds to NNPC for May and June and is due to report back in two weeks. An NNPC spokesman told Reuters the company had not yet seen the house’s resolution to investigate so could not comment further. After Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun raised her concerns in June, the NNPC said in an emailed statement that its remittance to the government account was in line with terms agreed with state governors. Government revenues are collected centrally each month and distributed to the various levels of state including the federal government, state governments and local government councils.

2018-07-10,"RABAT, July 10 (Reuters) - North Africa-focused oil and gas company SDX Energy, expects its revenues from Morocco to quadruple in the next three years as it expands gas production, its CEO said. SDX Energy produces 6 million standard cubic feet (MMSCF) of gas a day in Morocco, piping supplies to industrial clients in the city of Kenitra and generating revenue of $12.4 million in 2017, according to its financial statements. It plans to raise that to 8-10 MMSCF a day by the end of this year, eventually increasing output to the pipeline’s full capacity of 24 MMSCF, CEO Paul Welch said. The company, which also operates in Egypt, has invested $30 million in a drilling project in Morocco that was concluded in May, with seven out of nine wells successful. “In Morocco we will see revenues increase by four times over the next three years,” Welch told Reuters by phone. “We (SDX Morocco) will likely start making small profits in 2019,” he said, adding that the company was more focused on growing its business than distributing cash to shareholders. “At the moment, we are focusing on investing in infrastructure to connect customers to our pipeline and increase production.” With no plans to invest in additional drilling in Morocco this year, SDX Energy will spend $6.5 million on a 3D seismic geological survey that aims to boost the chance of successful wells in the future, he said. The company is already providing gas to industrial clients in Kenitra, and sees growth potential in the city’s ceramic industry as well as a Peugeot plant and spare part manufacturers that supply it. SDX Energy sells biogenic gas that is “much more competitive than the fuel used by local industrials,” Welch said. The company has a 75 percent stake in the Lalla Mimouna, Sebou, Gharb Centre concessions. The Moroccan National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) holds the remaining 25 percent stake in the projects.

World share markets remained near three-week highs, supported by optimism about U.S. company earnings and the notion that global economic growth can withstand trade tensions. “The first major earnings report came out, and PepsiCo’s earnings beat expectations and that’s a good start for the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Energy shares were also lifted by oil prices, which rose due to growing supply outages as Norway shut one oilfield amid a worker strike and Libya said production fell by more than half in recent months. Brent crude - up almost 20 percent this year - was last at $78.71, up 0.82 percent on the day. U.S. crude rose 0.22 percent to $74.01 per barrel. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 128.19 points, or 0.52 percent, to 24,904.78, the S&P 500 gained 7.66 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,791.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.46 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,767.66. Second-quarter U.S. corporate results start in earnest this week and are expected to showcase earnings growth of over 20 percent across all sectors, thanks to recent tax cuts, high oil prices and robust economic growth. tmsnrt.rs/2MrffP3 The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.41 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.15 percent. Investors have not forgotten about the underlying potential for an escalated trade war after China and the United States slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods. Even so, no fresh salvos have since been fired. Most analysis suggests that trade measures are not going to have a big impact on global growth, said Thierry Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie Group Limited. “Even if the trade concerns were still there, (investors) would be confronting a better earnings outlook in 2018, so that’s another consideration that’s keeping risk appetite strong,” he said. German export figures and Chinese factory gate prices this week have also offered reassurance on economic momentum. The risk-on sentiment nudged the U.S. dollar toward a six-month high against the yen, with the greenback poised for a further boost if consumer price inflation figures come in higher than expected on Thursday. The dollar index rose 0.15 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.1728. In Britain, sterling has been pressured by fears that cabinet resignations could lead to rebellion in the ruling party’s ranks, toppling Prime Minister Theresa May or triggering fresh elections. While this looks unlikely, the uncertainty caused sterling to sink as low as $1.3225 before recovering. However, a Bank of England rate hike may also support the pound, with markets assigning a roughly 60 percent chance of a 25 basis-point rate hike in August. Politics dominated Turkey, where President Tayyip Erdogan’s new cabinet lacked market-friendly names and included instead his son-in-law as finance minister. Turkish five-year credit default swaps, used to insure against default or restructuring, rose more than 20 basis points, while the lira gave up initial gains that had helped to reverse some of Monday’s 3 percent fall.

2018-07-10,"OSLO (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, leading to the shutdown of one Shell-operated field and helping send Brent crude prices higher.  One union said hundreds more workers would join the strike on Sunday if an agreement over union demands for a wage increase and pension rights was not reached. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) said that due to the strike it was temporarily closing production at its Knarr field, which has a daily output of 23,900 barrels of mostly oil, but also natural gas liquids and natural gas. Shutting the field, whose owners are Idemitsu (5019.T), Wintershall [WINT.UL] and DEA, could take up to 36 hours, it said. Norway is Western Europe’s biggest oil producer. The disruption added to a rise in global oil supply outages and helped push Brent crude LCOc1 up 1.2 percent to $79.03 per barrel. The output of Norway’s biggest oil producer Equinor (EQNR.OL), formerly known as Statoil, was not affected so far, the company said, even though it was shutting drilling operations at its Snorre B platform. Shortly after a midnight deadline passed, a state-appointed mediator said talks between two trade unions, Safe and YS, and the Shipowners’ Association, representing the rig employers, had failed to reach a deal.  “The parties were so far apart from each other there was no point presenting a proposal that could be recommended to both sides,” mediator Carl Petter Martinsen said in a statement. The Safe union wants pension rights to be the same for everyone regardless of whether an employee is new to a company or has many years of experience.  It also wants wages for drilling workers to match those of workers for oil companies, which are higher.  The Norwegian Shipowners’ Association said Safe was asking for a 50,000 Norwegian crown (4,688.67 pounds)salary increase for unskilled workers, equivalent to about 8 percent of current wages.  The leader of Safe said she did not recognise the figures presented by the Shipowners’ Association. Around 670 workers would walk out from Tuesday, with an additional 901 employees joining them from midnight on Sunday if the dispute is not resolved, Safe said in letters to the Shipowners’ Association.  In total, up to 2,250 workers could join the action, it said.  Norway’s oil sector directly employed 50,700 workers in 2017, of whom 26,700 worked in production and 23,500 in related services, according to Statistics Norway. The rest were occupied in transportation through pipelines. It was the biggest strike affecting the sector since a 16-day industrial action in 2012 cut the country’s output of crude by about 13 percent and its natural gas production by about 4 percent. Talks between the two striking Norwegian unions and rig employers will not resume for a few days, the leader of Safe, Hilde-Marit Rysst, told Reuters. “We have no contact with the employers yet. It will take some days at least before we hear from them ... If they want to contact us they will probably reach out to us before the bigger strike on Sunday,” Rysst said. The Shipowners’ Association, representing the employers, said it was keen to resolve the situation. “We have no scheduled contacts as of now but we have every will to seek a solution,” Jakob Korsgaard, lead negotiator for the Shipowners’ Association, told Reuters. “The effect of a strike like this is substantial financially.” He did not specify whether the association would contact the unions before Sunday’s strike escalation. Industri Energi, the union which represents the majority of Norwegian oil drilling workers, concluded a wage deal earlier this year with the Shipowners’ Association and is not on strike. Safe said 106 workers from the Teekay (TK.N) Petrojarl production ship operating at Shell’s (RDSa.L) Knarr field would walk out initially. Norway pumped 1.97 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids a day in 2017, according to BP’s Statistical Review published in June. Natural gas production was 123 billion cubic metres last year, BP reported, making Norway the world’s seventh biggest producer and Europe’s largest gas supplier after Russia. Safe said workers on rigs that conduct exploration or production drilling for oil firms would also walk out on Tuesday. That includes 117 workers from the Transocean (RIGN.S) Spitsbergen rig; 80 from the Songa [SONG.UL] Offshore Enabler; 71 from Odfjell Drilling’s (ODLL.OL) Deepsea Stavanger; and 60 from North Atlantic Drilling’s West Elara rig. Others set to join the action include 40 Archer (ARCHER.OL) drilling workers on the Snorre B platform operated by Equinor; 67 from COSL (601808.SS) working on the COSL Innovator rig; 50 from Island Offshore, a supply vessel firm; and 59 from the KCA Deutag MODU drilling contractor working on the Askeladden rig. The employees that could walk out on Sunday work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem (SPMI.MI), Transocean, Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling, Archer  and COSL, among others. Some catering workers will also be striking, Safe said.

2018-07-10,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegians enjoyed the warmest May this year since records began in 1900, but as rainfall has been unusually low, the treat will cost them about 2 billion euros ($2.34 billion) in higher power bills, Norway’s energy regulator told Reuters. The unseasonable weather accelerated snow melt in the mountains, but some of the water soaked into the dry land or evaporated and did not end up in the reservoirs that feed Norway’s hydropower plants, raising electricity prices. The warmth was accompanied by 40 percent lower than normal rainfall this spring, but the thousands of happy Norwegians who flocked to sunbathe and swim now face payback in the form of higher electricity bills. “The total cost for power this year for households, which consume 80 terawatt hours (TWh) annually, will be 1.2 billion euros higher than last year,” Vegard Willumsen, section manager at Norway’s water resources and energy directorate (NVE), said. The added cost for Norway’s entire power consumption, including industry, corresponding to about 135 TWh in total, can be calculated in the same way, he added. That would bring the total extra cost for power usage alone to just over 2 billion euros. On top of that, households and industrial consumers must pay taxes and grid tariff costs. Power prices were on average 33 percent higher this year comparing to the second quarter of 2017, NVE said in a press release on Tuesday. A number of other factors contributed to the extra power cost for Norway, such as the price of coal, gas and CO2 emissions, which made power imports more expensive. As a result, on a household level, a typical consumer in Norway will see his annual bill rise by about 3,000 crowns ($373). NVE calculated the figure using power prices so far and its outlook for continued high prices in the future. The downturn in spring caused Norwegian power generation and net exports to fall by 3.5 TWh compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net exports totaled only 0.4 TWh, which is unusually low during the snow melt, said NVE. “Most of the snow has melted and we can expect less intake than usual in the future. However, the power supply in Norway is not threatened by the drought, since we have a lot of water to take off. We also have the ability to import power,” it said.

2018-07-10,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German chemicals group Evonik (EVKn.DE) has started the auction process for its methacrylates plastics unit, which makes clear acrylic sheets, people close to the matter said. The company announced plans in March to sell the business as it looks to focus on faster-growing sectors, such as feed additives and rubber silica for tyres. Evonik and its adviser Barclays have started sending out first information packages to prospective bidders for the unit, which is seen fetching around 2.5-3 billion euros ($2.9-$3.5 bln), the people said. Potential suitors are to receive detailed information after the summer, and first bids will be due several weeks after that, they added. Peers such as South Korea’s LG Chem (051910.KS) and SK Holdings (034730.KS), China’s Wanhua Chemical Group (600309.SS) and Saudi Arabia’s Sabic are being contacted about their potential interest, as well as U.S. chemicals firms LyondellBasell (LYB.N) and DowDuPont (DWDP.N), they added.  Separately, private equity investors with an interest in chemicals assets such as Advent, Carlyle, Blackstone and Apollo are seen as likely to participate in the auction, they added.  Evonik said its efforts to divest the business were on track but declined to provide further details. The potential suitors declined to comment or were not immediately available. The business up for sale posted 2017 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less than 400 million euros on 1.8 billion euros of sales from clear acrylic sheets and methacrylate chemicals, the people said.  “2017 was the top of the cycle and Evonik benefited from capacity outages at peers,” a person close to the matter said, adding overhead costs also needed to be taken into account when looking at the business on a standalone basis, while allowing for some synergies.  The people said bidders would likely offer 2 to 2.5 billion euros for the asset, including debt, or 7 to 8 times the unit’s expected adjusted core earnings, while the seller was hoping to bag up to 3.5 billion. Shares in Evonik, which is controlled by a state-backed foundation, lags peers such as BASF (BASFn.DE), Lanxess (LXSG.DE) and DSM (DSMN.AS) as a multiple of expected core earnings.

2018-07-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian vice president Eshaq Jahangiri acknowledged on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions would hurt the economy but promised to “sell as much oil as we can” and protect its banking system. Jahangiri said Washington was trying to stop Iran’s petrochemical, steel and copper exports, and to disrupt its ports and shipping services. “America seeks to reduce Iran’s oil sales, our vital source of income, to zero,” he said, according to Fars news agency. President Donald Trump said in May he would pull the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose U.S. sanctions. Washington later told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. Jahangiri said it would be a mistake to think the U.S. “economic war” against Iran will have no impact, but added: “We will make Americans understand this year that they cannot stop Iranian oil sales.” The U.S. ambassador to Berlin called on the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel to block an Iranian attempt to withdraw large sums of cash from bank accounts in Germany. Iran’s foreign ministry and the central bank have taken measures to facilitate banking operations despite the U.S. sanctions, Jahangiri said without elaborating. The Iranian oil ministry said last week that it exported 2.2 million barrels per day of crude oil in June. The figure is not significantly lower than exports of 2.4 million bpd in April and in May. European powers still support the 2015 deal, under which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear development in exchange for international sanctions relief. They say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran, though a number of firms have already said they plan to pull out. Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatory countries to the nuclear deal — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — offered a package of economic measures to Iran on Friday but Tehran said they did not go far enough. “We think the Europeans will act in a way to meet the Iranian demands, but we should wait and see,” Jahangiri said. The pressure on Iran came as Washington had launched an “economic war with China and even its allies”, he said, referring to trade tensions between the United States and many of its main trading partners. Jahangiri also accused Washington of trying to use the economic pressure to provoke street protests in Iran. A wave of anti-government demonstrations against economic hardship and alleged corruption engulfed cities across the country in late December and early January.

2018-07-10,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria has opened a new plasma melting plant that will treat and dispose of radioactive waste at its Kozloduy nuclear power plant, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said on Tuesday. The 31 million euros ($36 million) facility will significantly reduce the volume of low and intermediate-level radioactive waste from Kozloduy’s two Soviet-made 1,000 megawatt units as well as from the four smaller reactors that have been shut between 2002 and 2006. “In a breakthrough in the treatment and disposal of radioactive waste a plasma melting plant has started operations at the site of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria,” the EBRD, which manages the Kozloduy International Decommissioning Support Fund, said. The fund has provided 65 percent of the financing for the plant, with the rest coming from the Bulgarian government. The new technology allows for treatment of waste with a minimal risk of radioactive contamination. “As the final waste form is free from organics and liquids, it will meet strict quality and stability requirements for long-term storage or final disposal,” the EBRD said. The plasma plant, built by a joint venture of Spain’s Iberdrola and Belgium’s Belgoprocess, has a capacity  up to 250 tonnes per year, the EBRD said. It can also retreat historical radioactive waste, which can make the new technology potentially widely applicable beyond Kozloduy, it said. Last year, Bulgaria started the construction of a national depot for long-term radioactive waste that should become operational in 2021.

Wall Street was set for a firmer opening after enjoying its best session in a month on Monday, its gains filtering across Asia, where bourses from Hong Kong to Tokyo ended the day firmer . European shares also rose, with a pan-European equity index up 0.5 percent after touching a two-week high on Monday, while MSCI’s all-country index rose to a three-week high before easing to trade flat on the day. Markets clearly remain on edge over the possible escalation in trade wars after China and the United States slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods. While that raises fears of a global growth slowdown, no fresh salvos have since been fired. Markets also took heart from Friday’s U.S. jobs data that suggested the Federal Reserve might not tighten policy as aggressively as feared. And German export figures and Chinese factory gate prices this week have offered some reassurance on economic momentum. Above all, investors are pinning hopes on U.S. second-quarter corporate results, which start in earnest this week and are expected to showcase earnings growth of over 20 percent across all sectors, thanks to recent tax cuts, high oil prices and robust economic growth. tmsnrt.rs/2MrffP3 “Markets are anticipating a strong U.S. earnings season, led by energy, healthcare and tech,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. Futures for the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq were as much as 0.3 percent higher. They look set to extend Monday’s jump which was driven by bank shares before heavyweight lenders JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citi report earnings on July 13. With banks estimated to have enjoyed a $5 billion first-quarter tax-cut windfall, S&P’s banks index posted its sharpest rise since March 26 on Monday. However, the earnings season comes amid rising trade tension meaning analysts will scrutinise profit outlook statements to see whether to adjust earnings expectations for the rest of 2018. “I doubt the upcoming earning season will carry world markets to new highs. The numbers will be strong but equity markets are dominated by the outlook and we know the outlook is clouded by the trade issue,” Garnry added. Such fears showed up in the latest reading of Germany’s ZEW monthly survey, which showed investor sentiment at six-year lows despite recent upbeat economic data. In Britain, sterling is pressured by fears that cabinet resignations could lead to rebellion in the ruling party’s ranks, toppling Prime Minister Theresa May or triggering fresh elections. While this looks unlikely, the uncertainty saw sterling sink as low as $1.3225 before recovering slightly . “We anticipate elevated headline risks for sterling over the coming weeks,” analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia told clients, though they noted that sterling’s cheap “real” valuation — against trade partners’ currencies and adjusted for inflation — could cushion it against further sharp falls. A Bank of England rate hike may also support the pound, with markets assigning a roughly 60 percent chance of a 25 basis-point rate hike in August. The ZEW data undermined the euro, pushing it half a percent lower, while a dollar index rose off 3-1/2 week lows , to firm 0.4 percent. Politics also dominated Turkey, where President Tayyip Erdogan’s new cabinet lacked market-friendly names and included instead his son-in-law as finance minister. Turkish five-year credit default swaps (CDS), used to insure against default or restructuring, rose more than 20 bps, while the lira gave up initial gains that had seen it reverse some of Monday’s 3 percent fall. Meanwhile, Brent crude - up almost 20 percent this year - rose another $1 per barrel to over $79 as a Norwegian oil workers’ strike added to the picture of supply shortages following output disruptions in Canada and Libya.

Turnover stood at 142.7 million rupees ($896,357), its lowest since April 16, and less than a sixth of this year’s daily average of 909 million rupees. The Colombo stock index ended flat at 6,077.37, hardly changed from Monday’s close. “All this is due to the political uncertainty and no catalysts to move the market,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. “However, the good news is that lower turnover levels mean the sellers are not desperate to sell and the market is likely to recover soon.” The index hit its lowest close since March 30, 2017, on Wednesday and has declined for a 19th session in 22 through Monday. It dropped 1.4 percent for the week, sliding for a seventh straight week. Lower economic growth outlook has also hit sentiment after the central bank cut its estimate, analysts said. Economic growth in 2018 is likely to be between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, falling short of an earlier estimate of 5 percent, Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy told reporters on Friday, adding that the earlier estimate was “ambitious”.

2018-07-10,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2NFcNWQ By John Kemp LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have continued to boost their bullish exposure to U.S. crude futures and options, following a longer-than-expected disruption of pipeline deliveries from Canada. Position-building in U.S. crude, also known as WTI, accounted for almost all changes in the petroleum complex in the week to July 3. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 47 million barrels. Portfolio managers raised net their long position in U.S. crude (+41 million barrels) with minor increases in Brent (+4 million), U.S. gasoline (+4 million) and U.S. heating oil (+2 million). Net length in European gasoil was cut by 3 million barrels, according to an analysis of regulatory and exchange data (tmsnrt.rs/2NFcNWQ). WTI position-building is being driven by the draw down in inventories around Cushing and disruption of pipeline deliveries to the U.S. Midwest as a result of the stoppage in production at Canada’s Syncrude plant. But the rest of the petroleum complex, including the international benchmark Brent, has shown no significant changes in recent weeks. Funds’ net long position in WTI has surged by 116 million barrels in the two most recent weeks, while net length in Brent has been unchanged. Net length in WTI has closed the gap with Brent for the first time since June 2015, with managers holding a net long position of 457 million barrels in both benchmarks. Portfolio managers hold the most lopsided position in WTI since June 2014, when Islamic State fighters were racing across northern Iraq and threatening the country’s oilfields. Hedge fund long positions outnumber short positions in WTI by a ratio of almost 13:1, up from less than 6:1 two weeks ago. But away from WTI, there were no significant position changes. The fund community is running a substantial net long position across the petroleum complex, though it has been trimmed by light profit-taking since mid-April.

2018-07-10,"NEW DELHI, July 10 (Reuters) - India and South Korea signed 11 agreements on Tuesday to expand business ties and more than double mutual trade to $50 billion by 2030, a day after the premiers of the two countries launched a Samsung mobile phone factory near Delhi. Major South Korean companies including Samsung and Hyundai Motor Co are household names across India, one of the world’s fastest growing markets, and visiting South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he hoped that smaller companies from his country could replicate that success. “Going forward I hope that more Korean companies will invest in India so that the foundation for mutual prosperity can be further expanded,” Moon said after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the third day of his four-day visit. Bilateral trade between the world’s seventh and 11th largest economies rose by nearly a quarter to $20.8 billion in the 2017/18 fiscal year that ended in March, with $16.4 billion of that in favour of South Korea. The agreements signed between the countries included accelerating negotiations to upgrade a ‘comprehensive economic partnership agreement’ signed in 2009, as well as expand cooperation in railways, healthcare, telecommunications and cyber security. They also agreed to explore tripartite partnership for development in third countries, beginning with capacity building programmes in Afghanistan. India already has close ties with Afghanistan and is helping to rebuild the war-ravaged country. Moon and Modi on Monday formally opened a new Samsung factory on the outskirts of Delhi which the company called the world’s biggest mobile phone manufacturing plant. The plant’s inauguration comes at a time when Modi, who faces an election next year, is trying to create new jobs for millions of Indians who join the workforce every year. In an apparent endorsement of Modi’s electoral prospects, Moon said he would eagerly await the Indian leader’s visit to South Korea in 2020. Modi, in turn, credited Moon for South Korea’s peace breakthrough with North Korea and offered India’s support in taking that forward. (Reporting by Manoj Kumar Editing by Krishna N.

2018-07-10,"(Repeats earlier story with no changes) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - Brett Kavanaugh, nominated on Monday to be a Supreme Court justice by U.S. President Donald Trump, is a long-time skeptic of business regulations, especially on rules limiting harmful emissions, although he has called global warming an “urgent” issue. If confirmed by the Senate, the 53-year-old conservative judge, who is well known in Washington legal circles, could serve for decades and have a major say over environmental regulations issued by future presidents, long after Trump has left office. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, an environmental activist group, said Kavanaugh is “an extreme ideologue who has time and again proven himself hostile to common-sense environmental safeguards.” A judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2006, Kavanaugh often hears challenges to regulations brought by business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. In line with the views of White House Counsel Don McGahn, who led the Supreme Court nominee selection process, Kavanaugh has questioned environmental regulations issued by former Democratic President Barack Obama and the legal reach of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “The selection of Judge Kavanaugh shows that the Trump administration is serious about taming the administrative state,” said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Last year, Kavanaugh wrote a ruling that struck down a rule regulating hydrofluorocarbons used in spray cans and air conditioners. Scientists say they contribute to climate change. Hydrofluorocarbon manufacturers including Mexichem Fluor Inc, a unit of Mexichem SAB de CV and Arkema Inc, part of Arkema SA, were part of a coalition that challenged the regulation. “However much we might sympathize or agree with EPA’s policy objectives, EPA may act only within the boundaries of its statutory authority,” Kavanaugh wrote. Companies that supported the regulation, including Honeywell International Inc, last month filed court papers asking the Supreme Court to reinstate it. If Kavanaugh were confirmed as a Supreme Court justice and the hydrofluorocarbon case came to the court, he would be recused. No other major emissions case is clearly headed for the Supreme Court’s docket in its next term beginning in October, but Kavanaugh’s record could shape future cases. In 2012, he disagreed with the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold the Obama administration’s first efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The regulations were challenged by business groups and energy companies such as Alpha Natural Resources Inc, which went through a bankruptcy in 2015, and Massey Energy Co, later bought by Alpha. When the court refused to reconsider its ruling, Kavanaugh dissented, saying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had exceeded its authority in seeking to regulate carbon emissions under a specific EPA program. He stopped short of saying that agency could not regulate greenhouse gas emissions altogether, however. “The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important,” he wrote. The conservative Supreme Court majority in 2014 agreed with Kavanaugh on the point he raised in the case, although it upheld most of the Obama regulations. In another environmental case, Kavanaugh in 2014 criticized the Obama administration for not considering the costs of a rule limiting emissions of mercury and other hazardous pollutants, mainly from coal-fired power plants. Peabody Energy Corp, a major coal producer, was among companies opposing the regulation. “To be sure, EPA could conclude that the benefits outweigh the costs. But the problem here is that EPA did not even consider the costs,” Kavanaugh wrote. Again, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court later agreed, ruling in 2015 on a 5-4 vote that the Obama administration should have considered compliance costs.

2018-07-10,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE) is cutting costs to cope with a rise in fuel prices that led it to slash full year earnings forecasts last month, its chief executive told shareholders on Tuesday. “Major cost positions have risen more than initially expected and are pressuring operating margins,” CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said in Hamburg. “We are responding short-term to this development through forceful cost management and will keep Hapag-Lloyd competitive this way,” he added. Among the measures being taken are accepting more valuable cargo, trying to reduce terminal contract costs and stripping out economically inefficient ship systems, he said. The effects of recent industry mergers have yet to be felt as the integration process is only just starting, he added, referring to a merger in April of three Japanese rivals and Chinese approval for COSCO Shipping Holdings’ (601919.SS) takeover of Hong Kong peer Orient Overseas International. Habben Jansen made no mention, however, of a Reuters report on Monday that bigger French rival CAM CGM [CMACG.UL] had made a merger approach, which sent Hapag-Lloyd shares up to 10 percent higher. Hapag-Lloyd in June cut its full-year profit forecast, saying freight rates had recovered more slowly than expected, while fuel costs had ballooned as global oil prices respond to supply disruptions and tightness. The news led to several banks cutting their price targets on the stock, while the company stressed it hoped to reap substantial synergies from its 2017 merger with Arab peer UASC. Habben Jansen also said the global ship orderbook had shrunk to just 11 percent of the total fleet. That should help bring supply and demand into a better balance over the next 2 1/2 to three years, he said. At the same time, world shipping demand could rise 5.2 percent per year, which should result in freight rate increases  from the second half of 2018 onwards. But the CEO also said increased geopolitical uncertainty - as the world’s leading economies head for a full-blown trade war - was acutely felt by container liners and their customers. Hapag-Lloyd last month said it has stopped one of two feeder services to Iran and would decide on the remaining one before a Nov. 4 deadline imposed by the United States. The company’s shares were down 0.9 percent at 1035 GMT.

Currency markets are dominated by political turmoil in London where Prime Minister Theresa May’s foreign minister and Brexit negotiator both quit on Monday in protest at her plans to keep close trade ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc. The fear is that the resignations will lead to all-out rebellion in the ruling party’s ranks, toppling May or even triggering fresh elections.

Britain plans to build a new fleet of nuclear plants to replace ageing coal and nuclear reactors set to close in the 2020s as well as to help cut the country’s carbon emissions. However, private investors have proved reluctant to take on the huge costs of new nuclear plants, and the government has come under fire for agreeing to pay a price for electricity from EDF’s (EDF.PA) Hinkley Point C plant - due to come online by the end of 2025 - which is way above rival power projects. Last month, the government said it might invest directly in another new nuclear plant planned by a unit of Japan’s Hitachi. (6501.T) However, the National Infrastructure Commission said moving to an electricity system powered by renewable energy sources could be the “safest bet” in the long term and be the lowest cost outcome for consumers. According to its calculations, the cost of an electricity generation mix with a high quantity of renewables would be comparable to building further nuclear plants after Hinkley Point C and cheaper than implementing carbon capture and storage on fossil fuel plants.   Established in 2015, the commission is an independent body to provide advice to the government on how best to meet the country’s long-term infrastructure needs. In its first ever assessment for the government, which it is required to produce once every Parliament, the commission recommended steps should be taken to ensure renewables account for 50 percent of electricity generation by 2030. Currently, around 30 percent of Britain’s electricity comes from renewables such as wind and solar power, up from 12 percent five years ago. “An energy system based on low-cost renewables and the technologies required to balance them may prove cheaper than building further nuclear plants, as the cost of these technologies is far more likely to fall, and at a faster rate,” the commission said. “The National Infrastructure Assessment therefore cautions against a rush to agree government support for multiple new nuclear power stations, and proposes that after Hinkley Point C in Somerset the government should agree support for only one more nuclear plant before 2025,” it added. The government has up to a year to respond to the commission’s recommendations.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1 percent after earlier rising more than 0.5 percent. The index had gained 1.3 percent on Monday. The losses were led by China, with Shanghai blue chips off 0.4 percent. The index added 2.8 percent on Monday for the biggest daily jump since August 2016. Japan’s Nikkei climbed about 0.7 percent and South Korea 0.3 percent. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.1 percent while spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for Europe, with FTSE futures up 0.1 percent. Investors have been on edge recently with the United States and China slapping levies on each other’s exports, spurring fears of a global growth slowdown and hurting stocks and commodities. On Friday, both China and the United States slapped tit-for-tat tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods, stirring fears of a prolonged dispute. The row has rattled Chinese financial markets, with the yuan suffering its worst monthly loss on record in June. Despite the overhanging concerns about trade, market attention is expected to turn to other developments, at least for the near-term. “Many investors are looking ahead to second-quarter earnings season, which begins in earnest Friday...to see how the trade threat is affecting companies,” said James McGlew, Perth-based analyst at stockbroking firm Argonaut. Both the Dow and S&P 500 boasted their biggest gains in more than a month overnight, as bank shares jumped ahead of earnings reports later this week. The S&P banks index posted its sharpest rise since March 26. The story in currency markets was all about political capers in London. Prime Minister Theresa May’s foreign minister and Brexit negotiator quit on Monday in protest at her plans to keep close trade ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc, stirring rebellion in her party’s ranks. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stepped down just hours after Brexit minister David Davis’s resignation, emboldening some in her Conservative Party to mull a plot to unseat her. The uncertainty saw sterling sink as deep as $1.3189 at one stage before bouncing somewhat to $1.3254. It was last down 0.2 percent at $1.3230. Markets still think it likely the Bank of England will hike rates in August, and that a full-blown political crisis could be averted. “It’s a big splash with some ripples,” said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Sydney. “It’s a big event but the global ramifications are actually quite muted. We could see further resignations come through but I don’t think that will lead to a change in government,” Craig added. “What really is illustrated by this how difficult it is for a country to leave the EU, really setting a precedent for any country that is looking to isolate itself from the European Union.” The pound’s pain was a boon for the U.S. dollar which rallied broadly on expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising its interest rates. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar bounced to 94.201 from a low of 93.713. The dollar also edged up to 111.16 yen, from a trough of 110.30.

2018-07-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brett Kavanaugh, nominated on Monday to be a Supreme Court justice by U.S. President Donald Trump, is a long-time skeptic of business regulations, especially on rules limiting harmful emissions, although he has called global warming an “urgent” issue. If confirmed by the Senate, the 53-year-old conservative judge, who is well known in Washington legal circles, could serve for decades and have a major say over environmental regulations issued by future presidents, long after Trump has left office. Michael Brune, president of the Sierra Club, an environmental activist group, said Kavanaugh is “an extreme ideologue who has time and again proven himself hostile to common-sense environmental safeguards.” A judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2006, Kavanaugh often hears challenges to regulations brought by business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. In line with the views of White House Counsel Don McGahn, who led the Supreme Court nominee selection process, Kavanaugh has questioned environmental regulations issued by former Democratic President Barack Obama and the legal reach of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “The selection of Judge Kavanaugh shows that the Trump administration is serious about taming the administrative state,” said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Last year, Kavanaugh wrote a ruling that struck down a rule regulating hydrofluorocarbons used in spray cans and air conditioners. Scientists say they contribute to climate change. Hydrofluorocarbon manufacturers including Mexichem Fluor Inc, a unit of Mexichem SAB de CV (MEXCHEM.MX) and Arkema Inc, part of Arkema SA (AKE.PA), were part of a coalition that challenged the regulation. “However much we might sympathize or agree with EPA’s policy objectives, EPA may act only within the boundaries of its statutory authority,” Kavanaugh wrote. Companies that supported the regulation, including Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), last month filed court papers asking the Supreme Court to reinstate it. If Kavanaugh were confirmed as a Supreme Court justice and the hydrofluorocarbon case came to the court, he would be recused. No other major emissions case is clearly headed for the Supreme Court’s docket in its next term beginning in October, but Kavanaugh’s record could shape future cases. In 2012, he disagreed with the Court of Appeals’ decision to uphold the Obama administration’s first efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The regulations were challenged by business groups and energy companies such as Alpha Natural Resources Inc APNR.PK, which went through a bankruptcy in 2015, and Massey Energy Co, later bought by Alpha. When the court refused to reconsider its ruling, Kavanaugh dissented, saying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had exceeded its authority in seeking to regulate carbon emissions under a specific EPA program. He stopped short of saying that agency could not regulate greenhouse gas emissions altogether, however. “The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important,” he wrote. The conservative Supreme Court majority in 2014 agreed with Kavanaugh on the point he raised in the case, although it upheld most of the Obama regulations. In another environmental case, Kavanaugh in 2014 criticized the Obama administration for not considering the costs of a rule limiting emissions of mercury and other hazardous pollutants, mainly from coal-fired power plants. Peabody Energy Corp (BTU.N), a major coal producer, was among companies opposing the regulation. “To be sure, EPA could conclude that the benefits outweigh the costs. But the problem here is that EPA did not even consider the costs,” Kavanaugh wrote. Again, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court later agreed, ruling in 2015 on a 5-4 vote that the Obama administration should have considered compliance costs.

2018-07-10,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The president of OPEC defended the oil producer group on Monday against U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent demands for higher oil output, saying OPEC does not shoulder the blame. “OPEC alone cannot be blamed for all the problems that are happening in the oil industry, but at the same time we were responsive in terms of the measures we took in our latest meeting in June,” Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries President Suhail al-Mazrouei told Reuters in an interview in Calgary, Alberta. “I feel OPEC is doing its part.” Trump has accused OPEC in recent weeks of driving gasoline prices higher and stepped up pressure on U.S. ally Saudi Arabia to raise supplies to compensate for lower exports from Iran. Washington has warned that it will impose sanctions on foreign companies that do business with Iran, in an effort to cut Iran’s exports of crude oil and condensates to zero from over 2 million barrels per day. Mazrouei said OPEC was willing to listen to major oil-producing countries, including the United States. OPEC agreed in June on a modest increase in oil production starting in July after its leader, Saudi Arabia, persuaded arch-rival Iran to cooperate, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs. Global oil prices LCOc1 have climbed steadily this year, helped by rising demand, and topped $80 per barrel in May for the first time in 3-1/2 years.  Mazrouei, who also serves as energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, said OPEC member crude producers had enough capacity to handle any unforeseen global supply disruptions. OPEC is seeking a balance between supply and demand, not targeting a crude price, he said. The UAE alone has 400,000 to 600,000 barrels per day of additional capacity, he said. Mazrouei said he did not anticipate needing to call any extraordinary meeting of OPEC member countries before a scheduled meeting in December. The OPEC president is in Canada during its annual Calgary Stampede, a rodeo that serves as the year’s biggest oil-industry networking party. Mazrouei is scheduled to speak on Wednesday to a business group that promotes stronger trade ties between Canada and the UAE.

2018-07-10,"TOKYO, July 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday on escalating concerns about potential supply shortages, with Brent crude leading the way as hundreds of oil workers in Norway are set to strike later in the day after failed wage talks. Brent crude had added 25 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $78.32 per barrel by 0056 GMT, following a 1.2-percent climb on Monday. U.S. light crude futures were up by 17 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $74.02. They gained 5 cents to settle at $73.85 a barrel the session before. Hundreds of workers on Norwegian oil and gas offshore rigs are due to on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, a move which will likely affect the production of at least one field, Shell’s Knarr. That potentially adds to disruptions in other oil producing regions amid tensions in the Middle East. The United States says it wants to reduce oil exports from Iran, the world’s fifth-biggest producer, to zero by November, which would oblige other big producers to pump more. Saudi Arabia, fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia agreed last month to increase output to dampen price gains and offset global production losses in countries including Libya. The market has grown concerned that if the Saudis offset the losses from Iran, that will use up global spare capacity and leave markets more vulnerable to further or unexpected production declines. Libya’s national oil production fell to 527,000 barrels per day from a high of 1.28 million bpd in February following recent oil port closures, the head of the National Oil Corporation said in a statement on Monday. In Canada, an outage at the 360,000-barrel per day (bpd) Syncrude oil sands facility has reduced flows into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. futures. Money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude in the week to July 3, the U.S. Commodity Trading Commission said on Monday.

2018-07-10,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has jailed hundreds of officials for failing to tackle environmental violations uncovered during inspections last year, the environment ministry said in the latest round of the “war on pollution” led by President Xi Jinping.        A total of 4,305 officials in 10 provinces and regions had been held to account for failing to rectify violations, with some of them facing fines and even jail time, the ministry said late on Monday. Beginning at the end of May, central government inspectors started re-examining thousands of violations uncovered during the nationwide environmental audit, and found that many of the problems had not been properly resolved.  They have already accused local governments and state-owned enterprises across the country of conducting “perfunctory” or even “fraudulent” rectifications.     Total fines of 510 million yuan ($77.13 million) had already been issued in the 10 regions, which include the two biggest steel producing provinces of Hebei and Jiangsu, as well as Yunnan and Ningxia in the far west and Guangdong in the southeast, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said. This round of inspections involved a total of 28,076 violations. The ministry said 464 officials had been subject to administrative or criminal detention.
