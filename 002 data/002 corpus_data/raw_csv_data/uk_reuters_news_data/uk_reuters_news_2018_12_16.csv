2018-12-16,"(Reuters) - EQT Corp’s board of directors will ask to meet Toby and Derek Rice for talks, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday, after the two brothers threatened the largest producer of natural gas in the United States with a board challenge. The Rice family sold its company Rice Energy Inc to EQT for $6.7 billion in cash and stock last year. It now owns about 2.75 percent of EQT, and Toby and Derek Rice wrote a letter last week to EQT’s board asking for a “course correction”.  The brothers have also warned EQT that they will nominate their own directors to its board at its next annual shareholder meeting in 2019 if a “mutually agreeable outcome” is not reached. EQT Chairman Jim Rohr and Chief Executive Rob McNally plan to write to the Rice brothers to ask them to discuss their plans for the company in more detail with the board, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. EQT declined to comment, while a spokesman for the Rice brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Rice brothers said in their letter last week that they had previously engaged in private discussions with Rohr and McNally to discuss their proposals, which included “inserting Toby Rice into the organization with proper authority and support to oversee operations.” They said they were going public with their demands because of what they called EQT’s lack of reciprocal engagement, as well as its pushing forward with establishing its 2019 operational plan. It is not clear how the Rice brothers will respond to EQT’s offer, and what outcome any new talks may produce. EQT shares have lost more than 45 percent of their value since the company’s acquisition of Rice Energy in November 2017, much worse than the 8 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Energy index in the same period. The Rice brothers have said they have a “proven, detailed business plan” to generate an incremental $400 million to $600 million of pre-tax free cash flow per year above EQT’s current plans, resulting in more than $1 billion of free cash flow annually. EQT, which has a market capitalization of $4.9 billion, is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin. It has operations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.

2018-12-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state-run oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos will focus on existing shallow water assets and refining next year at the expense of riskier, deepwater projects under a new government that has vowed to turn around the ailing company. The 2019 budget blueprint presented on Saturday by officials of leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador calls for some $23 billion (465 billion pesos) in discretionary spending for the company known as Pemex, up about 14 percent from this year. Almost half the Pemex budget is earmarked for exploration and production, mostly in shallow water and some onshore areas. Setting out his plans on Saturday, Pemex Chief Executive Octavio Romero said two previous governments had little to show for putting 41 percent of exploration funding into deep waters: “At best we’d have the first drop of oil by 2025,” he said. Mexican crude output has fallen for 14 straight years. Pemex aims to increase production by almost 50 percent by the end of the six-year term of Lopez Obrador, who wants to reduce Mexico’s dependence on imported fuels. To that end, the budget projects Pemex spending almost $2.5 billion on an oil refinery Lopez Obrador is building at the southern Gulf coast port of Dos Bocas. The facility aims to be able to process 340,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude. “Pemex’s E&P unit and refining will total 98 percent of all capital expenditures. All other subsidiaries will get scraps,” said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. Another $245 million in funding is planned for upgrades to Pemex’s six existing domestic refineries. The plan cuts funding for units focused on fertilizers, ethylene, drilling services and its corporate offices. The budget also provides for about $6.2 billion in so-called non-discretionary spending to cover costs like debt servicing. Pemex has financial debts of some $106 billion, among other hefty obligations, fuelling concern over its credit rating. Pemex is government-owned and the senior management is hand-picked by the president, including the chief executive and the chairman of the board, who is also the energy minister. Monroy identified two planned exploration and production outlays as “potential headaches” due to their complexity and cost: Chicontepec, a tight oil onshore project, and Lakach, a mostly natural gas deepwater scheme budgeted for $673 million.     Lopez Obrador firmly opposed the 2013 constitutional overhaul championed by his predecessor, who ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly and allowed foreign and private producers to bid on developing oil and gas projects for the first time. The shakeup also allowed Pemex to form joint ventures, a common practice in the industry aimed at sharing risks and rewards that Lopez Obrador has yet to embrace - or reject. Earlier this month, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said two onshore auctions scheduled for February would be cancelled. Mexico’s oil regulator later said auctions due at the same time for the right to partner with Pemex on seven onshore contracts had been postponed until next October. In the past three years, Pemex has inked three joint ventures, including one with Australia’s BHP Billiton for the deepwater Trion project. While Pemex cedes control on these projects, it attracts significant investment from partners without having to pledge much of its own funding during the initial phase. Lopez Obrador will need to authorize more Pemex joint ventures, also known as farm-outs, to reach his goal of boosting crude output to 2.6 million bpd in six years from 1.8 million now, said Raul Feliz, an economist at the CIDE think tank. “If Pemex has to do it all by itself with this level of funding, it won’t be enough,” he said.

2018-12-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A number of institutional investors in ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) have said they will file a shareholder resolution which calls on the world’s largest oil company to set targets for lowering its greenhouse gas emissions. The call, led by the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF) and the Church Commissioners of England (CCE), comes in the wake of shareholder moves at other major energy firms seeking to make them more responsive to climate change and its impact on the business. The statement released on Sunday by the CCE asked Exxon to disclose, for the first time, short, medium and long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both its operations and the use of its products. “We want to see ExxonMobil develop a clear strategy for long-term sustainability, in line with international commitments for a safer climate,” Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the CCE, said in the statement. Thomas DiNapoli, New York State Comptroller and Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund, added: “The world is transitioning to a lower carbon future and Exxon needs to demonstrate its ability to adapt or risk its bottom line along with investors’ confidence.” Exxon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The pair have previously teamed up to pressure Exxon on environmental issues, including on a shareholder resolution in 2017 which asked the company to disclose the impact of measures to combat climate change on its business. The NYSCRF and CCE are joined in the latest initiative, which will be filed for a potential vote at Exxon’s shareholder meeting in the spring of 2019, by other funds including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), and HSBC Global Asset Management, the statement added. Earlier this month, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) set out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets that were linked to executive pay in 2020, following pressure from its investors. BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) have also set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but these are limited to their own operations.

2018-12-16,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government said on Sunday it had asked utility Engie (ENGIE.PA) to take hedging positions to ensure gas prices do not rise until June next year. Unlike power prices, which typically move once a year, gas prices move every month in France and are set using a formula that takes into account production costs.  Many French governments have postponed tariff increases to protect consumers and their own approval ratings in the past, but legally the government has no authority to set prices. Earlier this month, the government suspended increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent public protests against President Emmanuel Macron’s policies and said it would keep gas and power prices unchanged this winter. The environment ministry said on Sunday it wanted to ensure Engie’s gas prices do not change until June 2019 but gave no explanation on the new timeframe of the requested price freeze. Officials at the environment ministry were not immediately available to comment. “Engie has taken notice of the government’s request and will realise the necessary operations in order to guarantee the stability of the regulated tariffs of natural gas until the end of June,” Engie said in an emailed statement.

2018-12-16,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum (QP) is looking to invest at least $20 billion in the United States over the coming few years, its chief executive told Reuters, after the Gulf Arab state unexpectedly quit OPEC this month. Saad al-Kaabi, who holds the energy portfolio of the world’s top liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplier, also said on Sunday the company aimed to announce foreign partners for new LNG trains needed for an ambitious domestic scale-up by the middle of next year, but was keeping open the possibility of going it alone. Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country is one of the most influential players in the LNG market due to its annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-2024 and will be building four liquefaction trains for the LNG expansion. As part of its more than $20 billion investment push in the U.S. QP is looking “at gas and oil, conventional and non-conventional,” Kaabi said. Qatar Petroleum is majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) holding smaller stakes. Kaabi said he expected to make a final decision on that investment and whether to move ahead with the project “by the end of the year, if not January.” Qatar is a relatively small oil producer compared to its massive gas production. Its decision to quit OPEC this month was seen as a swipe at the group’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia, which along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, has imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. Kaabi said that proposed U.S. legislation known as “NOPEC”, or No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, which could open the OPEC group up to anti-trust lawsuits, was among the reasons for quitting the oil exporting club. Qatar Petroleum announced separately on Sunday that it was partnering with Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) on three oil fields in Mexico, taking a 35 percent stake in deposits that will begin production in mid-2019 and ramp up to about 90,000 barrels per day by 2021. The company is in talks with international oil firms about the LNG expansion project at home, including Eni, Kaabi said. Other partners already operating in Qatar include Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ENI (ENI.MI).   QP said it will self-finance the LNG expansion rather than borrow, a shift from previous practices where it used lenders to fund up to 70 percent of project costs.     Kaabi said it could carry out the expansion alone if no good offers from foreign firms were made.     “We are looking for a lot of things (in our partners) including asset swaps, things that will help me in my international expansion,” he said.  “If I don’t get good deals, nobody will come.” The company currently pumps 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) and aims to boost its output to 6.5 million boed in the next 8 years by expanding its upstream business abroad.

2018-12-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s economy minister said he believed the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline can go ahead while preserving Ukraine’s vital interests, but that Berlin is also in talks to diversify its energy supply with liquefied natural gas. U.S. President Donald Trump in July accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion, Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is to be built in the Baltic Sea.  Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route from next year. Washington is concerned the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenues and says Moscow is using the project to divide Europe. “Personally, I believe that this project can be justified if Ukraine’s vital interests are preserved at the same time,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Reuters in an interview conducted on Friday for publication on Sunday. “And one of these vital interests is that even after 2019, substantial gas transit through Ukraine will take place from Russia. There are discussions about this at the moment,” he said, adding that the detail of the talks was “very difficult”. Ukraine derives up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) from transit charges. “We will not reduce dependence on Russia by torpedoing a pipeline such as Nord Stream 2 and then sourcing gas from Russia from other pipelines,” Altmaier said. “Greater independence is only conceivable if, in addition to the long-term supply of gas, we also create an LNG infrastructure in Germany.” Washington has touted liquefied natural gas (LNG), delivered by U.S. companies, as an alternative to Russian gas. Altmaier said German government members were agreed they wanted to build the infrastructure to import LNG soon, and “we are currently in the process of clarifying the location issue with private investors.” Turning to Britain’s departure from the European Union, Altmaier said an EU summit last week showed a deal on Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc could not be renegotiated but “on the other hand, that the European Union is ready to provide clarification”. “Between these two poles ... there is a certain amount of tension that can only be overcome by Britain putting proposals on the table that, as far as I can see, are not yet available,” he added. On German domestic politics, he said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was not divided following a robust leadership contest this month. “It is now clear that we have a stable government with a chancellor for the next few years,” he added.

2018-12-16,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Fractious climate change talks in Poland showed the limits of international action to limit global warming in a polarized world, putting the onus on individual governments, cities and communities to stop temperatures rising. Nearly 200 countries at the United Nations talks in Katowice - in the coal mining region of Silesia - saved the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement from disintegration on Saturday by agreeing a package of guidelines for its implementation. [L8N1YK0I1] But it deferred rules on carbon credits — a spur to business — and lacked any firm commitment to strengthen countries’ emissions cut targets by 2020, when the agreement comes into force. As such it left the parties a long way from the Paris deal’s goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone the cap of 1.5C needed to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The world is heading for a 3-5C rise in temperatures this century, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization has said. The Paris Agreement is based on individual commitments and expectations for the Polish talks to produce much more than rules for how those would be measured had always been low: the unity built in Paris had been shattered by a wave of governments placing national agendas before collective action. Only a handful of country leaders were present in Katowice and the U.N. Secretary-General had to fly back to the meeting to urge progress. “Political will is missing,” Alden Meyer, director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit science advocacy group said as the conference staggered towards a finish delayed for more than 24 hours by last-minute wrangling over parts of the text. “But it provides the hooks for governments, cities, businesses, civil society etc to do the work to get (to the Paris Agreement goals),” he said. For conference president Michal Kurtyka it was a job well done. “Mission accomplished,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our children look back at our legacy and recognize that we took the right decisions at important junctures like the one we face today.” For nations already suffering from climate change the agreement, which did not make clear how pledged funding would be provided, was only just better than nothing. Simon Stiell, Environment Minister of Grenada in the Caribbean, told Reuters it “is barely scratching the surface of what we really require”. Investors said it would take more action at government level to persuade them to pump in the amount of money needed. “Those countries ... who push ahead with ambitious, long-term climate policies will be the ones to reap the investment and economic advantages of doing so,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, Chief Executive of Institutional Investors’ Group on Climate Change, noting the low-carbon transition was already underway. The United States, set to withdraw from the U.N. process at the behest of President Donald Trump, staged an event touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels, including coal, more efficiently, while back at home, Trump has termed the Paris deal “ridiculous”. A scientific report requested by the Paris signatories said the share of coal-fueled power would have to be cut to under 2 percent by 2050, along with big cuts to other fossil fuels, to stop temperatures rising more than 1.5C and causing devastating floods, storms, heat waves and drought. The United States, as well as fellow oil producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait, refused to “welcome” the report, a term sought by countries seeking to focus minds on its findings. The final statement merely welcomed its timely completion and invited parties to make use of the information it contained. Yet the row over the report was far from the only one: China, India, Russia, Australia, Japan, Brazil and the European Union were all drawn into various rifts, although China won some praise for helping to overcome concern, especially from the United States, that it would sidestep any rules. “I think they have come a long way in recognizing they need to provide confidence,” Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said of the Chinese negotiators. Describing Washington as “out of touch”, Morgan noted the rules agreed in Poland nevertheless bound all countries, including the United States until its planned withdrawal in 2020, an achievement in itself. “But that doesn´t substitute for the need to build ambition,” she said. Poland, hosting its third U.N. climate conference, came in for criticism for its commitment to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels. The meeting’s final statement merely “noted” Warsaw’s call for a “just transition” allowing communities dependent on coal more time to adjust. The appointment of Kurtyka, Poland’s deputy environment minister, to preside over the talks appeased some campaigners angered by the government’s previous choice, former environment minister, Jan Szyszko. Szyszko had expressed doubts that global warming is manmade in the past and increased logging in the ancient forest of Bialowieza, declared illegal by the European Union’s top court. However, Kurtyka’s job was complicated by Poland’s environment minister saying he did not want discussion about raising ambition at the talks and Poland’s president vowing not to let anyone “murder coal mining”. A focus on technicalities in the first week was interpreted by campaigners as a pretext to avoid discussions on pledging deeper emissions cuts. Kurtyka got countries to focus on the guidelines near the end of the second week, but there was no collective action to harmonize or improve disparate pledges. “Each delegation has its own domestic interests ... Our role, as the presidency, is to find balance, which ensures reaching a compromise,” Adam Guibourge-Czetwertynski, Poland’s chief negotiator, said in the second week of talks. Poland’s ruling party, the nationalist-minded Law and Justice (PiS), wants to scale back the share of coal in electricity production from 80 percent to 60 percent by 2030. But the production of hard coal is expected to be stable for decades, although 72 percent of Poles think it should be gradually phased out to reduce emissions, according to a survey by state-controlled pollster CBOS in November. Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal region, is among the most polluted cities in Europe, because many people heat their homes by burning low quality coal, which is the cheapest. Residents say they have no choice. “No climate decisions, even the best ones, will change the content of our wallets,” said Maria Ligeza, an 83-year-old Katowice citizen. “Without help, people will be still burning what they have.” Additional reporting by Bate Felix and Wojciech Zurawski; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord/analysis-climate-talks-pass-baton-in-race-to-stop-global-warming-idUKL8N1YH6BV,16 Dec 2018,"Fractious climate

2018-12-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico aims to lift oil and gas production by almost 50 percent in the next six years and in January will award infrastructure and drilling contracts to develop 20 fields, state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos said on Saturday. Octavio Romero, chief executive officer of the company generally known as Pemex, said the new government would increase exploration investment by around 10 percent annually to reverse dwindling output as he presented a new plan for the industry. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, wants to revive Pemex, which has become heavily indebted as crude output fell from a peak of nearly 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004 to less than 1.8 million in October. “It’s a new Pemex rescue,” Lopez Obrador said alongside Romero in the port of Ciudad del Carmen in the southern Gulf of Mexico shortly before his government was due to present its first budget with Pemex’s finances under close scrutiny. Under the plan, Mexican crude output is due to climb to some 2.624 million barrels bpd by the end of 2024, while gas production will also rise by about 50 percent. Output will stabilize in the coming months and start to pick up toward the end of next year, the Pemex CEO said. However, projections presented in the government’s first budget later on Saturday suggested output would continue falling until 2020.  Mexico’s previous government sought to increase production by opening up production and exploration to private capital. But the decline has yet to bottom out. Lopez Obrador, an admirer of Lazaro Cardenas, the president who nationalized Mexico’s oil industry 80 years ago, was opposed to the 2013-14 constitutional overhaul of the industry carried out by his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto. The veteran leftist says he will respect 110 private oil contracts awarded under Pena Nieto, but this month challenged oil majors to start pumping oil quickly, offering them a three-year “truce,” without giving further details. In the meantime, Mexico will speed up exploitation of 20 mostly offshore fields in the Gulf of Mexico, Romero said. To this end, contracts for the necessary infrastructure will be awarded on Jan. 15 and to drill wells on Jan. 31, he added. Most of the fields are offshore and the government plans to issue “integrated” infrastructure contracts, Romero said. The drilling of the wells would be “turnkey” contracts that made the companies or consortiums responsible for delivery. Pemex will be responsible for the engineering and supervision of the services. By December 2019, the 20 fields should yield 73,000 bpd of output, Romero said. Energy Secretary Rocio Nahle told reporters in the city that priority would be given to Mexican firms in the contracting process, based on a restricted list of invitees. Romero said nine companies had expressed interest in drilling the offshore wells, and five others had done so for the four onshore fields. All are majority Mexican-owned, he said.
