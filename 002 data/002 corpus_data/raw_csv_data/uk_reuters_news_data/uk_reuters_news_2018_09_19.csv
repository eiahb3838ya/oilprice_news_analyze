2018-09-19,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell BARCELONA, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Bullish, as a word, doesn’t quite capture the stampede of optimism that was gushing out from the natural gas industry at its biggest annual event this week in Barcelona. “The demand is there,” stated Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in confirming that his country was on track to lift its output to 100 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel by 2023. Al-Kaabi’s remarks were among the more measured at the GasTech conference, with some executives making predictions that the market for LNG, currently around 300 million tonnes a year, will more than double by 2025. Speaker after speaker on the top-level panels offered up various versions of the view that natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel from dirtier and coal and crude oil to renewables, but is now a major part of world’s energy mix for the long term. But in stark contrast to the swathes of optimism, there was very little talk of when the next round of major LNG projects will reach the stage of final investment decisions (FID). If the denizens of the natural gas industry truly believe in the forecasts of rapid and strong growth in LNG demand, led by emerging buyers in Asia and China’s ongoing embrace of the cleaner-burning fuel, it would be logical to expect a new round of project approvals. Instead, progress toward FIDs for many of the planned projects around the world appears glacial. The exception to this slow process are those developers who have access to capital and can take higher investment risks than more cautious energy companies, who have to satisfy not only a board of directors, but also bankers and shareholders. Qatar’s planned additional 23 million tonnes of LNG capacity is a case in point. The small Middle Eastern country has the capital to underpin such a decision, and its low-cost structure means it can still prosper even if the extra capacity turns out to be surplus to market needs, thereby lowering prices. Another exception appears to be Russia’s Novatek, the developer of the Yamal LNG facility. Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson told a media briefing at GasTech that the company’s planned Arctic-2 project would add 20 million tonnes of LNG, taking his company’s total output to about 37.5 million tonnes by 2025. Mikhelson expressed confidence that the funding for the new venture would be secured, and also that there was no doubt in his mind that Asia would soak up the additional LNG. While Mikhelson may well be correct, and is prepared to invest to back his vision, Western oil companies may find it harder to get the necessary approvals. There is no shortage of LNG projects around the world, with several planned in Canada, the United States, east Africa and Australia. But the scars from the last round of major LNG developments perhaps haven’t quite healed, and are fresh in the memories of many would-be developers. Over the past decade Australia has built eight new LNG projects, at a cost of more than $200 billion, and will at least temporarily overtake Qatar as the world’s top producer when the last two come online later this year, or early in 2019. However, many of the projects ran over budget and were delayed, and the surge of supply caused spot LNG prices to at one stage fall to around a quarter of the record levels reached in 2011. The other major contributor to LNG supply has been the United States, which now has two operating LNG export facilities, and four more under construction and likely to be producing by 2020. But, if the demand forecasts for annual LNG trade to rise from the current 300 million tonnes per annum to something closer to 450 million tonnes, or even more, by 2025 are accurate, then there isn’t enough new LNG being developed. In theory, this should spark a new round of FIDs, but the LNG world has been changing at a rapid pace and the traditional methods of developing large projects appear unlikely to work this time. The traditional way of developing a multi-billion dollar plant was to underpin the financing by contracting long-term sales, most often linked to the price of crude oil. But LNG buyers no longer want these kind of deals, and are embracing the model of shorter-term agreement and spot purchases from a variety of suppliers. It would take a brave, or reckless, board of directors to sign off on project of up to $25 billion on the hope that if we build it, they will buy it. Bankers are also unlikely to be impressed with that sort of justification for a new venture. Projects in the United States now face the additional hurdle and uncertainty being created by President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China, with LNG now included in Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. The trade war may turn out to be a relatively short-lived affair. But, while it remains resolved it may well give pause to any planned FIDs in the United States. Overall, companies are going to have find new ways of underwriting project developments, or risk losing out to those developers that can afford to take the risks.

2018-09-19,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Global equities rallied for a second straight day on Wednesday while safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds and the Japanese yen slipped to multi-week lows as investors bet the escalating U.S.-China trade spat would inflict less damage than feared. The deepening tariff row between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains and undermine the world economy, with Beijing adding $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods But markets appear to have taken cheer from China’s move to levy only a 10 percent duty on $60 billion of U.S. imports. Washington too removed some 300 Chinese-made items from the list of dutiable goods. World growth is undoubtedly at risk — a survey by ThomsonReuters and INSEAD showed confidence among Asian companies at the weakest in almost three years as businesses feared blowback from the trade war And Germany’s IW economic institute lowered its growth forecast for the biggest euro zone economy, noting the fallout from the trade dispute But hopes of Chinese stimulus to counter the impact on the economy, as well as a pledge by premier Li Keqiang not to use yuan devaluation as a tool in the trade war, reassured investors to some extent, allowing markets to build on Tuesday’s gains. MSCI’s index of global equities rose 0.2 percent to a two-week high, while emerging stocks too firmed for a second day, led by a one percent jump in Shanghai markets. An index of non-Japan Asian stocks also rose one percent Government bonds from the United States and Germany, typically instruments that benefit from political or economic turmoil, saw yields race to multi-week highs. U.S. 10-year yields stayed firmly above the key 3 percent mark . “Where we are today is in a period of relative calm as U.S. bond yields probe their highs, and we become accustomed to trade rhetoric and perhaps, blasé about the economic damage it will cause,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes “All things considered, though, the tariff spat could have been a lot worse. Investors reacted relatively well to the news.” European shares followed Asian counterparts higher though U.S. equity futures pointed to a flat opening for Wall Street following Tuesday’s bounce. Analysts noted that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week had invited Beijing to a new round of talks but some also reckon on a more conciliatory stance from China. “China are out of bullets. The fight is done and dusted. Now it’s just a question of how the Chinese can save face and say ‘alright we’re going to change, going to open up wider access not only to the U.S. but to the EU and Japan’,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth in London. “Their economy is export-led, they can’t afford for it to go out of control.” But for now, the yuan was lifted by Premier Keqiang’s pledge, touching its highest level since last Friday at 6.843 per dollar. That in turn allowed an index of emerging currencies to rise for the second day in a row. In another sign of markets’ new-found optimism, the safe-haven yen slipped to two-month lows against the dollar .  The dollar inched higher but stayed close to seven-week lows against a basket of currencies. Investors also sold government bonds, pushing up yields on U.S. Treasury bonds to the highest since May while German yields surpassed 0.5 percent for the first time since mid-June . Meanwhile, Britain’s exit from the EU will be discussed at a European Union summit in Salzburg. The pound rose half a percent to $1.3215 after data showed inflation hitting a six month high. It then fell as low as $1.3098 after the Times newspaper reported Prime Minister Theresa May was set to reject the EU’s updated offer on the Irish border problem.

2018-09-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shale gas developer Cuadrilla will start fracking at its Preston New Road site in northwest England in the next few weeks, it said on Wednesday as it announced government approval for a second well. Hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure and was halted in Britain seven years ago after causing earth tremors. But the British government, keen to cut its reliance on imports as North Sea supplies dry up, has tightened regulation of the industry and gave consent in July for Cuadrilla to start fracking a first well at Preston New Road. After approval for a second well at the site, Cuadrilla said on Wednesday that it would begin work “in readiness to start hydraulically fracturing both wells in the next few weeks”. Cuadrilla said it would run an initial flow test of the gas produced from both wells for approximately six months.   The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could amount to 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years. However, attempts to extract the gas have come under fire from local communities and campaigners concerned about the potential effect on the environment and ground water, and arguing that extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with the country’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. British energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said consent for the second well had been granted after the company had met a number of criteria, including showing it had the necessary funds to carry out work at the site until at least June 30, 2019. “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, further enhancing our energy security and helping us with our continued transition to a lower-carbon economy,” she said in an emailed statement. Cuadrilla first attempted to frack gas near Blackpool in the northwest of England in 2011, but the practice led to an earth tremor registering 2.3 on the Richter scale. The company said the quakes were caused by an unusual combination of geological features at the site, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of 0.5 or above on the Richter scale is detected. It has also increased monitoring standards, including checks on ground water. Fracking consent was introduced in 2015 as an additional step to the government’s regulatory regime and ensures environmental, health and safety permits have been obtained. “Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities,” Perry said.

2018-09-19,"TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - China will not stoop to competitive devaluation of its currency, Premier Li Keqiang stressed, hours after China hit back, with a softer punch than the one landed by the United States, in an escalating tariff war between the world’s largest economies. Addressing a World Economic Forum event in the port city of Tianjin on Wednesday, Li did not directly mention the trade conflict but said talk of Beijing deliberately weakening its currency was “groundless.”  “One-way depreciation of the yuan brings more harm than benefits for China,” he said. “China will never go down the road of relying on yuan depreciation to stimulate exports.”  China will not do that to chase “thin profits” and “a few small bucks”. Li went on to say that the world’s multi-lateral trading system should be upheld, and that unilateral trade actions will not solve any problems. His remarks gave a lift to the yuan [CNY=CFXS], which has lost about 9 percent of its value since mid-April amid the ongoing trade war. On Tuesday, Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods.  But Beijing is running out of room to respond to any further U.S. tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis, raising concerns it may resort to other measures to weather what could be a protracted trade battle. China has yet to publicly accept an invitation extended last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold a fresh round of talks, which China welcomed at the time. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had no information on a possible trade delegation and questioned U.S. sincerity about wanting new talks, noting that the last round was followed immediately by the activation of new tariffs. “This has become a kind of U.S. routine,” he said. The United States wants to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its trade, technology transfer and high-tech industrial subsidy policies. Trump had warned that retaliation by China would trigger  tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese goods, on top of duties on $250 billion in imports that are already in place or threatened. China, which bought only $130 billion in American goods last year, has imposed or threatened tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. products. “China are out of bullets. The fight is done and dusted. Now it’s just a question of how the Chinese can save face and say ‘alright we’re going to change, going to open up wider access not only to the U.S. but to the EU and Japan’,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth in London. “Their economy is export-led, they can’t afford for it to go out of control,” he told Reuters. The new U.S. tariffs will begin on Sept. 24 at 10 percent and will increase to 25 percent by the end of 2018, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting a 0.5 percentage point decline in Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019 to 6.1 percent. Oxford Economics said in a note that China’s economic growth in 2019 could fall well below 6 percent, and said prospects for near-term easing in tensions were low. But, it added “the likelihood of de-escalation will rise over time as the increasing economic impact in the U.S. will make the Trump team less combative, and China realises that it will be hard to integrate more into the global economy without some concessions regarding its specific economic model.” Investors were relieved that the latest escalation was less severe than some market participants had expected, with Asian stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS rising on Wednesday and U.S. Treasury yields near four-month highs. China remains unafraid of the “extreme measures” taken by the United States, the People’s Daily newspaper said in a front-page article in its overseas edition on Wednesday. “To deal with the trade war, what China really should do is to focus on doing its own thing well,” said the newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party. “(China) is not worried that the U.S. trade counter measures will raise domestic commodity prices by too much but will instead use it as an opportunity to replace imports, promote localisation or develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing,” it said. The Global Times tabloid, which is affiliated to the People’s Daily, said the trade war was a chance to pursue greater global recognition of its financial markets and that it could open its A-share market more to listings by Western firms. Confidence among Asian companies has slumped to the weakest in almost three years as businesses fear collateral damage from the worsening trade war and China’s slowing economy, the latest Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed. Chinese firms were the most pessimistic since the poll began in 2009.

2018-09-19,"* Floods expected to grow in coming days * At least 35 people killed, mostly in North Carolina * More than 200,000 still without power By Ernest Scheyder WILMINGTON, N.C., Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, which is bearing the brunt of Florence’s deadly deluge and where rivers are still rising while thousands of homes and roadways remain submerged. Trump’s trip to the state follows criticism for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000 in the U.S. territory. Trump plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina at about 10:30 a.m. local time and return to Washington D.C. at 6:15 p.m., according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 metres), quadrupling its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way”. Florence has already killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina where local media reported that two mental health patients drowned on Tuesday when the sheriff’s van the women were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned about 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of interstates 40 and 95. In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised”.

If the denizens of the natural gas industry truly believe in the forecasts of rapid and strong growth in LNG demand, led by emerging buyers in Asia and China’s ongoing embrace of the cleaner-burning fuel, it would be logical to expect a new round of project approvals. Instead, progress toward FIDs for many of the planned projects around the world appears glacial. The exception to this slow process are those developers who have access to capital and can take higher investment risks than more cautious energy companies, who have to satisfy not only a board of directors, but also bankers and shareholders. Qatar’s planned additional 23 million tonnes of LNG capacity is a case in point. The small Middle Eastern country has the capital to underpin such a decision, and its low-cost structure means it can still prosper even if the extra capacity turns out to be surplus to market needs, thereby lowering prices. Another exception appears to be Russia’s Novatek, the developer of the Yamal LNG facility. Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson told a media briefing at GasTech that the company’s planned Arctic-2 project would add 20 million tonnes of LNG, taking his company’s total output to about 37.5 million tonnes by 2025. Mikhelson expressed confidence that the funding for the new venture would be secured, and also that there was no doubt in his mind that Asia would soak up the additional LNG. While Mikhelson may well be correct, and is prepared to invest to back his vision, Western oil companies may find it harder to get the necessary approvals. There is no shortage of LNG projects around the world, with several planned in Canada, the United States, east Africa and Australia. But the scars from the last round of major LNG developments perhaps haven’t quite healed, and are fresh in the memories of many would-be developers. Over the past decade Australia has built eight new LNG projects, at a cost of more than $200 billion, and will at least temporarily overtake Qatar as the world’s top producer when the last two come online later this year, or early in 2019. However, many of the projects ran over budget and were delayed, and the surge of supply caused spot LNG prices to at one stage fall to around a quarter of the record levels reached in 2011. The other major contributor to LNG supply has been the United States, which now has two operating LNG export facilities, and four more under construction and likely to be producing by 2020. But, if the demand forecasts for annual LNG trade to rise from the current 300 million tonnes per annum to something closer to 450 million tonnes, or even more, by 2025 are accurate, then there isn’t enough new LNG being developed. In theory, this should spark a new round of FIDs, but the LNG world has been changing at a rapid pace and the traditional methods of developing large projects appear unlikely to work this time. The traditional way of developing a multi-billion dollar plant was to underpin the financing by contracting long-term sales, most often linked to the price of crude oil. But LNG buyers no longer want these kind of deals, and are embracing the model of shorter-term agreement and spot purchases from a variety of suppliers. It would take a brave, or reckless, board of directors to sign off on project of up to $25 billion on the hope that if we build it, they will buy it. Bankers are also unlikely to be impressed with that sort of justification for a new venture. Projects in the United States now face the additional hurdle and uncertainty being created by President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China, with LNG now included in Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. The trade war may turn out to be a relatively short-lived affair. But, while it remains resolved it may well give pause to any planned FIDs in the United States. Overall, companies are going to have find new ways of underwriting project developments, or risk losing out to those developers that can afford to take the risks.

2018-09-19,"(Reuters) - Dominion Energy (D.N) said on Wednesday it had offered to buy the rest of Dominion Energy Midstream Partners DM.N in an all-stock deal, valuing the company at about $2.2 billion. Dominion Energy, which owns a stake of about 15 percent in the company, offered 0.2468 of its shares per Dominion Energy Midstream common unit, valuing each unit at $17.75 based on closing prices as of Sept. 18, the company said. The offer represented a discount of nearly 2 percent to Dominion Energy Midstream’s Wednesday close of $18.05, but was at a premium of 8.2 percent based on the 30-day volume-weighted average unit price.  Shares of Dominion Energy Midstream were down 3.3 percent at $17.45 in extended trading, while those of Dominion Energy were largely unchanged.     Pipeline companies are reorganizing their business structure after the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in March stopped them from claiming an income tax allowance as part of the fees they charge shippers. “Continued weakness in MLP capital markets combined with the prolonged disruption in Dominion Energy Midstream’s common unit price since the March 15 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission policy revision were key factors that led to this decision,” Dominion Energy Chief Executive Officer Thomas Farrell said.

2018-09-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets rallied for a second straight day on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds and the Japanese yen slipped to multi-week lows on bets the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat would inflict less damage than feared. European shares gained on trade-sensitive materials and auto stocks, while on Wall Street the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials were buoyed by U.S. bank stocks on the back of higher Treasury yields. The Dow hit its highest close since late January.  A drop in Microsoft (MSFT.O) pressured the Nasdaq and disappointing results in Europe from staffing firm Adecco (ADEN.S) and home improvement retailer Kingfisher (KGF.L) weighed on indexes. MSCI's gauge of equity markets in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.36 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 closed up 0.33 percent to two-week highs.  The big question for investors was whether the rest of the world will rejoin the United States in global synchronized growth or if ongoing trade tensions and tighter monetary policy finally slow the U.S. economy, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “That kind of dilemma is really what investors face and trade seems to be the wild card in all this,” Arone said. Investors were underestimating the boost stocks are gaining from the massive U.S. fiscal policy package that far outweighs any trade penalties that have been put forward, he said. The repatriation of corporate profits this year is likely to be $700 billion, individual and corporate tax cuts $200 billion and the government has boosted spending by $100 billion, Arone said. “That’s $1 trillion of fiscal stimulus. I think the effects of that continue to be under-appreciated by investors,” he said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 158.8 points, or 0.61 percent, to 26,405.76. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.64 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,907.95 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 6.07 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,950.04. U.S. 10- and 30-year Treasury debt yields hit fresh four-month highs after a report that U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in August. Housing starts rose 9.2 percent last month, a positive sign for the housing market which has underperformed the broader economy amid rising interest rates for home loans. The strong data pushed 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields US10YT=RR to a high of 3.092 percent and 30-year bond yields US30YT=RR to a high of 3.248 percent, extending a three-day rise in yields. The dollar slid against the euro and fell to the lowest in nearly three weeks against the risk-sensitive Australian dollar AUD=D4 as the latest U.S.-Chinese trade tensions failed to unnerve investors. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.09 percent to 94.553.  The euro EUR= rose 0.07 percent to $1.1673 and the Japanese yen JPY= fell 0.08 percent versus the greenback at 112.26 per dollar. U.S. oil futures rose more than $1 a barrel on a fifth weekly crude inventory drawdown and strong domestic gasoline demand amid ongoing supply concerns over U.S. sanctions on Iran.

2018-09-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil futures surged nearly 2 percent on Wednesday as they were bolstered by a fifth weekly crude inventory drawdown and strong domestic gasoline demand amid ongoing global supply concerns over  U.S. sanctions on Iran that come into force in November. U.S. crude inventories fell 2.1 million barrels last week to 394.1 million barrels, the lowest level since February 2015, government data showed. Gasoline stocks fell 1.7 million barrels versus forecasts for a 100,000-barrel drop. [EIA/S] “It was a squarely bullish report,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “The summer-like demand from drivers is proving unrelenting.” Gasoline consumption usually picks up in the summer and wanes in autumn, but demand remained strong in the latest week, estimated at 9.5 million barrels per day. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up $1.27, or 1.8 percent, at $71.12 a barrel.  Brent futures LCOc1 also rose but the gains were more muted, as the global benchmark ended 37 cents, or 0.5 percent, higher at $79.40 a barrel.    In the previous session, Brent rose 1.3 percent on a media report that Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, was comfortable with prices above $80, indicating the producer would not try to increase output to drive prices lower. Reuters reported on Sept. 5 that Saudi Arabia wanted oil to stay between $70 and $80 to keep a balance between maximising revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S. congressional elections. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia meet on Sept. 23 in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases within their quota framework to offset the loss of Iranian supply. U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s oil exports come into force on Nov. 4 and many buyers have already scaled back Iranian purchases. But it is unclear how easily other producers can compensate for any lost supply.

2018-09-19,"(Adds Saipem comment) By Emilio Parodi MILAN, Sept 19 (Reuters) - An Italian court found oil services group Saipem and a former CEO guilty of corruption in a long-running trial over bribes in Algeria but acquitted oil major Eni. In a court ruling on Wednesday, Milan judges sentenced one-time Saipem CEO Pietro Tali to four years and nine months in prison and seized 197.9 million euros ($231 million) from the company. Saipem was also fined 400,000 euros. In the same ruling, the court acquitted Eni, its former CEO Paolo Scaroni and its current upstream head Antonio Vella. Under Italian law, companies are responsible for the actions of their managers and can be fined if found guilty. Saipem said in a statement it reserved the right to appeal the decision once the reasons underpinning it had been made known within 90 days. Tali has previously denied any wrongdoing. The long-running case revolves around allegations Saipem paid intermediaries about 198 million euros to secure contracts worth 8 billion euros with Algeria’s state-owned Sonatrach. Prosecutors claimed money was also paid to allow Eni to get a green light from Algeria’s energy ministry to buy Canadian oil and gas company First Calgary Petroleums, which held rights to Algeria’s Menzel gas field. “Eni welcomes today’s judgment of acquittal on the grounds there was no case to answer,” the Italian major said in a statement. Scaroni, currently deputy chairman of Rothschild and chairman of Italian soccer club AC Milan, said he was pleased with the decision. In February prosecutors had asked for a jail sentence of six years and four months for Scaroni and five years and four months for Vella. Saipem is jointly controlled by Eni and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. When Scaroni was Eni CEO it was 43 percent owned by the energy major. Algeria has historically been an important market for Saipem and current CEO Stefano Cao has previously said he is keen to repair relations with the country. In February Algeria’s state energy firm Sonatrach signed an agreement with Saipem to end legal disputes over four gas projects. In its ruling on Wednesday the court turned down requests from Sonatrach and the Italian tax collection agency for compensation. $1 = 0.8561 euros

2018-09-19,"TEPIC, Mexico, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Severe flooding on the Amazon has increased amid changing weather patterns, and is harming the health and incomes of people living along the world’s biggest river, scientists said. Analysing more than 100 years of records measuring Amazon River levels in the port of Manaus in Brazil, they found extreme floods that occurred roughly once every 20 years in the first part of last century are now happening about every four years. “There are catastrophic effects on the lives of the people as the drinking water gets flooded, and the houses get completely destroyed,” said Jonathan Barichivich, environmental scientist at the Universidad Austral de Chile. “Our findings unravel the ultimate causes of the recent intensification - wet season getting wetter, and dry season getting drier - of the water cycle of the largest hydrological basin of the planet,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Droughts have also become more frequent in the past two to three decades, but the rise in flooding stood out, he noted. In a paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers from institutions including Britain’s University of Leeds said severe flooding had affected the Amazon basin nearly every year from 2009 to 2015. They linked the increase in flooding to a combination of warmer temperatures over the Atlantic Ocean and cooler temperatures over the Pacific. Known as the Walker circulation, this effect influences tropical weather patterns, and can partly be attributed to shifts in wind belts caused by global warming, the study said. With temperatures in the Atlantic expected to rise more than in the Pacific, flood risks on the Amazon River will persist, the scientists predicted. “We think that it’s going to continue for at least a decade,” said Barichivich, formerly a University of Leeds research fellow. The paper also noted that deforestation and construction of hydro-power plants could play a role in water-level changes. Besides disrupting cattle ranching and agriculture on the river’s flood plains, heavy flooding has health consequences for communities in Brazil, Peru and other Amazon nations, as it contaminates water and helps spread disease, said the study. Monitoring changes in river levels is important because the Amazon basin and its tropical rainforest play a major role in the world's hydrological and carbon systems, said Barichivich.

2018-09-19,"* State-run EDF operates all France’s nuclear reactors * Smaller power firms can buy electricity at fixed price * EDF says existing mechanism unfair, needs reform By Bate Felix PARIS, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The French government plans to reform the way independent power firms buy nuclear electricity from state-run EDF, but has drawn criticism from the smaller firms which say the draft proposals will reduce competition and increase their costs. Under the existing Arenh mechanism, EDF offers up to 100 terawatt/hours (TWh) per year, or about a quarter of its French nuclear production, to its smaller rivals for year-ahead delivery at a fixed price of 42 euros ($49) per megawatt. The mechanism was set up to encourage competition and offset EDF’s monopoly on nuclear power production. EDF operates all 58 of France’s nuclear reactors that generate more than 75 percent of the nation’s electricity needs. EDF has long complained the mechanism gives rivals unfair access to its nuclear output and says competitors profit from arbitrage trade — buying power via the Arenh window at a fixed price and reselling it when wholesale market prices are higher. The proposed reform aims to curb this arbitrage by setting new conditions for purchasing nuclear power, changing quantities allocated for a given period and locking buyers into contracts, the draft reform seen by Reuters showed. “The proposed reform poses a serious threat to competition in the electricity market,” the independent power providers said in a statement sent through their gas and power lobby groups. They said the reform would mean they would carry more risk, would have less visibility about the volume they would receive and would face increased costs for accessing the mechanism. Under the changes, sales of nuclear power under the Arenh mechanism would be staggered, with 40 percent of the 100 TWh sold on Jan. 15, 25 percent on July 15 and 35 percent on Nov. 15. Supplies would be delivered from the following January. Currently, independent providers bid for the whole Arenh volume at the same time, in November, with delivery made from January the following year. The independent providers have urged the French new energy minister, François de Rugy, to halt the reform and increase their access to EDF’s nuclear power. “The reform could artificially reduce the size of the Arenh mechanism,” a source at one independent power provider said, adding the changes could violate European competition laws. French and European electricity contracts for year-ahead delivery have soared well above the Arenh price in recent weeks, tracking gains in coal, gas and European carbon emission prices. The French Cal’19 delivery contract hit an all-time high of 63.50 euros/MWh on Sept. 11. It was trading at 58.80 euros/MWh on Wednesday. $1 = 0.8570 euros

2018-09-19,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (KO.N) is moving ahead with plans to take over Nigeria’s leading juice company Chi Ltd and aims to complete the deal early next year, a senior executive told Reuters.  The acquisition for an undisclosed price is one of several steps the U.S. company is taking in a global strategy to diversify from its core business of sugary sodas.  Last month it agreed to buy Costa coffee for $5.1 billion, and sources familiar with the matter say it is also bidding for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Indian Horlicks nutrition business. “We are still on track to complete the acquisition (of Chi Ltd) by the end of the first quarter of 2019,” Peter Njonjo, president of Coca-Cola’s west Africa business, said on Wednesday.  Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in the Nigerian juice and snack producer in January 2016, and said at the time it aimed to increase ownership within three years.  Juice sales form a central plank of the U.S. company’s attempt to offer drinks at a range of price points in Nigeria to improve affordability in a country where Njonjo sees high inflation and modest economic growth in the coming year. Focusing on smaller bottles and cans is another way the company is trying to woo cash-strapped consumers in Nigeria, which emerged from its first recession in 25 years in 2017 but continues to suffer from sluggish growth and high inflation. “Affordability will start becoming a bigger issue in this market than it was in the past. As a company, that is what we need to factor in as we are thinking about the future of our business in Nigeria,” Njonjo said in an interview.  He pointed to the introduction of a 30 centilitre bottle of Coke Zero for 60 naira ($0.20), compared with the standard 50 centilitre bottle for 80 naira, as just one example.  Njonjo said the company’s drive to diversify its product range could also give it more flexibility in a market where unemployment is high and the United Nations estimates most of the population of 190 million lives on less than $2 (1.5 pounds) a day.  “We realise that in certain pack formats you can only go down so low,” he said in an interview at his office in the commercial capital Lagos. “But once you start looking at pouches and still products, like juice and drinking yoghurts, that allows you to start accessing much lower price points.” Njonjo said the purchase of Costa could present a “significant opportunity” in Nigeria, despite the absence of a culture of hot-coffee drinking there. “There definitely could be opportunity around ready-to-drink coffee here in Nigeria ... Having iced coffee, blends of dairy and coffee, packaged in different formats,” he said.  Njonjo said Horlicks, a malt-based hot beverage, was an “interesting proposition” that could be “a significant opportunity on the (African) continent”. But while the company was researching drinks from locally relevant ingredients, such as ginger, he said he could not see a market for marijuana drinks - something the company has said it was closely watching in the past.  In January, Coca-Cola announced a global goal to help collect and recycle its packaging.  Njonjo said the company was working in Nigeria to collect bottles and find a way for them to be re-used through a partnership with cement-maker Lafarge in which bottles would be burned in kilns as an energy source.  A memorandum of understanding was being formalised and would be signed in the next few weeks, he said, adding that implementation would begin in the last quarter of this year.  He said the company was also working with Lagos state government on marine collection to remove waste from waterways in the city, which is built on a lagoon.

2018-09-19,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy trade with China will remain strong in the long term, officials said on Wednesday at a Sino-U.S. oil and gas forum in Houston, even as an escalating trade dispute hits U.S. exports of natural gas.  Cooperation could be expanded and more could be done to promote trade and investment between the two countries, Li Fanrong, China’s deputy administrator for the National Energy Administration, told delegates during opening remarks at the forum. There is effective cooperation between China and the United States, he said.   The annual forum kicked off a day after China said it would impose tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, including a 10 percent tariff on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, in response to U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese exports, including electronics, furniture and chemicals.  “Cooperation on energy is likely for the long term, despite short-term trade issues to course correct our global trade deals,” Steve Winberg, assistant secretary to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy, said in a statement.  Hosted by United States Energy Association (USEA), a group that seeks to advance energy infrastructure projects, the forum aims to build cooperation between the United States and China energy industries.  Despite trade tensions, some conference attendees said they were optimistic the U.S.-China energy relationship will weather the tariffs tit-for-tat.  “China is viewed by everybody in the sector as being the prime market for demand. I don’t think any of that is changed by the discussion on trade issues,” said Robert Gee, president of Gee Strategies Group and former assistant secretary to the Office of Fossil Energy during the Clinton Administration.  While energy officials on Wednesday did not specifically refer to the trade war in opening remarks, some U.S. government representatives were initially concerned that the Chinese delegation might not show for the event after some members of the National Energy Administration of China missed an event Tuesday evening, a person familiar with the matter said.  Most of the event was closed off to the media and access to Chinese and U.S. energy officials was restricted.  Still, Wednesday’s forum hosted almost 200 people, the largest attendance in the 18 years it has been held, said Barry Worthington, executive director for the USEA. “There is a different trading relationship than there has been in the past,” said Worthington, pointing to increased exports from the United States.  The tariffs threaten to undermine the development of the U.S. LNG export industry, which eyes China as a major trading partner.  Exports of oil products and LNG to China have grown rapidly in the past two years. The U.S. exported 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil to China in the first half of 2018, and through July has exported 56 cargoes of LNG to China, totaling nearly 190 billion cubic feet of natural gas, said the DOE’s Winberg. China imported roughly 10 percent of total U.S. LNG exports, he said. The United States has exported over 1.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since LNG exports began in 2016, thanks to the country’s shale boom, according the DOE. Those exports were anticipated to increase to an average of 9.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2018, marking a 15 percent gain from last year’s levels, the DOE said last week.

2018-09-19,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil producer Surgutneftegaz (SNGS.MM) is pushing buyers to agree to pay for oil in euros instead of dollars if the need arises, apparently as insurance against possible tougher U.S. sanctions, traders who deal with the firm told Reuters. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, but Washington has threatened to impose extra sanctions, citing what it has called Moscow’s “malign” activities abroad. The prospect that causes most alarm for Russian firms is inclusion on a Treasury Department blacklist that effectively cuts them off from conducting transactions in dollars, the lifeblood of the global oil industry. Surgutneftegaz, whose chief executive Vladimir Bogdanov is already on a U.S. blacklist in a personal capacity, declined to respond to Reuters questions. “We do not comment on our commercial activity,” said the company, Russia’s fourth largest by output. To date, Russia’s oil industry has been able to weather Western sanctions. In response to restricted access to Western finance and technology, firms have switched to borrowing from Russian state banks and developed their own technology. Most Russian oil majors, including Rosneft and Lukoil, also sell the lion’s share of output via long-term contracts with clients, giving them more time to work out alternative forms of payment when the contracts expire. But most of Surgutneftegaz’s exports — around 2 million tonnes per month — is sold through monthly tenders on the spot market, the largest volumes by far among its Russian peers. So it would have only around 30 days to find alternative payment methods. Six traders who regularly deal with Surgutneftegaz said the company had been asking buyers to agree to an addendum to their contracts stating that they accept the option of settling payments in euros. According to a message sent by Surgutneftegaz to one of its customers asking them to sign the addendum, the oil company cited the need to “avoid any possible problems with payment in USD.” Reuters has seen a copy of the message. Three of the traders said Surgutneftegaz had already begun discussions with its partners last summer about the possibility of settling payments in euros. But the company was now raising the issue with greater urgency, and had in some cases warned it would reject bids from buyers for cargoes of oil unless the buyers signed the addendum, according to four of the traders. In its message to customers, Surgutneftegaz did not mention the risk of new sanctions, but two traders said from their interactions with the company it was clear to them that this was the reason behind the change. “Surgut is afraid of sanctions,” a source in a European oil major which has dealings with Surgutneftegaz told Reuters, on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. government cannot forbid anyone from using dollars, but it can prevent U.S. banks from doing business with a sanctioned entity. Most dollar-denominated transactions pass through the U.S. banking system, and those banks, to avoid violating sanctions, can refuse to handle money linked to blacklisted companies or individuals.  It is not clear how widely the Russian oil sector is preparing for the possibility of tougher sanctions. A source at Gazpromneft, Russia’s third-biggest oil company by output, said most of its contracts already contained a clause on possible payments in non-dollar currencies. A second source at the company said that when it is drafting supply contracts with customers for 2019, it will make sure they include a non-dollar payment option in all cases. Gazpromneft was not immediately available to comment. Several other oil firms also already have clauses in their contracts allowing non-dollar payments under some circumstances, said four industry sources. Washington’s decision in April to include on its sanctions blacklist Russian firm Rusal, one of the world’s biggest aluminum producers, signaled to Russian business that Washington was ratcheting up the pressure. It was the first time a major Russian company with international partners had been blacklisted. Some elements of the sanctions have been temporarily watered down, but Rusal’s inclusion has disrupted its access to raw materials, led to the cancellation of some orders and prompted some foreign partners to sever ties.  Washington has not spelled out when or how it plans to toughen sanctions further, but it has signaled that they are coming this year, partly in response to the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Britain and its Western allies say Russian intelligence agents carried out the poisoning using a military-grade nerve agent, an allegation Moscow has denied.  State Department official Manisha Singh said this month there would be a “very severe second round of sanctions” unless Russia meets a November deadline to comply with international chemical weapons law. The source in the European oil major said Surgutneftegaz, in its push to arrange the option of payments in euros, was focused on what might happen in November. There is no indication from Washington if Surgutneftegaz would be a target for the next round of sanctions. But CEO Bogdanov was included on the Treasury Department list, published in January, of Russian oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more. In April, the Treasury Department added Bogdanov to its “Specially Designated National” list, freezing any U.S. assets he owns and barring him from travel to the United States. It said he was being blacklisted “for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.” Reporting by Gleb Gorodyankin and Olga Yagova; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Mike Collett-White",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-surgut-sanctions/exclusive-russian-oil-firm-seeks-dollar-alternative-amid-us-sanctions-threat-traders-idUKL8N1W53G1,19 Sep 2018,"* Surgutneftegaz is Russia's fourth biggest oil firm by

2018-09-19,"LONDON, Sept 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With climate-changing emissions still inching higher - and resulting threats from extreme weather surging - sucking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere must become an urgent priority, backers of “carbon removal” efforts say. “The math is quite simple,” Manish Bapna, executive vice president of the Washington-based World Resources Institute, told a panel discussion on the fledgling approach this week. If the world overshoots the temperature goals set in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, as looks increasingly likely, “carbon removal gets us back on track”, he said. “The first imperative is to reduce emissions as quickly and deeply as possible,” Bapna said. “But there is now a second imperative ... to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a large scale.” Proposals to suck carbon out of the atmosphere range from planting many more trees, which absorb carbon dioxide to grow, to installing devices that capture carbon directly from the air. Changing farming practices to store more carbon in soils, or producing energy by growing trees or crops, burning them and pumping underground the carbon released also could play a role, scientists say. Interest in carbon removal technologies is growing, not least because countries from Britain to the United States have included some of them in their plans to curb climate change. They also feature in a report, due out next month, by the world’s leading climate scientists, who say governments may have to find ways to extract vast amounts of carbon from the air if warming overshoots the lower Paris pact limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). That overshoot is expected to happen by about 2040, according to a draft copy of the report. “Carbon removal is really about creating options,” said Kelly Levin, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute. “If you fast forward 20 or 30 years, we want to keep options open.” The surging scale of losses to extreme weather - including the storms that smashed into the eastern United States and the Philippines this month - means more people now believe climate change needs to be curbed, said Klaus Lackner, director of the U.S.-based Center for Negative Carbon Emissions. “I believe we are at a turning point where people are starting to see the problem needs to be solved,” said Lackner, a proponent of technology to capture carbon from the air. Right now, the costs of carbon removal may be too high but as climate impacts worsen “eventually it will hurt, and then we will pay whatever it takes”, he predicted. “Show me technologies that didn’t get six times cheaper in a decade when they were actually used,” he added. Carbon removal faces many other challenges including low government spending, competition for land, and a need to move faster than finance and technology may allow, experts admitted. For instance, capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air, while possible, also requires a lot of energy, said James Mulligan, a World Resources Institute researcher on carbon removal. Capturing just 15 percent of U.S. annual emissions would use 7 percent of projected U.S. energy production in 2050, he said. Farming differently to store more carbon in soils, by comparison, could be cheaper and provide extra benefits, boosting harvests, water conservation and wildlife habitats, said Betsy Taylor, president of consulting firm Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions. “This pathway is the most affordable, technologically ready and it is a no-regrets option,” particularly as about a third of the world’s soils are now considered degraded, she said. Experimenting with carbon removal deserves “a newfound sense of urgency” not least because more intrusive “geoengineering” ideas, such as blocking some of the sun’s rays from reaching the planet, are “coming down the pike”, she said. But getting millions of farmers and ranchers to alter how they work would require significant investment - and monitoring carbon reductions from soil use remains an inexact science, experts admitted. Most carbon removal technologies would get the world only a fraction of the way to solving its climate problem, they said - and the prospect of having the technologies available might be seized as an excuse to stall action to cut emissions. “We need to be clear-eyed about the challenges,” Mulligan said. The key, said Levin of the World Resources Institute, is ensuring both emissions cuts and carbon removal efforts move ahead fast enough to ward off the worst anticipated impacts of climate change, from worsening hunger to extreme heatwaves. ""If you look at the science, we have to pull out all the stops on mitigation and carbon removal at a scale that is completely unprecedented,"" she said.

2018-09-19,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - World stock markets broadly rose for a second straight day on Wednesday, while safe-haven assets such as U.S. bonds and the Japanese yen slipped to multi-week lows, on bets the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat would inflict less damage than feared. Gains in European shares were led by trade-sensitive materials and auto stocks, while on Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials indexes were buoyed by U.S. bank stocks on the back of higher Treasury yields. A drop in Microsoft pressured the Nasdaq and disappointing results in Europe from staffing firm Adecco and home improvement retailer Kingfisher weighed on indexes. MSCI’s gauge of equity markets in 47 countries gained 0.36 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.39 percent to two-week highs. The big question for investors was whether the rest of the world will rejoin the United States in global synchronized growth or if ongoing trade tensions and tighter monetary policy finally slow the U.S. economy, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “That kind of dilemma is really what investors face and trade seems to be the wild card in all this,” Arone said. Investors were underestimating the boost stocks are gaining from the massive U.S. fiscal policy package that far outweighs any trade penalties that have been put forward, he said. The repatriation of corporate profits this year is likely to be $700 billion, individual and corporate tax cuts $200 billion and the government has boosted spending by $100 billion, Arone said. “That’s $1 trillion of fiscal stimulus. I think the effects of that continue to be under-appreciated by investors,” he said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 175.98 points, or 0.67 percent, to 26,422.94. The S&P 500 gained 2.4 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,906.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 31.62 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,924.49. U.S. 10-year and 30-year bond yields hit fresh four-month highs after a report that U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in August. Housing starts rose 9.2 percent last month, a positive sign for the housing market which has underperformed the broader economy amid rising interest rates for home loans. The strong data pushed 10-year yields to a high of 3.085 percent, and 30-year yields to a high of 3.235 percent, extending a three-day rise in yields. The dollar was steady against the euro and the Japanese yen and slipped against the risk-sensitive Aussie, as investors shrugged off the latest round of tariffs announced by China and the United States. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was about flat on the day at 94.647. The euro up 0.02 percent to $1.1667 and the Japanese yen strengthened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 112.34 per dollar. The price of Brent crude oil held near its highest level this year as concerns that producers may fail to cover a supply shortfall once U.S. sanctions on Iran come into force outweighed an increase in U.S. inventories. Brent crude futures rose 20 cents at $79.23 a barrel, having risen by 1.3 percent on Tuesday following media reports that Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, was comfortable with prices above $80. U.S. crude prices were last up 94 cents at $70.79. Bullion bounced as the dollar weakened, indicating investors are starting to worry about the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on the U.S. economy, luring some buyers back into gold investments.

Crude inventories fell 2.1 million barrels in the week to Sept. 14 to 394.1 million barrels, the lowest level since February 2015, EIA data showed. Analysts had forecast a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell 1.25 million barrels, EIA said. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 106,000 barrels per day, as exports jumped over 500,000 bpd to 2.4 million bpd. Weekly crude production inched back to 11 million bpd, the record high it has been hovering around this summer. Gasoline stocks fell 1.7 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 104,000-barrel drop. “It was a squarely bullish report,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “The summer-like demand from drivers is proving unrelenting.” Gasoline consumption usually picks up in the summer and wanes in autumn, but demand remained strong in the latest week, estimated at 9.53 million bpd.

2018-09-19,"* U.S. LNG shipments to China at least 9 pct cheaper * U.S. volumes to China drops in August - Eikon data * No U.S. LNG loaded for China this month yet - Eikon data By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States to China remain cheaper than other sources despite a 10 percent tariff that was imposed on the cargoes this week in the trade war between the two nations, industry sources said on Wednesday. But political risks may still deter Chinese buyers from U.S. cargoes even if they are a lower price, they said. “For a Chinese buyer, the overall risk profile for procuring U.S. LNG remains heightened, so we would expect Chinese buyers to pivot the emphasis in their longer term LNG procurement strategies away from U.S. supply, to places such as Qatar and Australia,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. China said on Tuesday it would tax U.S. products worth $60 billion effective Sept. 24 in retaliation for tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. This includes a 10 percent tariff on LNG shipments from the United States, although this was less than the 25 percent it had threatened to impose. China’s decision not to impose a higher tariff on LNG could have been due to an anticipated pick up in demand during winter, Kavonic said. “The smaller tariff may allow for some more U.S. cargoes to compete for Chinese demand as we approach winter, and provide Chinese buyers with more leverage to procure non-U.S. cargoes if the market becomes very tight,” he added. Shipments of LNG from the United States to China work out at least 9 percent cheaper than the delivered price into China compared with those loading from other key suppliers, according to calculations by Reuters and industry sources. The calculations are based on long-term prices committed for U.S. cargoes, shipping costs and loading-capacity fees. Despite the cheaper cost, the trade war between the world’s biggest economies has caused Chinese state-owned oil majors such as CNOOC and Sinopec to shy away from U.S. cargoes in the spot market recently, two sources familiar with the matter said. “We have told sellers not to supply us with U.S. LNG now ... and will continue to avoid until the (tension eases),” one of the sources said, citing political reasons. This shift is already showing in the trade volumes. Only one tanker carrying LNG loaded from the United States was bound for China in August, compared with three in July, while nothing has loaded in September so far, Thomson Reuters Eikon shiptracking data showed. At least one Chinese buyer tried to work around the anticipated tariff by asking sellers to absorb the tariff cost in new contracts they were signing, but it was not immediately clear if any sellers agreed, a Singapore-based LNG trader said. “I don’t think the U.S. sellers will be too worried about selling their spot cargoes to the Chinese as they know their price is still competitive,” another Singapore based industry source said. Still, damage has been done, said Kavonic. “Even with a smaller tariff, there has likely been some longstanding damage done to the perception of reliability of U.S. LNG supply in the eyes of Chinese buyers who will shape the next wave of global LNG projects, benefiting marketing of new supply projects and contract rollovers at Australian projects,” he said.

2018-09-19,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s president has proposed hiking taxes on mobile payments and other money transfer services, documents sent to parliament this month showed, amid a tussle in government over how to boost revenues without hurting the poor. Uhuru Kenyatta proposed increasing the excise duty on mobile money transfer fees from 10 percent to 12 percent, documents reviewed by Reuters showed. He also proposed a 20 percent excise duty on the fees charged by banks, money transfer services, and other financial institutions for each money transfer they do. Parliament will hold a vote on the measures on Thursday.  The latest proposal comes as Kenyatta, re-elected last year after an extended and bloody election, seeks to implement planned tax hikes and other measures in this year’s budget that were designed to fund a range of government development goals including universal healthcare and affordable housing.  Lawmakers and some members of the public have resisted the measures, particularly a new tax on petroleum products. Kenyatta said on Friday the tax is necessary, but that he wanted to cut it to 8 percent from 16 percent. In the documents, Kenyatta asked parliament to reduce government expenditure by 55 billion Kenyan shillings (£413.6 million) from the 2.72 trillion shilling budget proposed in June. The president has not yet signed the budget due to the dispute over planned tax hikes. In addition to the new fuel tax, the president has also asked parliament to approve an additional charge of 18 shillings per litre of kerosene that poor households use for lighting and cooking. He also proposed an excise duty of 15 percent on internet telephone services. Kenya’s biggest mobile phone operator Safaricom said in June it is opposed to any tax rise on mobile phone-based transfers, arguing that it would mainly hurt the poor, most of whom do not have bank accounts and rely on mobile transfer services such as their widely used M-Pesa. Safaricom, part-owned by South Africa’s Vodacom and Britain’s Vodafone, declined to comment on the proposal. Last month, lawmakers voted to delay the hike in fuel taxes for two more years, but the national revenue authority started collecting the tax anyway, triggering a strike by fuel transporters and public anger.  They also voted to retain an interest rate cap that the International Monetary Fund has said must be scrapped or modified in return for a new standby arrangement. The existing standby arrangement expired this month. Parliament at the time also rejected an earlier version of proposed fees on money transfers, a so-called “Robin Hood” tax of 0.05 percent on transfers of more than 500,000 shillings. Kenyan businesses and the public routinely complain of a heavy tax burden.  The Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry this month said the government should increase and widen the tax base. It also urged the state to cut expenditure, reduce wastage of public funds and deal with corruption, which some studies have found lose the government about a third of its annual budget.

2018-09-19,"NEW DELHI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - India is considering asking the central bank to offer dollars directly to oil marketing companies or through a state-run bank, a government source said on Thursday, as part of steps to stem a fall in the rupee. As an “extreme” measure, the government could also look at raising dollars by tapping expatriates to invest in bonds for non-resident Indians, said the source who has direct knowledge of the deliberations over the currency’s fall. The rupee is Asia’s worst performing currency this year. However, earlier on Wednesday it posted its strongest intraday gain since May 25 on hopes that oil companies, which are among the largest buyers of dollars in India, would now direct their demand to the central bank and not the open market. “We could ask the Reserve Bank of India to earmark $8 billion to $10 billion a month separately for the public sector oil companies,” the source said, declining to be named as the discussions continue. “As an extreme step, we would be ready to raise dollars through non-resident deposits.” Finance Ministry spokesman D.S. Malik declined to comment. The source said proposed restrictions on the import of non-essential items may have only a limited impact on the falling rupee as the current account deficit continues to widen.

2018-09-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. natural gas prices have remained stuck below $3 per million British thermal units for most of this year even as consumption has soared and gas stocks have slipped to their lowest seasonal levels since 2003. Working stocks in underground storage amounted to just 2,636 billion cubic feet at the end of the first week in September, down from 3,298 bcf at the same point last year and a five-year average of 3,232 bcf. Gas consumption by power producers has risen strongly as a result of high air-conditioning demand during a long, hot summer and the commissioning of another wave of combined-cycle generating units. Cooling demand has been more than 13 percent higher than in 2017 and 14 percent above the long-term average so far in 2018. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2pmzdBb) Cumulative demand has been similar to the heatwave of 2016, according to degree-day statistics from the U.S. Climate Prediction Center. Power producers’ gas consumption is also being boosted by the large number of new gas-fired generating units that have started up. Power producers had 464 gigawatts of gas-fired generating capacity available at the end of June, up 3 percent compared with 2017. And low gas prices have encouraged power producers to run them for more hours, with capacity utilisation rates several percentage points higher every month so far in 2018 compared with 2017. Much of the increase in gas-fired generation has come at the expense of coal, where capacity has declined by more than 6 percent from year-ago levels and utilisation rates have been down in most months so far in 2018. Power producers generated almost 16 percent more electricity from gas in the first six months of the year while coal-fired generation was down almost 6 percent (“Electric Power Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, August 2018). As a result, power producers consumed an extra 650 bcf (16 percent) of gas in the first half of 2018 compared with 2017. Natural gas exports also rose, by 126 bcf, in the first half as new pipelines opened to Mexico and LNG terminals ramped up. Despite the enormous increase in consumption and exports, domestic production has been rising even faster, keeping prices low. Natural gas production (excluding liquids) surged by 1,413 bcf in the first half of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017 (“Natural Gas Monthly”, EIA, August 2018). The super-abundance of domestic gas production, coupled with the growing volume of exports and the increased use of gas in the power sector, is fundamentally altering the relationship between stocks and prices. Gas traders now anticipate a large potential increase in inventories during the shoulder season after summer air-conditioning demand ends and before winter heating demand picks up. To ensure there is enough storage availability, gas prices remained low over the summer to encourage power producers to maximise gas consumption, keeping stocks much lower than in recent years. And to limit the increase when it comes in the next few weeks, gas prices have to remain low to continue incentivising high power burn during the shoulder season. Low prices are also curbing new drilling, with the number of rigs targeting predominantly gas-bearing formations down to 186 last week, from a peak of 200 in mid-May, after rising steadily for the last two years. Because production is now so plentiful, the market is comfortable carrying lower inventories over the summer months. The calendar strip of futures prices for 2019 remains stuck well below $3 per million BTUs, a sign supplies are expected to remain plentiful, notwithstanding strong consumption growth and relatively low inventories. Most traders see little prospect of a sustained rise in gas prices. Hedge fund managers hold a net long position in natural gas futures and options equivalent to 1,336 bcf, down from 2,223 bcf on Aug. 21. Fund managers’ long positions outnumber short ones by a ratio of just 2:1, down from recent highs of 4:1 at the end of January and 5:1 in May 2017. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-09-19,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A looming ban on older diesel vehicles from Germany’s financial capital faces a legal challenge from the state government, deepening controversy over how to handle the fallout from an emissions cheating scandal that has rocked the car industry. The state government of Hesse said on Wednesday it would appeal a court decision that would ban highly polluting older models from the streets of Frankfurt from next February. Frankfurt is emerging as a test case on how to handle rising air pollution in German cities, following a landmark ruling by the country’s top federal court in February that opened the door to such inner-city bans. Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats who is fighting a regional election in October, said a series of measures he proposes would do as good a job as the diesel ban. “Planned measures, such as deploying electric buses, building better cycle paths and more park-and-ride offerings would in practice have the same effect as a general driving ban,” he said in a joint statement with Environment Minister Priska Hinz. The proposed bans follow scandals at Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and other German carmakers that were found to have exceeded emissions limits, leaving vehicles on the road that are far more polluting than their buyers were led to believe. Merkel’s government has, meanwhile, dithered over whether to require manufacturers to carry out costly retrofits on older models with exhaust-cleaning systems that would help reduce urban air pollution. Around a quarter of the cars on the roads of Frankfurt, whose population nearly doubles by day as commuters come into the city, would be affected by the court-ordered ban.  At first, diesel cars meeting Euro-4 standards and petrol-powered vehicles running to Euro-1 and 2 would be barred from the city. The ban would be extended to Euro-5 diesels from next September, but not to newer, Euro-6 models. Deutsche Umwelthilfe, the environmental group that brought the Frankfurt case, argues banning diesels is the only way to meet European Union clean air rules which stipulate that nitrogen dioxide pollution should not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air on average. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the Euro-6 emissions standard from selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, are also considering bans.

2018-09-19,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell BARCELONA, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Bullish, as a word, doesn’t quite capture the stampede of optimism that was gushing out from the natural gas industry at its biggest annual event this week in Barcelona. “The demand is there,” stated Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in confirming that his country was on track to lift its output to 100 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel by 2023. Al-Kaabi’s remarks were among the more measured at the GasTech conference, with some executives making predictions that the market for LNG, currently around 300 million tonnes a year, will more than double by 2025. Speaker after speaker on the top-level panels offered up various versions of the view that natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel from dirtier and coal and crude oil to renewables, but is now a major part of world’s energy mix for the long term. But in stark contrast to the swathes of optimism, there was very little talk of when the next round of major LNG projects will reach the stage of final investment decisions (FID). If the denizens of the natural gas industry truly believe in the forecasts of rapid and strong growth in LNG demand, led by emerging buyers in Asia and China’s ongoing embrace of the cleaner-burning fuel, it would be logical to expect a new round of project approvals. Instead, progress toward FIDs for many of the planned projects around the world appears glacial. The exception to this slow process are those developers who have access to capital and can take higher investment risks than more cautious energy companies, who have to satisfy not only a board of directors, but also bankers and shareholders. Qatar’s planned additional 23 million tonnes of LNG capacity is a case in point. The small Middle Eastern country has the capital to underpin such a decision, and its low-cost structure means it can still prosper even if the extra capacity turns out to be surplus to market needs, thereby lowering prices. Another exception appears to be Russia’s Novatek, the developer of the Yamal LNG facility. Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson told a media briefing at GasTech that the company’s planned Arctic-2 project would add 20 million tonnes of LNG, taking his company’s total output to about 37.5 million tonnes by 2025. Mikhelson expressed confidence that the funding for the new venture would be secured, and also that there was no doubt in his mind that Asia would soak up the additional LNG. While Mikhelson may well be correct, and is prepared to invest to back his vision, Western oil companies may find it harder to get the necessary approvals. There is no shortage of LNG projects around the world, with several planned in Canada, the United States, east Africa and Australia. But the scars from the last round of major LNG developments perhaps haven’t quite healed, and are fresh in the memories of many would-be developers. Over the past decade Australia has built eight new LNG projects, at a cost of more than $200 billion, and will at least temporarily overtake Qatar as the world’s top producer when the last two come online later this year, or early in 2019. However, many of the projects ran over budget and were delayed, and the surge of supply caused spot LNG prices to at one stage fall to around a quarter of the record levels reached in 2011. The other major contributor to LNG supply has been the United States, which now has two operating LNG export facilities, and four more under construction and likely to be producing by 2020. But, if the demand forecasts for annual LNG trade to rise from the current 300 million tonnes per annum to something closer to 450 million tonnes, or even more, by 2025 are accurate, then there isn’t enough new LNG being developed. In theory, this should spark a new round of FIDs, but the LNG world has been changing at a rapid pace and the traditional methods of developing large projects appear unlikely to work this time. The traditional way of developing a multi-billion dollar plant was to underpin the financing by contracting long-term sales, most often linked to the price of crude oil. But LNG buyers no longer want these kind of deals, and are embracing the model of shorter-term agreement and spot purchases from a variety of suppliers. It would take a brave, or reckless, board of directors to sign off on project of up to $25 billion on the hope that if we build it, they will buy it. Bankers are also unlikely to be impressed with that sort of justification for a new venture. Projects in the United States now face the additional hurdle and uncertainty being created by President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China, with LNG now included in Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. The trade war may turn out to be a relatively short-lived affair. But, while it remains resolved it may well give pause to any planned FIDs in the United States. Overall, companies are going to have find new ways of underwriting project developments, or risk losing out to those developers that can afford to take the risks.

The deepening tariff row between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains and undermine the world economy, with Beijing adding $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods But markets appear to have taken cheer from China’s move to levy only a 10 percent duty on $60 billion of U.S. imports. Washington too removed some 300 Chinese-made items from the list of dutiable goods. World growth is undoubtedly at risk — a survey by ThomsonReuters and INSEAD showed confidence among Asian companies at the weakest in almost three years as businesses feared blowback from the trade war And Germany’s IW economic institute lowered its growth forecast for the biggest euro zone economy, noting the fallout from the trade dispute But hopes of Chinese stimulus to counter the impact on the economy, as well as a pledge by premier Li Keqiang not to use yuan devaluation as a tool in the trade war, reassured investors to some extent, allowing markets to build on Tuesday’s gains. MSCI’s index of global equities rose 0.2 percent to a two-week high, while emerging stocks too firmed for a second day, led by a one percent jump in Shanghai markets. An index of non-Japan Asian stocks also rose one percent Government bonds from the United States and Germany, typically instruments that benefit from political or economic turmoil, saw yields race to multi-week highs. U.S. 10-year yields stayed firmly above the key 3 percent mark . “Where we are today is in a period of relative calm as U.S. bond yields probe their highs, and we become accustomed to trade rhetoric and perhaps, blasé about the economic damage it will cause,” said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes “All things considered, though, the tariff spat could have been a lot worse. Investors reacted relatively well to the news.” European shares followed Asian counterparts higher though U.S. equity futures pointed to a flat opening for Wall Street following Tuesday’s bounce. Analysts noted that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week had invited Beijing to a new round of talks but some also reckon on a more conciliatory stance from China. “China are out of bullets. The fight is done and dusted. Now it’s just a question of how the Chinese can save face and say ‘alright we’re going to change, going to open up wider access not only to the U.S. but to the EU and Japan’,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth in London. “Their economy is export-led, they can’t afford for it to go out of control.” But for now, the yuan was lifted by Premier Keqiang’s pledge, touching its highest level since last Friday at 6.843 per dollar. That in turn allowed an index of emerging currencies to rise for the second day in a row. In another sign of markets’ new-found optimism, the safe-haven yen slipped to two-month lows against the dollar .  The dollar inched higher but stayed close to seven-week lows against a basket of currencies. Investors also sold government bonds, pushing up yields on U.S. Treasury bonds to the highest since May while German yields surpassed 0.5 percent for the first time since mid-June . Meanwhile, Britain’s exit from the EU will be discussed at a European Union summit in Salzburg. The pound rose half a percent to $1.3215 after data showed inflation hitting a six month high.

2018-09-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shale gas developer Cuadrilla will start fracking at its Preston New Road site in northwest England in the next few weeks, it said on Wednesday as it announced government approval for a second well. Hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure and was halted in Britain seven years ago after causing earth tremors. But the British government, keen to cut its reliance on imports as North Sea supplies dry up, has tightened regulation of the industry and gave consent in July for Cuadrilla to start fracking a first well at Preston New Road. After approval for a second well at the site, Cuadrilla said on Wednesday that it would begin work “in readiness to start hydraulically fracturing both wells in the next few weeks”. Cuadrilla said it would run an initial flow test of the gas produced from both wells for approximately six months.   The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in northern England alone could amount to 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, 10 percent of which could meet the country’s demand for almost 40 years. However, attempts to extract the gas have come under fire from local communities and campaigners concerned about the potential effect on the environment and ground water, and arguing that extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with the country’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. British energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said consent for the second well had been granted after the company had met a number of criteria, including showing it had the necessary funds to carry out work at the site until at least June 30, 2019. “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, further enhancing our energy security and helping us with our continued transition to a lower-carbon economy,” she said in an emailed statement. Cuadrilla first attempted to frack gas near Blackpool in the northwest of England in 2011, but the practice led to an earth tremor registering 2.3 on the Richter scale. The company said the quakes were caused by an unusual combination of geological features at the site, but they led to an 18-month nationwide ban on fracking while further research was carried out. The government has since introduced a traffic-light system that immediately suspends work if seismic activity of 0.5 or above on the Richter scale is detected. It has also increased monitoring standards, including checks on ground water. Fracking consent was introduced in 2015 as an additional step to the government’s regulatory regime and ensures environmental, health and safety permits have been obtained. “Our world class regulations will ensure that shale exploration will maintain robust environmental standards and meet the expectations of local communities,” Perry said.

2018-09-19,"TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - China will not stoop to competitive devaluation of its currency, Premier Li Keqiang stressed, hours after China hit back, with a softer punch than the one landed by the United States, in an escalating tariff war between the world’s largest economies. Addressing a World Economic Forum event in the port city of Tianjin on Wednesday, Li did not directly mention the trade conflict but said talk of Beijing deliberately weakening its currency was “groundless.”  “One-way depreciation of the yuan brings more harm than benefits for China,” he said. “China will never go down the road of relying on yuan depreciation to stimulate exports.”  China will not do that to chase “thin profits” and “a few small bucks”. Li went on to say that the world’s multi-lateral trading system should be upheld, and that unilateral trade actions will not solve any problems. His remarks gave a lift to the yuan [CNY=CFXS], which has lost about 9 percent of its value since mid-April amid the ongoing trade war. On Tuesday, Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods.  But Beijing is running out of room to respond to any further U.S. tariffs on a dollar-for-dollar basis, raising concerns it may resort to other measures to weather what could be a protracted trade battle. China has yet to publicly accept an invitation extended last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold a fresh round of talks, which China welcomed at the time. On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had no information on a possible trade delegation and questioned U.S. sincerity about wanting new talks, noting that the last round was followed immediately by the activation of new tariffs. “This has become a kind of U.S. routine,” he said. The United States wants to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its trade, technology transfer and high-tech industrial subsidy policies. Trump had warned that retaliation by China would trigger  tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese goods, on top of duties on $250 billion in imports that are already in place or threatened. China, which bought only $130 billion in American goods last year, has imposed or threatened tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. products. “China are out of bullets. The fight is done and dusted. Now it’s just a question of how the Chinese can save face and say ‘alright we’re going to change, going to open up wider access not only to the U.S. but to the EU and Japan’,” said Christopher Peel, chief investment officer at Tavistock Wealth in London. “Their economy is export-led, they can’t afford for it to go out of control,” he told Reuters. The new U.S. tariffs will begin on Sept. 24 at 10 percent and will increase to 25 percent by the end of 2018, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecasting a 0.5 percentage point decline in Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019 to 6.1 percent. Oxford Economics said in a note that China’s economic growth in 2019 could fall well below 6 percent, and said prospects for near-term easing in tensions were low. But, it added “the likelihood of de-escalation will rise over time as the increasing economic impact in the U.S. will make the Trump team less combative, and China realises that it will be hard to integrate more into the global economy without some concessions regarding its specific economic model.” Investors were relieved that the latest escalation was less severe than some market participants had expected, with Asian stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS rising on Wednesday and U.S. Treasury yields near four-month highs. China remains unafraid of the “extreme measures” taken by the United States, the People’s Daily newspaper said in a front-page article in its overseas edition on Wednesday. “To deal with the trade war, what China really should do is to focus on doing its own thing well,” said the newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party. “(China) is not worried that the U.S. trade counter measures will raise domestic commodity prices by too much but will instead use it as an opportunity to replace imports, promote localisation or develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing,” it said. The Global Times tabloid, which is affiliated to the People’s Daily, said the trade war was a chance to pursue greater global recognition of its financial markets and that it could open its A-share market more to listings by Western firms. Confidence among Asian companies has slumped to the weakest in almost three years as businesses fear collateral damage from the worsening trade war and China’s slowing economy, the latest Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed. Chinese firms were the most pessimistic since the poll began in 2009.

2018-09-19,"* Floods expected to grow in coming days * At least 35 people killed, mostly in North Carolina * More than 200,000 still without power By Ernest Scheyder WILMINGTON, N.C., Sept 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, which is bearing the brunt of Florence’s deadly deluge and where rivers are still rising while thousands of homes and roadways remain submerged. Trump’s trip to the state follows criticism for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000 in the U.S. territory. Trump plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina at about 10:30 a.m. local time and return to Washington D.C. at 6:15 p.m., according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 metres), quadrupling its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way”. Florence has already killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina where local media reported that two mental health patients drowned on Tuesday when the sheriff’s van the women were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned about 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of interstates 40 and 95. In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised”.

2018-09-19,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Bullish, as a word, doesn’t quite capture the stampede of optimism that was gushing out from the natural gas industry at its biggest annual event this week in Barcelona. “The demand is there,” stated Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), in confirming that his country was on track to lift its output to 100 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel by 2023. Al-Kaabi’s remarks were among the more measured at the GasTech conference, with some executives making predictions that the market for LNG, currently around 300 million tonnes a year, will more than double by 2025. Speaker after speaker on the top-level panels offered up various versions of the view that natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel from dirtier and coal and crude oil to renewables, but is now a major part of world’s energy mix for the long term. But in stark contrast to the swathes of optimism, there was very little talk of when the next round of major LNG projects will reach the stage of final investment decisions (FID). If the denizens of the natural gas industry truly believe in the forecasts of rapid and strong growth in LNG demand, led by emerging buyers in Asia and China’s ongoing embrace of the cleaner-burning fuel, it would be logical to expect a new round of project approvals. Instead, progress toward FIDs for many of the planned projects around the world appears glacial. The exception to this slow process are those developers who have access to capital and can take higher investment risks than more cautious energy companies, who have to satisfy not only a board of directors, but also bankers and shareholders. Qatar’s planned additional 23 million tonnes of LNG capacity is a case in point. The small Middle Eastern country has the capital to underpin such a decision, and its low-cost structure means it can still prosper even if the extra capacity turns out to be surplus to market needs, thereby lowering prices. Another exception appears to be Russia’s Novatek, the developer of the Yamal LNG facility. Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson told a media briefing at GasTech that the company’s planned Arctic-2 project would add 20 million tonnes of LNG, taking his company’s total output to about 37.5 million tonnes by 2025. Mikhelson expressed confidence that the funding for the new venture would be secured, and also that there was no doubt in his mind that Asia would soak up the additional LNG. While Mikhelson may well be correct, and is prepared to invest to back his vision, Western oil companies may find it harder to get the necessary approvals. There is no shortage of LNG projects around the world, with several planned in Canada, the United States, east Africa and Australia. But the scars from the last round of major LNG developments perhaps haven’t quite healed, and are fresh in the memories of many would-be developers. Over the past decade Australia has built eight new LNG projects, at a cost of more than $200 billion, and will at least temporarily overtake Qatar as the world’s top producer when the last two come online later this year, or early in 2019. However, many of the projects ran over budget and were delayed, and the surge of supply caused spot LNG prices to at one stage fall to around a quarter of the record levels reached in 2011. The other major contributor to LNG supply has been the United States, which now has two operating LNG export facilities, and four more under construction and likely to be producing by 2020. But, if the demand forecasts for annual LNG trade to rise from the current 300 million tonnes per annum to something closer to 450 million tonnes, or even more, by 2025 are accurate, then there isn’t enough new LNG being developed. In theory, this should spark a new round of FIDs, but the LNG world has been changing at a rapid pace and the traditional methods of developing large projects appear unlikely to work this time. The traditional way of developing a multi-billion dollar plant was to underpin the financing by contracting long-term sales, most often linked to the price of crude oil. But LNG buyers no longer want these kind of deals, and are embracing the model of shorter-term agreement and spot purchases from a variety of suppliers. It would take a brave, or reckless, board of directors to sign off on project of up to $25 billion on the hope that if we build it, they will buy it. Bankers are also unlikely to be impressed with that sort of justification for a new venture. Projects in the United States now face the additional hurdle and uncertainty being created by President Donald Trump’s escalating trade dispute with China, with LNG now included in Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs. The trade war may turn out to be a relatively short-lived affair. But, while it remains resolved it may well give pause to any planned FIDs in the United States. Overall, companies are going to have find new ways of underwriting project developments, or risk losing out to those developers that can afford to take the risks.

2018-09-19,"NAIROBI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Kenya’s president has proposed hiking taxes on mobile money transfer services and other money transfer services, documents sent to parliament this month showed, amid a tussle in government over how to boost revenues without hurting the poor. Uhuru Kenyatta proposed increasing the excise duty on mobile money transfer fees from 10 percent to 12 percent, documents reviewed by Reuters showed. Parliament is set to debate and vote on the measure on Thursday. The latest proposal comes as Kenyatta, re-elected last year after an extended and bloody election, seeks to implement planned tax hikes and other measures in this year’s budget that were designed to fund a range of government development goals including universal healthcare and affordable housing. Lawmakers and some members of the public have resisted the measures, particularly a new tax on petroleum products. Kenyatta said on Friday the tax is necessary, but that he wanted to cut it to 8 percent from 16 percent. Kenya’s biggest mobile phone operator Safaricom said in June it is opposed to a proposed tax rise on mobile phone-based transfers, arguing that it would likely mostly hurt the poor, most of whom do not have bank accounts and rely on mobile transfer services such as Safaricom’s M-Pesa. M-Pesa, which Safaricom pioneered in 2007, now has around 25 million users in the East African nation of 45 million, handling billions of shillings in daily transfer volumes. The model has been copied in other regional markets and beyond. Last month, lawmakers voted to delay the hike in fuel taxes for two more years, but the national revenue authority started collecting the tax anyway, triggering a strike by fuel transporters and public anger. They also voted to retain an interest rate cap that the International Monetary Fund has said must be scrapped or modified in return for a new standby arrangement. The existing standby arrangement expired this month. Kenyan businesses and ordinary people routinely complain of a heavy tax burden. Early this month, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) said the government could widen the tax base and increase the rate of tax compliance to 50 percent from the current 17 percent. It also urged the government to cut expenditure, reduce wastage of public funds and deal with corruption, which some past studies have found account for the loss of up to a third of the government’s annual budget.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Asia’s lead and open higher, with Britain’s FTSE rising 0.15 percent, Germany’s DAX adding 0.2 percent and France’s CAC gaining 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.95 percent. Global equities have been on a steady footing this week as investors looked past the latest escalation in the U.S.-China trade feud, seen by some market participants as less severe than expected. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.3 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rose more than 1 percent following a surge of 1.8 percent the previous day. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote China was likely to step up policy easing as a buffer against the negative effects of higher tariffs. “In our view, both monetary and fiscal easing will likely be rolled out to boost domestic demand and stabilise financial market sentiment,” they said. Australian stocks added 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI was little changed and Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.3 percent. The Trump administration said on Monday it will implement new tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese products on Sept. 24, with the tariffs to go up to 25 percent by the end of 2018. China hit back, saying it will levy tariffs on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, as previously planned, but cut the tariff rates. “There was relief as the United States set the initial tariffs at 10 percent, rather than the expected 25 percent, seen by some as a gesture that it was buying time for further negotiations,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. While global market reaction to the latest phase of the trade dispute has been relatively limited, the U.S.-China row was expected to heat up - a major worry for investors. “In reaction to China’s latest retaliatory move, Trump is now highly likely to hit back by adding tariffs to another $267 billion of Chinese goods. The trade war will only escalate,” said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “It remains to be seen if China holds back its anger and still holds negotiations with the United States. But if it opts not to, we’ll have to brace for the trade conflict dragging on into 2019.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week invited top Chinese officials to a new round of talks, but speculation has risen that Beijing would decline to attend after Washington fired its latest trade salvo. LONG-TERM U.S. YIELDS AT 4-MONTH HIGHS China’s yuan was up 0.15 percent at 6.8504 per dollar in onshore trade, supported by comments from Premier Li Keqiang that Beijing would not weaken its currency to boost exports. The Australian dollar, seen as a gauge of risk sentiment, stretched its overnight rally and rose to a near three-week peak of $0.7255. Safe-haven U.S. Treasuries were sold and their yields rose on the back of improved investor risk appetite. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stood at 3.049 percent after touching 3.059 percent overnight, its highest since May 23. The rise in yields in turn propped up the dollar, which climbed to a two-month high of 112.43 yen. The yen showed little reaction to the Bank of Japan’s well-anticipated decision on Wednesday to keep monetary policy steady. The BOJ also maintained its 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around zero percent. The euro inched up 0.05 percent to $1.1674. The pound shook off modest overnight losses and rose to $1.3175, its highest since July 26. Growing confidence that Britain and the European Union can secure an agreement has encouraged investors to buy sterling. Crude oil prices consolidated after rallying the previous day on signs that OPEC would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signalled an informal target near current levels.

2018-09-19,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - When the owners of Norwegian oil firm Aker BP (AKERBP.OL) decided to digitize its assets and operations, they searched high and low for the right software company. But they failed to find a suitable one. So instead they set up their own, Cognite www.cognite.com, to create digital maps of Aker BP's oil industry assets, integrating data from equipment such as pumps, heat and pressure sensors, maintenance records and even staff rotas to improve efficiency and safety. Less than two years later, Cognite is selling its software to Aker BP’s rivals and one competitor, Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum (LUPE.ST), has even agreed to share its real-time oilfield data with Aker in what they say is an industry first. “This will be the first time two different operators, or oil companies, will share operations/production data live from two producing fields, that is between Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen,” a Lundin Norway representative told Reuters. By combining all the data that typically sits in different digital silos - such as matching flow sensors with the piece of machinery they actually sit on - Cognite says its software can help reduce maintenance costs, extend the lifespan of equipment and avoid damaging breakdowns. Digitizing industrial assets can also mean fewer people need to be offshore, less downtime for oil platforms, more targeted maintenance and better analysis of information such as geological data and valve pressures. For Lundin Petroleum, sharing information from its Edvard Grieg field on the Norwegian continental shelf with Aker BP’s adjacent Ivar Aasen field makes sense because getting more real-time production data from a rival in a similar geological area could help it improve its own oil output. “Aker BP’s view is that, unlike seismic data interpretation for oil exploration, operational data is not a strategic know-how to be protected,” said its chief Karl Johnny Hersvik. For Aker ASA, the biggest shareholder in Aker BP and Cognite, the Lundin Petroleum deal is part of its plan to create software for an industry that can be improved and refined the more it gets used by different clients - rather than just focusing on an in-house model for Aker BP. “The value that Cognite’s technology brings to the Aker companies will increase with the number of customers Cognite serves,” Aker Chief Executive Oeyvind Eriksen told Reuters.  Aker ASA, which together with Aker BP owns more than 75 percent of Cognite, is even considering floating the company on the stock exchange within two years. Controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke here, Aker also has interests in oil, engineering and construction services as well as fishing. John Markus Lervik, a software engineer who founded Cognite, said it has grown from just 2 people to about 110 in 18 months, has clients in oil and shipping and is only planning 12-months ahead for now because “things are happening so quickly”. It might seem counterintuitive to share technological expertise with rivals, but by learning from usage across companies and industries, software can be improved - even if no oilfield specific data is exchanged. Improvements can then be rolled out to clients, including Aker BP. “To provide the algorithm and the software to be able to map or connect sensors to the right equipment, that’s a big challenge all oil companies and also other companies have,” Lervik said.   “The more companies we work with to create advanced algorithms to do this mapping, the more advanced, the more automatic, that mapping will be.” While Cognite is not alone in developing systems that can link masses of data historically kept in different systems, Alfonso Velosa at tech advisory firm Gartner www.gartner.com/en reckons when it comes to oil and gas, Aker is out in front for now. “Those systems tended to be stuck in proprietary legacy systems and this is now an approach that is trying to marry (them) together,” he said.  “This is a trend that’s coming down and they’re just ahead of the trend at the moment in the oil sector.” Other companies looking to bring thousands of data points together in the oil sector include Eigen www.eigen.co, a software firm in the United Kingdom founded by oil and gas engineers.  Chief strategy officer Gareth Davies said a new generation of people entering the oil and gas industry is partly behind the drive to come up with better digital systems.  “The guys who come in now who are in their 20s expect to have the information,” said Davies. “It’s like, well you have to go to that system, you have to ask him to log in there and he’ll export it here, and they look at you like: What are you talking about? That’s ridiculous.”  In one of its recent projects, Eigen digitally linked up 10,600 sensors on Italian oil company ENI's (ENI.MI) Golihere floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, the world's most northerly oilfield in production. The system brings together gas and pressure detection to prevent accidents and fire detectors, sprinklers and extinguisher systems, evacuation plans, life boats and other data into one stream of integrated information. “Up until now this would have been done through a monthly report,” Davies said. “You don’t want to know it every month, you want to know now.” Additional reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-tech-aker/focus-norways-aker-bets-on-software-engineers-for-its-oil-business-idUKL5N1VW52U,19 Sep 2018,"When the owners of

2018-09-19,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Rivers and waterways, swollen after Florence’s historic deluge, rose dangerously across the Carolinas on Tuesday, closing roads, inundating communities, hindering rescue and repair efforts and preventing evacuees from returning home. Though slow-moving Florence has moved into the U.S. northeast, allowing glimpses of sunlight in the waterlogged state, at least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days, the state said. “One thing we know is that sunshine doesn’t necessarily mean safety,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a late-afternoon press conference and warned the 15,000 residents living in shelters against returning home too soon. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of Interstates 40 and 95.  Florence, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before it was downgraded, has already killed at least 33 people, including 26 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina.  One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned some 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The White House said President Donald Trump would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters.  The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday.  “I haven’t been home since it started. I can’t get home either,” Chafin said. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised.” The Cape Fear River was also expected to keep rising in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has hampered efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow residents to homes.  Florence dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion litres) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said.  “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” Cooper said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appeared with Cooper and said his agency would help restore power and open roads. “I think the next 48 hours are going to be incredibly critical,” he said.  In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. More than 324,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina estimated on Tuesday 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 hogs died in the storm, exceeding the number killed in the state’s last major hurricane two years ago.  Property damage from the storm is expected to range from $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure.

2018-09-19,"BEIJING, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices on Wednesday pulled back from gains racked up the previous day, pushed down amid a surprise climb in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent crude futures had dropped 22 cents, or 0.28 percent, to $78.81 per barrel by 0042 GMT, chipping away at Tuesday’s 1.26 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 0.20 percent, or 14 cents, to $69.71 a barrel. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.2 million barrels to 397.1 million in the week to Sept. 14, according to data released on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute (API). That compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 2.7 million barrels. Stockpiles of distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 1.5 million barrels, the API data showed, compared with expectations for a 651,000-barrel gain. “The U.S. crude build temporarily grabbed trader attention,” said Chen Kai, head of commodities research at broker Shengda Futures. “Increasing fuel stocks in the U.S. and strong crude runs could lead to a bigger premium for Brent versus WTI.” Meanwhile, ministers from OPEC nations and non-OPEC producers are set to meet on Sunday to discuss compliance with output policies. OPEC sources have told Reuters no immediate action was planned and producers would discuss how to share a previously agreed output increase. OPEC with a group of non-OPEC producers that includes Russia started withholding oil supplies in 2017 to end a global glut and prop up prices. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed Saudi sources, that the kingdom was currently comfortable with prices above $80 per barrel, at least for the short term. Bloomberg reported that while Saudi Arabia had no desire to push prices higher than $80, it may no longer be possible to avoid it. U.S. sanctions affecting Iran’s petroleum sector are due to come into force from Nov. 4. Elsewhere, the latest escalation in the tit-for-tat trade war between the United States and China stoked worries over global economic growth and demand for oil. Beijing on Tuesday quickly added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.15 percent. Australian stocks added 0.35 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.1 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.45 percent. Equity markets in Asia took their cues from Wall Street, which posted a broad-based rally on Tuesday amid emerging views that the U.S.-China trade dispute’s impact on world growth might not be as heavy as previously feared. “The broader equity markets are able to regroup now that the latest phase of the U.S.-China trade war is over,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “There was relief as the United States set the initial tariffs at 10 percent, rather than the expected 25 percent, seen by some as a gesture that it was buying time for further negotiations.” On Monday, the U.S. administration said it will begin to levy new tariffs of 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese products on Sept. 24, with the tariffs to go up to 25 percent by the end of 2018. China said it will levy tariffs on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, as previously planned, but cut the tariff rates. Safe-haven U.S. Treasuries were sold and their yields rose on the back of improved investor risk appetite. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stood at 3.055 percent after touching 3.059 percent overnight, its highest since May 23. The rise in yields propped up the dollar in turn. The greenback climbed to a two-month high of 112.395 yen overnight and last traded at 112.300. China’s yuan was a shade firmer at 6.858 per dollar in offshore trade after edging up 0.15 percent on Tuesday. The Australian dollar, seen as a gauge of risk sentiment, edged up to a two-week peak of $0.7235 after advancing nearly 0.6 percent on Tuesday. The euro was flat at $1.1671. The pound shook off modest overnight losses and rose to $1.3175, its highest since July 26. Growing confidence that London and Brussels can secure an agreement has encouraged investors to buy into the British currency. Crude oil prices consolidated after rallying the previous day on signs that OPEC would not be prepared to raise output to address shrinking supplies from Iran, and as Saudi Arabia signalled an informal target near current levels. U.S. crude futures was 0.25 percent lower at $69.69 a barrel after surging 1.4 percent on Tuesday.

2018-09-19,"SHANGHAI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - China is not afraid of “extreme measures” the United States is taking in their trade war and will use it as an opportunity to replace imports, promote localisation and accelerate the development of high-tech products, state media said. The People’s Daily newspaper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party, made the comments in a front-page article in its overseas edition on Wednesday. The world’s two largest economies dove deeper into a trade war on Tuesday after Beijing added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. “To deal with the trade war, what China really should do is to focus on doing its own thing well,” the People’s Daily said. “(China) is not worried that the U.S. trade counter measures will raise domestic commodity prices by too much but will instead use it as an opportunity to replace imports, promote localisation or develop export-oriented advanced manufacturing,” it said. The Global Times tabloid, which is affiliated to the People’s Daily, said the trade war was a chance to pursue greater global recognition of its financial markets and that it could open its A-share market more to listings by Western firms. The United States has so far imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese products to pressure China to make sweeping changes to its trade, technology transfer and high-tech industrial subsidy policies. The new tariffs will begin on Sept. 24 and will increase to 25 percent by the end of 2018. Beijing has retaliated in kind but some analysts and American businesses are concerned it could resort to other measures, such as pressuring U.S. companies operating in China. Another Chinese state-owned newspaper, the China Daily, also said in an editorial on Wednesday the U.S. tactics would prove to be ineffective. “China has always managed to find the proper solutions to put its economy back on track,” the China Daily said. “The trade conflict will not force China to succumb to US pressure. Instead, given its economic resilience, it will squarely face those challenges, find the right solutions, and emerge stronger,” it said.

2018-09-19,"(Adds approval of payment to Petrobras) RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Brazil could face a diesel shortage at the end of 2018 as a result of the government’s mispriced subsidy program which has discouraged suppliers, and the state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA may be forced to sell diesel at a loss, broker INTL FCStone said on Tuesday. Brazil’s oil industry regulator ANP said it approved the payment of 871.5 million reais to Petrobras on Tuesday to compensate for the diesel subsidy. Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia had earlier told Reuters on Friday that the firm expected to receive 2 billion reais to 2.5 billion reais ($484 million to $605 million) from ANP within two weeks to make up for subsidies. Earlier this year, a nationwide truckers’ protest over rising diesel prices paralyzed Latin America’s largest economy and forced the government to lower diesel prices through tax cuts and subsidies. But the subsidy program announced in May has set prices too low to compensate most diesel importers, FCStone said in a statement. Companies have stopped selling the fuel, forcing Petrobras to supply most of the market at a loss and raising the specter of a shortage in the coming months, the commodity broker added. “Private imports are paralyzed, and Petrobras is practically the only agent bringing the product to Brazil,” FCStone said. “Unless oil regulator ANP raises diesel prices and starts paying subsidies, we will have diesel shortages in the last months of the year or Petrobras will have to face the cost alone of supplying the whole market at a loss,” FCStone said. The subsidy plan ended the truckers’ strike but it raised the specter of a new and costly round of state meddling in the affairs of Petrobras, still the world’s most indebted oil company. Brazil will need to import some 5.5 million cubic meters of diesel in the last four months of the year, a 12 percent increase over the same period last year, FCStone said. The growing need comes after an explosion in August at Replan, Petrobras’ largest refinery, hurt output and as a thriving agriculture industry drives demand higher. $1 = 4.1319 reais
