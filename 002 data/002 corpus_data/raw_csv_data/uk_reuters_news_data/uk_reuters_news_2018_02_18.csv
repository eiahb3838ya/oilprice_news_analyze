2018-02-18,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. investigators probing Mercedes maker Daimler have found that its cars were equipped with software which may have help them to pass diesel emissions tests, a German newspaper reported on Sunday, citing confidential documents. There has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit up to 40 times legally allowable emissions while meeting standards when tested by regulators. Daimler, which faces ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions, has said investigations could lead to significant penalties and recalls. The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said that the documents showed that U.S. investigators had found several software functions that helped Daimler cars pass emissions tests, including one which switched off emissions cleaning after 26 km of driving. Another function under scrutiny allowed the emissions cleaning system to recognise whether the car was being tested based on speed or acceleration patterns.  Bild am Sonntag also cited emails from Daimler engineers questioning whether these software functions were legal. A Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the content of the documents, saying the German company was fully cooperating with the U.S. authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the Department of Justice. “The authorities know the documents and no complaint has been filed,” the spokesman said. “The documents available to Bild have obviously selectively been released in order to harm Daimler and its 290,000 employees.”  Reporting by Edward Taylor and Emma Thomasson; Editing by Keith Weir",https://uk.reuters.com/article/daimler-emissions/software-may-have-helped-daimler-pass-u-s-emissions-tests-report-idUKL8N1Q8080,18 Feb 2018,"U.S. investigators probing

2018-02-18,"SHANGHAI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - China’s northwestern Xinjiang is planning a poverty relief scheme targeting the restive region’s 22 poorest counties, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Xinjiang, a huge region bordering Central Asia, has long been a security focus for Beijing, which has led a massive security clamp down there after deadly bouts of ethnic violence it blames on local Uighur extremists. The three-year poverty relief plan would target counties in the Xinjiang prefectures of Kashgar, Hotan, Kizilsu and Aksu, and would look to lift 400,000 local people out of poverty this year, the state news agency reported. It would see officials sent to 192 areas in the counties until 2020, by when the regional government aims to have found employment for 100,00 destitute people in the four prefectures, Xinhua said. Xinhua did not give an amount that would be spent on the drive, but said the regional government had been allocated 6.1 billion yuan ($961.57 million) in anti-poverty funds last year, of which 80 percent had gone to these four prefectures. The poverty-reduction drive is part of a broader push by China’s ruling Communist Party to tackle deep-rooted rural poverty and to raise the annual income of residents above the official poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($362) by 2020. China’s gross domestic product per person is $8,123 according to the World Bank. China brought 12.89 million rural people out of poverty in 2017. Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in the past few years in violence between Uighurs, a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language, and ethnic majority Han Chinese, especially in the heavily Uighur southern part of Xinjiang. $1 = 6.3438 Chinese yuan renminbi
