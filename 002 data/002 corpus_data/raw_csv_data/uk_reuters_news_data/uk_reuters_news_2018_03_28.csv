2018-03-28,"SAO PAULO, March 28 (Reuters) - A Brazilian government-backed institute said on Wednesday that new testing confirmed elevated levels of heavy metals in waters near the world’s largest alumina refinery, run by Norsk Hydro ASA , but the company for the first time questioned the validity of the scientific work. Marcelo Lima, a public health researcher at the Evandro Chagas Institute, a research facility linked to Brazil’s Health Ministry, told reporters the testing confirmed earlier findings of elevated levels of aluminum, lead and other contaminates in surface waters near populated areas around the Alunorte plant. Hydro, in an emailed statement, pointed to “serious technical and methodological failings” by the institute and noted inconsistencies in the data on chemical levels found in surface water in a February study run by Lima. The company, which has been forced to cut production following allegations of a toxic leak and could soon shut down three of seven alumina lines, also questioned the readiness of the Chagas Institute to carry out such testing. Hydro said its own evaluations had found no evidence of pollution. The Evandro Chagas Institute, in an emailed statement, acknowledged errors in its February report, which played a key role in a state court ruling that forced Alunorte to run at 50 percent of its capacity. But the institute said that the errors were typographical, the testing itself was correct and conclusions drawn from their work remains valid. A February thunderstorm dropped 200 millimeters (8 inches) of rain in 12 hours on the Alunorte plant, causing red water to flood streets, homes and areas of the Amazon rain forest near the plant, drawing the attention of authorities. Hydro said it was “undertaking a detailed investigation into what happened in Alunorte during the extreme rainfall in February” and would release its own evaluation on April 9, based on the work of internal and outside expert groups. Alunorte transforms bauxite into alumina, which is turned into aluminum at huge smelters. Hydro declared force majeure at the Alunorte unit in early March.

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Four U.S. states and 16 major automakers are launching a joint $1.5 million advertising campaign to prod Americans to buy electric vehicles. Automakers are investing billions of dollars to develop dozens of new EVs in the face of regulatory requirements, but face slow U.S. sales. General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp and many other companies, along with New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey, are backing the effort that was unveiled at the New York auto show on Wednesday. The campaign, dubbed “Drive Change. Drive Electric,” will focus on the benefits of electric cars. “Far too many drivers remain unfamiliar with the benefits of driving electric. Increasing sales of electric cars will deliver critical environmental and economic benefits across the region,” said Arthur Marin, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. Electric vehicle sales rose 25 percent in 2017 to a new record but still account for only 1.2 percent of U.S. vehicle sales. The campaign will initially focus in the northeast region and includes a new website, advertising, social media, strategic partnerships and events and other content efforts. John Bozzella, who heads Global Automakers, a trade group whose members include Toyota, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, said more education efforts are needed as automakers offer dozens of EV models. “The companies are effectively ahead of the customer,” Bozzella said in an interview. “We need to collectively help tell the story of the benefits of this technology and raise awareness.” Automakers are rapidly investing in EVs and say they plan to unveil dozens of new EVs in the coming years. They point to the growing range of EVs to travel on a single charge, lower battery costs and more recharging stations as all making the vehicles more attractive to customers. In January, Ford Motor Co said it would double its electrified vehicle spending. Reuters reported that global automakers plan to invest $90 billion in batteries and electric cars in the coming years, an amount that is still growing. Investments in electrified vehicles announced to date include at least $19 billion by automakers in the United States, $21 billion in China and $52 billion in Germany. Automakers also are reacting in part to pressure from regulators in Europe and California to slash carbon emissions from fossil fuels and mandates from California to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles.

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks stumbled again on Wednesday as jitters about major technology and internet companies pushed investors toward their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years. Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Apple Inc, once market leaders, mutated into an albatross just one day after concerns about other technology names sent stocks down sharply. Amazon fell 4.4 percent after reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is looking to target the company by changing its tax treatment. The 47-country MSCI global index sank 0.7 percent, enough to send traders piling back into the safety of bonds. Safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose in price to yield 2.777 percent, the lowest since early February’s market meltdown. That decline in yields chipped away at the spread between 2-year Treasuries, which yield 2.282 percent, and longer-term bonds. Some investors see a narrowing between those bonds’ yields as a sign the economy will sputter. “There’s a general rotation from risky assets towards safe-haven assets ... with weakened equities and trade war tensions in the general backdrop,” said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. The market’s losses were extended after China’s state-run Global Times reported that Beijing would soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports, reigniting fears of a U.S.-China trade war. Amazon, categorized as a consumer discretionary name rather than a technology stock, weighed on its sector, which also includes Netflix and which is grappling with the potential for trade conflict and investors’ growing impatience with high U.S. stock valuations. Apple dropped 1.1 percent after Goldman Sachs cut its March and June quarter sales estimates for the iPhone, citing weak demand. Wednesday’s stock rout came after tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 on Tuesday. Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc sank on Tuesday over data privacy concerns. Those social media shares pared their losses from the day prior after Facebook adjusted privacy settings to give users more control over their information. Nvidia, by contrast, added another day of losses after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber autonomous vehicle killed a woman. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.29 points, or 0.04 percent, to 23,848.42, the S&P 500 lost 7.62 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,605 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.58 points, or 0.85 percent, to 6,949.23. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.53 percent. [.EU] Asian stocks traded 1.75 percent lower, with Japan’s Nikkei ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent down 4.6 percent. Since hitting a record high on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The MSCI global index is down 9 percent from its high this year. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet Inc) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,” said SEB Investment Management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war. “The market is still nervous, and there’s a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. The dollar got some respite from its recent sell-off as revised fourth-quarter data showed U.S. economic growth slowed less than previously estimated and revealed the biggest gain in consumer spending in three years. The dollar index rose 0.8 percent, with the Japanese yen weakening 1.50 percent at 106.94 per dollar. Dollar gains put pressure on commodities. Spot gold dropped 1.4 percent to $1,325.21 an ounce.

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. demand for high octane gasoline could decline if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) changes fuel efficiency rules established under the Obama administration, analysts said. The rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, sought to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025. The EPA plans to declare by April 1 that the rules are “not appropriate,” thereby allowing the Trump administration to reopen vehicle emissions rules, two officials briefed on the matter said on Friday. Changes to the fuel efficiency rules could lead to more gasoline usage, said Andrew Linhardt, deputy legislative director for transportation with the Sierra Club in Washington. “More gasoline usage means more CO2, more pollutants in the air, dirtier air, and causing more climate change,” Linhardt said. In recent years automakers have manufactured more models that operate better with premium gasoline, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar Commodities in Austin, Texas. Premium gasoline, which has higher levels of octane, extends the mileage for a gallon of gas, thereby making it more efficient. The increased use of premium gasoline has raised octane demand, said Patrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy in Chicago. Sales of premium gasoline as a percentage of total motor gasoline have steadily risen since 2011, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed. In 2011, premium gasoline sales were 8.97 percent of total motor gasoline sales by U.S. prime suppliers, the data showed. In 2016, the most recent annual data available, premium gasoline’s market share increased to 11.52 percent. (For a graphic on premium gasoline's market share, see: tmsnrt.rs/2I7Xa6I) The RBOB futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $0.0005 to $2.014 a gallon by 2:10 p.m. EDT (1810 GMT) Premium gasoline for physical delivery on the Gulf Coast traded at 6 cents a gallon above the futures contract on NYMEX, traders said. By comparison, M2 conventional gasoline RU-DIFF-USG traded 10.50 cents below the futures benchmark. If the EPA were to ease fuel efficiency rules, manufacturers could reduce produce of vehicles with higher-performance engines, Fielden said. “That would increase the amount of regular gasoline versus premium and that would have a negative or neutral effect on this increase in the octane demand in the market,” Fielden said.

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly rose 1.6 million barrels last week, weighing on market sentiment. Brent June crude futures  settled 70 cents lower at $68.76 per barrel, while the front month May contract, which expires on Thursday, fell 58 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $69.53 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for May delivery fell 87 cents to $64.38 a barrel, a 1.3-percent loss. U.S. crude stockpiles rose as net imports soared by 1.1 million barrels per day, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S] Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S crude futures also rose 1.8 million barrels, EIA said. “Oil supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma are starting to replenish, which is bearish for prices, but they have a long way to go to near normal levels of supply,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. U.S. crude production also inched up last week to fresh record high at 10.433 million bpd. Output has risen by nearly 25 percent in the last two years to over 10 million bpd, taking it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of the biggest producer, Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent widened to as much as $5.22, the biggest since Jan. 24. “Costs in the U.S. are getting to be a little bit less expensive to drill and that’s one of the aspects that is potentially driving the spread between Brent and WTI,” Mark Watkins, a regional investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management said from Salt Lake City, Utah. Average breakeven prices to drill a new well in the U.S. range from $47 to $55 per barrel depending on the region, according to a Wednesday survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.  Brent prices have risen in seven out of the last nine months and have increased by more than 4 percent so far this year. Prices have also had three consecutive quarters of gains, the longest stretch since late 2010 and early 2011, after production curbs led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since last year. Wednesday’s price falls came despite Saudi Arabia saying it was working with Russia on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters on Tuesday that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending the short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices, with a partnership to manage supplies potentially growing “to a 10-to-20-year agreement.”  Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; editing by Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-9-oil-falls-about-1-pct-after-surprise-u-s-crude-build-idUKL3N1RA247,28 Mar 2018,"* U.S. crude stocks rose 1.6 mln bbls vs 300,000 bbl draw

2018-03-28,"(Adds details on gas subsidies payment in paragraphs 8, 9, details on ethanol price hikes in paragraphs 10, 11) BUENOS AIRES, March 28 (Reuters) - Argentine home heating gas bills will rise 28 percent to 40 percent starting in April, Energy and Mining Minister Juan Jose Aranguren told reporters on Wednesday, part of the government’s effort to cut the fiscal deficit. Under the previous administration, Argentines got generous utility subsidies that President Mauricio Macri, a free-markets advocate elected in late 2015, has gradually rolled back. “The system had been subsidized in an irresponsible way,” Aranguren said. After years of being locked out of the international capital markets following Argentina’s 2002 sovereign debt default, the government is trying to attract international investors in part by lowering the fiscal deficit to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product this year from 3.9 percent in 2017. But bigger gas bills ahead could stoke consumer price increases, which are already among the highest in the world. Twelve-month inflation in Argentina was 25.4 percent in February compared to 25 percent the month before. Argentina’s central bank held its benchmark rate at 27.25 percent on Tuesday, saying indicators suggested core inflation would remain high in March. In explaining its fourth consecutive decision to hold the seven-day interbank lending rate steady, the central bank said the pace of hikes in regulated prices for utilities and transportation would slow down after April. Aranguren added that he would sign a resolution on Wednesday outlining the payment process for the $1.5 billion in subsidies the government owes to oil companies under a natural gas production incentive program, which has been plagued by payment delays. The government will pay in 30 monthly installments beginning in January 2019, fully paying off the debts within two-and-a-half years. Separately, the Energy Ministry announced increases in local ethanol prices on Wednesday. Corn-based ethanol prices will increase 10.5 percent immediately followed by another 7.96 percent increase at the beginning of April. Sugar-based ethanol prices will rise 7.5 percent now and 3.54 percent in April. That means that at the beginning of April, corn-based ethanol will cost 13.16 pesos ($0.6534) per liter while sugar-based ethanol will cost 16.16 pesos per liter. Gasoline in Argentina is required to contain 12 percent ethanol. $1 = 20.1400 Argentine pesos

2018-03-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the $390 million sale of an oilfield in Nigeria, where the company is already under investigation over a separate deal. Dutch prosecutors confirmed they had received the complaint against Peter Robinson, a former vice president for sub-Saharan Africa. They said it would be included in an ongoing investigation into Shell and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) over the acquisition of a different Nigerian oilfield, known as OPL 245. Shell and Eni deny any wrongdoing related to OPL 245, in which Robinson is being prosecuted. A spokesman for Anglo-Dutch Shell said the two cases were unrelated. Chiara Padovani, a lawyer representing Robinson, said in a statement he denied any allegations of misconduct. Robinson has not been contacted by Dutch authorities about any such complaint, she added. “Our client regrets that an issue between him and his former employer has been drawn into the public domain. He has not been informed of the details of Shell’s complaint against him,” Padovani said. Shell said an internal investigation had found that Robinson may have committed a crime during the sale of an onshore oilfield, Oil Mining Lease (OML) 42, to local company Neconde Energy Ltd in February 2011. “We suspect a crime may have been committed by our former employee, Peter Robinson, against Shell in relation to the sale process for Oil Mining Lease (OML) 42 in Nigeria in 2011,” a Shell spokesman said in a statement.  “We have filed a criminal complaint with the Dutch authorities and are considering other steps we could take.” In a statement, Neconde Energy said it purchased its stake in the field following a competitive bidding round and made no payments to Robinson, Shell or other companies in order to facilitate it.  “Neconde completely denies any allegation or suspicion of kickback for the acquisition of its interest in OML 42 and the statement credited to Shell suggesting the contrary is untrue and most unfortunate,” the company said. Robinson is one of a number of Shell employees being prosecuted in Milan over OPL 245, a case spanning several countries that involves Nigerian government officials and oil executives in a $1.3 billion sale of the offshore field. The new evidence was uncovered after investigators looking into OPL 245 raided a house in Perth, Australia owned by Robinson, according to a source close to the process. The evidence included documents showing Robinson had set up a Seychelles-based company, which was later linked to two Swiss bank accounts set up in 2011 also under Robinson’s name, the source said. Shell suspects that the company and the accounts may have been used to process kickbacks, the source said. In court filings, the Milan prosecutor requested that Swiss authorities investigate and freeze two accounts opened at a Geneva bank in the name of Seychelles-based Energy Venture Partners Ltd to check their connection to Robinson. Reuters was unable to contact Energy Venture Partners. Shell, the largest international oil producer in Nigeria, was looking methodically at other transactions in which Robinson was involved, the source said. The spokesman said Shell had informed the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the offshore company and the accounts. Swiss federal prosecutors have supplied information to authorities in Italy and the Netherlands probing alleged corruption related to oil contracts in Nigeria, the Office of the Attorney General said on Wednesday.

2018-03-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s decision to expel Russian diplomats has split the Social Democrats (SPD), Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition partner, undermining her tough stance on Moscow just two weeks into a new government. Berlin is sending four diplomats back to Russia, joining other European states, the United States and others in a concerted response to a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in England which Britain blames on Russia. Moscow denies any involvement. “We must do everything possible to prevent a new Cold War with Russia,” Social Democrat Gernot Erler, government coordinator for Russia, told the Passauer Neue Presse. He said Germany had a clear and unshakeable position, “but we want to stay in dialogue with Moscow”.  While there is broad consensus on the response at the top of Merkel’s conservatives and the SPD, uneasiness among rank-and-file members of the SPD is growing.  Russia will likely be a key topic when Merkel gathers her cabinet for a two-day retreat at a castle about 65 km (40 miles) north of Berlin on April 10-11 to map out priorities for the year. The chancellor has regularly convened such meetings to allow deeper discussions far from the Berlin limelight. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and radical Left parties have already criticised the government’s stance on Russia and German business groups have also sounded warnings.  Merkel, who has a difficult relationship with Putin, and her SPD Foreign Minister Heiko Maas have repeatedly called on Russia to cooperate over the attack in England. Merkel says it is almost certain Russia was behind the attack and that Germany stands by Britain. Some prominent SPD members have gone further than Erler who stopped short of criticising the government.  Former European Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said any sanctions should be based on facts, not suspicions. “The view that if in doubt, ‘Putin and the Russians are responsible for everything’, is one that poisons thought and must stop,” he told the Augsburger Allgemeine daily.  Former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel said Verheugen’s comment showed “courage and a cool head”. While dissent among Merkel’s conservatives was muted, business groups are worried.  Sales to Russia rose last year for the first time since 2012 when sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis dented what was a 38 billion-euro ($47 billion) export trade. Exports in the first 11 months of last year were 24.1 billion euros. Germany also needs Russia for roughly a third of the gas it uses, and on Tuesday it said it had approved the construction and operation of the Russia-built NordStream 2 gas pipeline. The German Committee on East European Economic Relations warned against “over-hasty conclusions”, saying political reprisals risked a “spiral of escalation”.

2018-03-28,"(Adds detail on reason for court decision) By Marta Nogueira RIO DE JANEIRO, March 28 (Reuters) - A Brazilian court has blocked the inclusion of two top quality blocks in an oil auction this week, the mining and oil ministry said on Wednesday, adding that it plans to include the areas in future auctions this year. Oil Secretary Marcio Felix said the government would seek to undo the decision, without providing details. But he said success was unlikely before the round on Thursday, which will grant companies concessions to explore and produce in the areas. The move casts a big shadow over the concession-style auction by removing some of its most sought-after acreage. The two blocks withdrawn from Thursday’s auction are located in the offshore Santos basin and boasted minimum signing bonuses of 1.65 billion reais ($494.34 million) and 1.9 billion reias each. Both areas were thought to include geology from Brazil’s coveted pre-salt play, where billions of barrels of oil are buried under thousands of feet of salt beneath the ocean floor. The blocks also lie close to the Saturno block which is slated to be auctioned in June. By law, blocks within the pre-salt polygon must be auctioned through so-called production-sharing agreements, where companies compete to offer the government the biggest share of so-called profit oil after costs. Felix said the court’s rationale was centered on the fact that the government could make more money if it auctioned off the two areas through production sharing arrangements instead of concessions. $1 = 3.34 reais

2018-03-28,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland should decide how it manages one of Europe’s last ancient forests in the years ahead, not the EU’s top court, environment minister Henryk Kowalczyk said, setting up a possible confrontation in one of a series of disputes with Brussels. The European Court of Justice is due to rule in April on an EU complaint that Warsaw’s decision in 2016 to allow more commercial logging in Bialowieza Forest broke the bloc’s laws. Greenpeace and other campaign groups have said the logging allowed by Warsaw is threatening the UNESCO world heritage site  and its populations of European bison, lynx and rare birds. Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party - already at odds with Brussels over judicial reforms - has said it has the right to manage its own resources and the logging is needed to control a beetle infestation. Kowalczyk told Reuters he expected the court ruling would focus only on how Poland, the EU’s biggest eastern member, had managed the forest up to now.  The court “will not, however, indicate precisely future methods to protect (the forest), because it would be a transgression beyond its competence,”  told Reuters in an interview.  If the court made any specific recommendations about the forest’s future management, particularly if it banned any logging, then the government would have to discuss it, he added. Warsaw wanted to draw up its own protection plan for the forest, he said. “I expect that it will be a compromise between active and passive protection,” he added, without spelling out how many trees would be removed under an “active” scheme. An adviser to the EU court said in February that Poland’s decision to increase logging in the forest did break EU law. While judges are not obliged to follow the adviser’s recommendation, they do so in most cases. Separately, Kowalczyk said he was seeing some support in Europe and beyond for plans, backed by Warsaw, to let nations balance out their carbon dioxide emissions with absorption of greenhouse gases by forests. The plan would be discussed, he said, at U.N. climate talks that Poland will host in December in its southern city of Katowice - the centre of the coal-producing Silesia region. “The issue of absorbing emissions has its opponents, which is why we realise that these talks will not be easy. We will discuss this - first within the European Union,” Kowalczyk said.  Many countries want to focus more on cuts in emissions, reckoning the idea of absorption is a sideshow favored by coal-dependent states such as Poland. Kowalczyk said he had received a “clear declaration” from China’s special representative on climate change that Beijing was interested in the scheme. The minister reiterated that Poland wanted to reduce the share of coal in its electricity production to around 50 percent by 2050 from around 80 percent now.  “We will be moving slowly from coal to other sources, but it is important that it is not too abrupt,” he added.

2018-03-28,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas business activity continued to climb last quarter, driven by an improved oilfield services sector, but costs for goods and labor also rose, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said on Wednesday in its quarterly energy survey.  About 65 percent of the 140 energy firms surveyed in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana reported increased activity from a year ago. During that time, U.S. oil prices have climbed more than 30 percent to near $65 a barrel CLc1.  About 77 percent of the respondents reported an improved company outlook, with over 80 percent of oilfield services firms offering a better view for the future.  The uptick in activity is driving up costs, companies said, with the Fed’s index for wages and benefits climbing to 46.5 from 40.6 last year. Its index for service firms’ input costs rose by 14 percent from a year ago and over 50 percent from last quarter. Despite higher costs, the index for prices received for oilfield services fell to 35.7 from 44 a year ago. Less than half of firms reported receiving higher prices and 10.7 percent reported a decrease. “E&P companies are still holding service prices down at every turn. On the flip side, our costs of goods, fuel and wages are climbing every day. It is time for rate increases to ensure a profit and sustainability,” said one respondent.  On average, companies said they needed $52 per barrel oil prices to profitably drill new wells, $2 over the prior year’s breakeven. In the Permian Basin, companies said they needed $50 a barrel oil for new wells, also up $2 from last year. The higher breakevens come as companies are paying up for land. On Wednesday, Concho Resources (CXO.N) said it would buy rival RSP Permian in a deal valued at more than $70,000 per acre. Around 20 percent of the firms reported increased uncertainty from last quarter, driven partly by the Trump Administration’s decision to tax steel imports.  “The recent uncertainty regarding steel tariffs has the potential to create a major immediate shortfall in upstream drill pipe and to add significantly to costs, which would negatively impact the internal rate of return on many plays,” said one respondent who works for an oilfield services firm. The index for producer capital expenditures fell to 42 from 55.7 the previous year, a signal that oil and gas producers may be heeding calls from investors to boost returns rather than expand drilling at all cost.

2018-03-28,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale producer Concho Resources Inc on Wednesday agreed to buy rival RSP Permian Inc in an $8 billion all-stock deal that could trigger a wave of consolidation in the fast-growing Permian Basin oilfield. The proposed deal is the largest in the shale patch since 2012 and adds momentum to producers looking to expand drilling in the West Texas and New Mexico shale hub. Permian oil production has soared, now running about 3 million barrels per day and expected to grow by another 2 million bpd by 2025. Corporate mergers and acquisitions in the shale patch have been rare since the oil price collapse in 2014, although there have been large land purchases by Exxon Mobil Corp, Oasis Petroleum Inc and others. That could soon change, analysts say, with crude prices rising to above $64 a barrel. “We wouldn’t be surprised if the larger, well-capitalized Permian players leverage their market premium to go after the smaller Permian producers,” said Andrew Dittmar, senior analyst at PLS Inc., a data provider that tracks oilfield mergers and acquisitions. Smaller companies operating in the Permian, including Abraxas Petroleum, Lilis Energy and Jagged Peak Energy could be targets for consolidation, he said. Concho Resources’ bid is a 29 percent premium to RSP Permian’s closing price on Tuesday. The per acre price is more than $70,000, one of the highest in the Permian, according to PLS. Concho’s shares fell 8.3 percent to $143.84 while RSP’s were up about 16 percent, both in morning trading on Wednesday.  Last year, Exxon agreed to pay up to $6.6 billion to double its Permian Basin holdings and Oasis Petroleum paid $946 million in cash and stock, or about $46,600 an acre, to gain a Permian foothold.  The acquisition “allows us to consolidate premier assets that seamlessly fold into our drilling program (and) enhance our scale advantage,” Concho Chief Executive Tim Leach said. A deal would add about 92,000 acres in the Permian, increasing Concho’s total to 640,000, and lift its potential resources to about 2.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, the companies said. The combined company will be 74.5 percent owned by Texas-based Concho and have 27 rigs in the Permian, running the largest drilling and completion program there. [nBw34gllpa] RSP shareholders will get 0.320 of Concho shares for each of their shares, worth about $50.24 per share. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and expected to close in the third quarter of this year. “Obviously it’s a good marker for the market,” QEP Resources Inc Chief Executive Charles Stanley told Reuters on the sidelines of the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans.  His company recently said it would sell assets in North Dakota and Louisiana and focus on the Permian Basin, allowing Denver-based QEP to more quickly cover its capital expenses by production.     The oil industry has been discussing the merits of merging resources in the busy Permian Basin as a way to reduce operating costs and increasing shareholder returns. Costs for fracking service are rising about 10 percent to 15 percent as more companies expand drilling to take advantage of higher crude prices. The companies said including debt, the value of the deal is $9.5 billion. The equity value of the deal was calculated based on 155.53 million outstanding shares of RSP. “This is a significant acquisition and a lot of synergies that make sense, said RBC analyst Scott Hanold, adding the 29 percent premium was a reasonable price to pay. The acquisition is likely to add to Concho’s earnings in the first year after the deal closes, the companies said.

EPCG said in a statement on Wednesday that it would offer to pay 6.4 euros ($7.9) per share. According to the Montenegro Stock Exchange, RUP’s equity comprises 5.06 million shares in total. EPCG said it would bid to buy Italian utility A2A’s 39.49 percent stake, as well as all the other shares in RUP not owned by Montenegro’s government, which owns 31 percent.

2018-03-28,"GENEVA, March 28 (Reuters) - The world body linking national parliaments called on authorities in Venezuela on Wednesday to halt “harassment” of opposition MPs and efforts to undermine and usurp the powers of the opposition-led National Assembly. The opposition in 2015 won a broad majority in the legislative elections, but President Nicolas Maduro’s allies on the Supreme Court stripped it of many of its powers and systematically shot down every piece of legislation it approved. Maduro last year led the creation of a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly, which has no formal checks on its powers. Its creation led many countries around the world to describe Maduro as a dictator, a charge he dismisses as part of a campaign against him by the United States. The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose general assembly in Geneva this week was attended by 147 parliamentary delegations, recognises the National Assembly and not the Constituent Assembly. In a statement, the IPU’s Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians denounced “the scale of ongoing efforts, with apparent immunity, to repress opposition members and undermine the integrity and autonomy of the National Assembly of Venezuela.” It had received credible and serious allegations of human rights violations affecting 57 Venezuelan parliamentarians from the coalition of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD). “Since March 2017, close to 40 parliamentarians were attacked with impunity by law enforcement officers and pro-government supporters during demonstrations”, it said. In Caracas, Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment. Last week the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a commission of inquiry into complaints that Venezuela is violating standards including freedom of association and workers’ rights to organise. “In Venezuela these days, they are moving from crisis to crisis,” Martin Chungong, IPU President, told a news briefing. “The legitimately elected parliamentary institution is being subverted - the National Assembly that was elected by the people - is being subverted by an institution that is not largely recognised internationally, the Constituent Assembly,” he said. The Venezuelan delegation to the IPU assembly was composed of parliamentarians from the National Assembly. “Many of them expressed the concern that when they return to Venezuela they might be arrested at the airport on account of their participation in this meeting,” Chungong said. “So far, I think that the Venezuelan authorities have not gone that far as to really arrest systematically members of parliament,” he added. “But given what is happening in the country, you cannot rule that possibility out.” Reporting and writing by Stephanie Nebehay; additional

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index opened in the red in the United States and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.51 percent, all of which was enough to send traders piling back into the safety of bonds. Safe-haven 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose in price to yield 2.75 percent, the lowest yields since early February’s market meltdown, sharply shrinking the closely watched difference between spreads on the 10-year note and two-years at nearly 2.27 percent. German Bunds, seen as Europe’s most secure asset due to Berlin’s triple-A-rated finances, rallied hard to send 10-year yields back under 0.5 percent for the first time since early January. The rout in stocks came after tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 on Tuesday. Losses were extended after China’s state-run Global Times reported that Beijing would soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33.41 points, or 0.14 percent, to 23,891.12, the S&P 500 lost 2.63 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,609.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 54.43 points, or 0.78 percent, to 6,954.37. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.20 percent. Asia tumbled 1.5 percent overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent down 4.6 percent. Since hitting a record on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The 47-country MSCI global index is down more than 8 percent from its high. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple Netflix and Google) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,” said SEB Investment Management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. Amazon.com Inc fell more than 5 percent after reports that President Donald Trump is looking to target the company by changing its tax treatment. That came a day after Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc shares fell on data privacy concerns and Nvidia dropped after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber autonomous vehicle killed a woman. “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war. While the market remains highly vulnerable to news headlines like this, reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. “It would be in China’s interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “The market is still nervous, and there’s a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” he added. In the currency market, the dollar get some respite from its recent sell-off as revised fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth data slowed less than previously estimated and revealed the biggest gain in consumer spending in three years. The dollar index rose 0.46 percent, and the Japanese yen weakened 0.81 percent versus the greenback at 106.22 per dollar. Dollar gains put pressure on commodities. Spot gold dropped 1.0 percent to $1,331.48 an ounce. Benchmark Brent oil was last at $69.08, down 0.55 percent on the day as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders.

2018-03-28,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Demand for shipping is growing and could outpace the supply of new vessels next year, helping to boost profits at Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE) as it also reaps the benefits of a recent merger, the German company said on Wednesday.  The shipping industry has been in the doldrums for years as a slump in trade following the global financial crisis coincided with the delivery of scores of new vessels ordered earlier.  That sparked a wave of deals as firms looked to cut costs, including Hapag-Lloyd’s recent purchase of Gulf peer UASC to become the world’s fifth biggest container shipping company.  However, the Hamburg-based firm’s CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said on Wednesday that order books for new vessels were now relatively small compared with the economic growth that drives seaborne transport demand. “The idle fleet is also small and demand is growing, that makes us cautiously optimistic,” he told journalists after the company announced a surprise dividend and forecast a rise in annual earnings in 2018. “We are confident that we can improve profitability further and reduce our debts, while the realization of synergies (from the UASC deal) is also in focus,” he added. Habben Jansen upheld a January forecast for global container transport demand growth of 4.5 percent in 2018 and more than 4 percent in 2019. Demand and supply could be balanced this year, even though the first half will see more ships joining the fleet. But supply may start falling short of demand from next year, he said. Hapag-Lloyd said 85 to 90 percent of the $435 million in annual savings targeted over the long term from its tie-up with UASC were due to be realized this year. Habben Jansen reiterated the savings could eventually exceed the target, but he would only be able to provide details in the second half of 2018. Hapag-Lloyd said it would pay shareholders a dividend of 0.57 euro per share for 2017, after its core profit (EBITDA) nearly doubled to 1.06 billion euros ($1.3 billion).     It forecast a rise in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and operating profit (EBIT). A concern, however, is rising shipping fuel costs, driven by an increase in crude oil prices. Shipping fuel costs are currently around 27 percent above the $318 a tonne seen in 2017.     Hapag-Lloyd shares were up 2.3 percent to 30.72 euros at 1515 GMT.

2018-03-28,"(Drops paragraph 7 of March 27 story to remove incorrect reference to government subsidies) By Anirban Paul and Ahmed Farhatha March 27 (Reuters) - Canadian railway operators see a lucrative opportunity to transport more crude oil to the United States as a rise in output force producers to find new routes to its southern neighbor. However, their need for long-term contracts and the pressure to move a surplus of grains in the country is making it hard to cash-in on the prospect. Canada moves about 95 percent of its oil by pipelines, which are currently full. A 20 percent rise in crude production in the past five years has increased pressure to find new ways to haul the commodity, with rail being the second cheapest alternative. Analysts expect railway operator Canadian Pacific Railway to see a more than 60 percent rise in the volumes of crude it ships this year, but the company and its rival Canadian National Railway (CN) are being cautious about going all-in. With oil prices volatile and three pipeline expansions due to come on line at the end of decade, railways worry that any investment will be at risk in two or three years and could undercut their money-making base - moving grains. “Rails don’t view crude by rail as a sustainable business, but rather, one that is driven by short-term dislocations in crude prices,” said Stifel analyst Michael Baudendistel. In 2017, 23 percent of Canadian Pacific’s revenue came from grains and only 3 percent from crude, according to data by Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier. Canadian National saw 13 percent of its revenue from grains and 2 percent from crude, in the same period. “We understand crude is only going to be here for a certain period of time,” Canadian Pacific’s Chief Executive Officer Keith Creel said in a fourth-quarter results call with analysts. “We’re looking for strategic partners with long-term objectives that align with ours. We’re not going to allow ourselves to be commoditized.” Still, RBC analyst Walter Spracklin says Canadian National and Canadian Pacific could see, respectively, 5 and 11 percent upside in earnings this year helped by crude shipments, if oil sands production increases by 315,000 barrels per day. Other analysts expect even more of an impact to their bottom lines. LONG-TERM PACTS NEEDED Rail companies are reluctant when it comes to monthly, spot deliveries and the inherent volatility of the oil markets make it hard for them to get long-term commitments here from vendors. Cenovus Energy, which expects to double its daily output to 350,000 barrels during the first quarter over last year, recently complained that transport bottlenecks had made it impossible to haul oil. The company said it was having “ongoing discussions” with rail operators to resolve the shortage of rail hauling capacity. Railway operators cannot think of one to three-year investments when they invest in tank cars that are intended for a more than 30-year life span, said Genscape analyst Mike Walls. Producers on the other hand are wary of the long-term commitments railways are asking for, which is costlier than pipelines. To make a rough estimate, pipelines cost about $6-$12 per barrel to move crude from Hardisty in Alberta to the Gulf Coast, while it costs about $16-$18 per barrel when using rail. Major pipelines are expected to complete capacity expansions by 2020. Enbridge Inc is expected to double the capacity of an existing line to 760,000 barrels per day, while Kinder Morgan Canada plans to triple its capacity with the expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline beginning 2020. TransCanada Corp said last month it expects to start construction on its $8 billion Keystone XL expansion in 2019 and it will take about two years to complete here The International Energy Agency says crude shipments by rail will ease to 170,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) in 2020 from about 250,000 bbl/d in 2018, when Enbridge’s Mainline pipeline is expected to complete a capacity expansion. But until that happens, railways could move more than 400,000 barrels of oil per day and movements could even be higher if pipelines face further delays, said IHS Markit analyst Kevin Birn. “They want longer term commitments from oil producers and we think those commitments will be made... (but) the long term role depends on pipes,” he said.

2018-03-28,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco finalised a deal on Wednesday with Malaysian state energy company Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) to invest in a refinery project off Malaysia. Saudi oil giant Aramco agreed in February last year to buy a $7 billion stake in Petronas’s Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project, but the issue was then delayed by “technical issues”. RAPID is a $27 billion project located between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, conduits for Middle East oil and gas bound for China, Japan and South Korea. The two companies said in a statement that they signed the deal on Wednesday but did not confirm the value of Aramco’s investment. Saudi Aramco will supply 50 percent of the refinery’s crude oil with an option of increasing it to 70 percent, the statement said.  The development will contain a 300,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and a petrochemical complex with a capacity of 7.7 million metric tonnes a year.

2018-03-28,"RIYADH (Reuters) - A missile attack this week on Riyadh has raised the risk of an escalation in the Yemen war in a region riven with interwoven conflicts, but a direct confrontation between arch-foes Saudi Arabia and Iran still appears unlikely. Saudi Arabia’s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now touring the United States, must balance animosity towards Iran with the need for stability as he pitches the kingdom’s economic transformation plan to foreign investors and drums up support for containing Iran’s regional influence. However, Iranian authorities - facing the prospect of a more hawkish U.S. administration with Donald Trump’s appointments last week of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo as national security adviser and secretary of state - might crank up pressure in the Yemen war as a form of deterrence, diplomats and analysts say. Saudi Arabia sharpened its rhetoric against Tehran after Saudi forces shot down a flurry of missiles launched by the Iran-aligned Houthis on Saudi cities late on Sunday. One of the missiles caused the war’s first casualties in the Saudi capital Riyadh when falling debris struck a home and killed an Egyptian man and injured two others. Saudi King Salman, in comments carried by state media, pledged on Tuesday to “firmly and decisively thwart any hostile attempts” targeting the kingdom’s security and stability.  A day earlier, the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement accused it of using Iranian-made missiles and said that Saudi Arabia reserved the right to respond to Iran when and how it deemed appropriate. The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 in a campaign to restore its internationally recognised government after it was driven into exile by Houthi forces. “Iran is the appendicitis in the body of the world and should fix itself or else the world will fix the Iranian situation,” spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said. Iran has repeatedly denied giving missiles to the Houthis. Analysts said that in the short term, the Saudi leadership is unlikely to respond aggressively amid increased international scrutiny of the three-year-old Yemen conflict, which has given rise to the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. “Prince Mohammed would like to be viewed as a more restrained and composed leader” while touring his closest Western ally, the United States, according to Ehsan Khomen, MENA strategist at MUFG consultancy. “(He) may leverage the recent Houthi missile attacks to strengthen his narrative that Iran’s encroachment is undermining regional stability and that a more concerted international effort is needed to contain Iran.” The Yemen conflict pits a coalition of Western-friendly states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Houthis, who are sympathetic to Iran but deny being a pawn of its Shi’ite Muslim theocracy. Yemen’s war fits into a broader decades-long struggle for supremacy between Middle East powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia, which fund and train proxy forces in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and  accuse each other of backing terrorism. Military escalation in response to the latest rocket salvo could mean more coalition air strikes - which have been widely criticised for killing civilians - or mobilising the Saudi National Guard from a mostly static position along the border to undertake a concerted ground assault inside northern Yemen. Diplomats and analysts say that the coalition has few other options short of direct action against an Iranian target, something that remains unlikely unless a Houthi rocket takes out a valuable Saudi asset. Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh that were intercepted, the coalition responded by shutting Yemen’s airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation, and it was partially lifted. “They may make similar moves in order to be seen to be doing something, but it won’t really change the dynamics of the conflict,” said Jane Kinninmont, Middle East expert at Chatham House in London.  “My concern is that they could be tempted to take some action directly against some Iranian target, and that any such course of action could escalate further.” Consultancy Eurasia Group said that a successful Houthi strike on a prized Saudi target would probably prompt a firm military response from Riyadh to try to deter Iran. Analysts said that while a direct Saudi-Iranian showdown is unlikely, miscalculation remains a risk. Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to Yemen’s war. But they also support Riyadh’s argument that it needs to defend itself from cross-border strikes and limit the spread of Iran’s imprint in territory overlooking important trade routes. The United Nations says more than 10,000 people have died in the war, and 22.2 million Yemenis - three-quarters of the population - need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history. Analysts said that while Saudi Arabia will probably double down on its military campaign in Yemen to oust the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and reinstate President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, it may continue to support mediation efforts. However, the appointments of Bolton and Pompeo in Washington could encourage Iran to ramp up activities in Yemen to signal its ability and willingness to undermine the United States and its partners, Eurasia Group said. Economists have played down the impact of the Houthi attacks on the Saudi economy, which Prince Mohammed is trying to wean off oil exports with a slate of reforms that include cutting energy subsidies and expanding the private sector. Investors may have already largely priced in risks from Houthi missile strikes. But an intensification of the Yemen conflict and certainly an escalation to direct conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia could scare off foreign investors.

2018-03-28,"* Tech sector falls again on worries about more regulation * Trade worries simmer as China flags retaliatory tariffs * Bond yields fall as investors review policy expectations * World stocks facing first quarterly fall in two years * Wall Street set to open flat to lower By Marc Jones LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Stocks stumbled again on Wednesday, as jitters about a U.S.-China trade war and regulatory crackdown on tech firms such as Facebook left investors facing their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years. Europe’s main bourses fell as much as 1 percent in their fifth sell-off in six and the tech-heavy Nasdaq opened in the red in the United States again, all of which was enough to send traders piling back into the safety of bonds. German Bunds, seen as Europe’s most secure asset due to Berlin’s triple-A-rated finances, rallied hard to send 10-year yields back under 0.5 percent for the first time since early January as U.S. Treasuries nudged toward 2.75 percent. The rout in stocks came after the tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 on Tuesday. Losses were extended after China’s state-run Global Times reported that Beijing would soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports. Since hitting a record on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The 47-country MSCI global index is down 9 percent from its high. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple Netflix and Google) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,” said SEB Investment Management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.4 percent having been as far as 1.1 percent in the red early on when the region’s tech sector went down 2.6 percent. Nasdaq and S&P 500 went south again too in early deals to add to what has already been a $400 billion wipe out for the FAANGs alone since mid-March. Tuesday’s battering saw the Nasdaq slump almost 3 percent and the broader S&P drop 1.7 percent. As well as the Facebook nosedive, Twitter fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet slid 4.5 percent. Asia tumbled 1.5 percent overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent down 4.6 percent. Another weak U.S. spot had been Nvidia, which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber autonomous vehicle killed a woman. “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war. While the market remains highly vulnerable to news headlines like this, reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. “It would be in China’s interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “The market is still nervous, and there’s a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” he added. In the currency market, the dollar get some respite from its recent selloff as revised fourth-quarter U.S. economic growth data slowed less than previously estimated and revealed the biggest gain in consumer spending in three years. The greenback bounced 106.13 yen having earlier been changing hands at 105.51 yen which was not far from Monday’s 16-1/2-month low of 104.56. It knocked the euro off a near a six-week high too. The shared currency was bacl below $1.24 but still on track to post its fifth consecutive quarter of gains. It is up more than 3 percent since the start of January. Comments on Tuesday by ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny, who said the central bank will probably decide this summer to cull its bond purchases and warned that the ECB must not fall “behind the curve”, had helped underpin the euro. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield hit a two-month low below 0.500 percent though, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.76 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. The two-year yield stood at 2.26 percent. “There’s a general rotation from risky assets towards safe haven assets ... with weakened equities and trade war tensions in the general backdrop,” said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. In commodity markets meanwhile, oil prices slipped as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders. U.S. WTI crude futures dropped 0.8 percent to $64.85 while Brent crude futures traded 0.7 percent lower at $69.95 per barrel, off Monday’s high of $71.05, which was its highest since late January. Gold eased down from a five-week high to just under $1,340 per ounce. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo

2018-03-28,"(Corrects headline and first paragraph to say turnover touched a six-year high, not seven-year high) COLOMBO, March 28 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares hit a nine-week closing low on Wednesday, but turnover touched a six-year high as foreign investors exited from Lanka ORIX Leasing Company Plc. The Colombo stock index ended 0.23 points weaker at 6,440.20, its lowest closing level since Jan. 23. LOLC Holdings (Private Ltd) bought nearly 30 percent stake in its own subsidiary, Lanka Orix Leasing Company Plc, from ORIX Corporation of Japan, the company said in a disclosure to the bourse. The Japanese firm’s stake sale resulted in a foreign fund outflow of a net 12.7 billion rupees ($81.62 million) worth shares on Wednesday, reversing the year-to-date net foreign inflow to a net 5.3 billion rupees worth outflow. This was the highest net outflow in the last nine years for which data is available. Turnover stood at 13.4 billion rupees ($86.12 million), the highest since March 16, 2012, and well above this year’s daily average of around 1.2 billion rupees. “The biggest trade was the LOLC deal. Apart from that, there was no improvement in sentiment as investors are waiting for the outcome of the no-confidence motion against the prime minister,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers. Losses in shares such as Ceylinco Insurance Plc, which fell 6.8 percent, and Ceylon Theatres Plc, which ended 4.4 percent weaker, offset gains by Lanka ORIX leasing Company and Dialog Axiata Plc, which ended up 2.2 percent. Shares in Lanka ORIX leasing Company rose 6.3 percent. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is facing a no-confidence motion, which will be debated on April 4 before voting. Analysts say Wickremesinghe needs support from many political parties to survive the vote. Negative sentiment over the island nation’s slower economic growth also weighed on the market, brokers said.

2018-03-28,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies look set to keep their deal on cutting oil supplies for the rest of 2018, five sources familiar with the issue said, although some producers are starting to worry that high prices may be giving too much stimulus to rival output. OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers have curbed output since January 2017 to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018, and meet on June 22 to review policy. The deal has boosted oil prices LCOc1, which topped $71 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014. They were close to $70 on Wednesday. But it has also encouraged a flood of U.S. shale oil, fuelling a debate about how effective the curbs are. “June will be a rollover until the meeting later in the year to make a decision for next year, depending on market conditions,” an OPEC source from a major Middle East producer said, referring to the supply-cuting deal. The source said achieving a balance between supply and demand in the second half of 2018 was “the most likely scenario, if production, demand and compliance levels stay as now.” The chance of a significant tweak to the deal being agreed in June is low, most OPEC delegates say. But some officials are privately talking about the issue, a sign that prices have risen more strongly than expected. “The level of oil prices from now until the June meeting is going to affect the decision at that time,” said a non-Gulf OPEC source, who asked not to be identified by name. “Prices between $60 and $65 can support the continuation of the agreement for the rest of 2018,” he said, referring to benchmark Brent crude. “A very high price could convince the parties to the agreement to reconsider it.” The deal has delivered an even bigger cut than called for, mainly because of a drop in Venezuelan production, where output is collasping due to an economic crisis. Compliance with the deal reached an unprecedented 138 percent in February. Another OPEC source also raised the possibility revising the agreement in June should the market become short of oil. But four more Middle East delegates did not expect any changes. For any change to happen in June, top exporter Saudi Arabia would have to be on board, and there is no sign of that yet.   Saudi Arabia says OPEC and its allies will need to continue cooperating on supply curbs not just for the rest of 2018 but into 2019.  The producers are working on a framework for future cooperation, which they say will be discussed in June. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to extend their alliance over many years.  Over the past year, Saudi Arabia has emerged as OPEC’s leading supporter of measures to boost prices, a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years. It wants long-dated oil prices to trade at $70 a barrel.  Industry sources have linked this shift to Saudi Arabia’s desire to support the valuation of state oil company Aramco IPO-ARAM.SE, in which the kingdom is planning to sell a minority stake. Others in OPEC, notably Iran, have lower price aspirations, saying $70 oil benefits alternative energy providers too much. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told the Wall Street Journal in March that OPEC could agree in June to start easing the curbs in 2019. He also said OPEC should aim for oil around $60 to contain the growth of oil produced from shale.

2018-03-28,"(Adds detail, government reaction, background) VIENNA, March 28 (Reuters) - An Austrian administrative court has approved Vienna Airport’s plan to build a third runway, the company said on Wednesday, more than ten years after the project was first submitted for review. The court had to decide again on the issue after Austria’s Constitutional Court annulled its first ruling, which blocked the expansion project for environmental reasons. “Vienna Airport welcomes the positive legal decision announced today by the federal administrative court in favour of the third runway,” Vienna Airport said in a statement. Airport expansion is a hot topic in Europe, pitting local residents and environmentalists against airlines, airports and businesses. Law experts see the Austrian case as potentially having implications for other major infrastructure projects. Austrian Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache also welcomed the court ruling. “This could save and create tens of thousands of jobs,” he said in a statement. Vienna Airport, which handled 24 million passengers last year and can currently deal with 30 million per year, says it needs the third runway to handle a further increase in passenger numbers, ensure Austrian businesses’ competitiveness and cope with rival foreign airports in Munich, Zurich and Bratislava. Several airlines, including Ryanair, British Airways owner IAG’s low cost unit Vueling, and Easyjet have announced expansion plans for Vienna in recent months. The administrative court was not immediately available for comment.

2018-03-28,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 28 (Reuters) - Recent price gyrations for iron ore in China caused by swings in sentiment over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel are masking a broader downward trend. In recent days spot iron ore prices in the world’s largest importer have alternated between slumping as trade war fears mount, or rallying as these same fears moderate. The price action is being driven by the news cycle and the seeming chaotic way in which the Trump administration is implementing its trade policies. The spot price at China’s Qingdao port for 62 percent iron ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday to close at $63.90 a tonne, while the price for the same grade as assessed by Metal Bulletin .IO62-CNO=MB rose 1.3 percent to end at $65.17. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, benchmark iron ore futures increased 1.1 percent to close at 443.5 yuan ($70.73) a tonne, while Shanghai steel rebar futures gained 1.5 percent to 3,413 yuan. These small gains came amid signs that the Trump administration and the authorities in Beijing may be prepared to sit down and negotiate to avoid a trade war. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told visiting U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that Beijing is working towards dialogue with the United States on trade but is prepared for a trade war, state television reported. The gains also came as another country, South Korea, appeared to reach a deal to avoid the implementation of the Trump administration’s tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium. A pattern seems to have emerged since Trump first announced the planned tariffs on March 2, in which prices for the targeted commodities first decline on the initial news, then recover somewhat as it becomes clearer that the United States will provide exemptions to certain nations. But it’s also important to note that prices don’t recover nearly as much as they slump. Spot iron ore was at $79.55 a tonne on March 1, the day before Trump’s announcement, after which it fell for 11 straight days to end at $69.80 on March 12. A recovery over the next few days saw it end $71.65 a tonne on March 15, before starting to fall again, this time dropping to $66.90 on March 20. A small increase to $68.15 a tonne on March 22 was ended by Trump’s announcement of planned tariffs on some $60 billion of Chinese goods, which sparked the retreat to $63.50 on March 26, a four-month low. While it’s easy to be caught up in the daily news cycle, especially given the dramatic nature of the twists and turns of Trump’s announcements and subsequent developments, it should not distract from the overall picture. Spot iron ore prices have effectively been in retreat since late February, and are down 20 percent since the peak on Feb. 26. A combination of a well-supplied market and some easing of optimism over China’s steel demand, as well as record high inventories at Chinese ports, have contributed to the overall bearish market. At last week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth, a poll of the participants found that the average price forecast for 2018 was around $65 a tonne. An average price of $65 for 2018 suggests that the price may be below that level for some time during the year, given it has spent most of the first quarter above the forecast. The majority of the delegates were either iron ore miners, contractors or traders, with not many buyers in evidence, meaning that those making the forecasts stood to benefit most from higher prices. The modest price forecast suggests that the industry is bracing itself for tougher times, without expecting a collapse in demand. This reflects the view that China’s steel demand will be relatively stable this year, and output likely to remain near the 831 million tonnes seen in 2017.

2018-03-28,"* Tech sector falls on worries about more regulation * Trade worries simmer as China flags retaliatory tariffs * Bond yields fall as investors review policy expectations * World stocks facing first quarterly fall in two years * Wall Street set to open flat to lower By Marc Jones LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Stocks toppled again on Wednesday, as jitters about a U.S.-China trade war and regulatory crackdown on firms such as Facebook left investors facing their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years. Europe’s main bourses fell as much as 1 percent as the fifth sell-off in six days showed little sign of losing momentum and sent traders piling back to the safety of bond markets. German Bunds, seen as Europe’s most secure asset due to Berlin’s triple-A-rated finances, rallied hard to send 10-year yields back under 0.5 percent for the first time since early January and U.S. treasuries toward 2.75 percent. The rout in stocks came after the tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 on Tuesday. Losses were extended after China’s state-run Global Times reported that Beijing will soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports. Since hitting a record on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The 47-country MSCI global index is down 9 percent from its high. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,” said SEB Investment Management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 1.1 percent with the region’s tech sector down 2.6 percent. U.S futures were pointing south again too. Tuesday’s losses saw the Nasdaq slump almost 3 percent and the broader S&P 500 drop 1.7 percent. As well as the Facebook nosedive, Twitter fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet slid 4.5 percent. Asia tumbled 1.5 percent overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent down 4.6 percent. Another weak U.S. spot had been Nvidia, which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber autonomous vehicle killed a woman. “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war. While the market remains highly vulnerable to news headlines like this, recent reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. “It would be in China’s interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “The market is still nervous, and there’s a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” he added. In the currency market, the dollar changed hands at 105.51 yen, not far from Monday’s 16-1/2-month low of 104.56, as the Japanese currency was supported by the risk-averse mood. The euro was perched near a six-week high, buying just over $1.24 and on track to post its fifth consecutive quarter of gains. It is up more than 3 percent since the start of January. That was despite economic sentiment in the 19-countries sharing the euro slipping for the third month in a row in March, a slowdown in bank lending and a dip in German import prices. Comments on Tuesday by ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny, who said the central bank will probably decide this summer to cull its bond purchases and warned that the ECB must not fall “behind the curve”, helped underpin the euro. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield hit a two-month low below 0.500 percent though, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.770 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. The two-year yield stood at 2.270 percent. “In short, markets had priced in policy normalisation by the world’s central banks too much,” said Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities. In commodity markets meanwhile, oil prices slipped as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders. U.S. WTI crude futures dropped 0.8 percent to $64.72 while Brent crude futures traded 0.7 percent lower at $69.62 per barrel, off Monday’s high of $71.05, which was its highest since late January. Gold eased down from a five-week high to just under $1,340 per ounce. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo

2018-03-28,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - European trader Vitol is storing gasoline on tankers offshore Singapore, Asia’s biggest oil trading centre, for the first time since 2016 amid oversupply and weak demand for the fuel, said four people that participate in the market on Wednesday.  The sources said that Vitol was seen storing gasoline aboard more than one so-called Long-Range (LR) tanker. The company does not typically comment on its trading operations. At least one of the vessels is the tanker Glory Crescent, a so-called LR-2 tanker, said one of the four sources.  The vessel is 105,000 deadweight tonnes and could carry the equivalent of about 800,000 barrels of gasoline.  According to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, the Glory Crescent was fixed on Feb. 27 by a charterer that was not revealed for a one- to two-month time charter for storage. The Aframax LR-2 vessel is currently at anchor offshore the city-state, the data show.  Since the start of 2018, gasoline market has been in a contango structure, where front-month prices are lower than later-dated prices which is indicative of a weak market. This month, the contango between March and April prices widened to as much as 50 cents a barrel. MOG92SGSDMc0 Typically, traders can store fuel in a contango market in expectation of the later rising prices, but the current contango does not justify, according to the sources.  “The contango is not wide enough to encourage storing gasoline but Vitol may have its own economics for doing so,” said one of the sources. In 2016, traders including Vitol, Unipec, Total and Gunvor were storing gasoline aboard vessels off Singapore as the contango deepened to $1 a barrel.  So far, Vitol is the only company storing fuel, the sources said. They were not expecting more to follow suit, although the market remained saddled with supplies despite recent refinery outages in Taiwan and ongoing refinery maintenance in North Asia.  The latest data from Singapore’s International Enterprise (IE) showed that onshore light distillates stocks held in the week to Tuesday were at a record of 15.635 million barrels. Over in Europe Gunvor, Litasco, Trafigura, Socar as well as Vitol had already used vessels to store gasoline this month following slow demand for petrol from the United States. “Refinery runs in the Atlantic Basin are at elevated levels, despite turnaround activities ... This had a cascading effect on Singapore cracks as the U.S. still sets the tone for regional gasoline cracks,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu of FGE.  Overall, gasoline demand in Asia this year is expected to lag 2017, she added.   The gasoline crack refers to the profit from refining a barrel of oil into petrol.

2018-03-28,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - OPEC is seeking “very long-term” cooperation with other crude exporters, the secretary general of the oil exporting group said on Wednesday. Mohammad Barkindo was commenting on news that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia were working on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for up to 20 years. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the plan in an interview with Reuters on Monday. Russia, the world’s biggest oil producer, has worked with the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in previous oil gluts to rein in supplies and push up prices, but a 10 to 20-year deal between the two would be unprecedented. “We are looking for a very long-term cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries,” Barkindo told an energy conference in Baghdad. OPEC states, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supplies from January 2017 to lift oil prices that plunged from above $110 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016. A deal to extend the pact, which has boosted prices to around $70 now, was agreed in November. The output cuts are now due to run until the end of 2018. “In addition to the 24 countries that came to sign the declaration of cooperation in November, we have six more producing countries who came to show solidarity,” he said. Several oil exporters have suggested a six-month extension to the supply pact, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi told the conference, without identifying the countries. Regarding Iraq’s own resources, the minister said OPEC’s second-largest producer might have oil reserves twice as big as indicated by current estimates of about 150 billion barrels. He said the crude market was stabilising and prices had “improved”, adding that a decision on whether to extend cuts beyond 2018 depended on meetings to be held by the exporters by the end of this year. Barkindo said OPEC was evaluating the impact of the supply pact to determine the “appropriate action” when it expired. In addition, he said investment in the oil industry was  increasing as oil prices recovered but had not yet reached the level before the downturn in 2014.

2018-03-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will look retrospectively at visas issued to wealthy foreign investors and consider whether action needs to be taken, interior minister Amber Rudd said on Wednesday when asked about Russians who had been granted them. Rudd was asked about 700 Russians who had come to Britain between 2008 and 2015 with a “Tier 1 visa”, given to people who want to run businesses in Britain who have at least 50,000 pounds ($70,750) in investment funds.     “The Tier 1 was already reformed in 2015-2016 and it has been reduced by 84 percent since then,” Rudd told a committee of lawmakers. “I have asked my officials to look at what reforms we may continue with and to take a look at previous ones over the past few years.”  “I have asked to look at the cohort of previous ones to see if there is any action that needs to be taken,” she added. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was right for Britain to examine whether that part of the visa regime was being used properly.

2018-03-28,"MUMBAI, March 28 (Reuters) - India’s Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) plans to build a $3 billion petrochemical unit to serve the Mumbai region, a company official said, to profit from the country’s expected surge in demand for petrochemicals as its economy expands. BPCL’s expansion is part of a national plan to spend $35 billion on petrochemical production in order to meet the expected increase in consumption of the chemicals for products including plastics, paints and adhesives. India currently only produces about 20 million tonnes a year of petrochemicals, less than the 40 million tonnes of demand expected for the 2017/18 financial year. Demand is expected to almost double again within a decade, according to a report from the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. BPCL earlier this month bought 500 acres (202 hectares) of land from a fertiliser unit of Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd , Hindustan Organic said in a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange on March 17. The land will allow BPCL to build a petrochemical complex that will use feedstocks from its Mumbai refinery, which processes 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, R. Ramachandran, head of refineries at BPCL told Reuters this week. The site is about 60 km (37 miles) from the refinery. “This (land deal) is fundamental to enhancing our petrochemical portfolio,” said Ramachandran. “Going forward, petchem consumption is likely to be higher than the conventional fuels so it is better if we start thinking in that direction now.” To transport feedstock to the new petrochemical complex, Ramachandran said there was a plan to build a pipeline from the refinery to a nearby port and tankers would then deliver the feedstock to the facility. Alternatively, he said a direct pipeline between the Mumbai refinery and the petrochemical facility could be built. He said the facility would focus on producing propylene, but also produce polyethylene at lower quantities. Ramachandran told Reuters the company had not been able to expand the Mumbai refinery for the petrochemical site because of limited land availability in the city. The petrochemical complex will be ready by 2023, he said. BPCL plans to pump feedstocks from the Mumbai refinery by pipeline to a nearby port to load onto tankers that will then carry it to the petrochemical complex, said a source familiar with the matter. BPCL already produces petrochemicals at its 310,000 bpd Kochi refinery in southern India. BPCL is also constructing a 52 billion rupees ($799.26 million) project at Kochi to produce chemicals like acryl, oxo-alcohols, and acrylic acid used in products like paints, adhesives or textiles, which Ramachandran said would be commissioned next year. BPCL also plans to build a petrochemical plant at its 120,000 bpd Bina refinery in central India. “We are targeting petrochemical production equivalent to 10 to 15 percent of our crude processing in the long run,” he said. $1 = 65.0600 Indian rupees

2018-03-28,"SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - China’s launch of a crude oil contract this week on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) allows investors for the first time to take advantage of differences in supply-demand dynamics across world oil markets. Oil markets have until now been dominated by two financial futures instruments: U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Europe’s Brent crude. WTI is the main benchmark for U.S. crude grades and a crucial hedging tool for the U.S. oil industry. Brent, priced off North Sea oil, is the primary value marker for Europe, Middle East and African crudes. Both are used extensively by industry and financial traders. Asia so far has lacked a financial instrument despite its position as the world’s biggest and fastest-growing oil consumer. Previous attempts to establish one have been made in Singapore, Japan and Dubai, but have not been widely taken up. Shanghai crude futures may have done the trick, though, if traded volumes this week hold beyond initial enthusiasm. Success in Shanghai would mean the three main global oil markets - Asia/Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and the Americas (AMERS) - each have a benchmark reflecting their distinct supply-demand drivers. China’s oil demand makes up more than a quarter of Asian consumption and nearly a tenth globally. “Hopefully, it (Shanghai crude) gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. One of the main attractions of having globally available crude oil futures is for financial traders to take advantage of regional prices without investing in physical oil or operating assets such as tankers, oil fields or refineries. Investors typically take advantage of differences in cross-regional prices through arbitrage trading. Before this week, the primary means of doing this in crude markets was via a financial product CL-LCO1=R based on the Brent-WTI price spread. In EMEA, Brent futures are heavily influenced by output policy from the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as by Russia, the world’s biggest oil producer. Since both OPEC and Russia have been withholding production since 2017 to prop up prices, the spread currently reflects a premium that Brent holds over WTI. In the Americas, meanwhile, U.S. oil production has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) C-OUT-T-EIA, further supporting the Brent-WTI gap. Now, investors can also trade the arbitrages between China and the rest of the world. It would have been profitable this week, for example, to “buy the spread” between higher-priced Brent and lower-priced Shanghai by going long in the European contract and shorting Asia’s as the spread widened from $1.60 a barrel on Monday to $4.60 on Wednesday. That means closing the positions would have gained an investor $3 per barrel. A spread can be sold as well. Had a trader gone short Shanghai but long lower-priced WTI, it would have yielded a gain of $2.80 a barrel, as the gap between the two narrowed from $3.10 a barrel on Monday to just 30 cents on Wednesday. Buying WTI while selling Shanghai would effectively replicate in financial markets the surge in actual U.S. crude exports to China seen in the last two years. Crude futures also offer industry participants like oil producers and petroleum refiners the chance to protect their assets through what is known as hedging. So far, this has been done through the U.S. and European benchmarks. A Chinese refiner importing Middle East crudes - which are mostly priced off Brent - and needing to protect itself from a sudden jump in prices for those grades, would typically buy Brent futures. That way, losses from higher raw material costs can be mitigated by gains made in the European crude futures. Now, the Shanghai contract offers risk control strategies better reflecting local demand and supply. Should Chinese fuel demand fall and dent the refinery’s sales that would likely also pull down Shanghai crude futures. A short position in Shanghai futures would profit from the decline, offsetting at least some of the drop in revenue the refiner would see in its petroleum sales. Oil producers, by contrast, need to protect crude output from falling prices. Thus, a U.S. shale producer selling into Asia could take a short position in Shanghai to offset any drop in income from physical crude sales if demand and prices unexpectedly fall off in Asia.

2018-03-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Shanghai crude oil futures <0#ISC:> slumped on Wednesday, the third day of trading since their launch, after heavy selling overnight, as traders scrambled to follow cues from the main international markets. The big volumes done in the late evening in China underscore the complexity of trading the new contract when London’s Brent <0#LCO:> and WTI in the United States <0#CL:>, are in full swing, with Shanghai’s relatively low liquidity exaggerating the price swings. In the first two hours of the night session, which started at 2100 Beijing time (1300 GMT) on Tuesday and marks the beginning of a new trading day, prices sank 4.2 percent to 408.6 yuan ($65.09) per barrel. Over 34,000 lots of 1,000 barrels each of Shanghai crude changed hands in that time, more than half the turnover for the day. The price drop was much steeper than those seen in Europe and the United States, where prices were down under 1 percent after data showed a surprising rise in U.S. crude inventories. It was all the more jarring for many traders in China who rushed to catch up with the overnight action on Wednesday morning as Shanghai’s second session was starting at 9 a.m. That highlighted concerns among many traders about the set-up of the contract, with the exchange splitting trading into three slots punctuated by long breaks, while Brent and WTI keep trading. “It’s early days for Shanghai crude exchange. Long-term, it should have a good potential, but it would probably be good if opening hours were extended,” said Oystein Berentsen, director for crude oil trading at Strong Petroleum in Singapore, which specialises in China’s oil markets. (Graphic: Night owls in Shanghai crude oil - reut.rs/2pNo3Fp)     It was not immediately clear what caused the hefty drop, although some traders said it was due to a stronger yuan. A stronger yuan would make investing in the contract for holders of other currencies more expensive.  Other traders said the U.S. storage data also hurt sentiment. But the relatively low open interest, which measures contracts that have yet to be settled, caused big gyrations. On Wednesday, September open interest was 6,074 lots. The exchange counts both sides of the trade, which means it was actually 3,037 lots. That compares with half a million lots for Brent. “Given the limited liquidity and also the perception that the (Chinese) national oil companies are on the sell side, short-sellers were emboldened,” said a Beijing-based trader with a western trading house. “We are talking about only thousands of lots of open interest, not hundreds of thousands, that got people worried that deliveries would be an issue.”       Selling continued through the morning and afternoon sessions, with the contract falling almost 3 percent to a final settlement price of 414.1 yuan ($65.86) a barrel. Turnover was 67,198 lots, equal to 33.6 million barrels of crude. In the first two days of trading, volume each day was around 40,000 lots.

2018-03-28,"(Reuters) - Hamburg’s tax office is examining the German activities of U.S. agricultural merchant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM.N) over a five-year period in what the company called a routine audit, although sources said ADM could face unforeseen liabilities. Two sources familiar with the matter said the audit had been complicated by the departure of several senior trading officials from ADM’s German operations in previous years, of whom some had been made redundant through restructuring.  Due to a resulting lack of staff with the experience needed to field the authorities’ questions, ADM could have to pay more tax on billions of dollars of turnover, they added. “This should have been a routine tax enquiry. The problem is they don’t have the people with the institutional memory necessary to answer the questions being asked by the tax authorities,” one of the sources said. Chicago-based ADM, which buys, stores and ships crops and byproducts, is one of the world’s biggest grain merchants.  Since 2014 the group has stepped up efforts to restructure European operations and focus more on its European headquarters in Rolle, Switzerland, scaling down its previously more prominent German HQ in Hamburg, the sources said. Around 200 staff – estimated to account for half of the German office - had left the company in recent years, they said.  Both sources said the audit included the use of futures and options by the German office in emissions, coal and electricity markets as well as its grains and freight desks.  The first source added that the probe also included derivatives trades on the Chicago Board of Trade that were undertaken by ADM’s German office. “Usually it is no problem squaring the hedges with the  exposure of the physical trades. That squaring is normally done at the end of each trading day. For an audit you need the people involved in those trades to be there to explain,” the source said.     “But the traders and managers and back office people who could explain that relationship are no longer there. There is a tremendous amount of turnover that has to be explained.” ADM’s revenue from its German office reached $6.4 billion in 2010, $6.2 billion in 2011, $9.6 billion in 2012, $10 billion in 2013, $7.1 billion in 2014 and then dropped sharply to $3.4 billion in 2015, $2.3 billion in 2016 and $2.1 billion in 2017, ADM annual filings showed.  Data for 2010 and 2011 covered the financial years ending June 30. The revenue data for 2012 to 2017 was for the years ending Dec. 31. ADM was meant to have paid a standard corporate tax rate of 25 percent in the five-year period, but both sources said it had paid low taxes as a result of carrying forward trading losses and writing off other costs against tax.  “The taxable result could be higher if the hedges made through the futures markets cannot be shown to relate to physical trades,” the source said.  “If that relationship cannot be proven, then losses incurred on the futures market may not be tax-deductible.”     Both sources said it was unclear at this stage how much additional tax - if any - ADM could face.  A spokesman for the Hamburg city government’s finance department said no information on the case would be released as this area was covered by Germany’s tax confidentiality laws. ADM said in a statement the Hamburg tax office for large enterprises was conducting “a routine tax audit of ADM’s businesses in Germany for the (financial year) period 2010 through 2014”. “This is a normal audit procedure in Germany, in which corporate tax audits are conducted in intervals of four to five years. ADM is thoroughly fulfilling all requests of the audit, and, to date, no conclusions have been drawn.” ADM added that the audit was “not specific to certain areas of our business”. Both sources said there was no indication of impropriety or market manipulation, nor was the tax authority looking into any such activity. The audit is focusing on any potential underreporting of tax “and the period includes the Toepfer and Wild Flavors acquisitions”, the second source said. ADM took an 80 percent stake in German trading house Alfred C. Toepfer International in 2002 and bought the rest of the company in 2014. Also in 2014, it acquired Swiss-German natural ingredients company Wild Flavors. Germany accounted for 10.4 percent of ADM’s revenue in 2010, 7.7 percent in 2011, 10.6 percent in 2012, and 11.2 percent in 2013, then it dropped to 8.8 percent in 2014, 5.1 percent in 2015, 3.8 percent in 2016 and 3.4 percent in 2017, according to annual reports. “Hamburg has basically been downsized from a global corporate headquarters to a country office and a lot of the traders did not go to Switzerland,” said a former ADM trader familiar with the Hamburg office, referring to the restructuring. “There would be great difficulty in answering questions about trades five to ten years ago as so many people have left, both front office and back office. I think that would make it difficult even to answer routine tax inquiries.”  Chinese food commodities group COFCO’s trading division COFCO International has also seen staff upheavals in the past year with the loss of experienced senior traders who were part of Nidera, which COFCO acquired in 2014. ADM is one of a quartet of merchants alongside Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus - nicknamed the ABCDs after their initials - that has dominated trade in agricultural goods for decades. ADM has been trying to invest in lucrative areas such as natural flavourings and food ingredients to boost earnings in volatile commodity markets and raise margins, hit by low prices. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters in January that ADM had proposed a takeover of Bunge, which could set up a bidding war with Swiss-based rival Glencore Plc (GLEN.L).

2018-03-28,"* Tech sector falls on worries about more regulation * Trade worries simmer as China flags retaliatory tariffs * Bond yields fall as investors review policy expectations * World stocks facing first quarterly fall in two years By Marc Jones LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Stocks toppled again on Wednesday, as jitters about a U.S.-China trade war and regulatory crackdown on firms such as Facebook left investors facing their first quarterly fall in equity markets in two years. Europe’s main bourses opened more than 1 percent in the red as the fifth sell-off in six days gathered momentum and sent risk-averse traders piling back to the safety of bond markets. German Bunds, seen as Europe’s most secure asset due to Berlin’s triple-A-rated finances, rallied hard to send 10-year yields back under 0.5 percent for the first time since early January. The rout in stocks came after the tech woes had given the Nasdaq its worst day since June 2016 on Tuesday. Losses were extended after China’s state-run Global Times reported that Beijing will soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States imports. Since hitting a record on Jan. 26, world stocks have been battered by worries about rising inflation, the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and the possibility of a global trade war. The 47-country MSCI global index is down 9 percent from its high. “We are rotating from the old regime of low interest rates and growth stocks like the FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) into a new world where that paradigm is rocked and that creates volatility,” said SEB Investment Management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 1.1 percent with the region’s tech sector down 2.6 percent. U.S futures were pointing south again too. Tuesday’s losses saw the Nasdaq slump almost 3 percent and the broader S&P 500 drop 1.7 percent. As well as the Facebook nosedive, Twitter fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet slid 4.5 percent. Asia tumbled 1.5 percent overnight, with Japan’s Nikkei ending down 1.3 percent and top Chinese internet stock Tencent down 4.6 percent. Another weak U.S. spot had been Nvidia, which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber autonomous vehicle killed a woman. “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods was also rekindling worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war. While the market remains highly vulnerable to news headlines like this, recent reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. “It would be in China’s interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “The market is still nervous, and there’s a feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” he added. In the currency market, the dollar changed hands at 105.51 yen, not far from Monday’s 16-1/2-month low of 104.56, as the Japanese currency was supported by the risk-averse mood. The euro was perched near a six-week high, buying just over $1.24 and on track to post its fifth consecutive quarter of gains. It is up more than 3 percent since the start of January. That was despite economic sentiment in the 19-countries sharing the euro slipping for the third month in a row in March, a slowdown in bank lending and a dip in German import prices. Comments on Tuesday by ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny, who said the central bank will probably decide this summer to cull its bond purchases and warned that the ECB must not fall “behind the curve”, helped underpin the euro. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield hit a two-month low below 0.500 percent though, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.770 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. The two-year yield stood at 2.270 percent. “In short, markets had priced in policy normalisation by the world’s central banks too much,” said Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities. In commodity markets meanwhile, oil prices slipped as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders. U.S. WTI crude futures dropped 0.8 percent to $64.72 while Brent crude futures traded 0.7 percent lower at $69.62 per barrel, off Monday’s high of $71.05, which was its highest since late January. Gold eased down from a five-week high to just under $1,340 per ounce. Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) Vision Fund will invest in creating the world’s biggest solar power project in Saudi Arabia, it said on Tuesday, stepping up its involvement in the kingdom and expanding beyond technology. The project is expected to have the capacity to produce up to 200 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters in New York. That would add to around 400 GW of globally installed solar power capacity and is comparable to the world’s total nuclear power capacity of around 390 GW as of the end of 2016. By investing in solar power, Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, can reduce the amount of crude it currently uses to generate power and increase its overseas shipments. The move illustrates the commitment by the de facto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to transform the country’s economic status quo.  The final investment total for the 200 GW of generation, including the solar panels, battery storage and a manufacturing facility for panels in Saudi Arabia, will eventually total around $200 billion (140.97 billion pounds), Son said. The initial phase of the project, for 7.2 GW of solar capacity, will cost $5 billion, with $1 billion coming from SoftBank’s Vision Fund and the rest from project financing, he said. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 reform plan, which aims to reduce the country’s economic dependence on oil, was a good match for the fund’s long-term vision for innovation, said Son. “These two visions have come together to create clean, sustainable, low-cost and productive renewable energy,” he said. “The Kingdom has great sunshine, great size of available land, and great engineers...” Despite being one of the world’s sunniest countries, Saudi Arabia generates most of its electricity from oil-fired power plants.  Saudi’s entire installed power capacity is currently around 60 GW. Adding 200 GW would create enormous excess capacity that could be exported to neighbours or used by industry, although the kingdom will still require other forms of power generation for night-time back-up. Industry estimates say around 300,000 to 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil are burnt for Saudi power generation. Exporting that oil could increase Saudi’s annual oil revenues by between $7 billion and $20 billion, at the current price for benchmark Brent LCOc1 oil of almost $70 per barrel. POST-FOSSIL FUEL “Saudi Arabia is clearly preparing for a post-fossil fuel dependent economy in terms of domestic energy consumption, and this huge bet on renewables would free up a lot of domestic output of oil for exports, while probably saving domestic gas resources as well,” said Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Singapore. “Up until now, progress in building solar capacity in the kingdom has been very slow, but this deal might give it the kick start it needs. But 200 GW by 2030 though, that’s another question,” Kiernan said. Last May, Softbank said it raised over $93 billion for the Vision Fund, the world’s largest private equity fund with backers including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry (2317.TW).  The Vision Fund has funnelled $27.5 billion into 20 tech firms as of the end of December, transforming SoftBank from a Japanese telecoms upstart into one of the world’s biggest technology investors.   The Saudi investment is Softbank’s second major global solar project.  The company has said it will invest up to $20 billion along with Foxconn and Bharti Enterprises in solar projects in India, which has an ambitious target to generate 100 GW of power from solar by 2022. SoftBank estimated the electrification drive could create a requirement for over 150 GW of additional power.  (This story corrects name of Saudi crown prince to Salman not Sultan in paragraph 3.)

2018-03-28,"KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s largest oil and gas services company Sapura Energy Bhd on Wednesday reported a fourth quarter net loss, due to asset impairments and lower revenue from its engineering and construction and drilling segments. Sapura Energy posted a net loss of 2.29 billion ringgit ($593.73 million) for the quarter to Jan. 31 against a net loss of 172.3 million ringgit in the same period a year ago, according to a filing on the local stock exchange. Revenue stood at 1.19 billion ringgit, compared with 1.81 billion ringgit a year ago. For the full year, Sapura posted a net loss of 2.5 billion ringgit, including 2.1 billion ringgit in impairments, mainly of its drilling rigs. The loss compared with a 206 million ringgit profit a year ago. Sapura said in its filing that the impairment would enable the group to operate at a lower cost base going forward, and the company continued to optimise costs, including impairing assets. “The industry has seen a gradual recovery from the low levels of activity experienced in the last three years as reflected in the higher crude oil prices,” it said. “The group remains focused on maintaining strong operational performance and replenishing the order book by strengthening its position in existing markets and embedding ourselves into new ones to enlarge the bid opportunities.” Sapura Energy’s shares were down 1.8 percent on Wednesday afternoon, underperforming a 0.2 percent decline in the benchmark index.

2018-03-28,"* Tech sector falls on worries about more regulation * Trade worries ease a tad but keep many investors cautious * Bond yields fall as investors review policy expectations By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday after Wall Street was knocked hard by concerns about tighter controls on the tech industry, denting a brief global equities recovery driven by hopes that the risk of a U.S.-China trade war was easing. They extended losses further after China’s state-run Global Times reported China will soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on United States exports to China. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent, turning red for the week, led by information technology shares, such as Tencent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.3 percent. U.S S&P500 mini futures fell 0.4 percent in Asia, a day after the S&P 500 lost 1.73 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93 percent, making the benchmark indexes’ fourth decline in five sessions. The info tech sector was the worst hit with a fall of 3.5 percent, as investors expect tighter control on the industry following a furore over use of Facebook data by political consultants. Facebook fell 4.9 percent on Tuesday, taking its losses to almost 18 percent since March 16, when the firm first acknowledged the problem. Twitter fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet fell 4.5 percent. Another weak spot was Nvidia, which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle killed a woman. Investors rotated out of the tech sector, which had long outperformed the market on hopes of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT). “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The so-called FANG quartet of tech stocks, which includes Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Alphabet, has been a darling of many investors. European stock futures point to lower openings for European stocks, with futures for Germany’s Dax  and France’s Cac  down 0.9 percent and those for Britain’s FTSE  falling 0.7 percent. The report that Beijing plans to announce retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods rekindled worries about a Sino-U.S. trade war.

The euro lost steam after soft euro zone economic data and comments from European Central Bank policymakers flagging low underlying inflation. Economic sentiment in the 19-countries sharing the euro slipped for the third month in a row in March while bank lending slowed. Erkki Liikanen, an ECB Governing Council member, said that underlying inflation in the euro zone may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust, so the central bank needs to remain patient in removing stimulus. Another member, Jozef Makuch from Slovakia, also struck a similarly cautious tone. The euro traded at $1.2415, having lost steam after it rose to $1.24765 the previous day. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield also hit a two-month low below 0.500 percent, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15.

2018-03-28," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Recent price gyrations for iron ore in China caused by swings in sentiment over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel are masking a broader downward trend. In recent days spot iron ore prices in the world’s largest importer have alternated between slumping as trade war fears mount, or rallying as these same fears moderate. The price action is being driven by the news cycle and the seeming chaotic way in which the Trump administration is implementing its trade policies. The spot price at China’s Qingdao port for 62 percent iron ore, as assessed by Argus Media, rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday to close at $63.90 a tonne, while the price for the same grade as assessed by Metal Bulletin rose 1.3 percent to end at $65.17. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, benchmark iron ore futures increased 1.1 percent to close at 443.5 yuan ($70.73) a tonne, while Shanghai steel rebar futures gained 1.5 percent to 3,413 yuan. These small gains came amid signs that the Trump administration and the authorities in Beijing may be prepared to sit down and negotiate to avoid a trade war. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told visiting U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that Beijing is working towards dialogue with the United States on trade but is prepared for a trade war, state television reported. The gains also came as another country, South Korea, appeared to reach a deal to avoid the implementation of the Trump administration’s tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium. A pattern seems to have emerged since Trump first announced the planned tariffs on March 2, in which prices for the targeted commodities first decline on the initial news, then recover somewhat as it becomes clearer that the United States will provide exemptions to certain nations. But it’s also important to note that prices don’t recover nearly as much as they slump. Spot iron ore was at $79.55 a tonne on March 1, the day before Trump’s announcement, after which it fell for 11 straight days to end at $69.80 on March 12. A recovery over the next few days saw it end $71.65 a tonne on March 15, before starting to fall again, this time dropping to $66.90 on March 20. A small increase to $68.15 a tonne on March 22 was ended by Trump’s announcement of planned tariffs on some $60 billion of Chinese goods, which sparked the retreat to $63.50 on March 26, a four-month low. While it’s easy to be caught up in the daily news cycle, especially given the dramatic nature of the twists and turns of Trump’s announcements and subsequent developments, it should not distract from the overall picture. Spot iron ore prices have effectively been in retreat since late February, and are down 20 percent since the peak on Feb. 26. A combination of a well-supplied market and some easing of optimism over China’s steel demand, as well as record high inventories at Chinese ports, have contributed to the overall bearish market. At last week’s Global Iron Ore and Steel Forecast Conference in Perth, a poll of the participants found that the average price forecast for 2018 was around $65 a tonne. An average price of $65 for 2018 suggests that the price may be below that level for some time during the year, given it has spent most of the first quarter above the forecast. The majority of the delegates were either iron ore miners, contractors or traders, with not many buyers in evidence, meaning that those making the forecasts stood to benefit most from higher prices. The modest price forecast suggests that the industry is bracing itself for tougher times, without expecting a collapse in demand. This reflects the view that China’s steel demand will be relatively stable this year, and output likely to remain near the 831 million tonnes seen in 2017.  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  Editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-ironore-china/column-iron-ores-downtrend-trend-masked-by-trump-inspired-price-swings-russell-idUKL3N1RA2BK,28 Mar 2018,"Recent price

2018-03-28,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A member of a Harvard University oversight board made a rare public call for the school to divest itself from fossil fuel stocks, a move that shows continuing divisions on the issue as a new president takes over at the institution and its leading $37.1 billion endowment. Kat Taylor, a member of Harvard’s 32-member Board of Overseers and wife of billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, said in an interview late on Tuesday that while she was proud of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, school’s efforts to reduce its climate impact, it should also start to screen out stocks like oil companies from its investment portfolio. The school does not prohibit holdings such as in oil companies, which she called “a large, lost opportunity” for the university to take a lead. Harvard spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.  Taylor said her comments may be the first public call for divestment by a member of the elected board, one of two Harvard governing boards. The overseers do not have direct power over the school’s endowment.  U.S. schools have largely refrained from dumping energy stocks, despite some exceptions like Stanford University’s decision to sell coal shares in 2014. According to a count by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a trade group, college and university endowments with a total of $278 billion have largely rejected calls to divest fossil fuel stocks, while endowments with about $36 billion have said they would divest or partially divest from such stocks. Taylor said she was speaking about the issue since her term as an overseer is due to end this spring, and others’ views were divided. She said some members had expressed support in private while others said it would not be right to use the endowment for political ends or to interfere with managers’ ability to maximize profits.  Rather than divest, Harvard has taken steps such as signing on to a United Nations-supported set of principles for “responsible investment.” Last month, Harvard president Drew Faust outlined plans for the school’s own operations to become fossil-fuel free by 2050. Faust is due to turn over the job on July 1 to Lawrence Bacow, who will also serve on the board of Harvard Management Co, which runs its endowment. Taylor said she has spoken with Bacow only briefly on the issue.

2018-03-28,"HANOI (Reuters) - A crackdown on corruption in Vietnam unnerved some foreign investors when it intensified last year, but they are now getting much more sanguine about it and some say the business climate is improving as a result. While the campaign by the government of Communist party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong has slowed some dealmaking in a country already plagued by Soviet-era red tape and bureaucracy, it has not deterred foreign investors from putting their money in Vietnam. Vietnam’s economy grew 6.8 percent last year, the strongest pace since 2010, while foreign direct inflows hit record highs for two years in a row, reaching $17.5 billion in 2017. To some foreign investors the crackdown was long overdue. Nearly two-thirds of Vietnam’s people have had to pay a bribe to get access to public services, Transparency International (TI) said in a 2017 report. Out of 16 Asian countries surveyed, only India fared worse. The anti-corruption drive is a “good signal” to many foreign investors, said Somhatai Panichewa, chief executive of Amata VN Pcl, a unit of Thailand’s top industrial estate operator Amata which in January announced major investments in Vietnam.     “We think the government is serious about showing the public that investing in Vietnam is no longer ‘know-who’ but about ‘know-how,’” she said. Some business risk analysts take a similar view.     “Once the political thrust behind the arrests ... and their pattern could be more clearly identified, confidence was restored in the government’s commitment to courting foreign investment,” said Brendan Brady of consulting firm Eurasia.     That doesn’t mean the business conditions are easy for foreign investors.     Executives on the ground have to navigate “a minefield” of new challenges, said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi.     “Whether a result of corruption, protectionism, tax collection, or the government trying to pick winners and losers, our member companies often see areas where inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and unfair practices persist - and in some cases new unfair practices are being enacted,” Sitkoff said.     The government did not respond to requests for comment on the fallout from the crackdown or the circumstances in which it was launched.     Over 100 people - mostly from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the banking or energy sectors - have been prosecuted, jailed and, in some cases, given death sentences in the anti-corruption campaign.    Government critics say the crackdown is politically motivated and has targeted those close to former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who lost a power struggle in 2016 to Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.     But it has also shed light on deep-seated graft, mismanagement and nepotism within state-owned enterprises (SOEs) firms in the country at a time when a long-delayed privatisation drive is accelerating.             Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of a unit of the PetroVietnam state energy group, is now serving two life sentences for corruption after he fled the country and turned up in Hanoi in bizarre circumstances. Germany accused Hanoi of kidnapping him in a Cold-War style abduction in a Berlin park last year.      Thanh’s senior, ex-politburo member Dinh La Thang, was also sacked and became Vietnam’s highest-ranking official to have been jailed for decades. He was given 13 years in prison and is again on trial facing another potential jail term. “Officials have been more cautious after the corruption crackdown,” said an executive of a small government enterprise, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.     “There have been quite a lot of requirements to cut down costs recently ... some are required, some are forced, some are achieved via technology enhancements that cut down on electricity costs, material costs etc,” the executive said.     Earlier this month, one of Vietnam’s most sought after SOEs earmarked for privatisation, telecoms firm MobiFone, was accused by a government investigating team of several violations in a bid to buy a 95 percent stake in a private pay-TV service called Audio Visual Global.  The government inspectors described the deal as “negatively affecting” MobiFone’s proposed privatisation and proposed handing over the case to police.     The two sides called off the deal just before the results of the investigations were announced.  MobiFone has not responded to a request for comment.      Calls to Audio Visual Global were not answered.     The privatisation of MobiFone has already been delayed for more than a decade and it could take even longer if the case is handed over to the police. Vietnam has failed to meet its privatisation targets in previous years but has plans for over 100 initial public offerings as well as partial stake sales in around 400 companies by 2020.         “It seems that managers of SOEs - at least the most important ones - are now more cautious in their activity, in particular in relation to equitisation (partial privatisation), divestment and so on,” the European Chamber of Commerce said in a statement to Reuters.     “The approval of line ministers is more systematically sought and the valuation of assets or shares is subject to more constraints”.    Still, as Thang and Thanh went on trial in January, the government managed to raise about $740 million from selling partial stakes in three PetroVietnam units - despite the corruption attached to its name.    And last December, the government raised a lofty $4.8 billion from selling 54 percent of brewer Sabeco.

2018-03-28,"LONDON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) sold its remaining coal mine in Australia for $2.25 billion (1.59 billion pounds), making good on a pledge to exit the fuel and boosting its ability to fund future buybacks or higher dividends. The sale of Rio’s stake in the Kestrel mine to private equity manager EMR Capital and Indonesia’s Adaro Energy Tbk (ADRO.JK) was made at a significant premium to analysts’ expectations and was Rio’s third coal deal this month. In total, the assets have raised $4.15 billion. Rio has said the funds would be used for “general corporate purposes”, which could include increased returns for shareholders. Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement the latest sale, combined with Glencore’s (GLEN.L) purchase of the Hail Creek mine and the divestment of undeveloped coal projects would make Rio’s portfolio stronger and more focused. RBC said in a report the sale would make Rio Tinto the only mining major without coal assets, which should boost its allure to some investors. The divestments would boost the miner’s balance sheet by $3.9 billion, RBC added, “providing the potential for more buybacks or cash returns.” Tuesday’s deal to sell Rio’s 80 percent stake in the underground coal mine in Queensland state is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018. The Kestrel mine in the Bowen Basin region, which produces high quality coking coal, will be jointly managed and operated by Australia-based EMR and Adaro and marks EMR’s biggest mining investment. It last year bought an 80 percent stake in Zambian copper mine Lubambe for $97.10 million. It will also be Adaro’s biggest overseas investment.  “Coking coal ... offers excellent demand and supply fundamentals for decades into the future,” EMR Chief Executive Jason Chang said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts said the funds raised by Rio Tinto implied a higher than expected long-term price for the steel-making ingredient of around $175 a tonne.   Premium coking coal futures in Singapore SCAFc1 peaked at $265 a tonne in January when China’s pollution controls were in force but have since tailed back by nearly a fifth to $218 after curbs expired mid month. “We continue to see coking coal as a beneficiary of the Chinese supply-side reforms, both from a lower Chinese domestic production perspective but also from the implications from environmental reforms,” added RBC. Rio Tinto shares rallied in London trading but were down 0.4 percent in Australia on Wednesday, in a broader market  down around 0.6 percent.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent, with tech-heavy Korean shares falling 1.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 2.1 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 1.73 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.93 percent, making their fourth decline in five sessions. The information tech sector was the worst hit with a fall of 3.5 percent, as investors expect tighter control on the industry following a furore over use of Facebook data by political consultants. Facebook fell 4.9 percent on Tuesday, taking its losses to almost 18 percent since March 16, when the firm first acknowledged the problem. Twitter fell 12 percent while Google parent Alphabet fell 4.5 percent. Another weak spot was Nvidia, which fell 7.8 percent after the chipmaker temporarily suspended self-driving tests across the globe after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle killed a woman. Investors rotated out of the tech sector, which had long outperformed the market on hopes of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT). “There is a sense that there will be more regulations on Facebook or FANG and that the cost of compliance will increase,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The so-called FANG, a quartet of tech stocks that include Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Alphabet, have been a darling of many investors. Concerns about trade frictions between China and the United States also lingered, although reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred some optimism. “It would be in China’s interest to pursue trade rather than taking retaliatory actions. So eventually, they are likely to avert a trade war and strike a deal that will please (U.S. President Donald) Trump and increase trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings. “The market is still nervous, and there’s feeling you never know what Trump will do. But excessive wariness is likely to gradually wane,” he added. In the currency market, the dollar changed hands at 105.51 yen, not far from Monday’s 16-1/2-month low of 104.56, as the Japanese currency was supported by the risk-averse mood. The euro lost steam after soft euro zone economic data and comments from European Central Bank policymakers flagging low underlying inflation. Economic sentiment in the 19-countries sharing the euro slipped for the third month in a row in March while bank lending slowed. Erkki Liikanen, ECB Governing Council member, said that underlying inflation in the euro zone may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust, so the central bank needs to remain patient in removing stimulus. Another member, Jozef Makuch from Slovakia, also struck a similarly cautious tone. The euro traded at $1.2415, having lost steam after it rose to $1.24765 the previous day. Germany’s 10-year Bund yield also hit two-month low of 0.500 percent on Tuesday, having taken a downward shift since hitting a 1-1/2-year high of 0.795 percent in Feb. 15. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.770 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. The two-year yield stood at 2.270 percent. “In short, markets had priced in policy normalisation by the world’s central banks too much,” said Tohru Yamamoto, chief fixed income strategist at Daiwa Securities. Oil prices stepped back as a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) surprised many traders. U.S. WTI crude futures dropped 0.8 percent to $64.72 while Brent crude futures traded 0.7 percent lower at $69.62 per barrel, off Monday’s high of $71.05, which was its highest since late January.

2018-03-28,"* Brent fall below $70/barrel, WTI dips below $65/barrel * Saudi Arabia proposes long-term supply management with Russia * Shanghai crude sees high volumes, but also strong volatility By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with Brent falling back below $70 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crudes dipping below $65, pulled down by a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories that surprised many traders. U.S. WTI crude futures were at $64.86 a barrel by 0201 GMT, down 39 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their previous settlement. Brent crude futures were at $69.75 per barrel, down 36 cents, or 0.5 percent. Traders said the dips came after the American Petroleum Institute (API) late on Tuesday reported a surprise 5.3 million barrels rise in crude sticks in the week to March 23, to 430.6 million barrels. Official U.S. inventory data will be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) late on Wednesday. “We’ll see how the inventory data looks and whether these recent highs can be challenged again. For the moment it is looking like both WTI and Brent are stalling,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. Wednesday’s price falls came despite top exporter Saudi Arabia saying it was working with top producer Russia on a historic long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices. “We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20 year agreement,” the crown prince told Reuters in an interview in New York late on Monday. AxiTrader’s McKenna said such an agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia “effectively means an expansion” of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader but in which Russia is not a member. In Asia, Shanghai crude oil futures saw their third day of trading continuing with high volume but also volatility. Spot Shanghai crude futures were down by 4.4 percent on Wednesday, to 407.5 yuan ($64.93)per barrel by 0201 GMT. In dollar-terms, that puts Chinese crude prices significantly below Brent and only slightly above U.S. WTI. McKenna said he hoped Shanghai crude “gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks”, but he cautioned that “the first couple of days have been volatile.” ($1 = 6.2760 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin and

2018-03-28,"(Repeats March 27 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DYHekG By John Kemp LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds had turned more bullish on the outlook for petroleum prices, even before the decision to replace the U.S. president’s national security adviser with an anti-Iran hawk was announced on Thursday. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 95 million barrels in the week to March 20. The combined increase was the largest since the end of October and reversed a draw of 73 million barrels over the two previous weeks, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. Fund managers now hold a net long position of 1.311 billion barrels across Brent, NYMEX and ICE WTI, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil (tmsnrt.rs/2DYHekG). The combined net long position is 170 million barrels below the record 1.484 billion barrels set on Jan. 23 but more than four times higher than the recent low of 310 million set at the end of June 2017. Hedge fund positioning remains extremely lopsided, with almost all funds expecting prices to rise further rather than fall. Portfolio managers hold 11.7 long positions for every short one, the second-highest ratio on record after 11.9 on Jan. 30. Almost no one seems willing to bet against the trend. Short positions across the complex have declined to just 122 million barrels, the lowest level since May 2014. In some parts of the complex, positioning has become even more extreme. In U.S. gasoline, for example, long positions (94 million barrels) outnumber short ones (4 million) by a ratio of almost 22:1. The current positioning across the complex is a classic example of a market that has become “locked” with all traders trying to position themselves the same way. Locking often precedes a sharp reduction in liquidity, an increase in volatility and an eventual reversal in the price trend (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems”, Sornette, 2003). Extreme one-way positioning could herald a shift in oil prices into a new, higher trading range, such as happened in the fourth quarter of 2017. But with so few speculative short positions remaining to be covered, there may be few buyers around if and when the holders of long positions decide to realise some of their profits and try to sell them.

2018-03-28,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico saw patchy demand for oil and gas blocks auctioned on Tuesday under the shadow of promises by a presidential frontrunner to review contracts awarded under a historic energy opening if he wins the July 1 election. Spain’s Repsol and Britain’s Premier Oil were among the winners but 19 of the 27 blocks in the first two Gulf coast basins on offer received no bids, Mexico’s energy regulator said. Results for a third basin were due to be announced later on Tuesday. Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has a comfortable lead in most polls, said that if he wins the July 1 vote, he would review more than 90 contracts signed since Mexico passed legislation in 2013 ending the 75-year monopoly of state energy firm Pemex.  Running for office for a third time, Lopez Obrador has also said he would hold a referendum on the future of the reform, and ask President Enrique Pena Nieto to cancel two auctions planned for the second half of the year, if he wins in July.  Mexico’s next president takes office in December.  Despite the political uncertainty, Tim Davis, the group exploration manager for Premier Oil, said he was bullish about the future of the oil and gas opening. “I think you could see a slowdown (if Lopez Obrador wins).  “But...I think they will see the benefits,” of the investment that’s coming in and the invigoration of new ideas and new companies coming in.      Repsol and Premier Oil claimed two areas each in the shallow-water Burgos basin.  Consortiums made up of state-run Pemex, Mexico’s Citla Energy, Spain’s Cepsa, Britain’s Capricorn Energy and Germany’s DEA Deutsche Erdoel posted winning bids for four blocks in the Tampico-Misantla-Veracruz basin further south along the Gulf.   Mexico’s deputy secretary for hydrocarbons Aldo Flores blamed the patchy interest on the quantity of natural gas in some of the blocks, saying companies were more interested in finding oil. “This will continue to be a challenge for us given the abundance of natural gas in Texas at very low prices,” Flores told Reuters on the sidelines of the auction in Mexico City.     Mexico is also competing for private companies’ interest with Brazil, which is also holding an auction this week, with another scheduled in June. Brazil holds its own election in October, with the most likely leftist contender in the presidential race, Ciro Ferreira Gomes, warning he would expropriate energy assets bought by investors if he wins. In Thursday’s auction, Mexico is offering 35 areas in the Burgos, Tampico-Misantla-Veracruz and Southeast basins. Fourteen companies including BP, Chevron, Eni, India’s ONGC Videsh, Pemex, Petronas, Repsol, Shell and Total qualified to bid as individual bidders, while 22 consortia have also qualified to bid.

2018-03-28,"WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - California is prepared to sue the Environmental Protection Agency if it tries to weaken Obama-era vehicle efficiency standards, the state’s attorney general said on Tuesday, setting up another in a series of legal fights between Sacramento and the Trump administration. The EPA is expected to declare by April 1 that current rules aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025 are “not appropriate,” sources told Reuters last week. The declaration would enable the EPA to take steps to weaken those federal standards, which had been implemented by the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, with the backing of automakers. “We are going to do everything that can been done to defend these standards,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told Reuters in an interview. “So far, when we have been challenged on environmental standards we have had a good record in court. We haven’t lost a case.” In 2011, California’s air emissions regulator and the Obama administration reached an agreement with major automakers to nearly double average fleetwide fuel efficiency by 2025, but included a “midterm review” to determine by April 2018 whether the final requirements were feasible. But if the administration of Republican President Donald Trump weakens federal auto efficiency standards, then California - the most populous U.S. state and a massive market for automakers - could enforce its own stricter rules that nearly a dozen other states, including New York, would follow. Carmakers are worried that such a dispute would lead to a patchwork of different standards across the country. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told Reuters in January that “California doesn’t have the authority to set the standards for the rest of the country” - leading some officials in the state to worry the administration could attempt to revoke Sacramento’s authority to set its own rules. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman confirmed its recommendation is under interagency review and will be completed by the April 1 deadline. Becerra said he is confident courts would side with California if EPA tries to weaken the federal standards or, further down the road, undercut the state’s special authority under the federal Clean Air Act to set its own. “We are not yet at round one and we think we have some good knockout punches for the next rounds,” he said.

2018-03-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said late on Tuesday it was proposing to cancel a planned hike in higher “gas-guzzler” penalties for automakers whose vehicles fail to meet minimum fuel-economy standards. NHTSA in July suspended a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties. Automakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually. Congress ordered federal agencies in 2015 to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA under the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, proposed raising fines for every gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, but delayed the effective date to September 2018. NHTSA said in a proposed regulation released on Tuesday that it “tentatively concludes” that hiking the penalty would have a “negative economic impact.” New York, California and three other U.S. states in September sued the federal government for delaying the rollout of the higher penalties as did several environmental groups. A federal appeals court has set an April 12 hearing on the lawsuit. On Tuesday, two major auto trade associations intervened on behalf of the government in the suit. In March 2017, Republican President Donald Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency standards for 2022-25 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to determine by Friday that the standards are “not appropriate” and propose revisions to the rules in the coming months. NHTSA said previously the increases would potentially result in an additional $30 million in annual civil penalties. Automakers say the increases would dramatically raise costs since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits used to meet requirements. Some automakers including some luxury makers historically have opted to pay fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors (TAMO.NS), and Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles, paid the most in fines in recent years. NHTSA said in July many automakers were falling behind current fuel standards and face “the possibility of paying larger CAFE penalties over the next several years.” The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing major companies, said it was pleased that NHTSA had issued the proposed rule, but will need time to review the “notice that’s just been released before we’re able to offer more.” Reporting by David Shepardson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-autos-regulation/u-s-agency-proposes-scrapping-higher-automaker-penalties-for-gas-guzzlers-idUKL1N1R92BC,28 Mar 2018,"The U.S. National Highway
