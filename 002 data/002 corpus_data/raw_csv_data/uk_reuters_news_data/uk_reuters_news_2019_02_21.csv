2019-02-21,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The Chinese island province of Hainan will ban the production, sale and use of all single-use non-biodegradable plastics by 2025 in a bid to ease pollution, state media reported, citing the province’s environmental bureau. Hainan is the first Chinese region to make a formal commitment to phase out single-use non-biodegradable plastics, which have been identified by the United Nations as one of the world’s biggest environmental challenges. The province uses about 120,000 tonnes of the material every year, according to government estimates. The official China News Service reported late on Thursday Hainan would draw up new standards and establish a monitoring and enforcement system before the end of the year. The province will begin by banning non-biodegradable plastic bags and eating utensils by the end of 2020 and ban the material completely before 2025, the report said. Plastic pollution has emerged as one of China’s biggest environmental problems, with vast amounts of untreated plastic waste buried in landfills or dumped in rivers.  China is already boosting recycling rates and is building dozens of “comprehensive resource utilization” bases to ensure that more products are reused as part of its war on waste. The government is also working on new measures aimed at restricting the use of plastic packaging by courier and food delivery firms, which have been the biggest cause of the surge in plastic waste in recent years. China’s plastic recyclers traditionally processed waste imported from Europe and the United States but the government banned foreign scrap plastic deliveries at the start 2018, partly to encourage firms to process domestic waste instead.

2019-02-21,"MEXICO CITY, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-oil company Pemex burned through $665 million at its fertilizer unit, ignored consultants and made high-risk investments with no discernible business strategy, according to a devastating government audit of its 2017 operations. The report, published late on Wednesday, offers insight into how Pemex ended up creaking under $106 billion of debt during the six-year term of former President Enrique Pena Nieto. Mexico’s Federal Audit Office (ASF) used unusually frank language in its assessment of Pemex’s use of public resources, particularly with regard to the company’s fertilizer subsidiary and a failed power generation unit. The fertilizer company suffered net losses of $665 million in 2017, and its assets were worth $1.1 billion less over the course of the year. “It destroyed value,” read the assessment, the last of three reports by the audit office on the state of government finances in 2017. Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to revive Pemex by clamping down on over-spending, rampant fuel-theft and corruption, but ratings agencies and investors are wary that expansive plans to revamp Mexico’s refineries could further weigh on finances. Fitch downgraded the company’s credit rating to one notch above junk last month. David Colmenares, who has headed the ASF since before last year’s election, told Reuters the results showed Pemex needed to be “re-engineered” to revive its finances. “We believe that if we resolve many of these points, we will be able to recover (Pemex’s) finances,” he said. He acknowledged corruption in the company, citing examples of contracts given to recently-created companies with no energy experience. Many of the problems at Pemex Fertilizers, a subsidiary created under Pena Nieto’s liberalization of the energy sector, stem from its purchase of two fertilizer plants in 2013 and 2016, the report said. Both plants had previously belonged to Pemex before being privatized in the 1990s by Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The first plant, ProAgro, was not operational when Pemex bought it back for $475 million. Despite three attempts to revive it, the plant was still not up and running this year, the report said. The second plant, Fertinal, operated well below capacity, the report said. Before the purchase, international auditors including PWC, warned Pemex’s board of directors of the parlous state of the two plants, but the company went ahead and bought them anyway, the report said. Similarly, Pemex created a new power generation unit, called Pemex Cogeneration and Services, in 2015, without the board of directors being presented any evidence or studies to show it could be a profitable business, or seeing a business or operation strategy, the report said. Without any infrastructure to generate electricity, the company lost $19 million in 2017. Pemex closed the unit the following year. Wilbur Matthews, founder of Texas-based Vaquero Global Investment, called Pemex’s business decisions during the 2013-18 period “completely incongruous.” “The way that they were conducting business in the past six years did not make any sense at all,” Matthews said. During Pena Nieto’s term, Pemex took on an additional $47 billion in debt, citing the deterioration in finances and commitments to keep up investment levels at a time when the oil prices collapsed. Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt strategies at AllianceBernstein, which has $550 billion of assets under management and owns Pemex bonds, blamed the company’s problems on the federal government charging it too much in taxes. “The real issue is that the sovereign has taken a lot of money out of Pemex,” she said. Khan said the company’s management had improved in the last years of Pena Nieto’s government. “The decision to do energy reform, to reduce the burden of expenditures for the company and to try and stabilize the company were actually good decisions from a management perspective.” (Additional reporting by Adrianna Barerra and Noe Torres; Editing by Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-pemex-audit/how-pemex-destroyed-1-bln-with-erratic-business-choices-idUKL1N20G2BN,21 Feb 2019,"Mexico's state-oil company

2019-02-21,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro threatened to close the border with Colombia on Thursday as opposition leader Juan Guaido and some 80 lawmakers ran a gauntlet of roadblocks trying to get to the frontier to receive humanitarian aid. Guaido, who is recognised by dozens of countries as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, was poised for a showdown with Maduro’s government on Saturday, when the opposition will attempt to bring in food and medicine being stockpiled in neighbouring countries.     Maduro denies there is a humanitarian crisis and said on Thursday he was considering closing Venezuela’s key border with Colombia and would close the country’s other main border with Brazil, effectively shutting off any legal land access. The government has said soldiers will be stationed at official crossing points to repel any “territorial violations”, although the opposition could attempt to cross anywhere along Venezuela’s porous borders. “I charge (Colombian President) Ivan Duque with any violence that might occur on the border,” Maduro said in televised comments, surrounded by the military high command. Venezuela has already closed its maritime border with the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire, after Curacao’s government said it would help store aid. Opposition lawmakers set off from Caracas in a convoy of buses just after 10 a.m. on a 800-km (500-mile) road trip to the border with Colombia. Crowds formed alongside a main highway out of the capital, waving Venezuelan flags and whooping in support. A roadblock at a tunnel some 100 km (60 miles) along the main road forced several buses to stop, Reuters witnesses and lawmakers said. Lawmakers trying to get through scuffled with soldiers in riot gear at the tunnel’s exit, TV footage showed. “We have a commitment and that is to reach the border. We will try to get as far as we can,” lawmaker Mariela Magallanes told Reuters by telephone from the scene. “Humanitarian aid is not the whim of a few lawmakers, it is a necessity.” Magallanes said her vehicle managed to pass through the tunnel after being stuck for several hours but other buses remained behind. Lawmakers said Guaido’s vehicle continued but his exact location was being kept a secret due to security concerns. One opposition lawmaker in southeastern Bolivar state said he and some 20 other politicians would also travel to the border with Brazil. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment. Guaido still has not provided details on how the aid could come in. Opposition figures have suggested forming human chains across the land borders to pass packages from person to person and fleets of boats arriving from the Dutch Caribbean islands. The opposition says it is rallying relief efforts in Venezuela to alleviate widespread food and medicine shortages in the wake of its hyperinflationary economic collapse. The oil-rich economy has halved in size in five years. Tons of aid sent by the U.S. and Colombian governments is sitting in warehouses on the Colombian side of the border. Guaido tweeted late on Thursday that Chile was also airlifting supplies there, while Brazil’s government said it was sending aid to its own border. Meanwhile a boat carrying 250 tons of aid left Puerto Rico’s capital of San Juan headed for Venezuela on Wednesday, the local government said in a statement. Maduro accuses the Trump administration, which has levied crippling sanctions against his government, of seeking to force his ouster. The U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, will lead a government delegation accompanying the delivery of aid from Florida to Cucuta via military aircraft between Thursday and Friday, the Department of State said. Meanwhile, the office of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he would fly to the Colombian capital, Bogota, on Monday to discuss the crisis with leaders of the regional Lima Group of nations.  Guaido invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency on Jan. 23 and denounces Maduro as an usurper. Maduro still retains the support of powerful nations like Russia and China, as well as the key backing of the military. Some political analysts say Saturday’s border showdown is less about resolving Venezuela’s needs and more about testing the military’s loyalty by daring it to turn aid away. “It’s part of this calculus that sees the military as leading a transition in Venezuela,” said Geoff Ramsey at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), a thinktank. Guaido has offered amnesty to military officers who disavow Maduro, though few have so far done so. Former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, who Washington accused of involvement in the drug trade a decade ago, released a social media video on Thursday offering his support for Guaido. Carvajal distanced himself from Maduro in 2017 by opposing the creation of an all-powerful legislature. “I’m sure that Venezuela will soon return to democracy ... How this happens depends on you, brothers in arms,” he said, addressing the military. Gustavo Marcano, senior aide to the opposition’s envoy to Washington, told reporters in the U.S. capital on Thursday that 11 diplomats in the United States have defected from Maduro’s government since Guaido declared himself interim president. Bank accounts for Venezuelan embassies and consulates in the United States had been frozen, he said.

2019-02-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has formally ended talks with California over federal plans to roll back fuel economy rules, the White House said on Thursday, setting the stage for what could be a lengthy legal fight over the state’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. California could be joined in any court fight by 12 other states that have adopted its standards and want stricter rules to fight climate change. Several other states have also demanded the administration abandon its August proposal to freeze federal fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and take away California’s ability to impose stricter emissions rules. The administration has said tighter emissions controls would make automobiles too expensive.  “The administration is moving forward to finalize a rule later this year with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles,” the White House said in a statement. California has been allowed to set state standards that are stricter than federal rules under an exemption granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. The administration wants to revoke that waiver, saying California should not “dictate” policy for the rest of the country and arguing that another law pre-empts California from setting its own vehicle rules. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the administration’s decision to scrap the talks was a sign of its “weakness and fallibility.”  “California and states throughout America are prepared to defend our national Clean Car standards even if the Trump administration intends to go AWOL,” he said in an email statement. California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the end of negotiations was “unfortunate.” General Motors said it was “disappointed” that the talks ended.  GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles generate most of their global profits from U.S. sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.  All three have discontinued or plan to drop small and medium-sized sedans from their lineups, making it harder for their fleets to meet tighter emissions standards. “We continue to prioritize the need for one national program and remain hopeful that the parties can find a solution to achieve this goal,” GM said, adding that it was committed to “an all-electric future.” Ford said that it wanted “regulatory certainty, not protracted litigation.” “A coordinated program with every stakeholder is in the best interest of Ford’s customers, and is the best path forward to achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of global operations, said in a statement. An administration official familiar with the negotiations said California had failed to compromise. Instead, the official said, the state insisted on sticking with tougher Obama-era mandates and it would offer only a short extension in applying them. The official also said California “demanded” that the federal government “surrender” authority to set emissions and economy standards for the rest of the country. Trump escalated his administration’s power struggle with California on Tuesday, when the administration canceled $929 million in federal funds for a California high-speed rail project. The state’s governor said the move was in  retaliation for California leading a 16-state coalition challenging Trump’s national emergency to obtain funds for building a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Obama-era rules would require automakers roughly to double average fuel efficiency by 2025, sharply reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, which is linked to climate change. It was one of that administration’s most significant climate policy actions. Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, one of 13 states that had adopted California’s standards, said he was “deeply disappointed” by failure of the talks. “Repeatedly, I have urged this administration to strike a deal with the State of California and seize the win-win opportunity to keep the American auto industry globally competitive and create more good paying jobs here at home while protecting our environment,” he said in a statement.

2019-02-21,"MELBOURNE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Australia’s treasurer on Friday played down concerns about a ban on Australian coal imports into China’s northern port of Dalian, saying China was not targeting Australia over other diplomatic issues. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was responding to questions about a Reuters report that customs at China’s northern port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal since the start of February, news which knocked the Australian dollar down more than 1 percent on Thursday on concerns about tension with Australia’s biggest trading partner. Asked whether Australian imports into Dalian had been banned, Frydenberg said: “No they haven’t.” Frydenberg attributed the slowdown to existing testing of coal imports and denied it was politically motivated. “Well, I wouldn’t jump to conclusions. The Australia-China trading relationship is exceptionally strong and exceptionally important,” Frydenberg said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. “In the past they’ve put testing systems in place. As (Trade Minister) Simon Birmingham has said, our ambassador will be making inquiries,” he said. The Aussie dollar clawed back some losses to $0.70995 as of Friday morning after his comments. Frydenberg was asked whether Australia was being targeted in retribution for Australia’s barring of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment to its 5G broadband network. “No we’re not. We have a very strong relationship with China and it’s based on mutual respect and mutual interest,” he said. Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner. Just over one-fifth of Australia’s thermal coal and metallurgical coal exports went to China in the year to June 2018. Despite a slowdown imposed by China on all coal imports late last year, Australian coal exports to China were higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 than in the same quarter a year earlier, Frydenberg said.

2019-02-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday due to a deteriorating economic outlook that was only partially offset by signs of trade progress between China and the United States, while gold and oil prices retreated from their recent peaks. The dollar held steady against most major currencies, while the Australian dollar tumbled on jitters about a ban on that country’s coal by a key Chinese port.  Signs of positive developments in U.S.-Sino trade talks and a possible Brexit compromise between Britain and the European Union spurred selling of U.S. and core European government debt, pushing their yields higher. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Moreover, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory sector fell into contraction territory in February for the first time since May 2016, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed. “Mainly it’s about the bad economic reports and intensifying recession fears,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. The grim economic data was offset by signs of progress in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. The world’s two biggest economies have started to outline commitments in principle on the most contentious issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,850.63, the S&P 500 lost 10.42 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,774.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.01 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,459.06. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.28 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up over 3 basis points at 2.686 percent, while the German 10-year Bund yield rose 3 basis points to 0.13 percent. Safe-haven demand for bonds cooled a bit as diplomats said Britain and the EU were moving closer to a legal compromise that Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will gain approval from the British parliament.   In the currency market, an index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies rose nearly 0.2 percent, while the Aussie dollar was down 1 percent at $0.7092. China’s northern Dalian port has put an indefinite ban on coal imports from Australia since the start of February, a port official told Reuters on Thursday. In the commodity market, crude prices pulled back from their highest levels of 2019 on hopes that oil supplies will balance later this year.  U.S. crude settled down 20 cents or 0.35 percent at $56.96 a barrel after hitting a 2019 high of $57.55 the previous day. Brent futures ended down 1 cent at $67.07, below a 2019 peak of $67.38.

The government held off recent bidding rounds because of low international crude prices, repeatedly postponing an auction that had been set to take place last year. “With the 20 blocks that we are submitting for investment consideration, we hope to discover about 1 billion barrels of oil,” Luis Miguel Morelli,  president of the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), told reporters.

2019-02-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell below 2019 highs on Thursday after U.S. government data showed a fifth weekly build in crude inventories and record production, while concerns about slowing global economic growth weighed. Losses were capped by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. Advancements in Washington-Beijing trade deal discussions also supported prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures fell 13 cents to $57.03 a barrel by 11:43 a.m. EST (1643 GMT) after touching a 2019 high of $57.55 the previous day. Brent crude futures fell 1 cent to $57.07 after touching a 2019 peak on Wednesday at $67.38.  U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose for a fifth straight week to the highest in more than a year, as production hit a record high and seasonal maintenance kept refining rates low last week, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S] U.S. crude stocks rose 3.7 million barrels in the week to Feb. 15, to 454.5 million barrels, the highest since October 2017, even as crude exports surged 1.2 million barrels per day to a record 3.6 million bpd. “All in all the report is bearish, in particular the strong increases in crude oil stocks,” said Cartsen Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.  Production in the United States, which last year became the world’s top crude producer, rose to record high at 12 million bpd, which could also dampen sentiment, Fritsch said. Still, tightening supply globally helped keep losses at bay. Oil prices have been driven up this year after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and producer allies such as Russia, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent a supply overhang from growing. OPEC member Nigeria signaled on Wednesday that it would limit output after its production climbed in January. “Willingness of the OPEC+ group to adhere with the output cut agreement will remain supportive of oil prices in the run-up to their scheduled April meeting,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. “Sharply declining oil output from Iran and Venezuela will further prompt bullish sentiment in the market.” U.S. sanctions have hit Iranian and Venezuelan crude exports  while unrest has curbed Libyan output.  Talks between the United States and China to resolve a trade dispute which has dented global growth may be progressing, helping to lift crude prices.  The two sides have started to outline commitments in principle on key points of contention, sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters. However, analysts said that a global economic slowdown - signs of which emerged late last year - was preventing prices from surging beyond highs reached this week.

2019-02-21,"(Adds information on board meeting, context) By Marianna Parraga Feb 21 (Reuters) - A board of directors appointed this month by Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress to run state-owned oil firm PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum on Thursday was arranging its first meeting at the company’s headquarters, according with two people familiar with the matter. Venezuela’s National Assembly, led by opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido, last week appointed new boards for PDVSA and subsidiaries PDV Holding, Citgo Holding and Citgo Petroleum amid a political battle to control the country’s foreign assets. Citgo Chairwoman Luisa Palacios and other members of the new boards arrived at the refiner’s Houston offices early Thursday after working with advisers to legally assume control of the company in Delaware, where the U.S.-based refiner is registered, according to people familiar with the matter. Palacios was working from the chief executive officer’s office, according to one of the people. It was unclear on Thursday if she plans to take the CEO title. Their arrival represents a solid step in Guaido’s effort to take control of the nation’s assets outside Venezuela. Many Western countries recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, but Socialist President Nicolas Maduro retains control of state institutions, including PDVSA. Maduro calls Guaido’s claim to the presidency an attempted coup and has promised he will not allow Citgo to be “stolen.” Four top Citgo executives were removed this week from their posts ahead of the arrival of the new board. The four were linked to the previous board, led from a Caribbean office by Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of Venezuela’s late President Hugo Chavez that was appointed by Socialist President Nicolas Maduro in 2017. Other changes to staffing at the company’s finance, public affairs and treasury departments have followed, according to the people. A Citgo spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. Since the United States imposed sanctions on PDVSA on Jan. 28, barring its U.S. customers from transferring sale proceeds to the Venezuelan firm, Citgo has not publicly disclosed executive changes or its stance on the new board of directors. The subsidiary can no longer pay its parent company for purchases of Venezuelan oil, unless the money is deposited in new bank accounts to be set up by Guaido’s team. Citgo imported 175,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude last year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Citgo is the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and owns plants in Illinois, Texas and Louisiana that provide about 4 percent of U.S. refining capacity. It also operates pipelines and terminals, and supplies fuel to a retail network of 5,000 gas stations across 30 U.S. states.

2019-02-21,"(Adds details, background) NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has received 37 applications for small refinery waivers for 2018 from the U.S. Renewable Standard (RFS) through mid-February, according to data released on Thursday by the agency. The 37 applications matches the total the EPA received last year, when it approved waivers at small refineries owned by oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp. None of the applications have been approved or rejected, according to the agency, which has until March 30 to rule on the applications. The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply every year or buy compliance credits from competitors that do, a burden the refining industry says costs it hundreds of millions of dollars every year and threatens to put some refineries out of business. The requests for exemptions have become a battleground between rivals in corn and oil industries after former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt greatly expanded the program, angering corn-belt farmers who say it hurts demand for ethanol and other biofuels.

2019-02-21,"SAO PAULO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Rising gasoline prices in Brazil and improved economic prospects in 2019 are boosting the outlook for ethanol sales and mills may once again skew toward the biofuel and away from sugar as the new cane crop approaches. Ethanol remains more attractive at present and mills will likely heavily favor production of the biofuel as the 2019/20 cane harvest begins in the center-south region in April, according to analysts and a major company in the sector. Brazilian mills used only 35 percent of the cane last year to produce sugar, a record low amount. The rest was consumed by ethanol production as sales of hydrous ethanol, the type that competes with gasoline at pumps. Hydrous ethanol sales rose 42 percent as mills sought to escape low global sugar prices. A repeat of that situation in 2019, even if not as extreme as last year, could reinforce a swing from a surplus of sugar globally to a deficit. Brazil’s oil company, Petrobras, increased prices for gasoline at refineries several times in recent days following higher oil prices. This week, gasoline reached the highest value since November. That movement opens room for ethanol prices to rise as well, improving mills’ profit margins. Luís Henrique Guimarães, CEO of Raízen, the world’s largest sugar maker and Brazil’s leading ethanol producer, said on Thursday that demand for fuel in the country is expected to rise in 2019 for the first time in three years. “We see the economy recovering, improving people’s income. Fuel demand ... should rise,” he said, adding that the company is upbeat on ethanol in 2019. Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at sugar and ethanol consultancy Datagro, sees current returns on raw sugar sales still around $1 per pound, below the equivalent on ethanol prices. “Sugar would have to rise to a premium over ethanol to lure mills to produce more of the sweetener,” he said. Broker and consultancy INTL FCStone estimates that current ethanol prices in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest fuels market, are equivalent to a hypothetical sugar price of $14.39 per pound considering New York futures. FCStone sugar analyst João Botelho believes mills could change the mix slightly towards sugar due to the expectation of a global sugar supply deficit, but they would still produce more ethanol than the sweetener when cane processing starts in April.

2019-02-21,"PARIS (Reuters) - Utility Engie is poised to cut back its geographical spread of businesses and focus on grids and renewables in a 1 billion euro cost-cutting drive to bolster revenues, sources familiar with the matter said.  Engie has been criticized for being too complex and  conglomerate-like and CEO Isabelle Kocher is expected to address this in a 2019-2021 corporate strategy plan to be announced next Thursday, when the company also releases 2018 results. Two sources with knowledge of the company’s plans said Kocher was likely to scale back the number of countries Engie operates in - it is present in some 70 countries - notably in central Europe. Both said Kocher would focus the gas and power group more strongly on grids and renewables after selling some 15 billion worth of fossil-fuel related assets in 2016-18. One of the two sources, a union official, said Kocher would aim to cut costs by 1 billion over three years, extending a 1.3 billion euro cost reduction plan in 2016-18. Daily business newsletter La Lettre A had first reported that Engie was targeting a billion-euro profit-boosting plan. Engie will also need to acquire at least one well-established, cash-generating business too make up for cash flow lost in its move away from fossil fuels, two sources, including a banker, said.  “The plan will have to involve major acquisitions. The planets are aligned, but the target remains to be decided,” one of them said.  Potential targets include the Transportadora Associada de Gás pipeline owned by Petrobras, Dutch renewables utility Eneco, or the U.S. renewable energy assets of Portugual’s EDPS, sources said.  Engie cut is net debt to core earnings ratio to 2.2 at the end of 2017 from 2.5 two years earlier. It can further boost its financial firepower by selling part of its 75 percent stake in French gas transport firm GRTgaz, which will become possible under the government’s new “Loi Pacte” law.  Engie declined to comment on strategy or potential targets ahead of next week’s presentation.  More than anything, Kocher and new chairman Jean-Pierre Clamadieu have to come with plan that reduces Engie’s conglomerate discount and boosts its shares. This is because the  government’s plan to cut its 23.64 percent holding will remove Engie’s best defense against activist investors. “For now, the state’s presence is a deterrent for activist investors, but once it leaves, Engie becomes a possible target,” said an investment banker familiar with the company’s thinking.  Activist investor Elliott Management’s acquisition of a 2.5 percent stake in drinks firm Pernod Ricard in December has focused minds across France’s CAC40 bluechip index on the need for a clear strategy, attractive valuation and close relationships with major shareholders. At German rival Uniper, the presence of Elliott and activist investor Knight Vinke has become a source of tension in the company’s relationship with Finnish shareholder Fortum. Engie’s deeply discounted stock price shows the valuation potential of splitting off some of the group’s assets.  With a 0.95 price/book ratio, Engie is the second-most undervalued share in the Stoxx European utilities index,  with only Uniper more undervalued by that measure, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.  More focused utilities trade at much higher multiples, with renewable energy group Orsted and Innogy around 2.5 times book and grid pureplays like Red Electrica and Terna trading at nearly three times book.  “Engie’s conglomerate discount is due to its complexity,” one banker said. A large UK-based institutional investor said the company was “a black box”, incomprehensible to investors.  Bankers and advisers say Kocher’s biggest problem - Engie’s nuclear assets in Belgium - may offer its strongest defense against an activist attack.  Belgium plans to phase out nuclear energy by 2025, which will leave Engie the decades-long expensive task of decommissioning its seven nuclear plants there. “When an activist takes aim at a company, it is usually because he sees something that management doesn’t. But I don’t see what solution an activist could bring for Belgian nuclear,” the banker said.

2019-02-21,"LISBON (Reuters) - The crew of Venezuelan oil tanker, the Rio Arauca, that has been stuck in the middle of the river Tagus in Lisbon for nearly two years due to unpaid debt, is set to be dismissed, managers Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM) said on Thursday. BSM also said in a statement sent to Reuters another Venezuelan tanker, the Parnaso, which is in dry dock at the port of Setubal, south of Lisbon, will also have its crew removed later this week due to a lack of payment from owners PDV Marina, a subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. Lisbon’s maritime court ruled to take possession of the Parnaso last August. Both vessels are under BSM management.  PDVSA had no immediate comment on the issue. The amount owed by PDV Marina to BSM globally is at least $15 million, according to a source at the company and a document seen by Reuters. BSM said the Rio Arauca arrived in Lisbon in May 2017 but has been inactive and unable to dock since then. “BSM, as the manager for Rio Arauca, has operated a crew rotation, maintaining sufficient manning levels aboard to ensure the vessel’s safety and security while at anchor in the Tagus for the past 21 months,” BSM said, adding that the vessel was securely at anchor. Legal responsibility for the vessel now sits with the arresting parties, it said.    The port authorities in Lisbon and Setubal declined to comment on BSM’s intention to remove the crews. Lisbon’s Port Authority (APL) said Rio Arauca had entered the port with a cargo of crude for the local oil firm Galp Energia, but later Portuguese navigation company Navex declined to continue to be the tanker’s agent. The tanker was then subject to “successive arrest orders”, APL said.  APL filed a petition against the ship owner PDV Marina in April 2018 over accumulating monthly charges of 200,000 euros. APL said PDV Marina owed it a total of 1.7 million euros as of the end of last year.  In August 2018 another arrest order was issued by bunker fuel broker Amoil. BSM said that Amoil secured a maritime lien on the vessel claiming an unpaid debt by PDV Marina. Rio Arauca arrived in Lisbon with 26 crew members but Portugal’s Immigration and Border Service (SEF) said only 16 people still remained aboard.  Various tankers with Venezuelan crude around the world have been arrested by authorities or otherwise prevented from leaving because PDVSA has not been able to pay for hull cleaning, inspections, and other port services.

The dollar held steady against most major currencies, while the Australian dollar tumbled on jitters about a ban on that country’s coal by a Chinese port. Signs of positive developments in U.S.-Sino trade talks and a possible Brexit compromise between Britain and the European Union spurred selling of U.S. and core European government debt, pushing their yields higher. The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday domestic orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.7 percent. Moreover, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory sector fell into contraction territory in February for the first time since May 2016, data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed. “Overall, it is showing that the economy is not as strong as it was in the summer of 2018,” aid Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The grim economic data was offset by signs of progress in trade talks between Beijing and Washington. The world’s two biggest economies have started to outline commitments in principle on the most contentious issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.35 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was up 4 basis points at 2.690 percent, while the German 10-year Bund yield rose 3 basis points to 0.13 percent. Safe-haven demand for bonds cooled a bit as diplomats said Britain and the EU were moving closer to a legal compromise that Prime Minister Theresa May hopes will gain approval from the British parliament. In the currency market, an index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies rose 0.1 percent, while the Aussie dollar was down 1.17 percent at $0.7080. China’s northern Dalian port has put an indefinite ban on coal imports from Australia since the start of February, a port official told Reuters on Thursday. In the commodity market, crude prices pulled back from their highest levels of 2019 on hopes that oil supplies will balance later this year.

A potential deal would involve one of the largest privately-owned businesses in Texas’ Midland Basin, and provide an exit for its owners which built the position in an area considered at the heart of the U.S. shale revolution. The Permian’s importance in growing U.S. oil production to record levels, with some of the cheapest extraction costs in the country, means those holding large patches of land have been keen to try and offload these positions to oil majors which have the resources needed to fully develop production. DoublePoint’s owners include Apollo Global Management, Blackstone Group’s GSO Capital Partners, Magnetar Capital, and Quantum Energy Partners. Apollo, Blackstone and Magnetar all declined to comment. Quantum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. DoublePoint’s owners have been interviewing investment banks in recent days, according to four sources aware of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. There is no guarantee DoublePoint will succeed in selling itself, and its owners’ plans could still change. Sources said two banks will be appointed to advise on the sale, with Jefferies likely to be one of the duo chosen because of its longstanding relationship with DoublePoint, two of the sources said. Jefferies declined to comment. The shopping of DoublePoint to potential buyers is expected to begin by the middle of the year, depending on market conditions, according to one of those sources and a third source. Oil majors and large independent producers will likely be targeted as potential buyers. Last year, BP Plc, Diamondback Energy, and Concho Resources all completed sizable acquisitions in the Permian. DoublePoint Energy was formed in 2018 by the combination of two existing companies owned by private equity firms - Double Eagle Energy Holdings III and FourPoint Energy. It had more than 70,000 acres spread across six Texas counties, according to the statement announcing the formation.

2019-02-21,"(Adds milestones, further details from data) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose for a fifth straight week to the highest in more than a year, as production hit a record high and  seasonal maintenance kept refining rates low last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories rose 3.7 million barrels in the week to Feb. 15, to 454.5 million barrels, the highest since October 2017. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an increase of 3.1 million barrels. U.S. weekly crude production edged higher to a record 12 million barrels per day, the data showed. Oil production has surged in the United States, thanks to a shale revolution, vaulting the country above Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world’s biggest producer. “The continued surge in U.S. production stands as a bearish dynamic for market prices, especially as increasing volumes get sold abroad in a direct challenge to Saudi Arabia and Russia,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Net U.S. crude imports rose marginally last week by 69,000 bpd, as exports surged 1.2 million bpd to a record 3.6 million bpd, data showed. Market participants had anticipated a jump in exports as shipments ramped up after fog disrupted loadings in the U.S. Gulf Coast a week earlier. Refinery utilization rates remained unchanged at 85.9 percent of total capacity as refinery crude runs fell by 57,000 bpd, holding at their lowest since October 2017. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, rose by 3.4 million barrels, the EIA said. Analysts and traders attributed much of the increase in inventories at Cushing to ongoing seasonal maintenance work by refiners. “The refinery runs obviously are down ... more than expected,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “But it’s a reflection that maintenance season is in full stead right now, leading to lower demand for oil.” Gasoline stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 350,000-barrel drop. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.5 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.7 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2019-02-21,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday Mexico will not offer more oil joint ventures between private companies and state energy company Pemex indefinitely, raising doubts about auctions set for October. In reply to a question about the contracts, known in the industry as “farm-outs,” Lopez Obrador said the country would not offer more until existing projects began producing oil. Credit ratings agency Fitch downgraded Pemex in January, citing precarious finances and a collapse in oil output.  Lopez Obrador is betting on raising oil production through service contracts mainly with Mexican companies to squeeze more oil from existing shallow water and onshore fields. He has long been a critic of his predecessor’s liberalization of the energy industry, which allowed private and foreign companies to bid for oil exploration and production both alone and in association with Pemex. Lopez Obrador, who is from oil-producing state Tabasco, has previously said he will give companies three years to start producing before he decides whether to allow more auctions. He has not been clear whether this also applies to Pemex joint ventures.  In December, a few days after Lopez Obrador took office, the National Hydrocarbons Commission canceled two auctions for private energy companies set for February. But it chose to delay until Oct. 9 rather than cancel a round of “farm-out” auctions.

2019-02-21,"AMMAN (Reuters) - At least 10 people were killed and a number were wounded on Thursday when a bomb blast hit a minibus carrying workers employed in a major oil installation in eastern Syria run by a U.S.-backed Kurdish group, residents of the area said. The incident took place near the town of Al-Shahil in the  southeast of oil-rich Deir al-Zor province that borders Iraq, in an area under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that are backed by Washington. It was not known who carried out the attack. It came as the SDF presses on with efforts to retake the last small area of territory held in Syria by Islamic State. Activists with relatives in the area said many of the young men in the blown-up minibus had come from work in the nearby al-Omar field, one of Syria’s largest oil fields. Video on social media purportedly showed bodies lying on the ground following the attack. A source in the area said at least two SDF fighters were among those killed.

2019-02-21,"(Adds acting CEO quote, updates share price, adds change how Bunge will issue guidance) By Karl Plume Feb 21 (Reuters) - Global grains merchant Bunge Ltd reported a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday after a truce in the U.S.-China trade war ruined the company’s bets on Brazilian soy, sending shares down to a three-year low. Bunge, under pressure from weak results over the past two years, missed Wall Street forecasts for the fourth time in five quarters. Shares of the White Plains, New York-based company dropped 4.2 percent to $50.41. Brazilian soy prices had swelled to a large premium to U.S. beans after China slapped steep tariffs on shipments from the United States in July. But that premium narrowed after the countries declared a temporary truce in their trade war on Dec. 1. That resulted in a $125 million loss as the value of Bunge’s soybean inventory plunged. The gaffe was at least the second major risk management blunder by Bunge, whose executives had asserted last summer that shifts in global trade flows “play to our strengths.” “We’re not satisfied with our performance,” acting CEO Gregory Heckman told analysts on a conference call, adding that “2018 could have and, frankly, should have been a much better year.” Gross profit in Bunge’s agribusiness segment, historically responsible for about 80 percent of company revenue, fell to $203 million from $238 million in the fourth quarter a year earlier. Last month, Bunge warned of lower full-year earnings in the segment as well as in its sugar and bioenergy business. The company has been under investor pressure and the target of takeover attempts after an earlier string of weak profits. It removed long-time CEO Soren Schroder and is conducting a strategic review of its businesses that may include a sale of the 200-year-old company. Bunge’s problems are expected to stretch into the current year. Agribusiness results in 2019 are expected to be below 2018 due to narrowing soybean crush margins, while its struggling sugar and bioenergy unit’s results are likely to be “about break-even,” the company said. Bunge also said it would no longer offer earnings guidance estimates for its business segments, but instead give directional guidance. The company’s net loss available to shareholders widened to $74 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 8 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 20 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said net sales fell 0.5 percent to $11.54 billion.

2019-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in China-bound exports of British oil may soften the potential blow to the sale of UK crude to Asia from a no-deal Brexit, export data showed and trade sources said, offsetting likely lower shipments to South Korea. While Britain and the European Union remain in talks over Brexit, tariffs and other terms governing Britain’s trade with most of the globe would be set under World Trade Organization rules under a no-deal departure from the EU. The flow of British crude to Asia is significant for the global market as it can affect prices and is a popular trading play. Oil companies have been worried a no-deal Brexit could limit this arbitrage, creating excess supply in Europe. According to UK government and oil trading sources, the flow of British crude to China would not face increased tariffs under a no-deal Brexit. China has in recent months been purchasing more than South Korea, the other major Asian buyer of UK oil. “Leaving without a deal wouldn’t impact the tariffs we face from China,” a UK government source said, since Britain already trades with China under WTO rules. This would go some way to leaving the arbitrage in Asia open for Forties, the most popular British crude grade among Asian buyers. With the way forward still unclear, the UK’s Department for International Trade said the government recommended planning for all Brexit outcomes, including no deal. “Our priority is to avoid disruption to our global trading relationships as we leave the European Union and we are seeking continuity for existing free trade agreements,” the department said in a statement. A trader with an oil company dealing in Forties said China would remain a viable outlet under a no-deal Brexit. “Yes, I think it would,” he said. “But I suppose looking at the overall picture, you would have fewer options for your barrels.” Flows to South Korea may decline, he said, since the UK would drop out of a free-trade agreement (FTA) the EU has with that country. With the FTA, South Korea became a big buyer of Forties, a trade that has helped support the grade’s value. Such shipments also affect global prices as Forties is part of the Brent benchmark used for oil deals. As a result, trading plays hinging on sending UK crude via tanker to the East, or appearing to do so, have become a popular feature of the market. Oil companies that trade Forties are concerned its value could drop if South Korea imposes a customs tariff that matches pre-FTA levels should the UK leave the EU with no deal or without a separate trade agreement with Seoul. “We worried about the impact it would have on Forties if the obvious arbitrage was not there any more,” a second North Sea trading source said. “This would lower the value as there will be too much crude in the North Sea that needs to find a home.” Still, China has increasingly been providing that home, buying between 4 million and 6 million barrels of Forties a month since October, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  The economics of the trade hinge on a number of factors, such as freight rates and the competitiveness of a Brent-linked crude such as Forties against a more local crude grade based on the Dubai benchmark. “Clearly the UK has found a ready market for this type of crude in China,” Kpler, which researches oil trade patterns, said in a report. “The flow of Forties into China is particularly interesting given the unusually long distance and shipment time.” Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-brexit/rising-uk-china-oil-trade-could-soften-blow-of-no-deal-brexit-idUKL5N20A5OZ,21 Feb 2019,"* China bought more Forties than South Korea in recent

2019-02-21,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should spend hundreds of billions of euros combating climate change during the next decade, its chief executive said on Thursday, responding to a Swedish teen who has inspired a global movement of children against global warming. In a speech alongside 16-year-old Greta Thunberg in Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also criticised U.S. President Donald Trump for suggesting climate change was “invented” and “ideological”. “In the next financial period from 2021 to 2027, every fourth euro spent within the EU budget will go towards action to mitigate climate change,” Juncker said of his proposal for the EU budget, which is typically 1 percent of the bloc’s economic output, or 1 trillion euros (£863.58 billion) over seven years. “Mr. Trump and his friends believe that climate change is something that has just been invented and its an ideological concept, but ... something dangerous is already underway,” Juncker said. Thunberg was in Brussels to join a seventh week of demonstrations by Belgian children skipping school to protest against global warming.  More than 10,000 students, some holding up banners saying “stop denying the earth is dying”, protested across Belgium on Thursday, including in Brussels and the western city of Ghent. Thunberg said young people around the world wanted politicians to heed scientists’ warnings. “Unite behind the science, that is our demand,” Thunberg told a plenary session of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). “Talk to the scientists, listen to them.” Trump has cast doubt on the science of climate change. In 2017, he announced his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris deal to combat climate change, although he cannot quit the deal until after the 2020 presidential election. The Paris accord aims to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius and prevent damaging levels of global warming, which scientists say would limit water availability, alter coastlines and undermine human health. Trump’s new pick to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said last month climate change was not a major crisis. But Thunberg said she and hundreds of thousands like her were skipping school each week to focus politicians minds on a U.N. conference in 2020 when countries need to present new plans for more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions cuts. Students in Germany, Switzerland, France and Australia have followed her lead and also skipped classes to protest, while Thunberg took her protest to last month’s World Economic Forum in Davos to galvanize leaders meeting there to action. Politicians’ failure to act “would be the greatest failure of human history and they will be remembered as the greatest villains of all time,” she said.

2019-02-21,"NEW DELHI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India on Thursday revamped rules for future exploration and production of oil and gas blocks in its efforts to attract private investment and increase domestic production. India imports four out of every five barrels of crude oil it consumes and is likely to shell out more than $100 billion on oil purchases in 2018/19. “The emphasis of the new rules is for raising hydrocarbon production,” Dharmendra Pradhan, India’s oil minister said in New Delhi. Under the new rules, producers will be given pricing and marketing freedom that is currently non-existent in natural gas blocks in India. Explorers will also be given financial incentives for early production from their blocks, Pradhan said. “Fiscal incentive is also provided on additional gas production from domestic fields over and above normal production,” a government statement said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is seeking re-election in a few months, has targeted a 10 percent reduction to India’s dependence on imported crude by 2022. However, India’s dependence has increased from 78 percent in 2014/15 to an estimated 84 percent in 2018/19, government data shows. Pradhan said that state-owned companies Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India will be allowed to induct private players to enhance production from its existing blocks and bring in new technology and capital. The new rules will be largely applicable on 19 basins and on future licensing rounds, he added. India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven are producing. Encouraging private partnership can lead to more discoveries and higher production, local broker Emkay said in a report.

A mixed bag of economic data ranging from disappointing U.S. durable goods orders to slightly brighter French PMI data meant Wall Street was set for a more choppy start than had initially been expected. Some poor company earnings and ongoing Brexit confusion had sapped the main FTSE, DAX and CAC 40 bourses in Europe following a somewhat more eventful session in Asia. MSCI’s main Asia-Pacific index had struck a new a 4-1/2 month high after sources told Reuters overnight that U.S. and Chinese negotiators were drawing up six “memorandums of understanding” to help ease their trade feud. They include forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade, the sources said, adding the two sides were pushing for an agreement by a March 1 deadline, after which U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will ratchet up. The day’s biggest mover though was the Aussie dollar. It had slumped more than 1 percent after one of the country’s big banks, Westpac, called for two RBA rate cuts this year and Reuters reported that the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal. Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner. “It is hard know how much of this is in the price considering the fall we saw from the Aussie dollar last year,” said State Street’s EMEA Head of Macro Strategy, Tim Graf. It is still up this year, however, which means “there is totally scope for further downside”. The Aussie was last trading at $0.7105, down 0.8 percent on the day and it was not the only one struggling. The Kiwi dollar got bundled down 0.5 percent in the fallout and the U.S. dollar went back in the red after the durable goods miss. The euro too spent its day dithering between $1.1318 and $1.1366. French PMIs had been reassuring but were then followed by news that euro zone factory output had unexpectedly slammed into reverse last month as activity in Europe’s manufacturing powerhouse Germany declined again. IHS Markit’s Flash Composite euro zone Purchasing Managers’ Index, which is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 51.4 this month from a final January reading of 51.0, above a Reuters poll median expectation for 51.1 but still below where it has been for much of the past four years. “The euro zone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The general picture remained one of a more subdued business environment than seen throughout much of last year,” Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist said. Williamson said the results pointed to first-quarter euro zone growth of just 0.1 percent, below the latest Reuters poll estimate for 0.4 percent. They come soon after the European Central Bank ended its more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase stimulus programme. The slide in the Aussie dollar had helped its share market close at a six-month high. Japan’s Nikkei had ended 0.1 percent stronger too and though Chinese shares sagged, the yuan firmed to its strongest level since July in the “offshore” market on the trade hopes. Sterling shrugged off Fitch putting its UK credit rating on a formal downgrade warning amid uncertainty about whether the country’s parliament will be able to agree a transition deal before next month’s planned Brexit date. Wall Street stock futures were 0.2 percent lower after the early U.S. data flurry and as traders continued to digest the Federal Reserve’s affirmation on Wednesday that it will be “patient” on further interest rate rises The central bank had also signalled it would soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of $4 trillion in bonds and other assets, though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted “patient” stance on U.S. rates will last. In the commodity market, crude prices pulled back having risen more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest in 2019 on hopes that oil market supply will balance later this year. U.S. crude was last down 0.2 percent, or 10 cents, at $57.08 per barrel. Brent was 0.4 percent, or 23 cents, weaker at $66.85 and Gold was down a touch at $1,333 having scaled a 10-month peak of $1,346.70 on Wednesday.

2019-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders are becoming very bullish on the outlook for prices, betting that Saudi Arabia will do whatever it takes to tighten the market even if consumption growth slows, helped by U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Brent’s calendar spread for the second half of 2019 has surged into a backwardation of 90 cents per barrel, the strongest for more than three months and a huge swing from a 70 cent contango near the end of last year. For many traders, spreads rather than spot prices are a better indicator of expected balance between production and consumption (“Price relations between July and September Wheat Futures at Chicago”, Working, 1933). Backwardation implies many traders expect the market to be undersupplied in the second half of the year with a significant drawdown in global inventories of crude and fuels. The current swing to backwardation is similar to previous shifts in market structure when OPEC and its allies reduced production in 2017 and the United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in 2018. Both of those shifts were accelerated and amplified by significant position-building in crude oil by hedge fund managers, and something similar is likely in 2019. Hedge funds and other money managers have been net buyers of Brent crude futures and options in nine of the last 10 weeks with net purchases equivalent to 130 million barrels. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TZZN0D) Fund managers have almost doubled their bullish position in Brent to 266 million barrels, up from just 136 million barrels in early December, according to position records published by ICE Futures Europe. Position-building has been very similar to previous episodes, but total positions are still well below previous peaks of 500-600 million barrels, suggesting it could still have some way to run. Like other financial traders, hedge funds and other money managers tend to concentrate their positions in nearby futures contracts where there is more liquidity. Hedge fund buying is therefore lifting the price of nearby contracts and accelerating the shift into backwardation (just as fund selling depressed nearby contracts and accelerated the shift to contango in the fourth quarter). Traders have become relatively bullish on oil even as they maintain a more defensive position in equities and bonds, suggesting oil prices are being lifted by idiosyncratic factors. Brent has continued to march steadily into deeper backwardation even as the benchmark U.S. Treasury yield curve has remained close to flat and major U.S. equity indices have moved sideways. Traders seem increasingly confident Saudi Arabia’s output cut coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela will push the market into deficit, especially in the second half, when consumption is normally higher. The market is expected to be undersupplied despite a slowdown in consumption growth this year and poor compliance with the production agreement by other countries in the enlarged OPEC+ group of exporters. In effect, hedge fund managers are gambling on Saudi Arabia’s determination to tighten the market and lift prices plus a relatively tough sanctions policy from the White House to counteract weakness from other sources. If the U.S. economy slows and the Federal Reserve responds by trimming interest rates, the resulting decline in the dollar would also be supportive for oil prices, provided the slowdown is not too deep or too long. The investment narrative is drawing strong interest from fund buyers even as investors remain more neutral in other asset classes. The principal risks are a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in global growth; a more dovish approach to sanctions from the White House; or renewed criticism about rising prices from the U.S. president. The White House has so far been relatively quiet about rising oil prices, but that might change if they rise above $75, the level that provoked a flurry of presidential tweets in 2018. Until then, oil traders seem convinced the oil market will continue to tighten. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

2019-02-21,"(Adds quotes, background, details) By Robert Muller PRAGUE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis on Thursday outlined the government’s plan to build a number of nuclear reactors, saying the state should control construction so it can halt the expansion should power prices fail to support the project. The government expects to sign a contract with majority state-owned CEZ to build one or more new reactors at Dukovany, with a tender towards the end of 2020 and a supplier chosen by 2024. Babis said the government would not provide CEZ an unlimited state guarantee and that the utility would cover any extra costs not generated by the state or foreign regulators. “The basic aim of the state should be to take control of construction of new nuclear capacity,” Babis told a nuclear conference. “The state would get such control by signing a contract with CEZ on construction.” “It is simpler and more favourable for customers than state guarantees, which would in fact amount to a blank cheque.” The government has been considering how to fund a multi-billion-dollar expansion of CEZ’s nuclear power plants, before some units reach the end of their lifetime. CEZ has balked at starting a tender without receiving state guarantees but Babis has said the company, Central Europe’s largest listed utility, can handle the project itself. “It is necessary to start the first stage immediately ... to get building permission at the Dukovany site and to organise the tender,” Babis said. “The state ... will have an option to make appropriate decisions on whether to continue or stop the planned construction in case the resulting consumer electricity price is at an unacceptable level.” Some minority shareholders fear nuclear expansion through reactor construction would dent dividend payouts if CEZ were pushed to finance it on its own. The company could face shareholder lawsuits. But CEZ Chief Executive Daniel Benes told the conference the best model for the expansion had not yet been determined and that any plan must not harm minority investors. “The contract has to be construed in a way not to harm the minority shareholders,” he said.

2019-02-21,"PARAISO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s race to build an oil refinery in record time on land that was until recently alive with mangrove, wild cats and boa constrictors, has run into trouble, complicating his effort to revive ailing state-oil company Pemex. Even before Lopez Obrador took office last December, work had begun to cut down protected woodland on Pemex land on the coast of Tabasco state to make room for the new refinery next  to the Dos Bocas port.   But oil industry environmental regulator ASEA in January ruled that the contractor that deforested the land did not have the correct permits to do so. The body levied a fine of about $700,000. ASEA says work on the refinery can only go ahead once a full environmental impact assessment is done and approved.  That could delay the refinery project for months or even years, just as the government is trying to boost oil output by giving the state a bigger role in the industry, modernizing refineries and building the new one in Tabasco, Lopez Obrador’s home state.     Gustavo Alanis, president of the Mexican Centre of Environmental Law advocacy group, said Pemex will run into legal problems if it continues to act in haste over the planned Dos Bocas refinery. “If they move quickly without paying heed to the laws they need to follow, they’ll become their own worst enemy,” he said. The government has said it plans to tender for the construction of the $8 billion refinery in March and finish building it in three years. Pemex did not respond to requests for comment for this article. The land, near the town of Paraiso, where the new refinery is planned was planted with coconut and citrus fruit in the 1970s and expropriated by Pemex. But the company never used the terrain and tropical woodland and wildlife took over.  Several types of plovers, herons and hawks, two species of iguanas and other reptiles, protected amphibians, threatened species of snakes and piping plovers, which are in danger of extinction, were identified in Paraiso by Conabio, a government commission in charge of studying biodiversity. Footprints of the jaguarundi, a wild cat, were found at the site, ASEA told Reuters, along with a wide variety of bird species and freshwater turtles.   The land was so rich in wildlife about a decade ago that a group of Pemex executives proposed that it be declared a private nature reserve to prevent future building there, company sources said. A study by a government institute several years ago concluded Paraiso was a risky location for a refinery because of the biodiversity found there. But satellite pictures taken in November and obtained from  Conabio show a wide belt of mangrove across the terrain has now been cut down, leaving a smaller perimeter of forest. By the time Lopez Obrador came to Dos Bocas to announce the new refinery in December, muddy ground and heavy works machinery had replaced the site’s thick tree cover. After the land was cleared, four threatened or protected species were rescued, including a type of porcupine, a boa constrictor and a rare iguana. Reuters could not establish the fate of the other animals the agency detected at the site.  Paraiso’s oyster fishermen fear the refinery might harm the Mecoacan lagoon just a few miles from the refinery site, and their main source of subsistence for several generation.  “What we want is for them not to damage the lagoon,” said Manuel de la Cruz, a leading local fisherman, who has worked the waterway since he was eight years old. He said he delivered a document to Lopez Obrador in December saying fishermen want more than just “crumbs” of government support. Lopez Obrador has not commented on ASEA’s January’s ruling about the clearing of the land. In its ruling, the environmental regulator also ordered the replanting of a larger mangrove area, whose location is yet to be determined, and the launching of a wildlife preservation programme.      Mexico’s energy minister, Rocio Nahle initially said the mangrove had not been touched at the Paraiso site. She said in November the municipal and state government had given permits to “clean” the terrain.  Only ASEA can give the permits needed for Pemex to build an industrial project on the site. The potential delay to the refinery comes at a crucial time for Pemex. Last week, the government announced a $3.9 billion bailout to stave off a threatened loss of the company’s investment grade credit rating. Ratings agencies say Lopez Obrador’s plans to overhaul Pemex put fresh strain on its already problematic finances. Ratings agency Fitch says Pemex is “insolvent.”   (Click on reut.rs/2It5RNN to see related photo essay) Additional reporting by David Alire Garcia and Marianna Parraga; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Frank Jack Daniel and Alistair Bell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-refinery/wider-image-wild-cats-boas-are-obstacles-in-mexican-presidents-refinery-race-idUKL1N1ZD05Z,21 Feb 2019,"Mexican President Andres

2019-02-21,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Customs at China’s northern port of Dalian has banned imports of Australian coal and will cap overall coal imports from all sources to the end of 2019 at 12 million tonnes, an official at Dalian Port Group told Reuters on Thursday.  The indefinite ban on imports from top supplier Australia, effective since the start of February, comes as major ports elsewhere in China prolong clearing times for Australian coal to at least 40 days.  Australia’s ties with China have deteriorated since 2017, when Canberra accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs. Tensions rose again last month after Australia rescinded the visa of a prominent Chinese businessman, just months after barring Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies from supplying equipment to its 5G broadband network.  Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner and the Australian dollar tumbled more than 1 percent to as low as $0.7086 on fears the Dalian ban would hurt its already slowing economy.  Asked if the ban was related to bilateral tensions, Geng Shuang, a spokesman at China’s foreign ministry, told reporters on Thursday that customs were inspecting and testing coal imports for safety and quality.  “The goals are to better safeguard the legal rights and interests of Chinese importers and to protect the environment,” Geng said, adding that the move was “completely normal”.  Imports through Dalian comprise only 1.8 percent of Australia’s total coal exports, but if the reported ban reflects a more significant deterioration in the trade relationship between Australia and China, then it could have a broader impact, said Ivan Colhoun, chief economist of markets at National Australia Bank, in a note on Thursday.  Five harbors overseen by Dalian customs - Dalian, Bayuquan, Panjin, Dandong and Beiliang - will not allow Australian coal to clear through customs, said the Dalian port official. Coal imports from Russia and Indonesia will not be affected. “I’m aware of unconfirmed and unsourced media reports and have asked our Ambassador in Beijing to urgently clarify their veracity,” said Australia’s Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham. “We continue to engage closely with industry on matters of market access ... China is a valued partner of Australia and we trust that our free trade agreement commitments to each other will continue to be honored.”  Birmingham also said that Australia’s exports of coal to China in the fourth quarter of 2018 were higher in volume and value than in the same period in 2017.  The Dalian ports handled about 14 million tonnes of coal last year, half of which was from Australia, said Gu Meng, an analyst at Orient Futures.  The Dalian official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Neither Dalian customs nor the national General Administration of Customs immediately responded to a request for comment.  The Dalian official said he was not given a reason for the ban on Australian imports.  Australia’s New Hope Coal declined to comment. Yancoal said it will not be impacted by the Dalian ban as it does not ship to the port. Glencore directed queries to the Minerals Council of Australia, which declined to comment.  Beijing has been trying to restrict imports of coal more generally to support domestic prices.  A Beijing-based coal trader said Dalian had cleared about 6 million tonnes of coal in January that had been delayed since late 2018 as China slowed customs clearance to curb imports.  The delayed cargoes would not be included in the 12 million tonnes under the 2019 quota, the trader said, citing customs information.  Dalian handles both thermal and coking coal imports but the clamp down is expected to have a bigger impact on coking coal, used in steelmaking, rather than on thermal coal, used to generate electricity.  Dalian customs accounted for 7 percent of China’s total coal imports in 2018, according to a report from consultancy Wood Mackenzie. A possible China-wide ban could cause spiking metallurgical coal prices and decouple seaborne coal prices from domestic prices, according to Robin Griffin, Wood Mackenzie’s research director.  Spot Australian coking coal at the northern Chinese port of Jingtang is 200 yuan ($29.85) cheaper per tonne than domestic prices, according to data tracked by Orient Futures. The price difference for thermal coal is about the same.  “It is hard to find a replacement for Australian coking coal since its sulfur content is very low,” said a purchasing manager at a large plant in Hebei province that produces coke, used in the steelmaking process, from coking coal.  “Current inventory at ports should be sufficient to support usage for one or two months, but it could be a problem in the long term, especially if other ports also tighten imports,” he said, declining to be named due to company policy.  The most-active coking coal contract for May delivery rose more than 2 percent during morning trade on Thursday.  “(The restriction) will further squeeze profit margins at steel mills after Vale’s accident has already driven up iron ore prices,” said Gu at Orient Futures.  China bought 28.26 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia in 2018, accounting for 43.5 percent of the country’s total imports of the fuel, customs data showed.

Around 1,000 full-time positions - out of a pro-forma total of 4,200 - will be eliminated in a “socially compatible manner,” BASF’s Wintershall unit said in a statement on Thursday. About 800 of the job cuts will be in Germany and about 200 in Norway, it added. The new company will seek to boost joint average daily output by around 40 percent to 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent from 2021-2023, up from a pro-forma 575,000 barrels in 2017. “This growth is expected to come from both companies’ existing portfolio as well as new production regions like Mexico, where DEA has made a recent entry, and Abu Dhabi, where Wintershall entered into a new oil and gas concession,” it said. The output goal was increased from a previous target range of 750,000-800,000 barrels, which was issued in September before the Mexico and Abu Dhabi transactions were agreed. The new group will achieve synergies of at least 200 million euros per year, from expected production increases and cost reductions, Wintershall added.

2019-02-21,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German utility RWE will win unconditional EU antitrust approval to buy the renewables businesses of E.ON and Innogy in a deal that will reshape the German energy market, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The acquisition is part of an asset swap deal which involves breaking up Innogy and dividing its assets between parent RWE and E.ON. Network, renewables and retail energy group Innogy was carved out from RWE two years ago as a standalone unit. On completion, RWE, Germany’s biggest electricity producer, will become Europe’s third-largest renewable energy provider behind Spain’s Iberdrola and Italy’s Enel. The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Feb. 26, Innogy and E.ON declined to comment.  RWE said: “We do not see cartel hurdles by taking over the renewable assets from E.ON, but we don’t want to make comments on the ongoing process.” As part of the deal, RWE will take a 16.7 percent stake in E.ON, which has to be approved by the German and British competition authorities. RWE will also need U.S. regulatory clearance to buy E.ON’s assets there. The EU competition enforcer is now reviewing E.ON’s acquisition of Innogy’s prized regulated energy networks and customer operations, with a decision due by March 7. E.ON and Innogy’s rivals and customers have been asked if the deal will push up prices and harm competition.

2019-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria has ordered foreign oil and gas companies to pay nearly $20 billion (£15 billion) in taxes it says are owed to local states, industry and government sources said, in a move that could deter investment in Africa’s largest economy. In a letter sent to the companies earlier this year via a debt-collection arm of the government, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) cited what it called outstanding royalties and taxes for oil and gas production. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Eni, Total and Equinor were each asked to pay the central government between $2.5 billion and $5 billion, said the sources, who saw or were briefed on the letters. Norway’s Equinor, which produced around 45,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in Nigeria in 2017, confirmed the request. “Several operators have received similar claims in a case between the authorities in Nigeria and local authorities in parts of the country,” an Equinor spokesman said. Exxon “is currently reviewing the matter”, a spokeswoman for the U.S. company said. Shell, Total, Eni and Chevron declined to comment, as did Nigeria’s presidency, petroleum ministry and NNPC.  The charge came after the central Nigerian government and local states settled a dispute over the distribution of revenue from hydrocarbon production. The sides agreed last year that Abuja would pay the states several billion dollars, three company and government sources said. The companies were expected to dispute their respective payment claims. “Equinor sees no merit to the case,” the company spokesman said. A source at another company said: “This looks like an internal dispute between the federal and local governments. The central government is simply trying to shift to the IOCs (international oil companies) money it owes.” It was unclear whether the move was linked to the upcoming presidential election in Nigeria, the most populous African country. The tax demand adds a fresh challenge to energy companies investing in Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil and gas producer, which have been negotiating production-sharing agreements with the government to develop and operate giant offshore fields. Oil theft, massive oil spills and corruption further complicate operations in the country. Nigeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), produced around 2.1 million bpd of oil last year, compared with 1.86 million bpd in 2017, NNPC says. Nigeria uses several types of contract with energy companies including the establishment of joint ventures and production sharing, the two most common partnerships for international oil companies in the country. The companies pay the government in the form of royalties and tax as well as providing the state with oil and gas.

2019-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in British Gas parent Centrica slumped to a 16-year low on Thursday after the group warned a national price cap on energy bills, a fall in nuclear output and lower volumes at its oil and gas division would hit its 2019 results. Centrica said a regulator-imposed cap on standard energy prices would lead to a £300 million hit to profits in 2019, including a one-off impact of about £70 million in the first quarter of 2019. Late last year Centrica, whose British Gas unit is Britain’s largest energy supplier, said it would seek a judicial review of the way regulator Ofgem calculated part of the price cap, which was initially set around 6 percent lower than British Gas’s standard variable tariff. Ofgem this month said the cap will be raised by 10 percent from April 1 and British Gas has already said it will increase its prices by the same amount. “We believe (the cap) is the wrong intervention but it is here and we will live with it,” Chief Executive Iain Conn told journalists. British Gas shed 742,000 customer accounts in 2018 as the company came under pressure from smaller, nimbler rivals, often able to offer cheaper deals. Centrica posted a 12 percent rise in 2018 operating profit to £1.39 billion, bolstered by higher commodity prices, and maintained its full-year dividend at 12 pence. But traders focused on the weak outlook and concerns the dividend could be under threat in future. “Although a much-feared reduction in Centrica’s dividend hasn’t been explicitly announced today, the writing is pretty much on the wall,” said Cityindex senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta.  Shares were down 11 percent at 122.15 pence by 1038 GMT, having touched a 16-year low of 120.05p. In exploration and production, volumes at Centrica’s Spirit Energy are expected to remain in the lower half of its 45 to 55 million barrels of oil equivalent range for 2019. Meanwhile, output from the company’s 20 percent stake in Britain’s nuclear plants was still affected by current outages, Centrica said.  The company is targeting sales of £500 million from the sale of non-core assets in 2019 and said it would sell Clockwork Inc, its North American home services business, for $300 million (£230 million). Conn said plans to sell its UK nuclear stake are ongoing and the company expects to provide an update on this mid-year. It also plans to make efficiency savings of around £250 million, include making between 1,500 and 2,000 job losses on a like-for-like basis in 2019, which Conn said were part of the 4,000 cuts to 2020 announced last year.

A brief rise in the euro and bond yields after some slightly brighter French data and some poor company earnings made for a low key start for the main FTSE , DAX and CAC 40 bourses. Asian trading had been far more eventful though. MSCI’s main Asia-Pacific index rose to a 4-1/2 month high after sources told Reuters U.S. and Chinese negotiators were drawing up six “memorandums of understanding” to solve their trade feud. They include forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade, the sources said, adding the sides were pushing for an agreement by March 1, the deadline after which U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports will ratchet up. The big mover though was the Aussie dollar. It slumped more than 1 percent after one of the country’s big banks, Westpac, called for two RBA rate cuts this year and Reuters reported that the Chinese port of Dalian had banned imports of Australian coal. Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner. “It is hard know how much of this is in the price considering the fall we saw from the Aussie dollar last year,” said State Street’s EMEA Head of Macro Strategy, Tim Graf. It is still up this year, however, which means “there is totally scope for further downside”. The Aussie was last trading at $0.7105, down 0.8 percent on the day but it was not the only one struggling. The Kiwi dollar got bundled down 0.5 percent and the euro had given back its early gains to stand at $1.1320. French PMIs had been reassuring but were then followed by news that euro zone factory output had unexpectedly slammed into reverse last month as activity in Europe’s manufacturing powerhouse Germany declined again. IHS Markit’s Flash Composite euro zone Purchasing Managers’ Index, which is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 51.4 this month from a final January reading of 51.0, above a Reuters poll median expectation for 51.1 but still below where it has been for much of the past four years. “The euro zone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The general picture remained one of a more subdued business environment than seen throughout much of last year,” Chris Williamson, IHS Markit’s chief business economist said. Williamson said the results pointed to first-quarter euro zone growth of just 0.1 percent, below the latest Reuters poll estimate for 0.4 percent. They come soon after the European Central Bank ended its more than 2.6 trillion euro asset purchase stimulus programme. The slide in the Aussie dollar had helped its share market close at a six-month high. Japan’s Nikkei had ended 0.1 percent stronger too and though Chinese shares sagged, the “offshore” yuan firmed to its strongest level since July on the trade hopes. Sterling shrugged off Fitch putting its UK credit rating on a formal downgrade warning amid uncertainty about whether the country’s parliament will be able to agree a transition deal before next month’s planned Brexit date. U.S. stock futures were up 0.2 percent after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday affirmed it would be “patient” on further interest rate rises and that the economy remained fundamentally strong. The central bank also signalled it would soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of $4 trillion in bonds and other assets, though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted “patient” stance on U.S. rates will last. “The bar to restarting rate hikes in the near term seems to be quite high, with several participants arguing that rate increases would be necessary “only if inflation outcomes were higher than in (the) baseline outlook”, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. In the commodity market, crude prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest in 2019 on hopes that oil markets will balance later this year. Oil prices were also helped by output cuts from top producers and U.S. sanctions on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude was last up 0.3 percent, or 17 cents, at $57.33 per barrel. Brent was 0.1 percent, or 5 cents, higher at $67.13. Gold was steady at $1,338.50, close to a 10-month peak of $1,346.70 scaled on Wednesday.

2019-02-21,"ISTANBUL, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Turkey will begin drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus in coming days, state-owned news agency Anadolu reported Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu saying on Thursday, a move that could stoke tensions with neighbouring Cyprus and Greece. Turkey and the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean, a region thought to be rich in natural gas. “In the coming days we will start drilling with two ships around Cyprus,” Cavusoglu was quoted as saying in a speech to a business conference in western Turkey’s Aydin province. “Let those who come to the region from far away, and their companies, see that nothing can be done in that region without us. Nothing at all can be done in the Mediterranean without Turkey, we will not allow that,” Cavusoglu said. Turkey launched its first drillship “Fatih” in October to drill off the coast of Turkey’s southern Antalya province.

2019-02-21,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Adani Enterprises might have to wait up to two years to get two environmental approvals to start construction at its controversial Carmichael coal mine in Australia, a Queensland government official told Reuters. Adani said in November that it would fund the mine and rail project itself, requiring the company to cut the initial plans for the mine to around a quarter of its original size, after banks buckled to pressure from investors worried about climate change. Environmental activists have contested the project since it was first proposed eight years ago because of concerns about global warming and its potential impact of its port operations on the Great Barrier Reef. Carmichael is one of the world’s biggest greenfield coal projects in recent years. Caoilin Chestnutt, Queensland’s Resources Investment Commissioner, commented on the approval length in an interview on the sidelines of the Coaltrans conference in New Delhi late on Wednesday. Her agency is not responsible for issuing environmental approvals for the project, which is regulated by Queensland’s Department for Environment and Science.  Chestnutt told Reuters she believed environmental clearance for the project could in theory be given in the next several months.  “I would guess, but it is an absolute mess, six months to two years,” she said. “They (Department of Environment) have said they (Adani) have to go back to the drawing board and draft a management plan.” Queensland’s Department of Natural Resources said on Thursday in a statement that Chestnutt’s role was “to attract business investment to the Queensland resources sector” and that she was “not authorized to speak about any specific environmental approvals.”  The Queensland Department for Environment and Science has said two approvals were required, one relating to a plan to protect an endangered bird species, the black-throated finch, and another to identify the source aquifer of ground water in the area. Chestnutt said protests against the mine were a “hindrance” and that there was a lot of misinformation about the mine that needed to be challenged. Asked what she considered “misinformation”, she said, “I think people just think that coal is dirty and global warming is a major issue, and people just like to blame the coal business for that, CO2 (carbon dioxide) for that.” A spokesman for Adani said the firm expected to move faster on the project in future.  “We have provided all required information data and feedback needed for this process to be completed and accordingly we expect to have these plans approved in the very near term,” the spokesman said in an emailed response to Reuters. Adani plans to start producing around 10 million tonnes of coal a year and eventually ramp up to 27.5 million tonnes at the mine. The company last week slammed a report on the endangered bird which was reviewed by the Queensland government, calling it ""an anti-Adani lobbying document, dressed up as science.""

2019-02-21,"* Northern Chinese port bans imports from top coal supplier * Comes amid strained relations between Canberra and Beijing * Also sets quota of 12 mln T of overall imports for rest of 2019 (Adds comment from China foreign ministry, Australian gov’t, companies, Chinese trader; adds detail on import quota) BEIJING, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Customs at China’s northern port of Dalian has banned imports of Australian coal and will cap overall coal imports from all sources to the end of 2019 at 12 million tonnes, an official at Dalian Port Group told Reuters on Thursday. The indefinite ban on imports from top supplier Australia, effective since the start of February, comes as major ports elsewhere in China prolong clearing times for Australian coal to at least 40 days. Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner and the Australian dollar tumbled on the news, falling more than 1 percent to as low at $0.7086. Five harbours overseen by Dalian customs - Dalian, Bayuquan, Panjin, Dandong and Beiliang - will not allow Australian coal to clear through customs, said the official. Coal imports from Russia and Indonesia will not be affected. “I’m aware of unconfirmed and unsourced media reports and have asked our Ambassador in Beijing to urgently clarify their veracity,” said Australia’s Minister for Trade Simon Birmingham. “We continue to engage closely with industry on matters of market access...China is a valued partner of Australia and we trust that our free trade agreement commitments to each other will continue to be honoured.” Birmingham also said that Australia’s exports of coal to China in the fourth quarter of 2018 were higher in volume and value than in the same period in 2017. The Dalian ports handled about 14 million tonnes of coal last year, half of which was from Australia, said Gu Meng, an analyst at Orient Futures. The Dalian official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Neither Dalian customs nor the national General Administration of Customs immediately responded to a request for comment. The Dalian official said he was not given a reason for the ban on Australian imports. However, it follows simmering tensions between Beijing and Canberra over issues such as cyber security and China’s influence over island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Australia recently revoked the visa of a prominent Chinese businessman further straining ties. Asked if the ban was related to bilateral tensions, Geng Shuang, a spokesman at China’s foreign ministry, told reporters on Thursday that customs were inspecting and testing coal imports for safety and quality. “The goals are to better safeguard the legal rights and interests of Chinese importers and to protect the environment,” he said, adding that the move was “completely normal”. Australia’s New Hope Coal declined to comment. Yancoal said it will not be impacted by the Dalian ban as it does not ship to the port. Glencore directed queries to the Minerals Council of Australia, which declined to comment. Beijing has been trying to restrict imports of coal more generally to support domestic prices. A Beijing-based coal trader said Dalian had cleared about 6 million tonnes of coal in January that had been delayed since late 2018 as China slowed customs clearance to curb imports. The delayed cargoes would not be included in the 12 million tonnes under the 2019 quota, he added, citing customs information. Dalian handles both thermal and coking coal imports but the clamp down is expected to have a bigger impact on coking coal, used in steel making, than thermal coal, used to generate electricity. Spot Australian coking coal at the northern Chinese port of Jingtang is 200 yuan ($29.85) cheaper per tonne than domestic prices, according to data tracked by Orient Futures. The price difference for thermal coal is about the same. “It is hard to find a replacement for Australian coking coal since its sulphur content is very low,” said a purchasing manager at a large plant in Hebei province that produces coke, used in the steelmaking process, from coking coal. “Current inventory at ports should be sufficient to support usage for one or two months, but it could be a problem in the long term, especially if other ports also tighten imports,” he added. He declined to be named due to company policy. The most-active coking coal contract for May delivery rose more than 2 percent during morning trade on Thursday. “(The restriction) will further squeeze profit margins at steel mills after Vale’s accident has already driven up iron ore prices,” said Gu at Orient Futures. China bought 28.26 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia in 2018, accounting for 43.5 percent of the country’s total imports of the fuel, customs data showed.

In 2020 investments are expected to fall to 158.5 billion crowns, according to initial forecasts, though the forecasts could be revised upwards in the months to come, it added. “Several plans for development and operation are expected to be submitted to the government in both 2019 and 2020,” the agency said in a statement. “If the schedules for these plans are realised, the accumulated investment costs in 2020 from these projects will increase the investment in field development compared to the present estimate.” Equinor is Norway’s largest oil company, competing with the likes of Aker BP, Lundin Petroleum , Total or Shell. The Norwegian central bank expects investment in the oil sector, the Nordic country’s most important industry, to grow by 3 percent in 2020. “Our first impression is that there should be no need for a major revision to the Norges Bank forecast,” said Nordea Markets analyst Erik Bruce.

2019-02-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - The amount of future new wind capacity in Europe financed last year rose to a record high, industry group WindEurope said on Thursday, as falling costs and increased competition made it possible for investors to fund more for less cash. In total, 16.7 gigawatts (GW) of projects reached a final investment decision - 12.5 GW onshore and 4.2 GW offshore - 45 percent more than in 2017, WindEurope said in its annual report. Funding for the new investments rose to 26.7 billion euros (23.2 billion pounds). Even though 45 percent more future capacity was invested in, the amount spent on the investments was 20 percent more than a year earlier, a sign that costs continue to fall. “Cost reductions across the industry’s value chain and increased industry competition have made it possible for investors to finance more capacity for less cash,” it said. The cost of generating electricity from wind power fell to 1.59 million euros per megawatt (MW) in 2018 from 1.93 million euros/MW in 2017, WindEurope said. However, the report distinguishes between finance for future projects over the next few years and farms actually installed, saying the amount of capacity newly installed last year fell. “Last year was the worst year for new wind energy installations since 2011 ... 12 EU countries didn’t install a single wind turbine last year,” said WindEurope’s chief executive Giles Dickson. In the 28 European Union member nations plus Switzerland, Norway and Turkey, the amount of capacity added last year was 11.7 gigawatts (GW), 32 percent less than in 2017, due to poorly designed auctions and issues with permits, the report said. In the 28-nation EU bloc, new wind installations fell to 10.1 GW, the lowest level since 2011. “Investments in future capacity were quite good last year thanks to the UK, Spain, Sweden - and thanks also to the further expansion of offshore wind,” Dickson said. “But the outlook for new investments is uncertain. There are structural problems in permitting, especially in Germany and France. And with the notable exception of Lithuania and despite improvements in Poland, there’s a lack of ambition in central and eastern Europe,” he added. In total, 189.2 GW of wind power capacity is now installed in Europe, 6 percent higher than in 2017. That accounts for 18.4 percent of the EU’s total installed power generation capacity.

2019-02-21,"SINGAPORE/DUBAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco plans to sign preliminary deals to invest in two oil refining and petrochemical complexes in China during the Saudi Arabian crown prince’s visit this week, sources familiar with the plans said, as Beijing seeks expanded ties with Riyadh. The Saudi delegation, including top executives from Aramco, arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day visit, part of the crown prince’s Asia tour, during which the kingdom has pledged $20 billion of investment in Pakistan and sought additional investment in India’s refining industry. Mohammed bin Salman will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has made stepping up China’s presence in the Middle East a key foreign policy objective, despite its traditional low-key role there. China has given few details about the visit. Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil exporter, will sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to build a refinery and petrochemical project in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning in a joint venture with China’s defense conglomerate Norinco, said three sources with knowledge of the matter. Aramco is also expected to formalize an earlier plan to take a minority stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical, controlled by private Chinese chemical group Zhejiang Rongsheng Holding Group, said two sources with knowledge of this particular deal. Zhejiang Petrochemical is building a refinery and petrochemical complex in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang. The investments could help Saudi Arabia regain its place as the top oil exporter to China, which it has relinquished to Russia for the past three years. Saudi Aramco is poised to bolster its market share by signing supply agreements with non-state Chinese refiners.  It is not clear what new details will be in the MOU with Norinco expected during the visit, as the two companies first announced an alliance in May 2017 during Saudi ruler King Salman’s visit to Beijing. Under that earlier MOU, the companies agreed to build a refinery capable of processing 300,000 barrels per day of crude and a facility that would make 1 million tonnes per year of ethylene, a building block for petrochemicals, at an estimated cost of over $10 billion.    A senior Aramco executive said last June that he expected the front-end engineering for the Norinco project to be finished by mid-2019, following which the company will take a final investment decision. Norinco public affairs officials were not immediately available for a comment.   Aramco officials did not reply to a request for comment sent by email.  All the sources declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Meanwhile, the Zhejiang agreement would give Saudi Aramco control of the 9-percent stake in the project held by the Zhejiang provincial government.  The agreement follows an earlier MOU that Aramco signed in October to invest in Zhejiang’s project, which is planned as a refinery to process 400,000 bpd of crude and associated petrochemical facilities in the city of Zhoushan, south of Shanghai.  Reuters was not able to immediately reach Zhoushan Ocean Development and Investment Co Ltd, which holds the 9-percent stake in Zhejiang Petrochemical for the provincial government, for a comment. China has had to step carefully in its relations with Riyadh due to Beijing also having close ties with Saudi’s regional foe Iran. On Wednesday, the day before the crown prince arrives, Xi told the speaker of Iran’s parliament that China’s desire to develop close ties with Iran will remain unchanged, regardless of the international situation.

2019-02-21,"MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina are at loggerheads over gas sales pricing at their Arrow Energy joint venture, holding up development of Australia’s biggest coal seam gas resource, three industry sources said.  PetroChina, the listed arm of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), is eager to start developing Arrow’s 5 trillion cubic feet (140 billion cubic meters) of gas in the Surat Basin in Queensland to turn around loss-making Arrow Energy, one of its key overseas assets.  It is at the mercy of venture partner Shell, however, as the Anglo-Dutch oil company is also majority owner of Arrow’s biggest potential customer, Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG), a liquefied natural gas plant on an island off Queensland state.  “PetroChina, as a 50-percent stakeholder in Arrow, expects to maximise interests from the JV versus QCLNG. But for Shell, it may be thinking of using its operator role at QCLNG to protect its interests,” said a Chinese oil industry executive, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issues.  PetroChina’s investment is “already bleeding and the firm wants to cut losses, hoping not to make further bad investment decisions,” the executive said.  Shell and PetroChina acquired the Surat gas resource in a A$3.5 billion (1.92 billion pounds) takeover of Arrow in 2010. They had expected to reach a final investment decision on the Surat project in 2018, with first production around 2020, after the Arrow venture signed a 27-year deal at end-2017 to supply gas from Surat to QCLNG.  PetroChina, though, is unhappy with the price in the sales agreement with QCLNG and the technical plan for developing the gas. This is now holding up final approvals, according to three industry sources familiar with the talks, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  Shell Australia Chairman Zoe Yujnovich said on Feb. 13 that it is working through Chinese approval processes right up to senior levels of Beijing’s powerful state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission.      Shell still hopes to secure approval in time to deliver first gas in 2021, Yujnovich said.  “But it is an area we’re going to have work really carefully on, particularly the Chinese approval processes, as we step through the next phase,” she said.      When asked whether gas pricing was in contention, a Shell spokeswoman said that Shell supports both Arrow and QGC in developing the Surat gas project. QGC is the Shell subsidiary holding the company’s stake in QCLNG.  The project would help unlock the majority of Arrow’s reserves for both the domestic and export markets, the spokeswoman said.  PetroChina said in an email to Reuters that “talks on investment and cooperation in Australia’s Arrow (project) are still ongoing,” without responding to a question about the pricing dispute.  PetroChina’s takeover of Arrow with Shell in 2010 was its first investment in Australia’s coal seam gas sector, seen as a key acquisition at the time, but it has been a big loss-maker.  Over the five years through 2017, the latest year available, PetroChina has reported losses of 15.5 billion yuan (1.77 billion pounds) on its share of Arrow’s earnings.      Arrow Energy said in December that it had suspended engineering design work on a group of proposed expansion wells to reallocate spending to another area of the project.  It deferred all questions about timing or investment to Shell and PetroChina.  QCLNG is one of three LNG export plants built in Queensland, all fed by coal seam gas. QCLNG and one of its rivals are struggling to operate at full capacity as coal seam gas wells have proven to be less productive than expected.   This has led to concerns that QCLNG may have to shut one of its two processing units by 2025 if more gas isn’t brought into production.

2019-02-21,"ST ATHAN, Wales/GAYDON, England (Reuters) - In three cavernous former Royal Air Force hangars at an old airbase in Wales, luxury carmaker Aston Martin is forging ahead with construction of a new vehicle assembly plant. The paint shop is in, robots are being unpacked, and production of the company’s critical new sport utility vehicle is on track to start this year – Brexit deal or no deal. “I still have to believe that we’ll get to a proper and right decision because a no-deal Brexit is frankly madness,” Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer told Reuters at the company’s Gaydon headquarters in England, where designers are working on a diverse lineup of vehicles for the 2020s and beyond. Headlines have focussed on plant closures and job losses ahead of Britain’s divorce from the EU.  Nissan has scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in the country, while Honda will close its only UK car plant in 2021 with the loss of up to 3,500 jobs - though it said the decision was not related to Britain’s exit from the EU. However many auto companies - from luxury marques like Aston Martin to mass-market brands such as Vauxhall - are working on ways to survive after March 29. On the outskirts of London, workers at Vauxhall’s operation in Luton are preparing to produce a new line of commercial vans following fresh investment from the brand’s owner PSA which they are counting on to sustain over 1,000 jobs.  While post-Brexit market conditions remain a big unknown, Vauxhall boss Stephen Norman told Reuters Britain’s exit from the European Union could present an opportunity to increase the brand’s market share. He is pursuing a marketing campaign to boost demand for the company’s modestly priced cars and SUVs. The continued investment by some carmakers and the potential sales upside seen by Vauxhall reflect the conflicting decisions and opportunities that brands face depending on their size, their customers and where they are in the production cycle.  All automakers in Britain will anyway have to find ways make Brexit work, even if only in the short term.  Nissan builds nearly 450,000 cars and multiple models, making it hard to pull out of the country any time soon. Toyota builds just one model in Britain, the Corolla, but has only just started making it - in an industry where vehicles tend to have a seven-year production life cycle. Aston Martin and Vauxhall are as different as two auto companies can be. Now Brexit has thrown Palmer and Norman into the same precarious boat as, like their rivals, they seek to minimise the potential harm of a disorderly British exit.  The two companies have significant British manufacturing operations and together have thousands of employees in the country. Palmer and Norman both said in interviews that the impact of Brexit would be more complicated, more pervasive and take longer to play out than policymakers and the public appreciated. For Aston Martin, which sells sports cars at prices well above 100,000 pounds, new European tariffs on British-built cars are not a significant concern, Palmer said.  Like other smaller players such as Bentley, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, Aston has much larger margins on its cars and extra costs can be more easily passed onto wealthy customers. That’s not a luxury enjoyed by mass-market players.  What concerns Palmer more is the disruption to his company’s network of suppliers and its meticulously scheduled production system. As he walks through Aston’s Gaydon factory, Palmer points to several rows of dashboards mounted on carriers and crowded into a corner of the plant.  Aston is building stockpiles of key parts in case an abrupt, no-deal Brexit results in trucks with components getting delayed by chaos at British ports. It is increasing the days of stock it holds from three days to five days and could fly in parts if ports become clogged up after March 29.  Aston receives many of its engines from a Mercedes-Benz factory in Germany, and new border checks and tariffs could delay those shipments. Reverting to a regime of cross-border tariffs and World Trade Organization rules, after decades of free trade, would force Aston and its suppliers to trace and document where all the parts in a vehicle come from, Palmer told Reuters. “When you’ve got 10,000 parts on a car and then you’ve got all of the sub-parts and the sub-parts, you quickly get up to hundreds of thousands of parts. And do you honestly know where they’ve all come from? Often not,” he said.  That’s one reason why Palmer said he hired a supply chain chief, an appointment announced last month. “His obsession right now is planning for Brexit,” he said. The Brexit vote in mid-2016 came as Aston Martin was pursuing a multi-year strategy, unveiled in 2015, to go from making about 3,500 sports cars a year to building up to 14,000 sports cars and SUVs annually.  The St Athan plant will start building DBX SUVs, and then is expected to begin assembling a new line luxury electric vehicles under the Lagonda brand early in the 2020s.  Scrapping that investment is not Aston’s plan.  “People have asked me: what keeps you awake?” Palmer said. “It very much is the supply chain and the capability of that supply chain to absorb all the macroeconomics that are thrown at them.” Aston is not alone in this concern: Volkswagen, the biggest car seller in Britain, and Honda have both said they are stockpiling parts while Jaguar Land Rover has been talking to warehousing companies and Bentley has leased storage space.  At Vauxhall, boss Norman said Brexit could be an opportunity for a brand that struggled under its former owner, U.S. automaker General Motors, and is charting a new strategy under French group PSA.  Vauxhall believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to as much as a 20 percent fall in British new vehicle demand but a bigger market share for Vauxhall. PSA has committed last year to fresh investment to launch new models at its Luton van factory. But it faces a decision next year on whether to keep Vauxhall’s Ellesmere Port plant open after the current run of Astra Sports Tourer ends.  That decision is not a simple one, Norman said. “It would not be true to say that a hard Brexit automatically means the closure of plants in the United Kingdom, neither for us, nor for other manufacturers, but it would certainly mean they come under greater scrutiny,” he said.  British workers would have to deliver productivity gains that offset tariffs and supply chain friction.  Currently Vauxhall, which was bought by Peugeot parent company PSA in 2017, accounts for 7.5 percent of British car sales.  Added to the group’s Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands the total rises to 13 percent, making PSA one of the biggest sellers in Europe’s No.2 auto market.  If the market takes a hit, Vauxhall’s emphasis on functional, economically priced models could be an advantage, Norman said.  “People will look very long and hard,” he said. “And they will say: do I need this enhanced brand strength which I’m actually paying for that has no material value or should I not look more seriously at the offer from Vauxhall ... and have just as good a vehicle and not have to pay through the nose for the privilege.”  Reporting by Costas Pitas and Joseph White; Editing by Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-autos/insight-remain-or-leave-carmakers-confront-hard-brexit-choices-idUKL5N20F275,21 Feb 2019,"In three

Spread-betters expect Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC open up half a percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, and see London’s FTSE basically flat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent, giving up some earlier gains after hitting a peak last seen in early October. Australian shares gained 0.7 percent, closing at a six-month high, but the Australian dollar tumbled sliding on fears a ban on the country’s coal by a Chinese port would hurt its already slowing economy. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.1 percent higher. U.S. stock futures gained 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.1 percent, while Chinese blue-chips were last down 0.2 percent, giving up their gains after hitting their highest since early August last year. Investors have been cheered over recent days by signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks. The trade war between the economic giants has roiled financial markets over the past year. The United States and China have started to outline commitments in principle on the most contentious issues in their trade dispute, marking the most significant progress yet toward ending a seven-month trade war, sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters. Negotiators are drawing up six memorandums of understanding on structural issues: forced technology transfer and cyber theft, intellectual property rights, services, currency, agriculture and non-tariff barriers to trade, the sources said, as the two sides push for an agreement by March 1. That marks the end of a 90-day truce that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to when they met in Argentina late last year. Trump had suggested on Tuesday he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. Sentiment also got a lift after the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday affirmed it would be “patient” on further interest rate rises. “We must be a little bit careful that if the trade negotiation would be ended with a temporary success, that could in turn mean the Fed might restart their monetary tightening,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. On Wall Street, all three major U.S. equity indexes ended in positive territory on Wednesday after minutes from the Fed’s Jan. 29-30 meeting indicated policymakers see little risk to leaving rates alone, for now. “The bar to restarting rate hikes in the near term seems to be quite high, with several participants arguing that rate increases would be necessary “only if inflation outcomes were higher than in (the) baseline outlook”,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “The upshot is we now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged throughout this year, before a further deterioration in economic growth forces it to cut rates by a total of 75 basis points in 2020,” he said. The Fed signalled it will soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of $4 trillion in bonds and other assets, though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted “patient” stance on U.S. rates will last. In the currency market, the offshore Chinese yuan firmed to its strongest level since July last year on hopes of further progress in the Sino-U.S. trade talks, and was last trading at 6.7076 per dollar. The onshore yuan last changed hands at 6.7056 yuan per dollar after touching its strongest in three weeks. The Australian dollar was in the spotlight, sliding more than one percent after customs at China’s northern Dalian port banned imports of Australian coal and said it will cap overall coal imports for 2019. The Aussie had gained more than half a percent early in the session after employment numbers for January beat expectations though it then reversed course as the underlying soft outlook for the economy reinforced expectations of a possible rate cut this year. The Aussie was last trading at $0.7097, down 0.9 percent on the day. The euro held steady at $1.1331. Purchasing manager indexes for the euro zone are due on Thursday and investors are also eyeing the release of minutes from the European Central Bank’s January meeting later in the day. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was about 0.1 percent lower at 110.765 yen, moving off a seven-week peak of 111.13 reached last week. Japanese manufacturing activity contracted in February for the first time in two-and-a-half years as factories cut output amid shrinking domestic and export orders, a private business survey showed on Thursday. In the commodity market, crude prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest in 2019 on hopes that oil markets will balance later this year. Oil prices were also helped by output cuts from top producers and U.S. sanctions on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude was last up 0.3 percent, or 17 cents, at $57.33 per barrel. Brent was 0.1 percent, or 5 cents, higher at $67.13. Gold was steady at $1,338.50, close to a 10-month peak of $1,346.70 scaled on Wednesday.

2019-02-21,"(Adds A$ reaction, details, quotes) BEIJING, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Customs at China’s northern Dalian port has banned imports of Australian coal and will cap overall coal imports for 2019 through its harbours at 12 million tonnes, an official at Dalian Port Group told Reuters on Thursday. The indefinite ban on imports from top supplier Australia, effective since the start of February, comes as major ports elsewhere in China prolong clearing times for Australian coal to at least 40 days. Coal is Australia’s biggest export earner and the Australian dollar tumbled on the news, falling more than 1 percent to as low at $0.7086. Five harbours overseen by Dalian customs - Dalian, Bayuquan, Panjin, Dandong and Beiliang - will not allow Australian coal to clear through customs, said the official. Coal imports from Russia and Indonesia will not be affected. The ports handled about 14 million tonnes of coal last year, half of which was from Australia, said Gu Meng, analyst at Orient Futures. The Dalian official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Neither Dalian customs nor the General Administration of Customs immediately responded to a request for comment. The source said he was not given a reason for the ban on Australian imports. However, it comes amid simmering tensions between Beijing and Canberra over issues such as cyber security and China’s influence in Pacific island nations. Australia recently revoked the visa of a prominent Chinese businessman further straining ties. Beijing has also been trying to restrict imports of coal more generally to support domestic prices. Spot Australian coking coal at northern Chinese port Jingtang is 200 yuan ($29.85) cheaper per tonne than domestic prices, according to data tracked by Orient Futures. Prices of thermal coal are approximately the same. Dalian handles both thermal and coking coal imports but the clampdown is expected to have a bigger impact on coking coal, used in steel making, than thermal coal, used to generate electricity. “It is hard to find a replacement for Australian coking coal since its sulphur content is very low,” said a purchasing manager at a large coke plant in Hebei province. “Current inventory at ports should be sufficient to support usage for one or two months, but it could be a problem in the long term, especially if other ports also tighten imports,” he added. He declined to be named due to company policy. The most-active coking coal contract for May delivery rose more than 2 percent during morning trade on Thursday. “(The restriction) will further squeeze profit margins at steel mills after Vale’s accident has already driven up iron ore prices,” said Gu at Orient Futures. China bought 28.26 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia in 2018, accounting for 43.5 percent of the country’s total imports of the fuel, customs data showed.

2019-02-21,"NEW DELHI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India’s Adani Enterprises could theoretically win environmental approval for construction of the Carmichael coal mine in Australia in the next two years, a Queensland state resources official said, despite opposition from activists concerned about its impact on the Great Barrier Reef. The firm, which plans to start producing around 10 million tonnes of coal a year and eventually ramp up to 27.5 million tonnes, has been at loggerheads with environmental activists in the eight years since the project was first proposed. The comment on potential approval came in an interview with Caoilin Chestnutt, Queensland’s Resources Investment Commissioner, on the sidelines of the Coaltrans conference in New Delhi late on Wednesday. Her agency is not responsible for issuing environmental approvals for the project, which is regulated by Queensland’s Department for Environment and Science. Chestnutt told Reuters she believed environmental clearance for the project could in theory be given in the next several months. Carmichael is one of the world’s biggest greenfield coal projects in recent years. “I would guess, but it is an absolute mess, six months to two years,” she said. “They (Department of environment) have said they (Adani) have to go back to the drawing board and draft a management plan.” The Queensland Department for Environment and Science has said two approvals were required, one relating to a plan to protect an endangered bird species, the black-throated finch, and another to identify the source aquifer of ground water in the area. Chestnutt said protests against the mine were a “hindrance” and that there was a lot of misinformation about the mine that needed to be challenged. Asked what she considered “misinformation”, she said, “I think people just think that coal is dirty and global warming is a major issue, and people just like to blame the coal business for that, CO2 for that.” A spokesman for Adani said the firm expected to move faster on the project in future. “We have provided all required information data and feedback needed for this process to be completed and accordingly we expect to have these plans approved in the very near term,” the spokesman said in an emailed response to Reuters. The company last week slammed a report on the endangered bird which was reviewed by the Queensland government, calling it ""an anti-Adani lobbying document, dressed up as science,"" and said they wanted to advance their project.

2019-02-21,"MEXICO CITY/MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Venezuela is paying heavy premiums for fuel imports from Russia and Europe, with fewer than a dozen sellers seeing the risk as worth the reward after flows from the United States dried up because of sanctions, trading sources said and data showed. The South American nation exports crude but its refineries are in poor condition - hence the need to import gasoline and diesel for petrol stations and power plants, as well as naphtha to dilute its heavy oil. Since the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Venezuela on Jan. 28, products supplies have mainly come from Russian state oil major Rosneft, Spain’s Repsol, India’s Reliance Industries and trading houses Vitol and Trafigura, according to sources and vessel-tracking data. Russia has been a traditional political backer of Caracas, while India and Spain also have long-standing trade ties. But supplies even from those allies are coming at a cost. “The prices they are charging us are horrifying,” said an executive at Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA who is familiar with recent purchases. The executive said the heavy premiums were partially due to the fact that single cargoes passed through several hands before reaching Venezuelan ports and also involved complex and expensive ship-to-ship transfers. A trader involved in one fixture said shipowners were now charging a fee of up to 50 cents per barrel to Venezuela versus 15-20 cents before sanctions. Last year, Venezuela imported most products from the United States with the main providers being PDVSA’s own U.S. subsidiary Citgo Petroleum and a U.S. unit of India’s Reliance. Monthly supplies fluctuated but in December alone PDVSA imported almost 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of fuel as its domestic refineries worked at just below a third of its 1.3-million-bpd capacity, according to PDVSA data. Imports have fallen to some 140,000 bpd of gasoline, diesel, naphtha and other fuels since the end of January, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.  In addition, at least 13 cargoes carrying 5 million barrels of various fuels are heading to PDVSA’s terminals or waiting in Venezuelan waters to discharge, according to shipping sources and Eikon data. The new U.S. sanctions, aimed at forcing out Socialist President Nicolas Maduro, bar U.S. oil dollars from flowing to Venezuela.  However, the sanctions were later clarified, allowing U.S. persons to purchase and engage in swaps and non-cash deals for petroleum and petroleum products with PDVSA until April 28 in a move aimed at easing flows and averting a fuel crisis. But even though the clarification meant Washington was still allowing fuel supplies to PDVSA, sellers have been scarce so far. From Russia, Vitol and Trafigura are taking fuel from the ports of Ust-Luga and Taman to the Caribbean island of Aruba, where PDVSA’s unit Citgo operates an oil terminal, according to shipping sources and Refinitiv Eikon data. Vitol is bringing 30,000 tonnes of Rosneft-produced gasoil in the Orient Challenge vessel, while Trafigura chartered the Elandra Fjord to ship 37,000 tonnes of gasoline produced by Russian oil firm Surgutneftegaz. Rosneft is also lifting 60,000 tonnes of naphtha in a ship-to-ship transfer off Cyprus, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.  Reliance has booked the 500,000-barrel tanker Albiani to ship naphtha from northwest Europe. Repsol chartered several gasoline cargoes as part of a swap deal for Venezuelan crude with PDVSA, sources said. PDVSA, Rosneft and Reliance did not reply to requests for comment. Surgutneftegaz declined to comment. Vitol and Repsol said they fully complied with all legislation and sanctions. “We continue to closely monitor events on a cargo-by-cargo basis,” a Repsol spokesman said.   Trafigura declined to comment. The trading house will stop business with PDVSA after completing a small number of already-concluded trades, sources have said. PDVSA’s president Manuel Quevedo traveled to India last week to secure larger sales of Venezuelan oil to refiners as his country needs to divert up to 500,000 bpd of crude once bought by U.S. customers. Executives from Rosneft have traveled to Venezuela in recent weeks for talks, industry sources said. Rosneft is a major lender to PDVSA and co-owns oil projects in the country. Some Venezuelan petrol stations have been receiving insufficient fuel from PDVSA in recent weeks, so scarcity of supply has worsened in regions including the south of the country and the Andean states. Venezuela has so far, however, avoided a full-blown fuel crisis.

2019-02-21,"PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A heavily armed group of foreign nationals, who were arrested in Haiti on Sunday after days of massive anti-government protests, were handed over to U.S. authorities on Wednesday, Haitian and U.S. authorities said. It was unclear if all the members of the group, which reportedly included five Americans, a Serb and a Russian, were flown to the United States. “The return of the individuals to the U.S. was coordinated with the Haitian authorities,” a State Department representative for Western Hemisphere Affairs said in an emailed statement, without providing further details. A spokesman for Haiti’s Justice Ministry also confirmed that the individuals were “were handed over to U.S. authorities this Wednesday.” Media reports said that, at the time of their arrest, the men were armed with semi-automatic weapons, rifles, pistols, drones and satellite phones in their two vehicles. Videos circulating on social media alleged to show at least six men being escorted through the airport in Port-au-Prince towards a plane bound for the United States. Since the arrests, Haitian newspapers have printed names that corresponded to social media profiles of U.S. citizens claiming military backgrounds. However, Reuters could not independently confirm the identities of the arrested men. Thousands of demonstrators called for President Jovenel Moise to resign and for an independent probe into the whereabouts of funds from the PetroCaribe agreement, an alliance between Caribbean countries and OPEC member Venezuela. Protests that began on Feb. 7 died down after about a week-and-a-half but opposition leaders have called for Haitians to take to the streets again on Friday.

2019-02-21,"MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell and PetroChina are at loggerheads over gas sales pricing at their Arrow Energy joint venture, holding up development of Australia’s biggest coal seam gas resource, three industry sources said. Shell and PetroChina acquired the Surat gas resource in a A$3.5 billion ($2.5 billion) takeover of Arrow in 2010, and had expected to reach a final investment decision in 2018, with first production around 2020. That was after the Arrow Energy venture signed a 27-year deal in December 2017 to supply natural gas from Surat to the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG), which is operated by Shell.

2019-02-21,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Anglo American said on Thursday it has suspended operations at its Moranbah North coking coal mine in Australia after one worker died and several were injured on Wednesday. The London-listed miner said an investigation was underway into the underground accident between a personnel carrier and a grader. The driver of the grader was taken by ambulance to hospital and later died, it said.   Four other employees were helicoptered to hospitals in the towns of Mackay and Rockhampton and have since been released, it said, adding that production remained suspended while an investigation was conducted. “We are devastated by the tragic loss of one of our employees in the incident that occurred yesterday at Moranbah North,” Glen Britton, Anglo American’s executive head of underground operations, said in a statement.  “We are working with the relevant authorities to understand how this incident occurred.”      The Moranbah North mine in northern Queensland state last year produced about 7.68 million tonnes of coking coal, used in steel making, according to consultancy AME Group in Sydney. Chinese coking coal prices rose nearly 3 percent on Thursday morning, following a 2 percent hike overnight, as investors worry about tight supply. Analysts from Mysteel consultancy estimated the accident could lead to the loss of 1.2 million tonnes of coking coal output, which comes in a balanced market and as Chinese steel mills start to rebuild stocks after the Lunar New Year. The incident is the second disruption to Australian coking coal exports after a derailment in New South Wales state earlier this month disrupted shipments from the Hunter Valley.

The London-listed miner said an investigation was underway into the underground accident between a personnel carrier and a grader. The driver of the grader was taken by ambulance to hospital and later died, it said. Four other employees were helicoptered to hospitals in the towns of Mackay and Rockhampton and have since been released, it said, adding that production remained suspended while an investigation was conducted. “We are devastated by the tragic loss of one of our employees in the incident that occurred yesterday at Moranbah North,” Glen Britton, Anglo American’s executive head of underground operations, said in a statement. “We are working with the relevant authorities to understand how this incident occurred.” The Moranbah North mine in northern Queensland state produced about 7.68 million tonnes of coking coal last year, according to AME Group.

2019-02-21,"* Asian shares near 4-1/2-month peak * Aussie up over 0.5 pct on strong Australia full-time jobs figure * Minutes of Fed’s Jan 29-30 policy meeting provide some relief * Investors expect U.S., China to reach trade deal next month * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Daniel Leussink TOKYO, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Asian shares held near 4-1/2-month highs on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve minutes affirmed it would be “patient” on interest rate rises and risk assets got a lift from hopes of further progress in U.S.-China trade talks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were steady in early trade, hovering just off their highest since early October. Australian shares gave up early gains, last trading 0.1 percent lower, but the Australian dollar rallied in the wake of strong full-time jobs figure. Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.3 percent after closing at a two-month high during the previous session. Investors eyed signs of progress in the latest round of trade negotiations between the United States and China, amid expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping next month to strike a deal. Trump said on Tuesday that trade negotiations were going well and suggested he was open to pushing off the deadline to complete negotiations, saying March 1 was not a “magical” date. “We’ll see the Asian market start on the front foot, but we’ll need another catalyst, another driver, to take us to strong moves to the top side,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities Australia in Sydney. “We’ve got the Fed Minutes out of the way. They were a big event risk for a lot of (participants in) the market. They’ve come in largely in expectation with what the market was thinking.” On Wall Street, all three major U.S. equity indexes ended in positive territory on Wednesday after minutes from the Fed’s Jan. 29-30 meeting indicated policymakers see little risk to leaving rates alone, for now. “The bar to restarting rate hikes in the near term seems to be quite high, with several participants arguing that rate increases would be necessary “only if inflation outcomes were higher than in (the) baseline outlook”, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “The upshot is we now expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged throughout this year, before a further deterioration in economic growth forces it to cut rates by a total of 75 basis points in 2020,” he said. The Fed signalled it will soon lay out a plan to stop letting go of $4 trillion in bonds and other assets, though policymakers are still debating how long their newly adopted “patient” stance on U.S. rates policy will last. In the currency market, the Australian dollar was in the spotlight after Australia added more full-time employment in January as expected. The Aussie rallied more than half a percent to a two-week high of $0.72075 after the release of the figures, which showed Australia added 65,400 in full-time employment in January, with the unemployment rate steady at 5.0 percent. The euro held steady at $1.1341. Purchasing manager indexes for the euro zone are due on Thursday and investors are also eyeing the release of minutes from the European Central Bank’s January meeting later in the day. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was about 0.1 percent lower at 110.70 yen, moving off a seven-week peak of 111.13 reached last week. The offshore Chinese yuan was steady at 6.7174 per dollar after touching its highest in about three weeks during the previous session. The United States is seeking to secure a pledge from China it will not devalue its yuan as part of an agreement intended to end the countries’ trade war, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. In the commodity market, crude prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday to their highest in 2019 on hopes that oil markets will balance later this year. Oil prices were also helped by output cuts from top producers and U.S. sanctions on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude was last up nearly 0.1 percent, or 5 cents, at $57.21 per barrel. Brent was steady at $67.08. Gold rose 0.2 percent on the day to $1,341.20, crawling its way back up to a 10-month peak of $1,346.70 scaled on Wednesday.

2019-02-21,"(Repeats column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TYmwu1 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has resumed its traditional role as the swing producer, sharply reducing its own output to tighten the oil market and push prices higher. The de facto OPEC leader has demonstrated, once again, that it can always tighten the physical market, boost prices and push the calendar spread into backwardation - if it is prepared to cut its own production enough. The familiar problem is that protecting prices comes at the expense of market share: the more the kingdom cuts its own production and tightens the market, the more it encourages increased output from other sources. In this case, rising prices threaten to extend the oil drilling and production boom in the United States, which would ultimately force Saudi Arabia to make even deeper cuts or abandon its price-defence strategy. Saudi Arabia has never been able to escape from this dilemma and the country’s oil policy has cycled between a priority on price defence and volume defence (tmsnrt.rs/2TYmwu1). The kingdom has always struggled to craft an exit strategy from periods of output restraint. Policymakers pursue production curbs for too long, tighten the market too much and drive prices to an unsustainable level. The result is usually a slowdown in consumption growth and an acceleration of non-Saudi sources of production that pushes the market back towards surplus and necessitates a new round of output cuts. The kingdom made the same mistake in 2008, 2014 and 2018, failing to raise production early enough, creating the conditions for unsustainable price inflation and sowing the seeds of the subsequent downturns. Like any oil exporter Saudi Arabia will always benefit from an increase in prices in the short term, but it can then prove difficult to put a lid on the market. Saudi Arabia’s informal price targets tend to ratchet up as realised prices rise, with its targets tending to be somewhat elastic. In the first nine months of 2018 Saudi Arabia allowed the market to tighten too much, pushing prices above $80. That proved unsustainable and triggered a slowdown in consumption growth and a surge in U.S. shale. The kingdom’s market management was not helped by a mercurial White House, which threatened to push Iran’s oil exports to zero and then granted generous sanctions waivers. The question is whether the Saudis will make the same mistake again in 2019. Experience suggests it will. Senior Saudi officials have often sought to downplay the swing-producer tag since the mid-1980s, when the kingdom cut production even as other countries raised theirs. They have been keen to emphasise the importance of spreading cuts across Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and more recently an enlarged group including Russia and Oman (OPEC+). But the historical record shows that cuts by Saudi Arabia have been decisive in influencing spot prices and calendar spreads, and that Saudi Arabia, rather than OPEC or OPEC+, is the true swing producer. By cutting its own production, Saudi Arabia has always been able to engineer a rise in Brent spot prices and push the calendar spread into backwardation, as the attached charts illustrate. The kingdom’s influence is enhanced when the global oil economy and oil consumption are growing strongly and when the output of rival producers is disrupted by war, sanctions or civil unrest. Saudi Arabia has preferred to assemble coalitions of other producers to maximise its price leverage and for diplomatic reasons (OPEC and OPEC+ provide a useful shield against international criticism). But Saudi output policy has been the primary driver of market prices and spreads as the kingdom has been the only exporter with the scale and flexibility to shift the global production-consumption balance. The recent round of production cuts, agreed by OPEC+ at the start of December, has conformed to this pattern (“The 5th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting concludes”, OPEC, Dec. 7). The enlarged group agreed to cut by a total of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first six months of 2019, with reductions to be shared between OPEC (0.8 million bpd) and its Russia-led allies (0.4 million bpd). In the event, Saudi Arabia cut its own output by 380,000 million bpd in January, exceeding its pledged share of 320,000 bpd and accounting for more than half of the total cuts achieved by OPEC in the first month. Saudi Arabia’s aggressive reductions have compensated for poor compliance with the agreement by some other OPEC and OPEC+ members (“OPEC oil output falls by 890,000 bpd in January”, Reuters, Jan. 31). The kingdom has gone further and pledged to reduce its output by more than 1 million bpd from 11 million-plus in November to only 9.8 million in March, Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said in a recent interview with the Financial Times. The kingdom’s shift has helped to boost front-month Brent futures prices by more than $15 a barrel (30 percent) since late December and push the six-month calendar spread from a $1.70 contango to 45 cent backwardation. The price impact has been assisted by increased optimism that the global economy will avert recession as well as the impact of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil production and position-building by hedge funds. Provided that the global economy avoids recession or a prolonged slowdown this year, the oil market will tighten progressively over the course of 2019. Given their approach last year, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ are likely to prolong their output restraint until prices are well above $70, perhaps breaching $80. The result will be another spurt of U.S. shale production and a slowdown in oil consumption growth, pushing the market back towards surplus and necessitating another round of cuts. If Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ want to halt this cycle of instability, they need to be pro-active and start relaxing output curbs gradually as prices climb above $70. But OPEC has never been great at fine-tuning and the track record suggests prices are likely to overshoot on the upside to set the cycle in motion all over again.

2019-02-21,"SINGAPORE, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices hovered just below 2019 highs on Thursday, bolstered by OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $57.30 per barrel at 0046 GMT, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement and not far off their 2019 high of $57.55 reached the previous day. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade, but also hit a 2019 peak the day before, at $67.38 per barrel. Hopes that talks between Washington and Beijing would soon resolve the trade disputes between the world’s biggest economies also supported markets. Prices have been driven up this year by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). OPEC as well as some non-affiliated producers such as Russia agreed late last year to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to prevent a large supply overhang from growing. Another price driver has been U.S. sanctions against oil exporters Iran and Venezuela. “Although there is no lack of resources, there is an increasing lack of access to them,” Britain’s Barclays bank said of the sanctions on Wednesday. The main factor keeping oil prices from rising even further is soaring U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which rose by more than 2 million bpd last year, to a record 11.9 million bpd. The swelling output has resulted in rising U.S. oil inventories. U.S. crude oil stocks rose by 1.3 million barrels in the week to Feb. 15 to 448.5 million, according to a weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday. Official oil inventory and production data is due to be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) after 1800 GMT on Thursday.
