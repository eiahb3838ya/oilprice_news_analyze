2018-06-17,"(Repeats story from Friday with no changes to text) * Australia’s new gas fields could use shared infrastructure * Woodside wants to build quickly as looks to start new field * Chevron wants to spend more time planning infrastructure system * Gas has become one of Australia’s biggest exports By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, June 15 (Reuters) - After spending a decade and billions of dollars developing Australia’s vast gas reserves, U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp and local firm Woodside Petroleum are at odds over the pace and timing of the next leg of expansion. Shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have become one of Australia’s biggest exports and a key source of revenue for many energy majors, so any hurdles in the sector’s development could strike a substantial blow. The issue comes down to how quickly to build a shared infrastructure system that would include a major trunk pipeline for transporting gas from mammoth new offshore fields owned by various companies in northwest Australia. Woodside wants to take the lead in such a project, pushing to build soon so it can go ahead with its $11 billion Scarborough development, the only new gas field in the region that is primed for a final investment decision by 2020. But Chevron would prefer to spend more time planning and building such a system, which it says could be led by it or other companies. “I don’t think there are any showstoppers in changing ... to a more shared infrastructure model,” Chevron’s Asia Pacific exploration and production president, Stephen Green, said in a group interview. “It’s just getting the alignment of all the different parties that want to participate in that value chain and coming up with the structure that satisfies each party’s needs.” Firms with stakes in the region’s gas fields, including Royal Dutch Shell, BP and BHP Billiton , will need to decide which option to pursue within the next 18 months to ensure untapped reserves are available ahead of a supply shortfall that some industry analysts see emerging from around 2022. Putting pressure on his peers, Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said last month that any rival would need to negotiate with him by September to get their gas into an infrastructure system led by Woodside. “They really need to get to us in the third quarter and be very serious about what they’re doing, because that window will close,” he said at an investor briefing. Chevron has not put a cost estimate on its infrastructure plan, saying it depends on how big any trunkline is and how many fields it connects to. Woodside has not given an exact estimate of costs for a shared project that it would lead. “Talk of collaboration is good rhetoric, but there are an awful lot of moving parts,” said Wood Mackenzie analyst Saul Kavonic. BHP and BP declined to comment. Shell declined to comment except to reiterate that its Australian head, Zoe Yujnovich, has called for “greater cooperation between ventures to reduce waste and duplication”. Chevron and Woodside are key in Australia’s LNG sector as they operate the four LNG plants in Western Australia, and between them have a total of more than 60 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of undeveloped gas resources in the region’s offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins. Until now, all 10 of Australia’s LNG developments have been built as megaprojects, with the owners constructing pipelines and LNG plants dedicated to their own fields. Critics say that has wasted huge amounts of money as infrastructure has been duplicated, helping push total development costs to an eye-watering $200 billion. Burnt by a cost of $54 billion in developing its huge Gorgon project off Australia’s northwest coast, Chevron wants to change strategy. “It’s our view that that’s not the most cost efficient ... way to see resources developed across a large, prolific basin like the Carnarvon,” said Chevron’s Green. Cost control is key in a competitive industry in which Australia and Qatar vie for position as the world’s biggest producers and in which major new output is seen coming online in places such as the United States, Canada, East Africa and Southeast Asia. After years of sky-high LNG prices prior to 2014, when Asian spot cargoes sold for $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), prices are languishing at half of that. And the fate of the biggest undeveloped gas resource off Western Australia, the Browse project, where Woodside is operator, will likely remain in limbo until a common infrastructure is built. But both Coleman and Green expect each other’s companies to come around eventually. “I absolutely am confident we’ll work things out,” Green said, noting that Chevron and Woodside have long been partners in energy projects. And the possibility of Chevron or Woodside buying out additional stakes in the region’s gas fields and LNG projects could help align interests better to speed up a resolution. “M&A can play a key role in helping to create alignment across the joint ventures,” said Wood Mackenzie’s Kavonic.

2018-06-17," (This version of the June 8 story corrects fourth paragraph to show La Rosa previously served as commercial manager in Venezuela, not country manager) By Alexandra Alper and Marianna Parraga RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has permanently assigned its Brazil country chief to run its Venezuelan operations after the months-long detention of two executives escalated tensions between the OPEC-member nation and foreign oil firms.  Javier La Rosa, who had been president of Chevron Brazil since 2016, this month was named president of Chevron Venezuela, the company confirmed on Friday. He replaced the company’s Venezuela general manager, Christopher Whatley.   La Rosa joined Chevron in 2000 and had headed Venezuelan commercial operations for the company from 2005 to 2008, his LinkedIn page said. He flew to Caracas shortly after Chevron employees were detained to temporarily lead the Venezuela unit, according to two other people familiar with the matter.  La Rosa’s appointment comes after a tense showdown between foreign oil companies and the government in recent months as Venezuela’s political and economic meltdown deepened.  Venezuelan authorities this week released the two executives jailed since April as part of an ongoing graft probe into the oil sector, which has unnerved other foreign companies operating in partnership with state oil company PDVSA.      The arrests, related to the executives’ refusal to sign a supply contract for furnace parts for a PDVSA joint venture, were made public after some oil-service companies pulled back from Venezuela, writing off billions of dollars in assets. La Rosa is leaving Brazil just as Chevron begins to flex its muscle in Latin America’s largest crude oil producer. In a consortium with Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), Chevron clinched its first block in Brazil’s coveted offshore pre-salt oil play on Thursday. It was not immediately clear who will run Chevron’s Brazil operations. Reuters reported in December that Chevron was in talks with oil services firm Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) to resume drilling in an offshore field after a 2011 oil spill there cut production. Chevron, the world’s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer, with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year to $329 million, according to regulatory filings.

2018-06-17,"DOMIZ CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - The world is failing to properly invest in the Syrian refugee crisis and families, women, and children are suffering terribly as a result, U.N. refugee agency special envoy Angelina Jolie said on Sunday. The Hollywood actress was visiting the Domiz Camp, in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, which is home to 33,000 Syrian refugees displaced by seven years of civil war. Funding received by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to help refugees from the Syrian conflict fell sharply this year from 2017 when the agency received only 50 percent of the funds it needed, Jolie told a news conference. “There are terrible human consequences. When there is even not the bare minimum of aid, refuge families cannot receive adequate medical treatment. Women and girls are left vulnerable to sexual violence, many children cannot go to school, and we squander the opportunity to invest in refugees,” she said. UNCHR will publish figures on Tuesday that show that the number of displaced people globally, and the duration of their exiles, are “the highest they have ever been”, she said. “At the same time political solutions seem to be completely lacking leaving a void that humanitarian aid cannot fill. Words like ‘unsustainable’ don’t really paint a picture of how desperate the situation really is,” said Jolie. She met families at the camp, including two mothers who are now widows caring for young children after their husbands died from conditions that could have been treated under normal conditions, Jolie said. In 2011, Domiz was a small camp housing tents. Now it is a town complete with concrete houses, shops and fast food stalls. Ahmed Hussein, a refugee father of nine children, one of whom died and five of whom are handicapped, said he and other refugees lacked access to basic treatment and could not find jobs. “I wish Angelina had come to my house to meet my handicapped children who need medical treatment,” he said in his makeshift house where he has been living since 2015 when he fled the Syrian town of Qamishli with his family. On Saturday Jolie visited Mosul, the biggest city in northern Iraq, which Iraqi forces took back last year from Islamic State militants, who had occupied the city for three years, forcing 900,000 residents to flee. Jolie met families from western Mosul and walked through bombed out streets, video footage and photos provided by the UNHCR showed. Normality has returned to many parts of Mosul, with displaced residents leaving camps nearby to return home, but reconstruction in the Old City in West Mosul has been slow.  It was largely destroyed during a campaign by a 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Shi’ite militias backed by air support from a U.S.-led coalition. “This is the worst devastation I have seen in all my years working with UNHCR. People here have lost everything,” Jolie said in a U.N. statement. “They are destitute. They have no medicine for their children, and many have no running water or basic services,” she said. “I hope there will be a continued commitment to rebuilding and stabilising the whole of the city. And I call on the international community not to forget Mosul.” Jolie has worked for UNHCR since 2001, visiting uprooted civilians from Iraq to Cambodia and Kenya. This was her fifth visit to Iraq, UNHCR said.

2018-06-17,"BOGOTA, June 17 (Reuters) - Colombians vote on Sunday in a deeply divisive presidential runoff that pits candidates offering polar opposite views and has stirred fears the winner will upset a fragile peace process or derail the economy. Ivan Duque, the business-friendly protégé of hardline former president Alvaro Uribe, wants to alter a peace deal he deems too lenient on Marxist FARC rebels, while keeping Colombia’s largely orthodox economic model. His rival, leftist former guerrilla Gustavo Petro, has pledged to take on political elites, redistribute land to the poor and gradually eliminate the need for oil and coal in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy. “We’re between a rock and a hard place,” said financial planner Juan Jose Mojica, 21. “They’re two extremes that could destroy the development that the country has made over the last years.” From the sweltering Caribbean coast to the frigid heights of the Andes, some 11,230 polling stations will open at 1300 GMT. Polls close at 2100 GMT and results are expected within hours. These are the first elections since a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended their part in a five-decade conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. Duque wants to change the accord with tougher punishments for FARC war crimes, while Petro promises to support the existing deal and continue a peace process with the National Liberation Army (ELN) - Colombia’s last active rebel group. “Duque doesn’t want peace. He wants war to continue and prevent Colombia getting ahead,” said Jorge Andres Sanchez, 31, selling World Cup goods in a Bogota shopping center. “Let’s put it behind us and start again.” A lot is at stake too for Colombia’s $324 billion economy. Duque has promised to keep investors happy by cutting business taxes, bolstering the oil and coal sectors - top exports - and helping manufacturing. Petro, a one-time member of the now defunct M19 insurgent group, wants a new economic model that ditches reliance on extractive industries for renewable energy and a land reform that promotes an increase in productive use. His policies have prompted rivals to compare him to Venezuela’s former Socialist President Hugo Chavez. “The markets and the productive sector see Duque as someone who guarantees the continuity of the current economic model, while they see Petro as someone who would break it down,” said Carlos Sepulveda, dean of economics at Rosario University. State-run oil company Ecopetrol SA is responsible for almost 60 percent of Colombia’s oil production of around 830,000 barrels per day and operates export pipeline infrastructure. Petro would shift its emphasis toward wind and solar power. “I really don’t like either of them, but as I have to choose, it has to be Duque,” said Carlos Mora, a 52-year-old lawyer. “With Petro, I really think we’ll end up like Venezuela.” Some candidates from the first round have asked Colombians to cast blank ballots – a means for voters’ to demonstrate dissatisfaction with the choice of candidates. Sergio Fajardo, nudged into third place by Petro last month, said on Friday neither Petro nor Duque represent a good option. “The blank vote will be higher than usual because the two candidates are from the most extreme positions on right and left, leaving the moderate centrist electorate with no obvious option,” said political analyst Yann Basset.
