2018-12-10,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Qatar’s exit from OPEC “won’t affect production moving forward,” the UAE’s energy minister said on Monday in Abu Dhabi. Suhail al-Mazrouei said the UAE did not understand Qatar’s decision to remove itself from OPEC, which the Qatari minister of state for energy affairs said last week was a strategic one.  Qatar, one of OPEC’s smallest oil producers but one of the biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters, is embroiled in a row with OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It has an oil output of 600,000 barrels of oil per day, compared to Saudi Arabia’s 11 million bpd output.

2018-12-10,"Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Hess Corp and Conocophillips both expect production for 2019 to be higher than this year even as they spend roughly the same amount of money on exploration, the companies said on Monday. Investors have been urging U.S. oil companies to increase returns on tight spending at a time when they are also looking beyond the Permian Basin, which is getting crowded and costly. Hess said the lion’s share of its 2019 capital expenditure will go towards exploration in Guyana and Bakken. Conoco will spend most of its capex in Alaska and Canada, it said. The 2019 production views come as global oil markets struggle with oversupply, resulting in producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreeing to cut their crude output from January. Production in the United States, however, is expected to rise to a record high 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019. For Hess, production is expected to range between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boep/d) excluding Libya, up from the 255,000 boep/d it expects in 2018, while ConocoPhillips was aiming to produce 2.0-2.6 percent more oil and gas next year. Both kept their capital spending budget roughly flat - $2.9 billion for Hess and $6.1 billion for Conoco. “As we focus spending on our high return investment opportunities, we will continue to reduce our unit costs to drive margin expansion and improve profitability,” Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement on Monday. Last week, oil major Chevron Corp increased its spending budget for the first time in four years. The company said it plans to spend more on shale production next year, as well as in refining and chemicals.

2018-12-10,"LONDON, Dec 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies could save more than $500 million by choosing clean energy over fossil fuels in war zones and disaster areas, global think-tank Chatham House said in a report on Monday. Humanitarian agencies spent about five percent of their funds - or an estimated $1.2 billion - on diesel last year, and could save $517 million each year by using cleaner energy sources such as solar power, it said. “Humanitarians are operating in tough environments where saving lives come first,” said co-author Owen Grafham from the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI), a partnership managed by London-based Chatham House. “Energy is not given much thought - diesel is the go-to fuel because it’s what agencies are used to and it’s quick-to-deploy,” he said in a statement. Carbon-emitting fossil fuels can be used as a weapon, hijacked by militants or sold on the black market and sometimes have to be flown vast distances to reach off-grid relief camps. That creates costs that humanitarian groups can ill afford, with wars, persecution and other violence having uprooted a record 68.5 million people last year, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Aid agencies said curbing emissions was key to preventing climate-change related disasters. Renewable energy is key to reducing climate-changing emissions under a global climate deal after governments in 2015 pledged to hold temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5 degrees C. “The burning of dirty fuels increasingly impacts poor people, particularly women and girls, who are in the midst of humanitarian crises,” Sven Harmeling, head of CARE International’s climate advocacy arm, said in email. While the technology has not advanced far enough to make a full swap viable, some solar projects are already under way in the field and aid workers expect many more to follow. Engineer Per-Erik Eriksson, from the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Sweden Innovation Unit, said the group was making substantial effort to use renewable energy. “However, it is not certain that such a transformation will save us money, given the current initial costs for renewable energy infrastructure. Our operations are emergency-oriented, and therefore implicitly short term,” he said. “The investment for renewable energy solutions is always higher than for diesel generator solutions, and so the savings only come over a number of years,” Eriksson said from Haiti, where he is testing solar-powered air-conditioning. Aid groups say operations also relied on diesel generators since many local workers or volunteers already knew how to use them, whereas solar energy would be costly and require specialised knowledge. An October report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said renewable energy would need to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. More than 190 countries are meeting in Poland through Dec. 14 to hammer out rules that will enable the Paris accord to be put into practice from 2020, and spur countries to strengthen their current climate action plans.

2018-12-10,"LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Protesters disturbed a U.S.-sponsored event promoting fossil fuels on the sidelines of U.N. climate change talks on Monday. The event called “U.S. innovative technologies spur economic dynamism”, touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels more efficiently, infuriated campaigners and many government delegations who want the talks to focus on moving away from coal, oil and gas. Some 100 protestors in the audience at the event seized a microphone and interrupted opening remarks by Wells Griffith, the man President Donald Trump appointed as senior director for energy at the National Security Council. They waved banners and chanted: “keep it in the ground”. “I’m 19 years old and I’m pissed,” shouted Vic Barrett, a plaintiff in the “Juliana vs U.S.” lawsuit filed in 2015 by 21 young people against the government for allowing activities that harm the climate. “I am currently suing my government for perpetuating the global climate change crisis ... Young people are at the forefront of leading solutions to address the climate crises and we won’t back down.” Before the interruption, Griffiths said it was important to be pragmatic in dealing with climate change in a world still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. “Alarmism should not silence realism ... This administration does not see the benefit of being part of an agreement which impedes U.S. economic growth and jobs,” he said. The conference, in Katowice, Poland, aims to work out the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement, the global pact on combating climate change. The United States, the world’s top oil and gas producer, is the only country to have announced its withdrawal from the accord. Reporting by Nina Chestney

2018-12-10,"* Athens wants deadline extended to Jan. 7 - source * PPC selling 3 plants and a licence to build a new one * Athens wants coal-fired plants divestment wrapped up by Jan. 15 By Angeliki Koutantou ATHENS, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The European Commission has informally allowed Greece’s Public Power Corp. (PPC) to extend the deadline for binding bids for three coal-fired plants by three weeks, an energy ministry source said on Monday. Greece agreed to sell the plants under its latest international bailout, which ended in August. The source said potential bidders and advisors had requested that the deadline be delayed until after the Christmas holiday period to give them more time. PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, has shortlisted all six investors interested in buying Meliti I and two other plants in Megalopoli on the Peloponnese peninsula, as well as a licence to build a new plant, Meliti II, in northern Greece. The deadline for the final bids had been set at Dec. 15, and it is not known if all six will submit bids. An energy ministry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Greece has sought EU Commission approval for the binding bids to be submitted by Jan. 7 and for any improved offers by Jan. 10. It aims to have concluded the divestment process by Jan. 15. The Commission has informally approved the request, the official said, and Athens is now waiting for official confirmation of the extension in writing. The EU Commission and PPC were not immediately available for comment. The tender is organised by PPC and overseen by the Commission, after a European court ruled that PPC had abused its dominant position in the coal market. The official said that a final round of talks between the EU Commission and investors on the terms of the sale would start on Monday. Another source close to the matter said that issues on the table would include a mechanism that would allow PPC and the new owner to share any profit or loss from the plants for a set period of time.

The Bank of France on Monday forecast the euro zone’s number two economy would eke out growth of only 0.2 percent in the quarter from the previous three months, down from 0.4 percent in a previous estimate. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire declined to give an estimate for 2018 growth but forecast the nationwide tumult would trim 0.1 percent of a point off of national output. His deputy projected growth would round out “closer to 1.5 percent”. The slow-down will be worrisome for Macron, who faces huge pressure on the streets to make further cuts to taxes and social security costs to bolster household spending power, while keeping France’s budget deficit below a European Union cap. The slowdown is a “reality for our businessmen, entrepreneurs, it’s the reality for those whose shops were vandalised, looted, in the most violent way,” Le Maire told RTL. “And it’s a reality too for our foreign investors.” Police used tear gas, water canon and horses to charge protesters hurling projectiles, torching cars and ransacking some shops, though they encountered less violence than the previous Saturday, when the capital encountered its worst violence since the 1968 student uprising. Upscale department store Printemps, which shut its flagship store in Paris on Saturday, typically one of the busiest days of the year ahead of Christmas, said it had suffered a 25 to 30 percent slump in sales since the unrest began. “There has been a colossal loss in sales and they won’t be recouped,” Pierre Pelarrey, who runs Printemps Haussmann, told Reuters. Nationwide, shopping centres saw a 17 fall in people passing through the doors, the CNCC grouping of mall operators said. In a sign of the perceived heightened risk of holding French debt, French government bond yields rose on Monday, pushing the French/German 10-year bond spread to its widest since May, at around 46 basis points in early trade. On the Paris bourse, airport operator ADP fell 0.8, while retailers Casino and FNAC Darty also headed south. Hotels company Accor initially traded down 0.7 percent before paring losses. Macron addresses the nation on Monday evening. The president has drawn criticism for his silence in public over the violence in Paris - opponents accuse him of turning the Elysee Palace into a bunker. Ministers hope he will placate the yellow vests, whose revolt poses the most formidable challenge to his 18-month administration to date. “Our country is deeply divided, between those who see that globalisation has benefited them and others who can’t make ends meet, who say ... globalisation is not an opportunity but a threat,” Le Maire told RTL. “It is the president’s role to unify the country.” The protests were born out of a backlash against the squeeze on the household budgets of hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar workers. But the movement has developed into a broader anti-Macron rebellion. The former investment banker is under pressure to respond to the demands of yellow vests for a higher minimum wage, lower taxes, and better retirement provisions, though more concessions will leave France in danger of breaching EU deficit rules. “The big picture is that the budget deficit will worsen and political problems will make cuts to spending hard,” said Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. The government’s latest estimates are for a budget deficit of 2.8 percent in 2019, just below the EU’s 3 percent cap - a target Macron has cast as critical to meet to cement his reformist credentials. Le Maire reiterated his desire to accelerate tax cuts but suggested he was not in favour of reinstating a tax on wealth — known as the ‘ISF’ — that Macron narrowed when he came into office, and which earned him the tag “president of the rich”. “Does the ISF help reduce poverty, reduce our debts, reduce public spending? No. If you want to hunt for money, go knocking on the doors of digital tech companies,” Le Maire said. Reporting by Richard Lough; additional reporting by Leigh

2018-12-10,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by OPEC and its allies is “balance”. It’s something everybody in the market says they want, but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there. Boiled down to the basics, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the other producers, most notably Russia, are trying to do with the move to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) is achieve their vision of a balanced market. While what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms, it’s assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be “fair” and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output. What this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain, although it’s likely that OPEC and its allies will take the view that the $60.06 a barrel that Brent crude closed at the day before the Dec. 7 output deal was reached is too low. But it’s also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above $80 a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the OPEC orbit. Brent reached a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3, but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost 34 percent of its value, hitting a trough of $57.50 on Nov. 28, the lowest level in a year. It’s that rapid plunge that led OPEC and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance, and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired, but elusive, state. The market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether OPEC has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise, but not so high that demand is threatened. The initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for OPEC, with Brent jumping as much as $3.67 to $63.73 a barrel during trade on Dec. 7, but eventually it closed at $61.67, up 2.7 percent from the previous day. The nirvana of balance also means that OPEC, and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, have to walk a series of political tightropes. The obvious one is also the most public, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is often criticised for changing his mind on issues, but has been remarkably consistent on one front, namely his desire for lower oil prices. It’s perhaps no surprise that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih singled out U.S. energy companies as winners from the OPEC and allies deal, telling reporters at the meeting in Vienna on Dec. 7 that they were “breathing a sigh of relief”. This was perhaps a not-so-subtle attempt to stave off a blast from Trump on his favoured social media platform Twitter, by reminding him that the powerful U.S. energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices. The Saudis also have to manage their relationship with the United States carefully in the wake of the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in October. Trump has said he is not convinced the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder, even as leaders of his own Republican Party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing. A further complicating factor is Iran, which is exempt from the new output-cutting deal, and in theory living on borrowed time given the U.S. waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on April. Given the plethora of competing factors and influences, it would seem balance will be a difficult, if not impossible task in the crude oil market. But how will the success of this latest production cut be measured? If crude remains in a range between $60 and $80 a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the Iran export waivers, then it might be fair to argue that OPEC and its allies will have achieved what they wanted - a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with.

2018-12-10,"(Updates with Saudi Arabia, Polish presidency statements) KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change began the crucial final week in the Polish city of Katowice, capital of the country’s Silesian coal mining district. The aim of the gathering is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. Saudi Arabia issued a statement saying it recognised the efforts of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in producing scientific reports, the latest of which was published in October assessing the feasibility and importance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, it said there were gaps and uncertainties in the report which still needed further research. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is hopeful that the IPCC 6th Assessment Report will address these gaps and challenges, and that a consensus to welcome it among all parties can be reached,” it said in a statement. On Saturday, parties failed to reach an agreement on whether to “note” or “welcome” the U.N. IPCC report published in October. Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait were against welcoming the report and reference to the IPCC report was removed. Ministers from around 120 countries started to arrive at the conference and faced the task of breaking deadlocks and divisions to achieve the political compromises needed by the end of the week. The Polish presidency of the talks said a “significant amount of work” needed to be done to finish work on the rule book. If this outstanding work was not concluded by Tuesday, it would not be possible to conclude that by Friday, it said in a statement. Campaigners in Katowice said another weekend of the violent “yellow vests” protests in France showed why a just transition is needed when shaping energy transition policy. “When you look at the demands from the protests in France, it is not pitting climate policy against economic and social policy. It is saying (that) we need to respond to the anxieties people are feeling, the fear people are feeling,” said Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at E3G, a non-governmental organisation. French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on Monday as he seeks to placate “yellow vest” anti-government protesters who wreaked havoc in Paris this weekend. A side event supported by the U.S. administration on Monday afternoon called “Innovative Technologies Spur Economic Dynamism” has been criticised by environmental groups and many countries. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants,” said Dan Lashof, director, World Resources Institute US. “This sideshow in Poland would be laughable if the consequences of climate change weren’t so deadly serious,” he added. The event will feature Wells Griffith, senior director for energy at the National Security Council and Steve Winberg, assistant secretary at the department of energy. “Presentations at the event will show how innovation and investment have led to dramatically lower technology costs, reductions in all types of emissions, greater competitiveness, and access to affordable, modern energy services,” said a senior U.S. administration official.

Data from the world’s biggest economies — the United States, China, Japan and Germany — have all disappointed investors in recent days, and doubts are growing that Washington and Beijing will reach agreement before a 90-day trade ceasefire expires. Markets are also on edge after reports that the British parliament’s crucial vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal will be delayed, sending sterling and UK stocks lower. “Another day, another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining,” said Stephen Innes at brokerage OANDA MSCI’s all-country index has spent four weeks in the red, despite intermittent rallies fuelled by hopes of trade war detente. The index slipped 0.5 percent, while a pan-European index fell 0.7 percent by 1200 GMT. U.S. equity futures   were down 0.3 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session. Last week’s arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States was seen as putting up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said Sunday there was a “hard deadline” to the 90-day trade ceasefire and without a successful end to talks by March 1, Washington would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Following weak trade and inflation data on the weekend, China also posted far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reinforcing expectations Beijing will roll out more stimulus to prevent the economy cooling too fast. However, the yuan sagged to a one-week low after the weak data. “(The data) would suggest China woes go well beyond U.S. tariffs, given that China trade surplus to the U.S. was at a record level. One can only imagine the impact on China terms of trade if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff,” Innes of OANDA said. Japan posted the worst contraction in over four years in the third quarter as uncertainty over global demand and trade saw companies slashing capital spending. MSCI’s index of Asian equities outside Japan earlier slid to near three-week lows, Shanghai shares retreated 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.1 percent. Emerging-market stocks lost 1.5 percent. Asia’s data came after investors were spooked last week by below-forecast industrial output numbers in Germany and U.S. jobs data showing employers hired fewer workers than expected in November. The slowdown signs also have pummelled oil prices, which have slumped around 30 percent since early October. Brent futures fell 1.5 percent to $60.7 a barrel, reversing earlier modest gains triggered by a supply cut from OPEC and some non-affiliated producers. European investors were keeping their eyes on events in Britain and France. Sterling slumped to the lowest since June 2017 versus the dollar, after the BBC’s political editor quoted cabinet sources said May was pulling the vote, scheduled for Tuesday. Sterling slid half a percent to $1.2656 and extended losses versus the euro, trading down 0.7 percent at 90.18 pence - its weakest since early-September. Britain’s FTSE 250 equity index, sensitive to local economic developments tumbled 1 percent and investors scurried to buy British government bonds, with yields dropping five to seven basis points on the day. “There is still room for short-term political risk premium to be priced into pound which is currently worth of 2 percent based on our models. The downside to sterling is hence very clear,” ING Bank analysts told clients. The dollar inched off two-week lows against a basket of currencies, including sterling. Last week, the dollar posted its worst performance since August after the lacklustre jobs data convinced many that U.S. growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening sooner than previously thought. French assets also came under pressure, with hotel and retail stocks suffering the fallout of four weekends of anti-government riots, which the finance minister said could curb economic growth by 0.1 percentage point. The yield premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German peers rose to the highest since May, before a 1900 GMT televised address by President Emmanuel Macron.

2018-12-10,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda SANTIAGO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - A massive cargo ship docked in the Chilean port of San Antonio at the end of November, carrying it its belly the first 100 electric buses from China that Chileans hope will revolutionize their public transport system. Chile’s ambitious plan to face down its capital Santiago’s notorious smog problem includes the rollout of electric scooters, cars and taxis, as well as lorries for use in the mining industry. Mineral-rich Chile - which is not only the world’s largest copper producer but also the second-largest producer of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries - aims to increase the number of electric vehicles tenfold by 2022. Energy minister Susana Jiménez told Reuters the government wanted electric vehicles to account for 40 percent of Chile’s private fleet and 100 percent of public transportation on the roads by 2050. The initiative puts Chile at the forefront of clean mobility in Latin America as well as among developing countries worldwide. But it represents a significant challenge given the persistently high price of electric vehicles and the paucity of charging points in the country. Chile has just 40 public charging stations - half of them in Santiago, according to the energy ministry. Enthusiasts of the new technology prefer to focus on the pluses of clean motoring, such as the reduction in noise and air pollution as well as lower fuel costs. The operation and maintenance costs of an electric bus are also around 70 percent less than those of a diesel engine, according to Chile’s Ministry of Transport. “Chile will be second only to China as a nation with the greatest quantity of electric buses in the world,” Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said at the start of November, when the government took delivery of six BMW i3 electric cars destined for ministerial use. Studies by McKinsey and Bloomberg bear his claims out - of the 385,000 electric buses on the road worldwide last year, 99 percent are in China. The Netherlands and Britain have more than 300 electric buses each but they are spread among several cities rather than concentrated in one, as will be the case in Santiago. The Chilean capital will have 200 in total, the government said. The 100 that recently arrived were manufactured by Chinese firm BYD Electronic International Co Ltd, financed by the local subsidiary of the Italian power utility Enel Generacion Chile SA and will be operated by Metbus, a private Chilean company. Another 100 due to be added to the Santiago fleet are being financed by French energy generation firm Engie Energia Chile SA and manufactured by China’s Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co Ltd . Other Latin American countries are catching on. Mexico City has a booming market in electric scooters and bicycles. It also plans to introduce between 300 and 500 electric buses. Peru has slashed the import tax on electric vehicles to zero while Colombia is converting public diesel buses to unspecified, cleaner engines. If the present fleets of buses and taxis spread across 22 Latin American cities were replaced by electric vehicles today, by 2030 almost $64 billion in fuel would have been saved, and 300 million tons less of carbon dioxide equivalent would have been pumped into the air, according to a UN study. Chile offers electric vehicles exemptions from environmental tax and traffic restrictions, as well as subsidies and fast-track licensing to taxi drivers who switch to more energy efficient cars, the Ministry of Energy said. The government is also encouraging its mining industry to look at using electric lorries, with state copper miner Codelco recently announcing a pilot scheme to introduce them. But the electric vehicle industry remains nascent across Latin America, partly due to the high costs. A BMW i3 equivalent to those being tested by ministers would cost around $60,000 in Chile, prohibitively expensive for most motorists in a country where the average monthly wage is $410. Matías Asun, Greenpeace’s national director, said at the present rate of electric vehicles penetration, the government would have to take dramatic action to meet its 2050 goal. “Our question to the government is this: From what year will it no longer allow combustion engines to be sold in Chile?” he said.

2018-12-10,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Taxing the extraction of fossil fuels could help pay for the growing costs of damage from harsher storms, wildfires, floods and rising seas, while providing a stronger incentive to wean the world off carbon-heavy energy, green groups said on Monday. A “climate damages tax” levied on oil, gas and coal companies could raise $300 billion a year by 2030 to bail out communities bearing the brunt of global warming, said a proposal supported by WWF, Practical Action and others. The tax would lay the cost of rising disaster losses directly on the industries most responsible for them, they said in a report released at U.N. climate negotiations in Poland. Besides assisting those in need overseas, a large share of income from the government-levied tax could help poorer groups at home take up green jobs, energy and transport, backers said. Spending on social justice measures is seen as crucial to avoiding the kind of protests France has seen in recent weeks over rising living costs, sparked partly by hikes in fuel taxes. “The injustice of climate change is that the impacts are felt first and hardest by those with the least responsibility for its causes,” Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, said in a statement. His Pacific island nation lost 64 percent of its GDP - about $450 million - during Cyclone Pam in 2015, and has struggled to recover financially, he noted. “New sources of finance are needed to help address this,” he said, adding there was “strong justification” to tax the fossil fuel industry to pay for the climate damage it is causing. From 2021, the proposed tax would levy $5 on each tonne of heat-trapping emissions expected to be produced by oil, coal and gas deposits that are extracted from the ground. The money would flow through existing national systems for royalty payments where fossil fuel companies operate, with a share going to the international Green Climate Fund or similar bodies to help pay for losses around the world, the report said. Part of the levy would stay in nations with fossil fuel industries, to help their workers find new jobs and pay for cleaner infrastructure for low-income communities, it said. Poorer fossil fuel-producing states, such as Indonesia and Nigeria, would keep all the funds raised, with middle-income nations such as China and Colombia retaining a larger share of income than richer countries. The tax would rise by $5 a year until 2030, rising to a $10 annual increase after that through 2050, when fossil fuels must be largely phased out of global energy systems to meet government commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate accord. “The world must wean itself off fossil fuels if we are to protect the planet - and we must do so quickly,” Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF’s climate and energy head and former Peruvian environment minister, said in a statement supporting the tax. Julie-Anne Richards, one of the report’s authors, said the tax was “a practical way to address the injustice at the heart of climate change”. The fossil fuel industry makes “hundreds of billions in profits while the true costs of their products are paid by the rest of society”, she added. There are precedents for such taxes on tobacco, oil spills and the nuclear industry, she noted. And as losses mount from wilder weather, a fossil fuel levy could become more politically palatable, she added. Storm damage in the United States and the Caribbean alone last year amounted to more than $220 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, the United Nations said last week.

2018-12-10,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s oil exports have hit a record high in November, according to data from a leading tanker-tracking company, ahead of an OPEC supply cut deal takes effect next month when shipments from the kingdom are set to fall by more than 1 million barrels per day. Geneva-based Petro-Logistics, which tracks oil supply from OPEC members and other major exporters, put Saudi oil exports at 8.105 million bpd in November up from 7.491 million bpd in October, according to data seen by Reuters. That would suggest that oil exports from Saudi Arabia in December would fall to about 7.6 million bpd and would further drop to around 7 million in January, according to industry sources, as Riyadh follows through on a global deal to cut supply.       OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday in Vienna to slash oil production by more than the market expected in a bid to shore up prices despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in Vienna this week that the kingdom’s oil exports would be less than 8 million bpd in December, down from “the range of 8.3 million bpd” in November. He also said Saudi Arabia would pump about 10.2 million bpd in January, down from about 10.7 million bpd in December. The kingdom pumped 11.1 million bpd in November.

2018-12-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - The weakening outlook for oil consumption coupled with rising output from U.S. shale and softer than expected U.S. sanctions on Iran have convinced most traders the market is moving into a period of oversupply. In the run up to last week’s OPEC meeting in Vienna, hedge fund managers had little confidence in the organisation’s ability to cut production by enough to avoid an oversupplied market next year. Fund managers sold another 32 million barrels of Brent futures and options in the week to Dec. 4, bringing total sales over the last 10 weeks to a record 360 million barrels. Funds now hold just over two long positions for every short one, down from a ratio of more than 19:1 at the end of September, and the least-bullish position for 17 months. Bearish short positions have risen to 117 million barrels, up from just 27 million at the end of September, and the largest number since June 2017. Pessimism about the outlook for crude prices was reflected by a similar collapse in sentiment towards middle distillates such as gasoil. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PtIemz) Fund managers sold another 20 million barrels of European gasoil, bringing total sales in the last eight weeks to 82 million barrels. Funds are the least-bullish towards middle distillates since July 2017, according to an analysis of position data from ICE Futures Europe. Middle distillates are heavily geared towards the economic cycle because most distillate fuel oil is used in freight transportation (shipping, railroads, aviation, trucks), manufacturing, mining and farming. So the collapse in sentiment towards distillates is consistent with growing concerns about the outlook for the global economy in 2019. Investors’ fears about the impact of trade tensions and heightened uncertainty on business investment and growth next year is darkening the outlook for distillates just as it is hitting equity markets. Expected oversupply of crude has been reflected in the sharp fall in Brent spot prices since the start of October and the futures curve swinging from backwardation into contango. OPEC and selected non-OPEC countries agreed last week to cut their output by 1.2 million barrels per day during the first six months of 2019 from the level in October 2018. Most of the cuts will come from Saudi Arabia, with smaller contributions likely to come from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman. Other OPEC and non-OPEC countries are unlikely to reduce their output voluntarily by any significant amount so their participation in the agreement is mostly symbolic. The planned production cuts reverse the OPEC+ group’s earlier ramp up in output and should offset the softer enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Iran. By cutting output promptly and aggressively, OPEC+ may be able to avert a large build up in excess oil inventories next year and a collapse in prices similar to 2014/15. In contrast to 2014, Saudi-led OPEC has opted to sacrifice market share in an effort to defend prices at a higher level despite the rapid growth of U.S. shale. But there is little the group can do about the deteriorating economic outlook, which implies the need for a period of lower oil prices to restrain production and stimulate consumption to keep the market balanced. And as the global economy reels from the tariff war between the United States and China, rising interest rates, tightening credit conditions, and a broader economic slowdown, lower oil prices are a necessary part of the economic adjustment process.

The aim of the gathering is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. 1100 GMT - As ministers lock horns on the detail of the text, they might reflect on a statement issued overnight by global investors managing $32 trillion in assets who urged governments to accelerate steps to combat climate change. reut.rs/2C23M6e Separately, it would seem pressure on oil companies to tackle climate change is growing after an activist group for the first time filed a shareholder resolution urging BP to set hard targets for reducing overall carbon emissions. Follow This, a Dutch organisation that spearheaded a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell's AGMs over the past three years said it also filed one with the Anglo-Dutch company for 2019. reut.rs/2Em0mO9 Ministers from around 120 countries start to arrive at the conference and face the task of breaking deadlocks and divisions to achieve the political compromises needed by the end of the week. On Saturday, negotiations tried to clean up a messy text to have a document ready for ministers to wrestle over in the second and final week of the conference. Negotiators say there has been progress, but it is slow and, as ever, finance is a stumbling block. Parties also failed to reach an agreement on whether to “note” or “welcome” the U.N. IPCC report published in October. Saudi Arabia, Russia, the U.S. and Kuwait were against welcoming the report. Ultimately any reference to the IPCC report was removed. Campaigners in Katowice said another weekend of the violent “yellow vests” protests in France shows why a just transition is needed when shaping energy transition policy. “When you look at the demands from the protests in France, it is not pitting climate policy against economic and social policy. It is saying (that) we need to respond to the anxieties people are feeling, the fear people are feeling,” said Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at E3G, a non-governmental organisation, said. French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on Monday as he seeks to placate “yellow vest” anti-government protesters who wreaked havoc in Paris this weekend. A side event supported by the U.S. administration on Monday afternoon called “Innovative Technologies Spur Economic Dynamism” has been criticised by environmental groups and many countries. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants,” said Dan Lashof, Director, World Resources Institute US. “This sideshow in Poland would be laughable if the consequences of climate change weren’t so deadly serious,” he added. The event will feature Wells Griffith, senior director for energy at the National Security Council and Steve Winberg, assistant secretary at the department of energy. “Presentations at the event will show how innovation and investment have led to dramatically lower technology costs, reductions in all types of emissions, greater competitiveness, and access to affordable, modern energy services,” said a senior U.S. administration official. Although highly technical, negotiators say the Katowice talks are an essential follow-up to the Paris Agreement, which agreed on the aim of limiting global warming but did not provide rules on how to achieve that. A U.N. spokesman said a record number — more than 32,800 — had registered to attend the conference.

2018-12-10,"NAIROBI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A Kenyan court on Monday charged senior officials from the state-run oil pipeline and others from the state health insurance fund for abuse of office and economic crimes that led to the loss of billions of shillings from the two institutions. Dozens of Kenyan government officials and business people have appeared in court since May on charges relating to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of shillings from public coffers in a new drive to tackle widespread graft. Joe Sang, the managing director of Kenya Pipeline Company, and five of his colleagues were charged with abuse of office in connection with the loss of funds in the construction of a fuel jetty in western Kenya worth 1.96 billion shillings ($19 million), a figure that exceeded the original budget. Geoffrey Mwangi, the chief executive officer of the National Health Insurance Fund, his predecessor and 16 other officials were also charged with abuse of office an irregular award and extension of a contract in which 1.1 billion shillings was lost. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges. “The charges are generic but not serious,” Ahmednasir Abdullahi, lawyer representing the Kenya Pipeline officials, said in court. “I have instructions to apply for bail and accused should be admitted to reasonable bail terms.” A payments processing company and two of its directors were also charged over receiving the funds that were allegedly lost at the state health insurance fund. They also pleaded not guilty. President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013, but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials.

A judgment on the smelter will be uploaded on the court’s website in a week’s time, Adarsh Kumar Goel, chairman of the National Green Tribunal, said on Monday.

State authorities had shut down the Tamil Nadu plant in May after police fired on protesters calling for its closure over concerns it was polluting air and water. Vedanta’s lawyer Aryama Sundaram last week told the court the company would invest 1 billion rupees ($14 million) to build hospitals and schools for people living close to the smelter.

2018-12-10,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African government needs to “bite the bullet” and bail out struggling state-run power firm Eskom, which has asked for 100 billion rand (5.5 billion pounds) in government support, the chief executive of Rothschild & Co in South Africa told Reuters. Rothschild advised Eskom in 2008 when it last received a major cash injection from government. At the time, Eskom sought 115 billion rand, but was granted a 60 billion rand loan which was later converted into equity. Eskom has implemented controlled power cuts for much of the past week, which could erode support for the ruling African National Congress at next year’s national election. Opinion is divided on whether Eskom, which provides more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power but was embroiled in corruption scandals under its previous management, should be bailed out again. Rothschild’s Martin Kingston said in an interview that recapitalising Eskom could cost the country its last investment grade credit rating but that there was “no other obvious solution” if Eskom was to survive. “The government knows that putting money into Eskom is going to exacerbate a downgrade scenario. But I think it is going to have to bite that bullet,” Kingston said. “The level of debt on Eskom’s balance sheet is completely unsustainable.” Eskom’s debt has ballooned from around 106 billion rand to more than 419 billion rand over the past decade, while electricity sales have fallen. Eskom executives told investors on a roadshow last week they wanted the state to take on 100 billion rand of the company’s debt. But Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is yet to approve the proposal and has said the state cannot afford to continue “pouring money” into loss-making state firms. President Cyril Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority since taking office in February, but the scale of its financial difficulties has made progress slow. Kingston said the government had kicked the can down the road by not providing Eskom with more funds in 2008 and that restructuring the utility could take three to five years.

Wall Street was set to open lower, futures indicated, after New York-listed shares posted their biggest weekly decline since March. “Another day, another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining,” said Stephen Innes at brokerage OANDA MSCI’s all-country index has spent four weeks in the red, despite intermittent rallies fuelled by hopes of trade war detente. The pessimism has been exacerbated by data showing the world’s largest economies — the United States, China, Japan and Germany — are all headed for slower growth. That pushed the index 0.5 percent lower, while a pan-European index fell almost one percent by 0930 GMT and U.S. equity futures  were down 0.5 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session. Last week’s arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States was seen putting up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said Sunday there was a “hard deadline” to the 90-day trade ceasefire and without a successful end to talks by March 1, Washington would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Economic data has disappointed, too, underscoring the impact of the trade wars on the world economy. Following weak trade and inflation data on the weekend, China posted far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reinforcing expectations Beijing will roll out more stimulus to prevent the economy cooling too fast. However, the yuan sagged to a one-week low after the weak data. “(The data) would suggest China woes go well beyond U.S. tariffs, given that China trade surplus to the U.S. was at a record level. One can only imagine the impact on China terms of trade if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff,” Innes of OANDA said. Japan posted the worst contraction in over four years in the third quarter as uncertainty over global demand and trade saw companies slashing capital spending. MSCI’s index of Asian equities outside Japan slid 1.5 percent to a near three-week low, Shanghai shares retreated 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.1 percent. Emerging-market stocks lost 1.3 percent. Asia’s data came after investors were spooked last week by below-forecast industrial output numbers in Germany and U.S. jobs data showing employers hired fewer workers than expected in November. The slowdown signs also have pummelled oil prices, which have slumped around 30 percent since early October. Brent futures rose 0.2 percent to $61.90 a barrel after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers announced a supply cut. The U.S. jobs data weakened the dollar by convincing many that U.S. growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening sooner than previously thought. Last week, the dollar posted its worst performance since August against a basket of currencies. The dollar was a touch firmer on Monday but stayed near two-week lows. The euro rose 0.3 percent at $1.1418. European investors were keeping their eyes on events in Britain and France. Sterling inched lower, heading back towards 17-month lows hit last week versus the dollar, as British Prime Minister Theresa May’s European Union divorce deal looks set to be rejected by parliament in a Tuesday vote. While that raises fears of a chaotic exit in March, those hoping for a no-Brexit outcome were encouraged by a ruling from the EU’s top court that Britain can revoke its decision to leave the bloc without the consent of other EU members. France, meanwhile, suffered a fourth weekend of anti-government riots, which the finance minister said could curb economic growth by 0.1 percentage point. French hotel, transport and retail stocks fell. The yield premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German peers rose to the highest since May . President Emmanuel Macron, already forced to row back on fuel tax increases, will make a televised address at 1900 GMT. “Concern about a bit of political and fiscal capitulation is rarely good for a bond market,” said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.

2018-12-10,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.  1/ CURVE-BALLS With major parts of the U.S. economy visibly slowing, the Treasury market has reacted in a striking manner - the 10-year yield is close to falling below the two-year yield, which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last 40 years. Signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year.   But wait. Inflation is running at a 9-month high, annual wage growth a 9-1/2 year high and unemployment at a near-50 year low. So November inflation, due on Dec. 12, will play into how Fed chair Jerome Powell frames the path of future tightening. So it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here. There are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert. Depending on how the incoming data looks - stagflation, anyone? - the Fed’s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear.

Britain’s parliament is - at the time of writing at least - set to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit transition deal on Tuesday, but the chances of it being approved don’t look good. What happens then is... well that’s the thing, there are multiple possibilities, all with very different implications. A really heavy defeat would make it difficult for May to carry on. She has staggered through the last couple of years, taking direct hits from all angles but this could finally bring her down. Could that then lead to a hard Brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal? Perhaps and sterling won’t like that one bit. But it’s equally possible that whoever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the so-called Article 50 notice. That could even raise the chances of a second public Brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring. (For a graphic on 'Sterling positions and valuations' click tmsnrt.rs/2QkcsxI) Thursday marks the end of an era for the ECB, which is set to formally announce the end of its three-year long, 2.6 trillion-euro monetary stimulus scheme. For markets, that’s a done deal. What matters now is what the ECB does in the face of a weakening economy, global trade tensions, Brexit and Italy. Policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when QE ends. One suggestion is for multi-year loans to banks.  What investors appear more certain about is that the ECB will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent - especially if a U.S. slowdown encourages the Fed to pause its rate-hike cycle. Money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a 75 pct chance of a ECB rate hike in 2019. But that’s down from 100 percent just a few weeks ago. (For a graphic on 'European Central Bank QE scheme' click tmsnrt.rs/2RzoTCh) So much for the U.S.-China trade truce. If financial markets are any guide, the detente between Washington and Beijing struck over a steak dinner at the G20 in Buenos Aires barely lasted 24 hours. Fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment. On oil markets, that signals that a 30 percent price slump since October has little hope of reversing. Oil has also had to contend with OPEC, whose initial failure to agree an output cut accelerated the price slump. Agreement over a 1.2 million barrels-per-day cuts together with some non-OPEC producers has provided a bit of respite but Brent still remains just over $60. Commodities overall are in some trouble. Copper is near three-week lows, having lost around 15 percent so far in 2018, while most base metals are down a similar amount. And the Australian dollar, a good proxy for commodities, Chinese demand and world trade, was the worst-performing major currency in the world all week. Without good news on the trade front, respite is unlikely. The U.S. trade deficit hit a 10-year high in October, and its politically sensitive deficit with China surged to a record $43 billion. So lets see how China hawks in the Trump administration react to data showing Beijing’s imports from the United States shrank 25 percent from a year earlier, following a 1.8 percent annual decline in October. It appears so far that China may not be carrying out promises to import more from America and that could provide more grist for the mill - for U.S. officials pushing for more reasons to punish China and for investors skeptical of the trade ceasefire.  The prospect of a Chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy. So while trade contributes far less to the country’s GDP than it used to, there are other data points coming up too - credit growth and retail sales among others - which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war.

Speaking at a ministry event in Baghdad, Ghadhban said the recent fall in Iraqi exports was not due to technical reasons, as Iraqi oil fields have high capacity, but rather because of weather conditions. “Our goal is to reach an export capacity of 6.5 million barrels per day but over several stages,” he said. Speaking about the recent Kirkuk oil deal with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Ghadhban said state oil marketer SOMO had received preferential prices, albeit for low quantities. Iraq last month restarted exports of Kirkuk oil, halted a year ago due to a standoff between the central government and the KRG, after a new government in Baghdad agreed a tentative deal with Erbil.

2018-12-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global commodity trader Trafigura Group reported its lowest annual net profit in eight years on Monday as a drop in oil trading margins offset a strong performance by its metals and minerals division. Traded volumes at its metals division increased by 37 percent in the financial year that ended on Sept. 30, mainly in coal, which had a “surprisingly strong” year, the company said.  In oil trading, however, Trafigura said the oil structure shift to backwardation, whereby the front month price is higher then the next, compressed margins prompting a “major overhaul” of its books to reduce inventories and storage contracts.  Trafigura’s total earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the financial year rose 8 percent to $1.7 billion (1.34 billion pounds), from 1.6 billion. Gross profit increased to $2.4 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier.  Net profit fell slightly to $873 million from a lacklustre $887 million in 2017 due to low oil volatility, already its lowest since 2010.  Revenues rose to $180.7 billion, from $136.7 billion in its 2017 financial year. Traded oil volumes grew to 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from just over 5.3 million bpd the previous year. Liquefied natural gas volumes rose to 9.9 million tonnes from 8.1 million tonnes.      “The largest component of profit was generated by the Metals and Minerals Trading division in one of its best years [...] Oil and Petroleum Products Trading’s contribution to gross profit fell by 10 percent to $1 billion as a result of the switch from the contango to backwardated oil pricing structure,” the Geneva-based company said in a statement.  Earlier this year the company tripled the size of its management committee and promoted Rob Gillon and Ben Luckock to run the oil division as co-heads alongside Executive Director Jose Larocca.  Ahead of new, cleaner shipping fuel rules being introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2020, Trafigura confirmed it had merged its middle distillates and fuel oil trading teams. It also set up a new bunkering team to develop new business as the fuel change is set to unnerve oil markets.  Trafigura’s adjusted debt to group equity fell below 1 from 1.24 as of Sept. 30 2017.  Share buybacks also fell to $528 million from $569 million.  The company is still paying departing founders, including the family of the late Claude Dauphin, but details on who was paid were not disclosed. The cost of capital increased sharply due to rising interest rates globally. Trafigura’s Chief Financial Officer Christopher Salmon said he expected this trend to continue in 2019.  “The sector has entered a period of consolidation around the very largest players – with banks, for example, becoming more selective in allocating liquidity,” Salmon said in the results.  Trafigura made $191 million on divesting a 50 percent stake in its subsidiary Impala Terminals to IFM Investors.  Impairments included $72 million with zinc, lead producer and smelter Nyrstar. Trafigura recently extended a credit facility worth $650 million to help Nyrstar’s debt situation. It also suffered a pretax loss of $57 million following the sale of a 20 percent stake in Buckeye Texas Partners LLC for $210 million.

2018-12-10,"Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Hess Corp and Conocophillips both expect production for 2019 to be higher than this year even as they spend roughly the same amount of money on exploration, the companies said on Monday. Investors have been urging U.S. oil companies to increase returns on tight spending at a time when they are also looking beyond the Permian Basin, which is getting crowded and costly. Hess said the lion’s share of its 2019 capital expenditure will go towards exploration in Guyana and Bakken. Conoco will spend most of its capex in Alaska and Canada, it said. The 2019 production views come as global oil markets struggle with oversupply, resulting in producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreeing to cut their crude output from January. Production in the United States, however, is expected to rise to a record high 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019. For Hess, production is expected to range between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boep/d) excluding Libya, up from the 255,000 boep/d it expects in 2018, while ConocoPhillips was aiming to produce 2.0-2.6 percent more oil and gas next year. Both kept their capital spending budget roughly flat - $2.9 billion for Hess and $6.1 billion for Conoco. “As we focus spending on our high return investment opportunities, we will continue to reduce our unit costs to drive margin expansion and improve profitability,” Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement on Monday. Last week, oil major Chevron Corp increased its spending budget for the first time in four years. The company said it plans to spend more on shale production next year, as well as in refining and chemicals.

2018-12-10,"LONDON, Dec 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Aid agencies could save more than $500 million by choosing clean energy over fossil fuels in war zones and disaster areas, global think-tank Chatham House said in a report on Monday. Humanitarian agencies spent about five percent of their funds - or an estimated $1.2 billion - on diesel last year, and could save $517 million each year by using cleaner energy sources such as solar power, it said. “Humanitarians are operating in tough environments where saving lives come first,” said co-author Owen Grafham from the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI), a partnership managed by London-based Chatham House. “Energy is not given much thought - diesel is the go-to fuel because it’s what agencies are used to and it’s quick-to-deploy,” he said in a statement. Carbon-emitting fossil fuels can be used as a weapon, hijacked by militants or sold on the black market and sometimes have to be flown vast distances to reach off-grid relief camps. That creates costs that humanitarian groups can ill afford, with wars, persecution and other violence having uprooted a record 68.5 million people last year, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Aid agencies said curbing emissions was key to preventing climate-change related disasters. Renewable energy is key to reducing climate-changing emissions under a global climate deal after governments in 2015 pledged to hold temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5 degrees C. “The burning of dirty fuels increasingly impacts poor people, particularly women and girls, who are in the midst of humanitarian crises,” Sven Harmeling, head of CARE International’s climate advocacy arm, said in email. While the technology has not advanced far enough to make a full swap viable, some solar projects are already under way in the field and aid workers expect many more to follow. Engineer Per-Erik Eriksson, from the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) Sweden Innovation Unit, said the group was making substantial effort to use renewable energy. “However, it is not certain that such a transformation will save us money, given the current initial costs for renewable energy infrastructure. Our operations are emergency-oriented, and therefore implicitly short term,” he said. “The investment for renewable energy solutions is always higher than for diesel generator solutions, and so the savings only come over a number of years,” Eriksson said from Haiti, where he is testing solar-powered air-conditioning. Aid groups say operations also relied on diesel generators since many local workers or volunteers already knew how to use them, whereas solar energy would be costly and require specialised knowledge. An October report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said renewable energy would need to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. More than 190 countries are meeting in Poland through Dec. 14 to hammer out rules that will enable the Paris accord to be put into practice from 2020, and spur countries to strengthen their current climate action plans.

2018-12-10,"LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Protesters disturbed a U.S.-sponsored event promoting fossil fuels on the sidelines of U.N. climate change talks on Monday. The event called “U.S. innovative technologies spur economic dynamism”, touting the benefits of burning fossil fuels more efficiently, infuriated campaigners and many government delegations who want the talks to focus on moving away from coal, oil and gas. Some 100 protestors in the audience at the event seized a microphone and interrupted opening remarks by Wells Griffith, the man President Donald Trump appointed as senior director for energy at the National Security Council. They waved banners and chanted: “keep it in the ground”. “I’m 19 years old and I’m pissed,” shouted Vic Barrett, a plaintiff in the “Juliana vs U.S.” lawsuit filed in 2015 by 21 young people against the government for allowing activities that harm the climate. “I am currently suing my government for perpetuating the global climate change crisis ... Young people are at the forefront of leading solutions to address the climate crises and we won’t back down.” Before the interruption, Griffiths said it was important to be pragmatic in dealing with climate change in a world still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. “Alarmism should not silence realism ... This administration does not see the benefit of being part of an agreement which impedes U.S. economic growth and jobs,” he said. The conference, in Katowice, Poland, aims to work out the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement, the global pact on combating climate change.

(PPC) to extend the deadline for binding bids for three coal-fired plants by three weeks, an energy ministry source said on Monday. Greece agreed to sell the plants under its latest international bailout, which ended in August. The source said potential bidders and advisors had requested that the deadline be delayed until after the Christmas holiday period to give them more time. PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, has shortlisted all six investors interested in buying Meliti I and two other plants in Megalopoli on the Peloponnese peninsula, as well as a licence to build a new plant, Meliti II, in northern Greece. The deadline for the final bids had been set at Dec. 15, and it is not known if all six will submit bids. An energy ministry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Greece has sought EU Commission approval for the binding bids to be submitted by Jan. 7 and for any improved offers by Jan. 10. It aims to have concluded the divestment process by Jan. 15. The Commission has informally approved the request, the official said, and Athens is now waiting for official confirmation of the extension in writing. The EU Commission and PPC were not immediately available for comment. The tender is organised by PPC and overseen by the Commission, after a European court ruled that PPC had abused its dominant position in the coal market. The official said that a final round of talks between the EU Commission and investors on the terms of the sale would start on Monday. Another source close to the matter said that issues on the table would include a mechanism that would allow PPC and the new owner to share any profit or loss from the plants for a set period of time.

The Bank of France on Monday forecast the euro zone’s number two economy would eke out growth of only 0.2 percent in the quarter from the previous three months, down from 0.4 percent in a previous estimate. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire declined to give an estimate for 2018 growth but forecast the nationwide tumult would trim 0.1 percent of a point off of national output. His deputy projected growth would round out “closer to 1.5 percent”. The slow-down will be worrisome for Macron, who faces huge pressure on the streets to make further cuts to taxes and social security costs to bolster household spending power, while keeping France’s budget deficit below a European Union cap. The slowdown is a “reality for our businessmen, entrepreneurs, it’s the reality for those whose shops were vandalised, looted, in the most violent way,” Le Maire told RTL. “And it’s a reality too for our foreign investors.” Police used tear gas, water canon and horses to charge protesters hurling projectiles, torching cars and ransacking some shops, though they encountered less violence than the previous Saturday, when the capital encountered its worst violence since the 1968 student uprising. Upscale department store Printemps, which shut its flagship store in Paris on Saturday, typically one of the busiest days of the year ahead of Christmas, said it had suffered a 25 to 30 percent slump in sales since the unrest began. “There has been a colossal loss in sales and they won’t be recouped,” Pierre Pelarrey, who runs Printemps Haussmann, told Reuters. Nationwide, shopping centres saw a 17 fall in people passing through the doors, the CNCC grouping of mall operators said. In a sign of the perceived heightened risk of holding French debt, French government bond yields rose on Monday, pushing the French/German 10-year bond spread to its widest since May, at around 46 basis points in early trade. On the Paris bourse, airport operator ADP fell 0.8, while retailers Casino and FNAC Darty also headed south. Hotels company Accor initially traded down 0.7 percent before paring losses. Macron addresses the nation on Monday evening. The president has drawn criticism for his silence in public over the violence in Paris - opponents accuse him of turning the Elysee Palace into a bunker. Ministers hope he will placate the yellow vests, whose revolt poses the most formidable challenge to his 18-month administration to date. “Our country is deeply divided, between those who see that globalisation has benefited them and others who can’t make ends meet, who say ... globalisation is not an opportunity but a threat,” Le Maire told RTL. “It is the president’s role to unify the country.” The protests were born out of a backlash against the squeeze on the household budgets of hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar workers. But the movement has developed into a broader anti-Macron rebellion. The former investment banker is under pressure to respond to the demands of yellow vests for a higher minimum wage, lower taxes, and better retirement provisions, though more concessions will leave France in danger of breaching EU deficit rules. “The big picture is that the budget deficit will worsen and political problems will make cuts to spending hard,” said Rabobank rates strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor. The government’s latest estimates are for a budget deficit of 2.8 percent in 2019, just below the EU’s 3 percent cap - a target Macron has cast as critical to meet to cement his reformist credentials. Le Maire reiterated his desire to accelerate tax cuts but suggested he was not in favour of reinstating a tax on wealth — known as the ‘ISF’ — that Macron narrowed when he came into office, and which earned him the tag “president of the rich”. “Does the ISF help reduce poverty, reduce our debts, reduce public spending? No. If you want to hunt for money, go knocking on the doors of digital tech companies,” Le Maire said. Reporting by Richard Lough; additional reporting by Leigh

2018-12-10,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by OPEC and its allies is “balance”. It’s something everybody in the market says they want, but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there. Boiled down to the basics, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the other producers, most notably Russia, are trying to do with the move to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) is achieve their vision of a balanced market. While what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms, it’s assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be “fair” and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output. What this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain, although it’s likely that OPEC and its allies will take the view that the $60.06 a barrel that Brent crude closed at the day before the Dec. 7 output deal was reached is too low. But it’s also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above $80 a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the OPEC orbit. Brent reached a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3, but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost 34 percent of its value, hitting a trough of $57.50 on Nov. 28, the lowest level in a year. It’s that rapid plunge that led OPEC and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance, and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired, but elusive, state. The market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether OPEC has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise, but not so high that demand is threatened. The initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for OPEC, with Brent jumping as much as $3.67 to $63.73 a barrel during trade on Dec. 7, but eventually it closed at $61.67, up 2.7 percent from the previous day. The nirvana of balance also means that OPEC, and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, have to walk a series of political tightropes. The obvious one is also the most public, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is often criticised for changing his mind on issues, but has been remarkably consistent on one front, namely his desire for lower oil prices. It’s perhaps no surprise that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih singled out U.S. energy companies as winners from the OPEC and allies deal, telling reporters at the meeting in Vienna on Dec. 7 that they were “breathing a sigh of relief”. This was perhaps a not-so-subtle attempt to stave off a blast from Trump on his favoured social media platform Twitter, by reminding him that the powerful U.S. energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices. The Saudis also have to manage their relationship with the United States carefully in the wake of the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in October. Trump has said he is not convinced the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder, even as leaders of his own Republican Party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing. A further complicating factor is Iran, which is exempt from the new output-cutting deal, and in theory living on borrowed time given the U.S. waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on April. Given the plethora of competing factors and influences, it would seem balance will be a difficult, if not impossible task in the crude oil market. But how will the success of this latest production cut be measured? If crude remains in a range between $60 and $80 a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the Iran export waivers, then it might be fair to argue that OPEC and its allies will have achieved what they wanted - a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with.

2018-12-10,"(Updates with Saudi Arabia, Polish presidency statements) KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change began the crucial final week in the Polish city of Katowice, capital of the country’s Silesian coal mining district. The aim of the gathering is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. Saudi Arabia issued a statement saying it recognised the efforts of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in producing scientific reports, the latest of which was published in October assessing the feasibility and importance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, it said there were gaps and uncertainties in the report which still needed further research. “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is hopeful that the IPCC 6th Assessment Report will address these gaps and challenges, and that a consensus to welcome it among all parties can be reached,” it said in a statement. On Saturday, parties failed to reach an agreement on whether to “note” or “welcome” the U.N. IPCC report published in October. Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States and Kuwait were against welcoming the report and reference to the IPCC report was removed. Ministers from around 120 countries started to arrive at the conference and faced the task of breaking deadlocks and divisions to achieve the political compromises needed by the end of the week. The Polish presidency of the talks said a “significant amount of work” needed to be done to finish work on the rule book. If this outstanding work was not concluded by Tuesday, it would not be possible to conclude that by Friday, it said in a statement. Campaigners in Katowice said another weekend of the violent “yellow vests” protests in France showed why a just transition is needed when shaping energy transition policy. “When you look at the demands from the protests in France, it is not pitting climate policy against economic and social policy. It is saying (that) we need to respond to the anxieties people are feeling, the fear people are feeling,” said Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at E3G, a non-governmental organisation. French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on Monday as he seeks to placate “yellow vest” anti-government protesters who wreaked havoc in Paris this weekend. A side event supported by the U.S. administration on Monday afternoon called “Innovative Technologies Spur Economic Dynamism” has been criticised by environmental groups and many countries. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants,” said Dan Lashof, director, World Resources Institute US. “This sideshow in Poland would be laughable if the consequences of climate change weren’t so deadly serious,” he added. The event will feature Wells Griffith, senior director for energy at the National Security Council and Steve Winberg, assistant secretary at the department of energy. “Presentations at the event will show how innovation and investment have led to dramatically lower technology costs, reductions in all types of emissions, greater competitiveness, and access to affordable, modern energy services,” said a senior U.S. administration official.

2018-12-10,"* US-China trade tensions flare again * European stocks open lower * Dollar drops after soft US jobs data * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Losses on global stocks snowballed on Monday, with Wall Street set to follow Europe and Asia lower as fresh signs emerged that the U.S.-China trade spat was taking a deeper toll on world economic growth. Data from the world’s biggest economies — the United States, China, Japan and Germany — have all disappointed investors in recent days, and doubts are growing that Washington and Beijing will reach agreement before a 90-day trade ceasefire expires. Markets are also on edge after reports that the British parliament’s crucial vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal will be delayed, sending sterling and UK stocks lower. “Another day, another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining,” said Stephen Innes at brokerage OANDA MSCI’s all-country index has spent four weeks in the red, despite intermittent rallies fuelled by hopes of trade war detente. The index slipped 0.5 percent, while a pan-European index fell 0.7 percent by 1200 GMT. U.S. equity futures   were down 0.3 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session. Last week’s arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States was seen as putting up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said Sunday there was a “hard deadline” to the 90-day trade ceasefire and without a successful end to talks by March 1, Washington would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Following weak trade and inflation data on the weekend, China also posted far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reinforcing expectations Beijing will roll out more stimulus to prevent the economy cooling too fast. However, the yuan sagged to a one-week low after the weak data. “(The data) would suggest China woes go well beyond U.S. tariffs, given that China trade surplus to the U.S. was at a record level. One can only imagine the impact on China terms of trade if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff,” Innes of OANDA said. Japan posted the worst contraction in over four years in the third quarter as uncertainty over global demand and trade saw companies slashing capital spending. MSCI’s index of Asian equities outside Japan earlier slid to near three-week lows, Shanghai shares retreated 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.1 percent. Emerging-market stocks lost 1.5 percent. Asia’s data came after investors were spooked last week by below-forecast industrial output numbers in Germany and U.S. jobs data showing employers hired fewer workers than expected in November. The slowdown signs also have pummelled oil prices, which have slumped around 30 percent since early October. Brent futures fell 1.5 percent to $60.7 a barrel, reversing earlier modest gains triggered by a supply cut from OPEC and some non-affiliated producers. European investors were keeping their eyes on events in Britain and France. Sterling slumped to the lowest since June 2017 versus the dollar, after the BBC’s political editor quoted cabinet sources said May was pulling the vote, scheduled for Tuesday. Sterling slid half a percent to $1.2656 and extended losses versus the euro, trading down 0.7 percent at 90.18 pence - its weakest since early-September. Britain’s FTSE 250 equity index, sensitive to local economic developments tumbled 1 percent and investors scurried to buy British government bonds, with yields dropping five to seven basis points on the day. “There is still room for short-term political risk premium to be priced into pound which is currently worth of 2 percent based on our models. The downside to sterling is hence very clear,” ING Bank analysts told clients. The dollar inched off two-week lows against a basket of currencies, including sterling. Last week, the dollar posted its worst performance since August after the lacklustre jobs data convinced many that U.S. growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening sooner than previously thought. French assets also came under pressure, with hotel and retail stocks suffering the fallout of four weekends of anti-government riots, which the finance minister said could curb economic growth by 0.1 percentage point. The yield premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German peers rose to the highest since May, before a 1900 GMT televised address by President Emmanuel Macron.

2018-12-10,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda SANTIAGO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - A massive cargo ship docked in the Chilean port of San Antonio at the end of November, carrying it its belly the first 100 electric buses from China that Chileans hope will revolutionize their public transport system. Chile’s ambitious plan to face down its capital Santiago’s notorious smog problem includes the rollout of electric scooters, cars and taxis, as well as lorries for use in the mining industry. Mineral-rich Chile - which is not only the world’s largest copper producer but also the second-largest producer of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries - aims to increase the number of electric vehicles tenfold by 2022. Energy minister Susana Jiménez told Reuters the government wanted electric vehicles to account for 40 percent of Chile’s private fleet and 100 percent of public transportation on the roads by 2050. The initiative puts Chile at the forefront of clean mobility in Latin America as well as among developing countries worldwide. But it represents a significant challenge given the persistently high price of electric vehicles and the paucity of charging points in the country. Chile has just 40 public charging stations - half of them in Santiago, according to the energy ministry. Enthusiasts of the new technology prefer to focus on the pluses of clean motoring, such as the reduction in noise and air pollution as well as lower fuel costs. The operation and maintenance costs of an electric bus are also around 70 percent less than those of a diesel engine, according to Chile’s Ministry of Transport. “Chile will be second only to China as a nation with the greatest quantity of electric buses in the world,” Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said at the start of November, when the government took delivery of six BMW i3 electric cars destined for ministerial use. Studies by McKinsey and Bloomberg bear his claims out - of the 385,000 electric buses on the road worldwide last year, 99 percent are in China. The Netherlands and Britain have more than 300 electric buses each but they are spread among several cities rather than concentrated in one, as will be the case in Santiago. The Chilean capital will have 200 in total, the government said. The 100 that recently arrived were manufactured by Chinese firm BYD Electronic International Co Ltd, financed by the local subsidiary of the Italian power utility Enel Generacion Chile SA and will be operated by Metbus, a private Chilean company. Another 100 due to be added to the Santiago fleet are being financed by French energy generation firm Engie Energia Chile SA and manufactured by China’s Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co Ltd . Other Latin American countries are catching on. Mexico City has a booming market in electric scooters and bicycles. It also plans to introduce between 300 and 500 electric buses. Peru has slashed the import tax on electric vehicles to zero while Colombia is converting public diesel buses to unspecified, cleaner engines. If the present fleets of buses and taxis spread across 22 Latin American cities were replaced by electric vehicles today, by 2030 almost $64 billion in fuel would have been saved, and 300 million tons less of carbon dioxide equivalent would have been pumped into the air, according to a UN study. Chile offers electric vehicles exemptions from environmental tax and traffic restrictions, as well as subsidies and fast-track licensing to taxi drivers who switch to more energy efficient cars, the Ministry of Energy said. The government is also encouraging its mining industry to look at using electric lorries, with state copper miner Codelco recently announcing a pilot scheme to introduce them. But the electric vehicle industry remains nascent across Latin America, partly due to the high costs. A BMW i3 equivalent to those being tested by ministers would cost around $60,000 in Chile, prohibitively expensive for most motorists in a country where the average monthly wage is $410. Matías Asun, Greenpeace’s national director, said at the present rate of electric vehicles penetration, the government would have to take dramatic action to meet its 2050 goal. “Our question to the government is this: From what year will it no longer allow combustion engines to be sold in Chile?” he said.

2018-12-10,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Taxing the extraction of fossil fuels could help pay for the growing costs of damage from harsher storms, wildfires, floods and rising seas, while providing a stronger incentive to wean the world off carbon-heavy energy, green groups said on Monday. A “climate damages tax” levied on oil, gas and coal companies could raise $300 billion a year by 2030 to bail out communities bearing the brunt of global warming, said a proposal supported by WWF, Practical Action and others. The tax would lay the cost of rising disaster losses directly on the industries most responsible for them, they said in a report released at U.N. climate negotiations in Poland. Besides assisting those in need overseas, a large share of income from the government-levied tax could help poorer groups at home take up green jobs, energy and transport, backers said. Spending on social justice measures is seen as crucial to avoiding the kind of protests France has seen in recent weeks over rising living costs, sparked partly by hikes in fuel taxes. “The injustice of climate change is that the impacts are felt first and hardest by those with the least responsibility for its causes,” Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, said in a statement. His Pacific island nation lost 64 percent of its GDP - about $450 million - during Cyclone Pam in 2015, and has struggled to recover financially, he noted. “New sources of finance are needed to help address this,” he said, adding there was “strong justification” to tax the fossil fuel industry to pay for the climate damage it is causing. From 2021, the proposed tax would levy $5 on each tonne of heat-trapping emissions expected to be produced by oil, coal and gas deposits that are extracted from the ground. The money would flow through existing national systems for royalty payments where fossil fuel companies operate, with a share going to the international Green Climate Fund or similar bodies to help pay for losses around the world, the report said. Part of the levy would stay in nations with fossil fuel industries, to help their workers find new jobs and pay for cleaner infrastructure for low-income communities, it said. Poorer fossil fuel-producing states, such as Indonesia and Nigeria, would keep all the funds raised, with middle-income nations such as China and Colombia retaining a larger share of income than richer countries. The tax would rise by $5 a year until 2030, rising to a $10 annual increase after that through 2050, when fossil fuels must be largely phased out of global energy systems to meet government commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate accord. “The world must wean itself off fossil fuels if we are to protect the planet - and we must do so quickly,” Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF’s climate and energy head and former Peruvian environment minister, said in a statement supporting the tax. Julie-Anne Richards, one of the report’s authors, said the tax was “a practical way to address the injustice at the heart of climate change”. The fossil fuel industry makes “hundreds of billions in profits while the true costs of their products are paid by the rest of society”, she added. There are precedents for such taxes on tobacco, oil spills and the nuclear industry, she noted. And as losses mount from wilder weather, a fossil fuel levy could become more politically palatable, she added. Storm damage in the United States and the Caribbean alone last year amounted to more than $220 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, the United Nations said last week.

2018-12-10,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s oil exports have hit a record high in November, according to data from a leading tanker-tracking company, ahead of an OPEC supply cut deal takes effect next month when shipments from the kingdom are set to fall by more than 1 million barrels per day. Geneva-based Petro-Logistics, which tracks oil supply from OPEC members and other major exporters, put Saudi oil exports at 8.105 million bpd in November up from 7.491 million bpd in October, according to data seen by Reuters. That would suggest that oil exports from Saudi Arabia in December would fall to about 7.6 million bpd and would further drop to around 7 million in January, according to industry sources, as Riyadh follows through on a global deal to cut supply.       OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday in Vienna to slash oil production by more than the market expected in a bid to shore up prices despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in Vienna this week that the kingdom’s oil exports would be less than 8 million bpd in December, down from “the range of 8.3 million bpd” in November.

2018-12-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - The weakening outlook for oil consumption coupled with rising output from U.S. shale and softer than expected U.S. sanctions on Iran have convinced most traders the market is moving into a period of oversupply. In the run up to last week’s OPEC meeting in Vienna, hedge fund managers had little confidence in the organisation’s ability to cut production by enough to avoid an oversupplied market next year. Fund managers sold another 32 million barrels of Brent futures and options in the week to Dec. 4, bringing total sales over the last 10 weeks to a record 360 million barrels. Funds now hold just over two long positions for every short one, down from a ratio of more than 19:1 at the end of September, and the least-bullish position for 17 months. Bearish short positions have risen to 117 million barrels, up from just 27 million at the end of September, and the largest number since June 2017. Pessimism about the outlook for crude prices was reflected by a similar collapse in sentiment towards middle distillates such as gasoil. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PtIemz) Fund managers sold another 20 million barrels of European gasoil, bringing total sales in the last eight weeks to 82 million barrels. Funds are the least-bullish towards middle distillates since July 2017, according to an analysis of position data from ICE Futures Europe. Middle distillates are heavily geared towards the economic cycle because most distillate fuel oil is used in freight transportation (shipping, railroads, aviation, trucks), manufacturing, mining and farming. So the collapse in sentiment towards distillates is consistent with growing concerns about the outlook for the global economy in 2019. Investors’ fears about the impact of trade tensions and heightened uncertainty on business investment and growth next year is darkening the outlook for distillates just as it is hitting equity markets. Expected oversupply of crude has been reflected in the sharp fall in Brent spot prices since the start of October and the futures curve swinging from backwardation into contango. OPEC and selected non-OPEC countries agreed last week to cut their output by 1.2 million barrels per day during the first six months of 2019 from the level in October 2018. Most of the cuts will come from Saudi Arabia, with smaller contributions likely to come from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman. Other OPEC and non-OPEC countries are unlikely to reduce their output voluntarily by any significant amount so their participation in the agreement is mostly symbolic. The planned production cuts reverse the OPEC+ group’s earlier ramp up in output and should offset the softer enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Iran. By cutting output promptly and aggressively, OPEC+ may be able to avert a large build up in excess oil inventories next year and a collapse in prices similar to 2014/15. In contrast to 2014, Saudi-led OPEC has opted to sacrifice market share in an effort to defend prices at a higher level despite the rapid growth of U.S. shale. But there is little the group can do about the deteriorating economic outlook, which implies the need for a period of lower oil prices to restrain production and stimulate consumption to keep the market balanced. And as the global economy reels from the tariff war between the United States and China, rising interest rates, tightening credit conditions, and a broader economic slowdown, lower oil prices are a necessary part of the economic adjustment process.

2018-12-10,"(Adds new entries) KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change enters the crucial final week in the Polish city of Katowice, the capital of the country’s Silesian coal mining district. The aim of the gathering is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. 1100 GMT - As ministers lock horns on the detail of the text, they might reflect on a statement issued overnight by global investors managing $32 trillion in assets who urged governments to accelerate steps to combat climate change. reut.rs/2C23M6e Separately, it would seem pressure on oil companies to tackle climate change is growing after an activist group for the first time filed a shareholder resolution urging BP to set hard targets for reducing overall carbon emissions. Follow This, a Dutch organisation that spearheaded a number of climate shareholder resolutions at Royal Dutch Shell's AGMs over the past three years said it also filed one with the Anglo-Dutch company for 2019. reut.rs/2Em0mO9 Ministers from around 120 countries start to arrive at the conference and face the task of breaking deadlocks and divisions to achieve the political compromises needed by the end of the week. On Saturday, negotiations tried to clean up a messy text to have a document ready for ministers to wrestle over in the second and final week of the conference. Negotiators say there has been progress, but it is slow and, as ever, finance is a stumbling block. Parties also failed to reach an agreement on whether to “note” or “welcome” the U.N. IPCC report published in October. Saudi Arabia, Russia, the U.S. and Kuwait were against welcoming the report. Ultimately any reference to the IPCC report was removed. Campaigners in Katowice said another weekend of the violent “yellow vests” protests in France shows why a just transition is needed when shaping energy transition policy. “When you look at the demands from the protests in France, it is not pitting climate policy against economic and social policy. It is saying (that) we need to respond to the anxieties people are feeling, the fear people are feeling,” said Camilla Born, senior policy advisor at E3G, a non-governmental organisation, said. French President Emmanuel Macron will address the country on Monday as he seeks to placate “yellow vest” anti-government protesters who wreaked havoc in Paris this weekend. A side event supported by the U.S. administration on Monday afternoon called “Innovative Technologies Spur Economic Dynamism” has been criticised by environmental groups and many countries. “Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants,” said Dan Lashof, Director, World Resources Institute US. “This sideshow in Poland would be laughable if the consequences of climate change weren’t so deadly serious,” he added. The event will feature Wells Griffith, senior director for energy at the National Security Council and Steve Winberg, assistant secretary at the department of energy. “Presentations at the event will show how innovation and investment have led to dramatically lower technology costs, reductions in all types of emissions, greater competitiveness, and access to affordable, modern energy services,” said a senior U.S. administration official. Although highly technical, negotiators say the Katowice talks are an essential follow-up to the Paris Agreement, which agreed on the aim of limiting global warming but did not provide rules on how to achieve that. A U.N. spokesman said a record number — more than 32,800 — had registered to attend the conference.

2018-12-10,"NAIROBI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A Kenyan court on Monday charged senior officials from the state-run oil pipeline and others from the state health insurance fund for abuse of office and economic crimes that led to the loss of billions of shillings from the two institutions. Dozens of Kenyan government officials and business people have appeared in court since May on charges relating to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of shillings from public coffers in a new drive to tackle widespread graft. Joe Sang, the managing director of Kenya Pipeline Company, and five of his colleagues were charged with abuse of office in connection with the loss of funds in the construction of a fuel jetty in western Kenya worth 1.96 billion shillings ($19 million), a figure that exceeded the original budget. Geoffrey Mwangi, the chief executive officer of the National Health Insurance Fund, his predecessor and 16 other officials were also charged with abuse of office an irregular award and extension of a contract in which 1.1 billion shillings was lost. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges. “The charges are generic but not serious,” Ahmednasir Abdullahi, lawyer representing the Kenya Pipeline officials, said in court. “I have instructions to apply for bail and accused should be admitted to reasonable bail terms.” A payments processing company and two of its directors were also charged over receiving the funds that were allegedly lost at the state health insurance fund. They also pleaded not guilty. President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013, but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials.

2018-12-10,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s environmental court on Monday said it will issue its  judgment in one week on whether to allow Vedanta Ltd to re-open its copper smelter, which was closed earlier this year after 13 people died when police fired on protesters.  A panel of experts set up by India’s National Green Tribunal, informally known as the environmental court, in November said authorities in Tamil Nadu state failed to comply with procedures before shutting down the smelter.  A judgment on the smelter will be uploaded on the court’s website in a week’s time, Adarsh Kumar Goel, chairman of the National Green Tribunal, said on Monday.  There will be no further hearings on the case, he said.  Last week, C.S. Vaidyanathan, a lawyer for the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, questioned the power of the expert panel to decide that the ban on the smelter in the southern town of Thoothukudi should be lifted.  State authorities had shut down the Tamil Nadu plant in May after police fired on protesters calling for its closure over concerns it was polluting air and water. Vedanta’s lawyer Aryama Sundaram last week told the court the company would invest 1 billion rupees ($14 million) to build hospitals and schools for people living close to the smelter.  The smelter is one of the two largest in India. Resuming production is crucial to Vedanta as it faces rising costs and the impact of a slowing economy on demand for metals and energy.

2018-12-10,"OSLO (Reuters) - Equinor’s (EQNR.OL) Mongstad oil refinery on Norway’s west coast evacuated 300 workers and halted part of its gasoline production following a leak, the company said on Monday. The spill of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) led to an emergency shutdown of the refinery’s naphtha-making unit, however there were no injuries, Equinor spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said. “Part of the gasoline production has stopped as a consequence, not all,” she said. The company declined to specify how much of its output had been stopped and how much of the facility’s operations were still working. Local police and the fire service confirmed earlier that the leak had been stopped. Mongstad is Equinor’s largest refinery and has a crude oil and condensate distillation capacity of 226,000 barrels per day, according to the company. In October 2017, Mongstad suffered a two-week outage caused by a naphtha leak. In August, the oil refinery halted production due to a power outage.

2018-12-10,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The South African government needs to “bite the bullet” and bail out struggling state-run power firm Eskom, which has asked for 100 billion rand (5.5 billion pounds) in government support, the chief executive of Rothschild & Co in South Africa told Reuters. Rothschild advised Eskom in 2008 when it last received a major cash injection from government. At the time, Eskom sought 115 billion rand, but was granted a 60 billion rand loan which was later converted into equity. Eskom has implemented controlled power cuts for much of the past week, which could erode support for the ruling African National Congress at next year’s national election. Opinion is divided on whether Eskom, which provides more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power but was embroiled in corruption scandals under its previous management, should be bailed out again. Rothschild’s Martin Kingston said in an interview that recapitalising Eskom could cost the country its last investment grade credit rating but that there was “no other obvious solution” if Eskom was to survive. “The government knows that putting money into Eskom is going to exacerbate a downgrade scenario. But I think it is going to have to bite that bullet,” Kingston said. “The level of debt on Eskom’s balance sheet is completely unsustainable.” Eskom’s debt has ballooned from around 106 billion rand to more than 419 billion rand over the past decade, while electricity sales have fallen. Eskom executives told investors on a roadshow last week they wanted the state to take on 100 billion rand of the company’s debt. But Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is yet to approve the proposal and has said the state cannot afford to continue “pouring money” into loss-making state firms. President Cyril Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority since taking office in February, but the scale of its financial difficulties has made progress slow. Kingston said the government had kicked the can down the road by not providing Eskom with more funds in 2008 and that restructuring the utility could take three to five years.

2018-12-10,"* US-China trade tensions flare again * European stocks open lower * Dollar drops after soft US jobs data * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout, changes byline, dateline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Losses on global stocks snowballed on Monday, with European markets following Asian peers lower as fresh signs emerged of slowing growth worldwide and fears grew that simmering U.S.-China tensions would torpedo chances of a trade deal. Wall Street was set to open lower, futures indicated, after New York-listed shares posted their biggest weekly decline since March. “Another day, another reason to sell risk. Equity markets remain in a world of pain with everyone in search of a very elusive silver lining,” said Stephen Innes at brokerage OANDA MSCI’s all-country index has spent four weeks in the red, despite intermittent rallies fuelled by hopes of trade war detente. The pessimism has been exacerbated by data showing the world’s largest economies — the United States, China, Japan and Germany — are all headed for slower growth. That pushed the index 0.5 percent lower, while a pan-European index fell almost one percent by 0930 GMT and U.S. equity futures  were down 0.5 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session. Last week’s arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States was seen putting up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer said Sunday there was a “hard deadline” to the 90-day trade ceasefire and without a successful end to talks by March 1, Washington would impose new tariffs on Chinese goods. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Economic data has disappointed, too, underscoring the impact of the trade wars on the world economy. Following weak trade and inflation data on the weekend, China posted far weaker-than-expected November exports and imports, reinforcing expectations Beijing will roll out more stimulus to prevent the economy cooling too fast. However, the yuan sagged to a one-week low after the weak data. “(The data) would suggest China woes go well beyond U.S. tariffs, given that China trade surplus to the U.S. was at a record level. One can only imagine the impact on China terms of trade if the U.S. follows through with a 25 percent tariff,” Innes of OANDA said. Japan posted the worst contraction in over four years in the third quarter as uncertainty over global demand and trade saw companies slashing capital spending. MSCI’s index of Asian equities outside Japan slid 1.5 percent to a near three-week low, Shanghai shares retreated 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.1 percent. Emerging-market stocks lost 1.3 percent. Asia’s data came after investors were spooked last week by below-forecast industrial output numbers in Germany and U.S. jobs data showing employers hired fewer workers than expected in November. The slowdown signs also have pummelled oil prices, which have slumped around 30 percent since early October. Brent futures rose 0.2 percent to $61.90 a barrel after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers announced a supply cut. The U.S. jobs data weakened the dollar by convincing many that U.S. growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve will pause its rate tightening sooner than previously thought. Last week, the dollar posted its worst performance since August against a basket of currencies. The dollar was a touch firmer on Monday but stayed near two-week lows. The euro rose 0.3 percent at $1.1418. European investors were keeping their eyes on events in Britain and France. Sterling inched lower, heading back towards 17-month lows hit last week versus the dollar, as British Prime Minister Theresa May’s European Union divorce deal looks set to be rejected by parliament in a Tuesday vote. While that raises fears of a chaotic exit in March, those hoping for a no-Brexit outcome were encouraged by a ruling from the EU’s top court that Britain can revoke its decision to leave the bloc without the consent of other EU members. France, meanwhile, suffered a fourth weekend of anti-government riots, which the finance minister said could curb economic growth by 0.1 percentage point. French hotel, transport and retail stocks fell. The yield premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German peers rose to the highest since May . President Emmanuel Macron, already forced to row back on fuel tax increases, will make a televised address at 1900 GMT. “Concern about a bit of political and fiscal capitulation is rarely good for a bond market,” said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James.

2018-12-10,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them.  1/ CURVE-BALLS With major parts of the U.S. economy visibly slowing, the Treasury market has reacted in a striking manner - the 10-year yield is close to falling below the two-year yield, which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last 40 years. Signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year.   But wait. Inflation is running at a 9-month high, annual wage growth a 9-1/2 year high and unemployment at a near-50 year low. So November inflation, due on Dec. 12, will play into how Fed chair Jerome Powell frames the path of future tightening. So it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here. There are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert. Depending on how the incoming data looks - stagflation, anyone? - the Fed’s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear.  (For a graphic on 'Inflationary Pressures' click tmsnrt.rs/2REoChx) (For a graphic on 'U.S. Yield Curve' click tmsnrt.rs/2zUqXiW) Buckle up for another wild week of Brexit may-hem on sterling and other UK-focused markets. Britain’s parliament is - at the time of writing at least - set to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit transition deal on Tuesday, but the chances of it being approved don’t look good. What happens then is... well that’s the thing, there are multiple possibilities, all with very different implications. A really heavy defeat would make it difficult for May to carry on. She has staggered through the last couple of years, taking direct hits from all angles but this could finally bring her down. Could that then lead to a hard Brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal? Perhaps and sterling won’t like that one bit. But it’s equally possible that whoever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the so-called Article 50 notice. That could even raise the chances of a second public Brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring. (For a graphic on 'Sterling positions and valuations' click tmsnrt.rs/2QkcsxI) Thursday marks the end of an era for the ECB, which is set to formally announce the end of its three-year long, 2.6 trillion-euro monetary stimulus scheme. For markets, that’s a done deal. What matters now is what the ECB does in the face of a weakening economy, global trade tensions, Brexit and Italy. Policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when QE ends. One suggestion is for multi-year loans to banks.  What investors appear more certain about is that the ECB will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent - especially if a U.S. slowdown encourages the Fed to pause its rate-hike cycle. Money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a 75 pct chance of a ECB rate hike in 2019. But that’s down from 100 percent just a few weeks ago. (For a graphic on 'European Central Bank QE scheme' click tmsnrt.rs/2RzoTCh) So much for the U.S.-China trade truce. If financial markets are any guide, the detente between Washington and Beijing struck over a steak dinner at the G20 in Buenos Aires barely lasted 24 hours. Fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment. On oil markets, that signals that a 30 percent price slump since October has little hope of reversing. Oil has also had to contend with OPEC, whose initial failure to agree an output cut accelerated the price slump. Agreement over a 1.2 million barrels-per-day cuts together with some non-OPEC producers has provided a bit of respite but Brent still remains just over $60. Commodities overall are in some trouble. Copper is near three-week lows, having lost around 15 percent so far in 2018, while most base metals are down a similar amount. And the Australian dollar, a good proxy for commodities, Chinese demand and world trade, was the worst-performing major currency in the world all week. Without good news on the trade front, respite is unlikely. The U.S. trade deficit hit a 10-year high in October, and its politically sensitive deficit with China surged to a record $43 billion. So lets see how China hawks in the Trump administration react to data showing Beijing’s imports from the United States shrank 25 percent from a year earlier, following a 1.8 percent annual decline in October. It appears so far that China may not be carrying out promises to import more from America and that could provide more grist for the mill - for U.S. officials pushing for more reasons to punish China and for investors skeptical of the trade ceasefire.  The prospect of a Chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy. So while trade contributes far less to the country’s GDP than it used to, there are other data points coming up too - credit growth and retail sales among others - which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war.

Speaking about the recent Kirkuk oil deal with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Ghadhban said state oil marketer SOMO had received preferential prices, albeit for low quantities.

2018-12-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global commodity trader Trafigura Group reported its lowest annual net profit in eight years on Monday as a drop in oil trading margins offset a strong performance by its metals and minerals division. Traded volumes at its metals division increased by 37 percent in the financial year that ended on Sept. 30, mainly in coal, which had a “surprisingly strong” year, the company said.  In oil trading, however, Trafigura said the oil structure shift to backwardation, whereby the front month price is higher then the next, compressed margins prompting a “major overhaul” of its books to reduce inventories and storage contracts.  Trafigura’s total earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the financial year rose 8 percent to $1.7 billion (1.34 billion pounds), from 1.6 billion. Gross profit increased to $2.4 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier.  Net profit fell slightly to $873 million from a lacklustre $887 million in 2017 due to low oil volatility, already its lowest since 2010.  Revenues rose to $180.7 billion, from $136.7 billion in its 2017 financial year. Traded oil volumes grew to 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from just over 5.3 million bpd the previous year. Liquefied natural gas volumes rose to 9.9 million tonnes from 8.1 million tonnes.      “The largest component of profit was generated by the Metals and Minerals Trading division in one of its best years [...] Oil and Petroleum Products Trading’s contribution to gross profit fell by 10 percent to $1 billion as a result of the switch from the contango to backwardated oil pricing structure,” the Geneva-based company said in a statement.  Earlier this year the company tripled the size of its management committee and promoted Rob Gillon and Ben Luckock to run the oil division as co-heads alongside Executive Director Jose Larocca.  Ahead of new, cleaner shipping fuel rules being introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2020, Trafigura confirmed it had merged its middle distillates and fuel oil trading teams. It also set up a new bunkering team to develop new business as the fuel change is set to unnerve oil markets.  Trafigura’s adjusted debt to group equity fell below 1 from 1.24 as of Sept. 30 2017.  Share buybacks also fell to $528 million from $569 million.  The company is still paying departing founders, including the family of the late Claude Dauphin, but details on who was paid were not disclosed. The cost of capital increased sharply due to rising interest rates globally. Trafigura’s Chief Financial Officer Christopher Salmon said he expected this trend to continue in 2019.  “The sector has entered a period of consolidation around the very largest players – with banks, for example, becoming more selective in allocating liquidity,” Salmon said in the results.  Trafigura made $191 million on divesting a 50 percent stake in its subsidiary Impala Terminals to IFM Investors.  Impairments included $72 million with zinc, lead producer and smelter Nyrstar. Trafigura recently extended a credit facility worth $650 million to help Nyrstar’s debt situation. It also suffered a pretax loss of $57 million following the sale of a 20 percent stake in Buckeye Texas Partners LLC for $210 million.

2018-12-10,"SEOUL, Dec 10 (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors have charged four people with illegally importing millions of dollars worth of North Korean coal in violation of international sanctions, by trying to disguise it as imports from Russia, a prosecutors’ office said on Monday. South Korea’s customs agency found in August that some firms had imported coal from North Korea in violation of U.N. resolutions aimed at choking off funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The unidentified defendants were charged on Friday with bringing in North Korean coal and other material by “laundering the origin” through fake certificates of origin from Russian ports, after the old route for North Korean coal, through China, was blocked due to sanctions, the Daegu District Public Prosecutors Office said in a statement. “It appears that the defendants wanted profit from arbitrage, using the fact that the prices of North Korean coal and other materials are low due to their difficulty to be traded internationally,” the office said. One of the four, a 44-year-old woman, was arrested for bringing in some 28,962 tonnes of coal and 2,010 tonnes of pig iron from North Korea, worth about 4.3 billion won ($3.83 million) and 1.1 billion won respectively, between April-October 2017, the office said. South Korea’s Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act prohibits the import of North Korean products without special approval from the minister of unification. The woman was also charged with violating customs law by bringing in some 4,156 tonnes of coal briquettes from North Korea, worth about 800 million won, by falsifying customs records to say they were semi coke, the office said. The other three people, who are indicted without arrest, were found to have brought in, or abetted the import of, millions of dollars worth of North Korean coal, pig iron and, or, coal briquettes during that time, the office said. The U.N. Security Council banned North Korea’s sale of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood in August last year in a bid to cut by a third its $3 billion annual export income. It also capped North Korea’s import of crude oil and refined petroleum products in September. The United States has led the sanctions campaign to press North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes, but there have been signs that the U.S. campaign for “maximum pressure” has lost steam since North Korea sought to improve relations with South Korea, China, and the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for an unprecedented summit in Singapore in June to discuss North Korea’s denuclearisation and the easing sanctions. . Trump said this month he expected to met Kim again in January or February.

2018-12-10,"NEW DELHI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Top Indian gas importer Petronet LNG is looking to sign a deal in a year’s time to buy at least 1 million tonnes of U.S. natural gas annually for a period of up to 10 years, as it pushes to diversify its supply sources beyond the Middle East. As part of any deal, the firm could potentially take a stake in a U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, said Petronet’s managing director, Prabhat Singh. “The U.S. market is open compared to other markets where the state is (often) the controller of minerals,” Singh told Reuters late last week. “The U.S. offers lots of opportunities and we would like to explore that properly and make a venture (there),” he said. Petronet currently runs a 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification site at Dahej in the western state of Gujarat and a 5 mtpa plant at Kochi in southern India. It has long-term deals to buy 10 mtpa of LNG, with 8.5 mtpa of that coming from Qatar’s RasGas. Singh said Petronet was in talks with various companies including Tellurian Inc about a potential U.S. deal. Singh had said in November that Petronet and ONGC Videsh were jointly in talks to buy a stake in Tellurian’s proposed Driftwood project in Louisiana. “If the pricing is right then India has appetite for huge volumes,” he said last week. Natural gas accounts for about 6.5 percent of India’s overall energy needs, far lower than the global average. The government wants to lift that to 15 percent in the next few years. “The U.S. market is so developed that niche service providers are available on a shoestring budget, which means less overheads,” Singh said. A glut of natural gas in the United States in the wake of the rapid development of shale fields there has kept benchmark U.S. prices for LNG at almost half Asian levels. Meanwhile, Singh said Petronet was also in talks to invest in exploration and LNG projects in Qatar, as well as continuing to scout for opportunities in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow, with Britain’s FTSE seen dropping 0.7 percent, Germany’s DAX 1.1 percent and France’s CAC 1 percent. Traders returned from the weekend to face a growing wall of worry, with the world’s largest economies — the United States, China and Japan — all reporting weaker-than-expected data which pointed to moderating activity. Investors were also bracing for a Tuesday vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s European Union divorce deal, which looks set to be rejected by parliament, raising fears of a chaotic exit in March. S&P futures and Dow futures both fell 0.7 percent, suggesting more pressure on Wall Street later in the session as investors continue to dump riskier assets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1.5 percent to a near three-week low. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.6 percent. Australian stocks lost 2.2 percent, brushing the lowest level since December 2016, and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.1 percent. Data early in the session showed the economy contracted the most in over four years in the third quarter as companies cut capital spending amid uncertainty over global demand and trade tensions. U.S.-China trade negotiations need to reach a successful end by March 1 or Washington will impose new tariffs, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday, clarifying that there is a “hard deadline” after a week of seeming confusion among President Donald Trump and his advisers. Markets were already reeling from news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States. The arrest could throw up another hurdle to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies. Wall Street’s main indexes fell more than 2 percent on Friday in a broad sell-off, posting their largest weekly percentage drops since March. “The biggest concerns for equity markets currently is the U.S.-China trade conflict and the Huawei incident,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties.” Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping early this month agreed to a temporary truce that delayed a planned Jan. 1. U.S. tariff hike while the two sides negotiate. “Eventually, because it is in both party’s interests, I think some deal will be struck but the process, I suspect, will have many hills and valleys that will impact the markets,” said Mark Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc in Florida. While U.S. officials say the Huawei arrest was a legal matter and not linked to the trade dispute, the move is expected to complicate trade talks. “Even though President Trump said the incident will not derail the talks, the markets should not underestimate the nationalism hype which may create the hurdle for China to make concessions,” wrote strategists at OCBC Bank. The dollar was on the backfoot after Friday’s soft U.S. jobs report raised worries that economic growth has peaked and the Federal Reserve may pause its rate tightening cycle sooner than previously thought. On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said public and private employers hired 155,000 workers in November, fewer than the 200,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters, while the jobless rate held at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 112.42 yen and the euro added 0.5 percent to $1.1437. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies dipped 0.1 percent to 96.424. Dollar weakness helped lift the pound 0.2 percent to $1.2752 , despite the looming Brexit vote in parliament. It had lost 0.5 percent on Friday. The Chinese yuan dipped following weak trade and inflation data over the weekend that added to worries about its slowing economy. China reported far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring faltering global and domestic demand. The downbeat reading reinforced views that Beijing will have to roll out more support and stimulus soon to keep the economy from cooling too fast. Oil prices rose, extending gains from Friday when producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January.

The poll of 40 economists predicted retail inflation sank in November to 2.80 percent from October’s 3.31 percent. Forecasts in the poll, taken between Dec. 4-7, ranged between 2.26 percent and 4.00 percent. If the consensus is realised, the November data will not only mark inflation below the RBI’s medium-term target of 4 percent for a fourth straight month but also be the first time since July 2017 it was below 3 percent. “We expect headline CPI inflation to have slowed...during November in a broad-based manner. Food prices are likely to have continued to remain benign. Transportation costs are also estimated to have softened due to a fall in global crude oil prices,” said Shashank Mendiratta, India economist at ANZ. “Core inflation should have moderated alongside, reflecting easing demand-side pressures in the economy. The softer headline CPI print should provide comfort to the central bank.” Asia’s third-largest economy is slowing, dragged down by lower consumer spending and farm growth and that should also remove any pressure for an increase in interest rates. With energy and food prices, which account for a major chunk of India’s consumer price index basket, falling sharply, the trend of relatively stable inflation over the past two years is expected to continue. While falling food costs is good news for consumers, plunging prices of some vegetables, in a country with a chronic supply problem that is often exacerbated by unpredictable monsoons, is adding to the woes of farmers. The crash in farm prices led to tens of thousands of farmers protesting in the national capital last month, likely worrying for a government going to the polls in six months. Farm prices could rise if the government steps in to buy crops at higher prices, known as minimum support price (MSP), something economists had said could be inflationary. “The upside risk related to MSP has not materialized as anticipated,” said Tushar Arora, economist at HDFC Bank. Food inflation has eased recently, helped by bountiful crop supplies and sales of subsidised foodgrain to nearly two-thirds of India’s 1.3 billion population. “It is food prices that moves the needle on inflation,” said Arjun Nagarajan, economist at SBICAP Securities. “What we don’t know, is whether the demand slack is the dominant variable that is bringing food inflation down, or whether the supply glut is the dominant variable that is bringing it down. For now, it seems that the supply glut is the more dominant variable that is bringing the prices down.” Separately, the poll showed industrial output rose at an annual 5.7 percent pace in October, up from September’s 4.5 percent. It was boosted by infrastructure production - the output at eight core industries - which rose 4.8 percent from a year ago.

2018-12-10,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by OPEC and its allies is “balance”. It’s something everybody in the market says they want, but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there. Boiled down to the basics, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the other producers, most notably Russia, are trying to do with the move to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) is achieve their vision of a balanced market. While what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms, it’s assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be “fair” and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output. What this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain, although it’s likely that OPEC and its allies will take the view that the $60.06 a barrel that Brent crude closed at the day before the Dec. 7 output deal was reached is too low. But it’s also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above $80 a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the OPEC orbit. Brent reached a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3, but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost 34 percent of its value, hitting a trough of $57.50 on Nov. 28, the lowest level in a year. It’s that rapid plunge that led OPEC and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance, and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired, but elusive, state. The market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether OPEC has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise, but not so high that demand is threatened. The initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for OPEC, with Brent jumping as much as $3.67 to $63.73 a barrel during trade on Dec. 7, but eventually it closed at $61.67, up 2.7 percent from the previous day. The nirvana of balance also means that OPEC, and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, have to walk a series of political tightropes. The obvious one is also the most public, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is often criticised for changing his mind on issues, but has been remarkably consistent on one front, namely his desire for lower oil prices. It’s perhaps no surprise that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih singled out U.S. energy companies as winners from the OPEC and allies deal, telling reporters at the meeting in Vienna on Dec. 7 that they were “breathing a sigh of relief”. This was perhaps a not-so-subtle attempt to stave off a blast from Trump on his favoured social media platform Twitter, by reminding him that the powerful U.S. energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices.  The Saudis also have to manage their relationship with the United States carefully in the wake of the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s consulate in October. Trump has said he is not convinced the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder, even as leaders of his own Republican Party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing. A further complicating factor is Iran, which is exempt from the new output-cutting deal, and in theory living on borrowed time given the U.S. waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on April. Given the plethora of competing factors and influences, it would seem balance will be a difficult, if not impossible task in the crude oil market. But how will the success of this latest production cut be measured? If crude remains in a range between $60 and $80 a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the Iran export waivers, then it might be fair to argue that OPEC and its allies will have achieved what they wanted - a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with.

2018-12-10,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.7 pct, Nikkei sheds 2 pct * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Global stocks extended their slump on Monday, with U.S. equity futures and Asian shares sliding on worries over slowing growth and fears that a fresh flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing could quash any chances of a trade deal. Traders returned from the weekend to face a growing wall of worry, with the world’s largest economies — the United States, China and Japan — all reporting weaker-than-expected data which point to moderating activity. S&P futures were down 0.7 percent and the Dow futures lost 0.8 percent early in the Asian day. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.7 percent, stooping to a two-week low. Australian stocks fell 1.7 percent, brushing its lowest level since December 2016, and South Korea’s KOSPI were down 1.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2 percent. Data early in the session showed the economy contracted the most in over four years in the third quarter as capital expenditure tumbled. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s comments that U.S. officials would raise tariff rates on Chinese imports if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period fanned fresh concerns over U.S.-China trade relations. Markets were already reeling on news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies. Wall Street’s main indexes fell more than 2 percent on Friday in a broad sell-off, posting their largest weekly percentage drops since March. “The biggest concerns for equity markets currently is the U.S.-China trade conflict and the Huawei incident,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “The trade theme will preoccupy the markets through the 90-day truce period between the United States and China, waiting for any signs of concession between the parties.” Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. hike of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal. U.S.-China trade negotiations need to reach a successful end by March 1 or new tariffs will be imposed, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Sunday. The dollar was on the backfoot after Friday’s soft U.S. jobs report raised worries that economic growth is moderating and the Federal Reserve may pause its tightening cycle sooner than previously thought. The British pound also was on the defensive as Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal to exit the European Union looks set to be rejected by parliament on Tuesday, while the Chinese yuan dipped in offshore trade following weak trade and inflation data over the weekend. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said public and private employers hired 155,000 workers in November, fewer than the 200,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters, while the jobless rate held at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent. The dollar was down 0.2 percent at 112.50 yen and the euro added 0.25 percent to $1.1409. Other data at the weekend showed China reporting far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring slower global and domestic demand and reinforcing views that Chinese authorities will have to roll out more support and stimulus soon to keep the economy from cooling too much. Oil prices rose, extending gains from Friday when producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. Brent crude edged up 0.2 percent to $61.79 per barrel.

2018-12-10,"(Repeats item published on Dec. 8, no changes in text) BEIJING, Dec 8 (Reuters) - China’s imports of crude oil hit a fresh monthly high in November, customs data showed on Saturday, beating the record set in October on heavy buying from private refiners and trial starts of new mega-refineries. Crude oil arrivals last month rose 8.5 percent compared with the same month a year ago to 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd), marking the first time China imported more than 10 million bpd. October’s imports were 9.61 million bpd. For the first 11 months, China imported 418.11 million tonnes of foreign crude oil, or 9.17 million bpd, putting it on track to make this year a record high for imports. Strong demand is being driven in part by new refineries, such as the 400,000 bpd project operated by major private firm Hengli in northeastern port Dalian that planned test runs last month. Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp is also planning trial runs at some refining units at its 400,000 bpd facility off the archipelago city of Zhoushan at the end of this year, and imported several cargoes of Oman crude in the fourth quarter. The private refiners, known as “teapots”, bought 8.57 million tonnes of crude in November, or 1.94 million bpd, according to Refinitiv Oil Research and Forecast. Zhejiang Petrochemicals received two VLCCs of crude in November while Dalian Hengli received 540,000 tonnes of Arab crude in November, Refinitiv analyst Emma Li wrote in a note on Dec. 5. Meanwhile China’s total natural gas imports rose 25.6 percent year on year to 9.15 million tonnes in November, also a record monthly number, as China’s energy majors boosted imports to meet demand from the second year of a government campaign to switch to cleaner fuels for winter heating. For the first 11 months, gas imports stood at 81.19 million tonnes, up 33.8 percent from last year. Reporting by Meng Meng and Dominique Patton; Editing by Simon

2018-12-10,"KARA-KULJA, Kyrgyzstan, Dec 10 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In a cold, sparsely lit Soviet-era room, sitting close to the heater, Ainura Ibraimjanova taps at her computer. In this rural district in southern Kyrgyzstan, she is the only lawyer providing free legal aid. Just back from court in the Alai district, Ibraimjanova is attending to a stream of clients in thick coats and clutching documents. They are in need of help with alimony, divorce or family land disputes. “The laws have changed considerably since Kyrgyzstan gained its independence, because there was a real gap in legal frameworks and customs - with many people breaching laws in favour of customs,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Land, a scarce and highly-prized resource in this former communist country, is of huge social value, she said, with disputes over it particularly affecting women. “Having or not having a piece of land decides who you are ... It’s a very important matter, especially in a rural area,” said Ibraimjanova. At independence in 1991, when state property was privatised, every citizen was given an equal plot of land, but it was often registered under the name of the male household head. That meant women often missed out on claiming land rights, especially if they got married or divorced, Ibraimjanova said. “According to Kyrgyz tradition, people treat men and women in different ways. If a girl grows up and chooses to take her share of land with her and separate from her big family, this really looks strange in accordance with local tradition and the family is usually opposed to it,” she said. Although courts often rule in favour of women and in accordance with the law, executing such judgments can be arduous and take years, Ibraimjanova said. “There are still many women who need to be supported and whose rights needs to be better protected.” Yet change is coming, even to remote regions like Alai - in part thanks to the “Bus of Solidarity”. The small van bounds along rural roads to bring lawyers, notaries and social workers to remote parts of the country to resolve villagers’ legal quandaries - for free. It is supported by the justice ministry and the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP). On this day, it is headed for the craggy village of Kara-Kulja in southern Kyrgyzstan. Among those waiting in the rain for the bus to arrive was Zoora Jumabaeva. “I learned by chance that the bus was coming today,” Jumabaeva, a first-time user, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. She hoped the lawyers could resolve her complaint with the local bazaar after the new owner raised rents and forcibly removed her stall, which sells medicine for livestock, to a location outside the market. Had the bus not come, Jumabaeva would have had to make an arduous two-hour journey on poor roads to the nearest town, Osh, to seek legal services. In previous years, she would use informal mechanisms such as a council of elders to solve her disputes. But, she said, the fact that their decisions were not legally binding was frustrating. And so, bearing the rain and cold, Jumabaeva huddled at a small desk inside a billowing blue tent to explain her dilemma. “I’m losing my regular income and my family is suffering. I came here today to get some more legal advice on protecting my interests,” she told a lawyer. “There are many other women and young families (at the market) who suffer more than me (from being evicted), as this was their only income source, so I’m trying to act on their behalf to solve a common problem.” The lawyer, Jazgul Kolmatova, who practises in Osh, is no stranger to the Bus of Solidarity having made several journeys. Jumabaeva’s paperwork, she said, was scant. “She came to us with quite a difficult and complex problem, but her case is a fairly common one,” Kolmatova told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as she took down notes. Boarding the bus provides a chance to resolve knotty legal issues that have often been building for years, she said. “I joined the bus of solidarity because I know that the rural population - and especially women - are very poorly educated in legal issues, and I want to make my contribution to changing this situation,” she said. Since the bus began running in 2016 it has visited about 193 villages and carried out more than 7,000 consultations, according to UNDP. But meetings are often brief, and complex cases require follow-up. With a luminous orange hijab wrapped around her hair and fighting back tears, Gulzina Ashimzhanova, 37, said she met Ibraimjanova when the Bus of Solidarity came to her village earlier this year. Ashimzhanova and her five children were made homeless when she left her alcoholic husband, who she said was violent. Ashimzhanova wanted to divorce him and secure her share of the property. “When we went to the village we saw the bus and met Ainura (Ibraimjanova). She told us about this free legal assistance, she explained everything,” she said. “We were consulted from there, then she said to bring the documents and she could help me. She said we could divide the house and get alimony via the court.” Ashimzhanova, who has been clinically depressed, tried to get her share of a house, 5,500 square metres of land and an apple orchard - all registered in her husband’s name. “I need to get a house for my children,” Ashimzhanova said. “I don’t want my rights to be violated.” For Ibraimjanova, the case - though legally clear-cut - carries a heavy social stigma, because Ashimzhanova left her husband and wants an equal share of their common property. “Gulzina (Ashimzhanova) from my point of view is very brave to act like this, and I’m sure her example can inspire many others,” Ibraimjanova said. ""I told her if she does fight for her rights that could set a good example for other women in Kyrgyzstan too - there could be many others who are also shy, and this step of hers could give them a push.""

2018-12-10,"* OPEC to curb supply by 800,000 bpd from January * Group of non-OPEC members led by Russia to cut 400,000 bpd * Fuel demand-growth set to slow next year amid economic woes By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - International oil prices rose on Monday, extending gains from Friday when producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. International Brent crude oil futures were at $61.81 per barrel at 0016 GMT, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. Prices surged on Friday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including heavyweight Russia announced they would cut oil supply by 1.2 million bpd, with an 800,000 bpd reduction planned by OPEC-members and 400,000 bpd by countries not affiliated with the group. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.35 per barrel, 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, below their last close, weighed down as America’s booming oil drilling industry is not taking part in the announced cuts. The OPEC-led supply curbs will be made from January, measured against October 2018 output levels. “Our key conclusion is that oil prices will be well supported around the $70 per barrel level for 2019,” analysts at Bernstein Energy said on Monday. Despite the cuts, that was still a price forecast reduction of $6 per barrel as Bernstein reduced its crude oil demand forecast from 1.5 million bpd previously to 1.3 million bpd for 2019. The slowdown in demand-growth comes on the back of increasing fuel efficiency and because of an economic slowdown. Japan, the world’s third biggest economy and No.4 oil consumer, on Monday revised its third quarter GDP growth down to an annualised rate of -2.5 percent, down from the initial estimate of -1.2 percent. Meanwhile the two world’s biggest economies, the United States and China, are locked in a trade war which is threatening to slow global growth and battering investor sentiment. Despite the announced cuts, Brent crude prices are almost 29 percent below their most recent highs in early October.
