2018-07-12,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Strong global demand for beef and animal feed fattened grain trader Cargill Inc’s profits in fiscal year 2018, which were also boosted by trade tensions and South American weather woes, the company said on Thursday. For the full year, adjusted operating earnings reached $3.2 billion, up 6 percent from fiscal 2017. Company officials said that was the highest ever, excluding earnings from Cargill’s investment in fertilizer producer the Mosaic Company, which it exited in fiscal 2011. The impact of a drought in Argentina, and volatility in financial and commodity markets sparked by trade disputes between the United States and top commerce partners China and Mexico, helped Cargill’s grain trading unit to its strongest fourth-quarter showing in seven years. Years of global oversupply have depressed grains prices and made it difficult for top agricultural grains merchants such as Cargill to turn a profit buying and selling food staples such as corn, soybeans and wheat.  But the drought in Argentina has eaten into the supply glut, while tit-for-tat tariffs have disrupted global grain flows, giving merchants space to profit. Cargill’s Chief Financial Officer Marcel Smits warned that too much volatility could be a problem, however. The company has mapped out plans internally to deal with disruptions to trade, Smits said in an interview Thursday. But the plans could quickly lose relevance, given the speed at which the trade disputes are developing. “We have potentially an advantage in terms of anticipating different scenarios, but it is hard to risk manage yourself through some of that volatility,” Smits said. Over the past fiscal year, the demand for protein and animal feed was the biggest boost to Cargill’s bottom line. U.S. beef packer margins have hit historic highs due to low cattle prices and strong retailer appetite heading into America’s summer grilling season. Global demand for all proteins – whether from meat and poultry, or aquaculture and plants – is booming in emerging markets in Asia and Africa, in part due to rising incomes, industry analysts say.   Cargill has steadily expanded its portfolio in the sector in recent years, from investing in U.S. pea protein production to buying Pollos El Bucanero SA, one of Colombia’s largest meat producers. In its traditional crop businesses, Cargill’s soy crush margins have improved worldwide, Smits said.  Cargill’s net earnings rose to $711 million in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $347 million a year earlier.

2018-07-12,"RIO DE JANEIRO, July 12 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has named Mariano Vela, a geologist with 20 years of experience at the U.S. oil major, to oversee its Brazil operations, the company told Reuters on Thursday, as it expands in Latin America’s top producer. A letter seen by Reuters on Thursday and signed by former Brazil country manager Javier La Rosa on June 19 said Vela would take the reins in Brazil at the beginning of July. In an emailed statement, Chevron confirmed the appointment of Vela. Chevron, which had global revenues of $135 billion in 2017, has been growing its presence in Brazil. In a consortium with Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , it clinched its first block in Brazil’s coveted offshore pre-salt oil play last month. The world’s top oil companies have spent billions in recent months amid rising oil prices and shrunken reserves to lock in access to the promising area, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Vela joined Chevron in 1998 and studied geology in Argentina and the United States, Chevron said. Vela’s LinkedIn profile says he is Chevron’s Global Earth Science Sponsor based in Houston, Texas. La Rosa was transferred to Venezuela as country manager in June after a two-year stint in Brazil, following the months-long detention in Venezuela of two Chevron executives. La Rosa wrote in the letter, which was addressed to a recipient outside the company who declined to be named, that his tenure marked “a period of important restructuring and growth of our sector.” “We are very enthusiastic about the five new blocks that we just acquired in the last two tenders,” he added.

2018-07-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude strengthened late on Thursday, recouping some of its losses from the previous session, as market focus returned to concerns about spare capacity following a warning from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Brent crude oil gained $1.05 a barrel to settle at $74.45, rebounding from a session low of $72.67. On Wednesday, the global benchmark slumped $5.46, or 6.9 percent, its biggest one-day fall in two years. U.S. crude settled down 5 cents at $70.33 a barrel, after losing 5 percent the previous session. The IEA cautioned the world’s oil supply cushion “might be stretched to the limit” due to production losses in several different countries. Ongoing concerns about supply disruptions from OPEC member Venezuela drove crude higher, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management.  “Production issues there today were a reminder that those issues are ongoing,” he said. Several countries have seen their output fall in recent weeks, including Venezuela, Norway, Canada and Libya.   “Rising production from Middle East Gulf countries and Russia, welcome though it is, comes at the expense of the world’s spare capacity cushion, which might be stretched to the limit,” the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report. “This vulnerability currently underpins oil prices and seems likely to continue doing so,” the agency said. At the same time, the U.S. has ramped up its rhetoric on sanctions against OPEC member Iran, contributing to rising prices, Kilduff said.  Wednesday’s sharp selloff was galvanized by worries over rising trade tensions between the United States and China and news that Libya had brought some production back online. The declines have not spurred buyers to return yet, after traders sold speculative positions on Wednesday. Libya’s National Oil Corp said it would reopen four oil export terminals, ending a standoff that had shut down most of Libya’s oil output; the reopening will bring back up to 850,000 barrels per day of crude production. The market also expects stockpiles at the U.S. oil delivery hub to fall, traders said, citing energy information provider Genscape. Supply to the U.S. market has also been squeezed by the loss of some Canadian oil production. Brent still may recover to above $80 a barrel by the end of the year, said Brian LaRose, a senior technical analyst at ICAP-TA. If Brent pulls to below $70 a barrel, that reduces the possibility the market will recover as quickly, he said.

2018-07-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of the Interior said on Thursday it would hold a record-sized auction for oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico next month, in an attempt to spark interest in offshore  drilling months after a similar sale received a weak response from energy companies.  The sale, to be held on Aug. 15, includes all available unleased areas in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in about 78 million acres (31.5 million hectares) off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. It is the third sale in the agency’s 2017-2022 program, which aims to hold 10 sales in all.  The sale is part of what the Interior Department calls President Donald Trump’s America-First Offshore Energy Strategy. Vincent DeVito, an adviser to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, said the sale “is just one piece of the administration’s comprehensive effort to secure our nation’s energy future.”  The last Gulf of Mexico lease sale, held in March, brought in only $124.8 million, as just 1 percent of the then-record 77 million acres (31.2 million hectares) offered found bidders. In addition, nearly all the purchases showed big drillers stuck closest to existing operations. In April, Zinke, who had earlier proposed opening up nearly all the country’s coasts to drilling, said the sale in March held “modest to little” interest from drillers and added there was little likelihood for strong demand elsewhere in the country. His plan to open up the Pacific and Atlantic coasts was criticized by environmentalists, politicians and tourism and fishing interests. The U.S. government estimates the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico contains about 48 billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and 141 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered technically recoverable gas. Most of the recent U.S. oil boom has occurred onshore, where it is cheaper to drill than in deepwater. In addition, many drillers are exploring in other places, such as Mexico, where energy reforms have brought in billions of dollars in investments.

2018-07-12,"MONTREAL/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A U.S. push for new global standards to kickstart its fledgling supersonic jet industry is facing resistance by European nations that want tough rules on noise, according to documents and people familiar with the situation. Fifteen years after Concorde’s last flight, U.S. regulators are weighing rule changes to allow testing of early-stage supersonic jets, amid plans for American-made business and small passenger jets due in service by the mid-2020s. (Full Story) But the new industry could face delays at the United Nations aviation agency where the United States and European countries - including France, Germany and Britain - are squaring off over new noise rules needed for the jets to fly, five sources told Reuters, speaking about confidential talks on condition of anonymity. The previously unreported dispute follows a 1990s clash on noise standards, when the European Union wanted to ban noisy older U.S.-made jets like the Boeing 727 from its airports and Washington threatened to retaliate by banning the Anglo-French Concorde. This latest round pits U.S. ambitions for an American-led revival of supersonic jets by start-ups Aerion Supersonic, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace against European fears of disruptive noise from the planes. Aerion, backed by Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N and GE GE.N, is considered by industry sources as the most advanced of the supersonic projects. For a FACTBOX on the players, click (Full Story) Boom will be making its first appearance at the Farnborough Airshow next week as it looks to cement the revival of the supersonic industry, which is struggling to design jets that meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints. “The politics are that Europe is way more worried about noise (around airports),” said an industry source familiar with the matter. “Europe has a problem but they have no reason to solve (it) because they have no industry pushing for this.” That’s a reversal of disputes which delayed the beginning of Concorde’s transatlantic services in the 1970s, as first the U.S. Congress and then the New York Port Authority banned it due to noise. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flights over U.S. land since 1973. For now, the new jets plan to stick to over-water routes, though the FAA will eventually decide whether to allow overland flights after analysing data from NASA in a study by 2025. Both Boeing BA.N and Airbus AIR.PA have mapped out futuristic visions for ultra-fast air travel. But since the demise of Boeing’s planned near-supersonic Sonic Cruiser in 2002, the world’s two largest planemakers have focused on slower, fuel-efficient planes that allow airlines to lower ticket prices. Now, U.S. startups are working to develop quieter and more fuel-efficient supersonic planes than Concorde, aimed at business travellers. They claim these can be economically viable with the right engine. They also pledge to dampen the famous sonic boom which depressed Concorde’s sales and restricted its operations until it was grounded for economic reasons in 2003. The United Nations’ Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which sets many global standards, has started looking at supersonic jets by seeking technical information from planemakers. ICAO will then be in a better position to assess options for standards on noise and emissions, and “how long the process should take,” a spokesman said. While the aviation industry prefers to have common international rules developed through ICAO, the FAA said on Thursday it is also looking at domestic noise requirements. “In the event of a delay in the adoption of international standards, the FAA will need to establish noise regulations for domestic certification,” it said. The European countries think current noise limits should be used as “guidelines” for developing landing and take-off rules, according to a document presented to a recent ICAO committee meeting and seen by Reuters. The United States, echoing industry’s demand, has called for new standards that reflect “fundamental differences” between subsonic and supersonic jets, according to a second document. “You can’t try to shoehorn a supersonic aircraft into a subsonic standard,” said Mike Hinderberger, Aerion senior vice president of aircraft development at an industry conference last month. (Full Story) Aerion declined to comment further. It’s not yet clear how other countries see supersonics or whether ICAO could craft a compromise. Lengthy delays by ICAO would likely force planemakers to hold off, or risk investing millions in a design that “no one will certify,” said a U.S. industry source. “It’s a chicken and egg argument,” added the first industry source. “How can you bring a plane to market if you don’t have the standards to meet?” Noise standards “need to be defined as soon as practicable so that manufacturers have certainty,” said the FAA. “The sooner the agencies finalise guidelines and standards, the sooner we can ensure our design meets those requirements,” said Vik Kachoria, CEO of Boston-based Spike Aerospace, which hopes to select an engine for its jet early next year. The European nations, however, are seeking robust data. In a separate document on emissions, they said they do not expect new standards “before 2025 or later” because of insufficient data. Boom CEO Blake Scholl said he had faith that the international community would ultimate reach agreement on supersonic noise standards, due in part to customer demand to get to destinations faster. “Supersonic flight will be a critical driver of human progress, and we believe Europe’s citizens will embrace it,” he said. “We know noise is a sensitive issue, and we are designing with that in mind.” Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Jamie Freed in Singapore; additional reporting by Julia Fioretti in Brussels and Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Tim Hepher and Edward Tobin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/airplane-supersonic-usa/exclusive-u-s-and-europe-clash-over-global-supersonic-jet-noise-standards-idUKL1N1U81ND,12 Jul 2018,"* U.S. companies Aerion, Boom, Spike developing supersonic

2018-07-12,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Donald Trump gave an angry ultimatum to European allies on Thursday, warning a NATO summit the United States could withdraw its support and sparking crisis talks which the U.S. president said produced big new defence spending pledges. Other leaders, however, played down the extent to which they went beyond existing commitments to increase contributions to their own defence, as Trump demanded they share more of what he calls an unfair burden on U.S. taxpayers in funding an alliance focused on discouraging pressure from a resurgent Moscow. In a closed-door meeting with NATO leaders, Trump said that if European governments did not spend more on defence, the United States “would have to look to go its own way”, according to one diplomatic source present in the room. Trump delivered the line after what several sources said was an improvised rant focussed on his grievances about transatlantic ties, but appeared to hesitate before issuing his ultimatum, which led to some confusion about what he really meant. French President Emmanuel Macron and others said they did not hear in Trump’s warning a direct threat to quit NATO — though the words did cause alarm — and Trump himself later said such a move would be “unnecessary”.  The early morning drama was part of two days of diplomatic theatre in Brussels, as allies tried to shield a post-war world order from his “America first” demands. It was unclear anything concrete changed, although NATO’s chief Jens Stoltenberg spoke of a “new sense of urgency”. A month after he walked out of a G7 economic summit amid rows about new U.S. tariffs that have provoked fears of global trade war, Trump was already at the centre of a storm from the start of the NATO summit on Wednesday.  He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of being beholden to Moscow due to energy imports, while letting Americans pay for protecting Germany from Russia. That tension seemed to calm during a gala dinner but that did not last. Trump tweeted out more of his anger overnight, saying billions of dollars in new spending by NATO allies since last year “isn’t nearly enough”. When the summit resumed for a session with the leaders of non-members Ukraine and Georgia, Trump failed to appear for nearly an hour, officials said. And when he did, he soon used his turn to speak to stray from the scheduled topic and to return to his budget complaints in even stronger language. People present said he raged that allies, notably Germany, did not make vast increases in their defence budgets. Pledges to spend 2 percent of national income on defence by 2024 must be met by January, he said — a dizzying idea for many countries which currently spend just half that. Another NATO diplomat said Trump trampled on protocol by pointing at some leaders he said were not spending enough and addressing Merkel by her first name, referring to her as “you, Angela”. Stoltenberg, stepping in — not for the first time — as peacemaker between Trump and the other 28, called a special closed-door session, the first in a decade, with most officials and the invited guests ushered out, to allow the alliance’s principal leaders to remonstrate with Trump. Merkel, facing domestic political opposition to pushing defence spending up from 1.2 percent of GDP, said she explained to Trump how much was already being done. NATO has spent an extra $90 billion on defence since 2015, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Macron said he had just agreed a 2019 budget with parliament so changing it was unrealistic — a point Trump later said he had accepted though he still expected all members to hit the 2 percent target in the next years, and then possibly double that. “I let them know that I was extremely unhappy,” an ebullient Trump told reporters afterwards. But he added that the talks had ended on good terms: “Everybody in that room got along and they agreed to pay more and they agreed to pay it more quickly.” In a characteristically freewheeling news conference at NATO headquarters, covering his impending visit to Britain, talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, Iran, China, and his father and mother’s European roots, Trump also returned to a favoured theme. He linked calls for higher defence spending to complaints about Germany’s trade surplus and renewed a threat to raise tariffs on EU-made cars if trade terms do not change. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian premier who Trump said gave him “total credit” for a successful summit, told reporters: “We had a very frank and open discussion ... That discussion has made NATO stronger. It has created a new sense of urgency.” Merkel was among those, however, who gave little indication that anything concretely new had been pledged by those present. “The American president demanded what has been discussed for months, that there is a change in the burden-sharing. I made clear that we are on this path,” she said, a day after having to challenge Trump’s suggestion German imports of Russian gas meant that her country was “totally controlled by Russia”. Macron said France, which last year spent 1.8 percent on defence, would meet the target by the 2024 deadline. For many of those present, Trump’s demands that they move closer to the 3.6 percent of GDP Washington spends on the world’s most powerful military make little sense. “Even if we had the money, what would spend it on?” one NATO diplomat said. “In the case of Germany, a lot of European countries would be very uncomfortable with that level of spending,” the diplomat added — a nod to the World War Two aggression that was to lead to NATO’s creation. “It would be armed to the teeth.” Additional reporting by Sabine Siebold, Phil Stewart and Humeyra Pamuk in Brussels and John Walcott in Washington; Writing by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Peter Graff and Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nato-summit/update-8-trump-claims-nato-victory-after-ultimatum-to-go-it-alone-idUKL8N1U8151,12 Jul 2018,"* U.S. President ""forcibly"" renewed demand allies up

2018-07-12,"TORONTO/OTTAWA, July 12 (Reuters) - Having cut interest rates in 2015 to counter the oil slump, the Bank of Canada is now looking for a handoff from housing to energy as a source of growth, hoping higher prices can cushion the impact global trade tension has on exports and investment. The central bank raised rates on Wednesday for the fourth time since July 2017, bring borrowing costs to 1.50 percent -about halfway back from ultra-low levels of 2015 to a neutral rate that neither boosts nor hinders growth. The Bank of Canada estimates the neutral rate as between 2.50 and 3.50 percent. With business investment and consumer confidence both under threat from a tit-for-tat tariff fight between Canada and the United States, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz has been pleasantly surprised at a faster-than-expected rebound in oil exports in the first half of 2018, alongside higher prices. More investment in Canada’s energy sector should come hand-in-hand with planned pipeline expansion, including TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL, Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain and Enbridge Inc’s Line 3, just in time to fuel broader economic growth as the country’s long consumer and housing boom feels the pinch of rising rates. “We are selling our exports at a more rapidly rising price than we are paying for imports, so this time we’re importing an income lift,” said Derek Holt, vice President of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. “That should carry some trickle-down benefits to consumption and investments.” With U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs expected to cut Canadian exports in the coming quarters, the robust U.S. economy and its appetite for Canadian resources are just what Poloz needs to justify further rate hikes - though relying on the boom-and-bust oil sector can be a roller-coaster. Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said higher oil prices will help - but that stronger U.S. growth is the crucial factor. Even if Canada is getting a smaller slice through exports, America’s pie is getting bigger. Stronger investment and exports have already started to reduce Canada’s reliance on household spending to fuel growth, while money markets see a roughly 60 percent chance of another rate hike by December. “We are really not in the camp where there is a natural pause at halftime where they go and get their orange slices and relax,” Chandler said of the bank’s path to further hikes.

2018-07-12,"UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Reuters) - The United States is trying to rally enough votes at the United Nations Security Council to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan following continued fighting and human rights abuses, diplomats said on Thursday. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States. The council could vote as early as Friday. Diplomats said Washington has secured at least seven votes, but some council members say the timing is not right given attempts to revitalize the peace process. The U.S. mission to the United Nations was not immediately available to comment. South Sudan, which split off from its northern neighbor Sudan in 2011, has been gripped by a civil war since 2013 caused by political rivalry between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar. Last Friday the government and opposition signed an agreement on security arrangements which follow on from a ceasefire deal last month. However, on Thursday South Sudan’s parliament voted to extend Kiir’s mandate until 2021 in a move likely to undermine the peace talks as opposition groups have said the change would be illegal. At the end of May, the Security Council renewed its targeted sanctions regime on South Sudan until July 15 and said it would consider an arms embargo and blacklisting six senior South Sudan officials if U.N. chief Antonio Guterres reported by June 30 that there was still conflict or a lack of a viable political agreement. That resolution was adopted with nine votes in favor and six abstentions. “There have been credible reports of fighting,” Guterres told the Security Council in a June 29 letter. He also said U.N. peacekeepers had documented gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. “While the outcome of regional and international efforts to deliver a political settlement of the conflict is yet unclear, I must reiterate that any revitalized agreement must be inclusive, fair and sustainable,” Guterres wrote. The U.N. human rights office said on Tuesday that at least 232 civilians were killed and 120 women and girls raped in “scorched earth” attacks by South Sudan government troops and aligned forces in opposition-held villages earlier this year.

2018-07-12,"(Recasts) By Jarrett Renshaw and Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on Thursday unanimously rejected a petition by Buckeye Partners to reverse a western portion of the Laurel product pipeline that connects Philadelphia area refiners to the Pittsburgh market. The partial reversal of the traditional westward flow on of the 350-mile (563-km) pipeline to bring 40,000 barrels per day of fuels, including gasoline and diesel, to Pennsylvania would have given Midwest refiners like Marathon Petroleum Corp and Husky Energy  greater access to the Pittsburgh market, while essentially cutting off their East Coast peers. Midwest refiners have added nearly 500,000 barrels of daily refining capacity in the last 10 years, tailoring their systems to run crude out of Canada and North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field. The investments have increased fuel production, creating a need for new markets. The five-member commission agreed with a previous administrative law judge opinion that said the partial reversal threatened consumers and the state’s two East Coast refineries. Buckeye argued there was more demand from Midwest refiners than from East Coast refiners for pipeline capacity, so reversing the line made the most commercial sense. “The company did not provide any evidence that it couldn’t achieve the same goals by increasing rates,” PUC Chairwoman Gladys M. Brown said before casting her vote to reject the petition. The vote ends Buckeye’s bid at the state level to partially reverse the line, but it recently submitted a slightly different petition to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In that petition Buckeye is now proposing to allow the western section of the pipeline to move in both directions, though not at the same time, giving East Coast refiners limited access to the Pittsburgh market. In a statement, Buckeye said they disagree with the PUC decision and still believe it would provide state consumers with greater access to cheaper fuels. “Bi-directional service will enhance competition and provide shippers and suppliers with more options,” the company said. Buckeye requested that FERC act on the petition no later than July 16, and FERC has not yet ruled on the issue. Some Philadelphia-area refiners such as Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Delta Air Lines subsidiary Monroe Energy opposed the reversal, saying it would harm their business and lead to closures. Buckeye argues that Midwest shippers and refiners have urged expansion of its pipeline network into central Pennsylvania, the company said in the FERC petition.

2018-07-12,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - He came. He raged. He claimed victory. He left. President Donald Trump brought his chaotic style of governing to the NATO summit in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday, irritating and befuddling allies with charges and jibes before declaring success for convincing his counterparts to pay more for their mutual defence. It was a classic performance for the one-time reality television star, whose “America first” mantra has translated into a sometimes-bullying style on the world stage, particularly with countries traditionally considered to be U.S. friends. Even before the NATO summit was underway, he kicked off the summit with a broadside against Germany over plans for a natural gas pipeline with Russia and he stepped up his criticism of the alliance as a whole for not taking more of the financial burden off the United States. He reinforced that tension through critical tweets, even as he held polite talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the summit and made nice with other world leaders at a reception on Wednesday night. “He was in a good mood, he said Europe was a continent he appreciated,” Luxembourg’s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said of Trump at the evening event, at which leaders enjoyed an acrobatic display and saxophone music in a Brussels park. But the next morning, the bad guy persona was back, prompting the first formal NATO crisis meeting since 2008 in which Trump aired his grievances in a leaders-only, unscripted session over the funding issue again, diplomats said. One diplomat said something appeared to have irritated Trump, a suggestion from another leader or possibly a report in the news media that he had not gotten his way.  When he took the floor in the amphitheatre-like North Atlantic Council room for a session with non-NATO members Georgia and Ukraine, Trump began a 10-minute tirade, which several diplomats said became a rage. He made very clear attacks against Germany and warned that if NATO countries did not meet a goal of raising their defence spending to two percent of their national GDP by January 2019, the United States would go it alone. That outburst prompted NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to ask Ukraine and Georgia to leave the room and, in a closed session, to try to get the carefully-choreographed summit back on track. Trump continued his now familiar verbal attacks, saying too many U.S. presidents had failed to get Europeans to spend more on defence and that he wanted immediate results. But French President Emmanuel Macron, with whom Trump is friendly, fought back and said the allies had to stick to the previously-agreed-upon 2024 target for their defence spending increases. He could not change France’s budget for next year, which he had just presented to parliament.  Merkel said it was “completely impossible” to meet the  commitments by January in the crisis session that Trump himself later publicly described as “tough for a while”.  “It wasn’t easy for Merkel and the Germans to be treated as a villain,” said a NATO diplomat, adding that the overall mood within the organisation was that this was “the new normal.”  By the end of that meeting, despite the pushback, Trump felt victorious.  During a hastily-convened news conference at NATO headquarters, the president declared that all was well and he believed in NATO. He said he was proud that his intervention had prodded other nations to step up their spending.  And with his free-wheeling opinions on Britain’s exit from the European Union at that news conference, Trump even forced British Prime Minister Theresa May into a public defence of her policies and to come out to speak to reporters, diplomats said.   “We’ve had a very amazing two-day period in Brussels,” Trump told reporters. “Everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment. They’re going to up it at levels that they’ve never thought of before.” In fact, allies had agreed to stick to the goals that had already been set before Trump became president and which NATO officials say have much more to do with fear of Russia than of the U.S. president. But Trump was satisfied, at least for the time being. “And now we’re very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong NATO, much stronger than it was two days ago,” he said.

2018-07-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. soybean supplies were forecast to rise to the highest ever as a trade war with China, the world’s largest buyer of the oilseed, will cut into exports, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday. USDA, in its monthly supply and demand report, pegged soybean ending stocks for the 2018/19 crop year at 580 million bushels, up from its estimate of 385 million bushels issued a month ago before China imposed tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans. If realized, that would surpass the previous record of 574 million bushels of soybeans left over at the end of the 2006/07 crop year. Analysts’ estimates in a Reuters survey had pegged 2018/19 soybean ending stocks in a range from 390 million bushels to 571 million bushels.   The government cut its export projections for soybeans by 250 million bushels to 2.040 billion bushels. “They kind of ripped the Band-Aid off,” said Ted Seifried, analyst with Zaner Ag Hedge. “That is an aggressive move from the USDA.” It was the second biggest monthly cut to soybean exports. In August 2012, USDA cut its soybean export forecast by 260 million bushels as a drought lowered production potential. USDA also lowered its end stocks outlook for the 2017/18 crop year, which ends on Aug. 31, to 465 million bushels from 505 million bushels, due to increases in demand by crushers and higher exports in the current marketing year. USDA also raised its outlook for the 2018/19 soybean harvest to 4.310 billion bushels, up 30 million bushels from its previous outlook. It left its yield forecast unchanged at 48.5 bushels per acre. For corn, USDA pegged the 2018/19 harvest at 14.230 billion bushels, in line with analysts’ estimates, and up from the 14.040 billion bushels it predicted in June. It left the corn yield outlook unchanged at 174.0 bushels per acre. USDA pegged 2018/19 domestic corn ending stocks at 1.552 billion bushels, near the low end of market forecasts and down from its June projection of 1.577 billion bushels. It boosted its corn export outlook by 125 million bushels to 2.225 billion bushels but lowered the forecast for ethanol use. It cut its 2017/18 corn ending stocks view to 2.027 billion bushels, below the low end of market forecasts, also due to increased export demand.

2018-07-12,"* Trump doesn’t like planned pipeline to Germany * Has criticised German energy reliance on Russia * Kremlin says Trump trying to push U.S. LNG on Europe (Adds comments by U.S. Secretary of Energy Perry) By Andrew Osborn MOSCOW, July 12 (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Thursday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump’s description of Germany as a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, saying his statement was part of a U.S. campaign to bully Europe into buying American energy supplies. Trump told Germany at a NATO summit in Brussels on Wednesday that it was wrong to support an $11-billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet NATO targets for defence spending. Trump’s comments came ahead of his summit on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, though the Kremlin said they were unlikely to have an impact on what was always going to be a difficult meeting due to the number of disagreements between the two countries. Russia is keen to press ahead with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline since it has the potential to double its gas exports under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine with which it has poor relations. However Washington opposes the project, and a spokesman for the U.S. State Department told Reuters on Wednesday that Western firms invested in the pipeline were at risk of sanctions. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump’s statement marked an escalation of a U.S. campaign to talk down Russian gas supplies to Europe in an attempt to push the U.S. energy sector instead. “As for Germany’s dependence (on Russia) as a major gas buyer we cannot agree with this premise,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call. “Supplies of pipeline gas do not lead to dependence of one country on another but to complete mutual dependence. That is a guarantee of stability and future development.” Peskov said Moscow regarded U.S. objections to the new pipeline as “unfair competition” aimed at trying to force European countries to buy costlier U.S. liquefied natural gas. “We consider that it’s a question of economic competition and that ... the buyers must take their own decision,” he said. Speaking in Brussels, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry said he had not heard any of his EU counterparts talk positively about Nord Stream 2 and said Washington didn’t like it because it didn’t promote diversity of supply. “The president is pretty straightforward about what he believes and he thinks Nord Stream 2 is not in the European Union’s best interest and my bet is he’ll be more than happy to tell President Putin that straight to his face,” said Perry. Five Western firms have invested in Nord Stream 2 - Wintershall (BASFn.DE) and Uniper (UN01.DE) of Germany, Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI), Anglo-Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA).

2018-07-12,"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) topped estimates for quarterly profit and operating revenue Thursday as a rise in average fares trumped an almost 40 percent surge in fuel costs, pushing shares higher. Delta said it flew 3.2 percent more paying customers in the quarter and both average fares and adjusted total unit revenue - a closely-watched industry measure which compares sales with flight capacity - increased 4.6 percent. Given the additional fuel costs, however, the airline also said that it planned to cut less profitable flights in its new schedule for the second half of this year. “With strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps (basis points) of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,” Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said.  As developing middle classes in the world’s big emerging economies including China and India fly more, global air passenger traffic has risen every month this year. While that has bolstered airlines across the board, they are also facing the fallout of a more than doubling of crude oil prices since early 2016.  The Atlanta-based airline reiterated it expected its fuel bill for the year to rise by $2 billion after a 38.8 percent jump in fuel costs in the second quarter.  Those costs prompted Delta to cut its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.35 to $5.70 per share from $6.35 to $6.70 per share, months after bigger rival American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) also cut its full-year outlook. Delta expects unit revenue to grow 3.5-5.5 percent in the third quarter. The company’s board approved a 15 percent hike in dividend for the third quarter to 35 cents. On an adjusted basis, Delta earned $1.77 per share in the second quarter, beating an estimate of $1.72, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Delta’s total operating revenue rose 9.6 percent to $11.78 billion in the quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of $11.72 billion. Up to Wednesday’s close, the company’s stock had fallen 11 percent this year.

Metals also rebounded, with bargain-hunting investors scrambling to buy, while oil prices struggled to hold on after clawing back big losses. Stocks on Wall Street got a boost from technology and industrial shares. CA Inc jumped 18.1 percent after chipmaker Broadcom announced a surprise $18.9 billion deal to buy the U.S. business software company. There was also some relief for markets as President Donald Trump came out of a meeting of the NATO military alliance in Belgium with a positive assessment, after a string of earlier barbs. “We had a fantastic meeting at the end,” Trump told reporters. “Very unified, very strong, no problem.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 165.53 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,865.98, the S&P 500 gained 14.62 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,788.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 64.84 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,781.45. Stocks in Shanghai jumped more than 2 percent as trade war tensions faded to the background for now. “While markets have typically reacted negatively to any escalation on trade, the overall impact has been relatively modest under the circumstances which suggests investors are far from panic mode right now,” Craig Erlam, Oanda senior market analyst, said in a note. “There still seems to be some hope that common sense will prevail and a full blown trade war will be averted.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.80 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.46 percent. Positive U.S. jobless data on Wednesday provided a market boost, with labor market conditions remaining robust in early July. In addition, a consumer prices report indicated the underlying trend continued to point to a steady buildup of inflation pressure that could keep the Federal Reserve on a path of gradual interest rate hikes. The inflation data also boosted the U.S. dollar, which rose to a six-month high against the Japanese yen. In part, currency investors may see positive implications for the dollar from a trade war, as the United States would be better equipped to weather a slowdown in trade than other major economies. The Japanese yen weakened 0.38 percent versus the greenback at 112.45 per dollar. Oil prices, which had rebounded, turned negative after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the world’s oil supply cushion “might be stretched to the limit” due to production losses. Metals prices rebounded after a meltdown following Trump’s threats for 10 percent tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods.

2018-07-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - A rise in oil prices caused by the United States’ sanctions policies will hurt economic growth in China, Europe and other consumers, much like President Donald Trump’s trade measures, a top Iranian official said on Thursday. Iran’s OPEC governor also told Reuters the rise in oil output by OPEC and its allies, after pressure by Trump to do so, was only 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June and would not grow much in 2019, also weighing on economic growth. While Trump has accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of driving up oil prices, Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, says the United States has caused this by imposing sanctions on Iran and fellow OPEC member Venezuela. “The higher oil prices Trump is causing are leading to a higher energy bill in the EU, Japan, China and India, impacting their economic growth just like the tariffs imposed upon them, also enabling Saudi Arabia and the UAE to pay their arms bill to the U.S.,” Iran’s Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said. The comments underline the still-simmering tensions after OPEC’s meeting last month, when the group agreed to return to full compliance with earlier agreed oil output cuts, after months of underproduction by OPEC countries including Venezuela. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more, such as itself, to go ahead and do so, to make up for  shortfalls elsewhere. Iran strongly disagreed and criticized Saudi plans to boost output. Kazempour said Trump may be disappointed by the scale of the production increase so far and voiced scepticism Saudi Arabia and Russia could add much more oil in 2019. “These days Saudi Arabia are supplying out of stocks not additional production,” he said. “Russia is also unable to do much not even 200,000 barrels per day - all are talking few barrels next year and the world economy will shrink and all indexes will be down.”  “The June versus May increase in OPEC and non-OPEC production was only 170,000 bpd. Does this surprise you, Mr President?” The International Energy Agency, in a report on Thursday, put the combined month-on-month increase at 230,000 bpd. If Iran were able to develop its liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry to its full potential, Tehran could help reduce reliance on Russia, Kazempour said - something that the United States would favor. “Trump is concerned about EU and German dependence on Russian gas. Why do Trump and American companies together with EU companies not invest in Iranian LNG for Europe? Iran holds the largest gas reserves.”     The U.S. president had launched a sharp public attack on Germany on Wednesday for supporting a Baltic Sea gas pipeline deal with Russia, saying Berlin had become “a captive to Russia”.

2018-07-12,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan’s parliament voted on Thursday to extend President Salva Kiir’s mandate until 2021 in a move likely to undermine peace talks as opposition groups have said the change would be illegal. The vote will bolster the government team at peace talks with rebel groups in Khartoum, Sudan, said Paul Youani Bonju, chairman of parliament’s information committee. The extension also applies to vice presidents, state lawmakers and governors. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 but erupted into violence in late 2013 over a political disagreement between Kiir and his former vice president Riek Machar. “We regret the move as it shows the regime is playing games at the negotiating table. The international community should not recognise this move and the regime should be declared as a rogue regime,” Mabior Garang de Mabior, spokesman of Machar’s rebel group, the SPLM- IO, told Reuters by phone from Nairobi. The law change will extend the presidential and other officials’ terms until July 12, 2021. This week, Machar’s rebel group rejected plans to reinstate Machar as vice president, saying it had failed to dilute Kiir’s power. Rebels rejected parts of a peace deal signed in June. Previous agreements have promptly been broken. Lam Paul Gabriel, deputy military spokesman for Machar’s SPLA-IO, said government troops attacked its positions on Thursday in Kajo Keji in the country’s northwest in fighting that killed five government soldiers and one rebel. Government military spokesman Lul Ruai Koang said rebels ambushed and killed three of its soldiers who had gone to look for wild cassava on Tuesday. The civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and forced millions to flee from their homes. It has also cut South Sudan’s crude oil production, which the government depends on for revenue, with output at less than half its pre-war level of 245,000 barrels per day.

2018-07-12,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LbhIwR By John Kemp LONDON, July 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices registered their largest one-day fall in more than two years on Wednesday, in what was probably an indication hedge fund managers and other traders are realising profits after a year-long rally. Front-month futures slumped by $5.46 per barrel, or just under 7 percent, a daily price move more than three standard deviations away from the mean, and the largest one-day decline since February 2016. The market has suffered a larger percentage decline on only 44 days since the start of 1990, and it comes after a long period in which price volatility has been very low by historical standards. Traders and analysts have blamed the sudden drop on a cocktail of factors, including the reopening of oil export terminals in Libya and the worsening trade dispute between the United States and China. There have also been hints the United States will grant at least some waivers for countries to continue importing Iranian crude, easing fears of an extreme supply crunch after sanctions are reimposed in November. Saudi Arabia also sharply increased exports in June and is expected to raise them further in July, helping relieve fears about future shortages. The most likely explanation is a combination of all these factors, coupled with stretched market positioning and a lack of liquidity. Brent has shown signs of topping out for some time, even as prices remain close to their highest since 2014 (tmsnrt.rs/2LbhIwR). Buoyant flat prices have concealed signs of weakness elsewhere in the calendar spreads as well as hedge fund positioning. Brent spreads, which cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between over- and under-supply, have been softening for more than a month. The six-month futures spread peaked in a backwardation of $3.50 per barrel in late April, and had slipped to just $1.76 on Tuesday, before plunging to 63 cents on Wednesday. Hedge funds and other money managers have cut their bullish position in Brent futures and options from 632 million barrels in early April to just 457 million barrels by July 3. Portfolio managers hold just over eight bullish long positions in Brent for every bearish short position, but the ratio has come down from 20:1 in April. At the same time, fund managers have been gradually working down their bullish positions in refined fuels such as gasoline, heating oil and gasoil, contributing to downward pressure on crude. Overall, the fund community remains bullish on oil, anticipating that strong consumption growth and further disruptions in production will tighten the market even further in 2018 and 2019. But they are less bullish following the 75 percent run-up in Brent prices over the last 12 months and the market’s failure to break through the previous highs set in May. Fears about future supply disruptions have failed to push prices higher and cast doubt on the potential for further short-term gains. The resulting profit-taking has gradually sapped the momentum from the rally and probably contributed to the lack of liquidity behind Wednesday’s price move. The sharpest price drops were concentrated in near-dated futures contracts, which are where many hedge fund positions are held. Even after profit-taking in recent weeks, fund managers still held a historically high and lopsided bullish position in Brent futures, leaving them vulnerable to another bout of profit-taking. U.S. crude futures prices have remained supported by the interruption of pipeline deliveries into the U.S. Midwest as a result of the shutdown at Canada’s Syncrude plant. Hedge funds have actually been buying U.S. crude futures, adding 116 million barrels of net bullish positions in the last two weeks, even as they left Brent positions unchanged. But Brent has had no such local factors to support the market and on Wednesday it finally seemed to succumb to a profit-taking plunge. Markets exhibit strong cyclical behaviour. Once prices stop rising, they tend to fall, rather than hold at the peak. And the sharpest price falls in a market come not straight after the peak, but normally when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time, and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent. That is likely what happened on Wednesday.

2018-07-12,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Sixteen years after Emmanuel Ibeawuchi lost a leg in a road accident, his dream of playing soccer in a World Cup is about to become a reality.  He will captain Nigeria’s team when it makes its debut at the Amputee Football World Cup in Mexico in October.  The team hopes to follow in the footsteps of Nigeria’s disabled athletes who won eight gold medals at the 2016 Paralympics, along with two silver and two bronze medals, to finish 17th in the medal table and top among African countries. “We are the best all over the world so whatever we do we excel,” said Ibeawuchi, a 38-year-old bus conductor, citing the success of Nigerian disabled athletes across a range of sports. “There is no difference between one leg and two legs in terms of football because it is the same rules,” added the father-of-three who has played the game since his lower right leg was amputated a few inches below his knee.  The amputee tournament will take place just months after the World Cup in Russia where Nigeria’s team, known as the Super Eagles, failed to qualify from the group stage. The squad has been training in the commercial capital of Lagos, using crutches during games set on dusty brown soil. Like many cities across Africa, there are few facilities in public spaces for disabled people in Lagos, a city of around 23 million people.   Team coach Victor Nwewe said this makes disabled athletes less visible, a factor that affects the confidence of some players. “We have put it in them that they should see themselves as equally good as an able person,” he said, arguing that his team, known as the Special Eagles, can outperform their counterpart’s short-lived appearance at the World Cup in Russia.  “Since then all of them have the confidence now that they can even do better than the able bodied,” he said.

2018-07-12,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi police fired into the air to disperse protesters demanding jobs and better public services at one of three demonstrations outside major oilfields in the southern oil hub of Basra on Thursday, police sources said. Two protesters were wounded, police and hospital sources said, without elaborating after the incident near an entrance to the giant West Qurna 2 oilfield, run by Lukoil. Local workers said around 10 protesters managed to briefly enter a crude separation facility before police pushed them back. An angry crowd set fire to a caravan used by police, said two policemen at the scene. The unrest did not impact production at West Qurna 2 or the other two fields, West Qurna 1 and Rumaila, two oil officials said.  Iraq’s oil ministry later issued a statement saying that production at West Qurna 2 was proceeding normally and that security forces were in control of the situation near the oilfields. Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any potential disruptions to production could severely impact the economy.  The demonstrations escalated after police opened fire last week to disperse dozens of protesters near the giant southern West Qurna-2 oilfield, killing one person and wounding three. Tensions over basic services come at a sensitive time when Iraqi political blocs are attempting to form a coalition government after a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud. Easing hardship will not be easy. Iraq needs tens of billions of dollars to rebuild after its war with Islamic State. “We want jobs, we want to drink clean water, and electricity. We want to be treated like human beings and not animals,” said Husam Abdul Ameer, 25, an unemployed college graduate from Basra. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered a ministerial committee to look into the protesters’ demands. About 70 people gathered near a joint entrance leading to the key oilfields of Rumaila, operated by BP, and West Qurna 1, run by Exxon Mobil, said police officers in charge of protecting the oilfields perimeters. Some called on foreign companies to create jobs. “Why should young men from Basra beg for jobs while oil companies are hiring foreign workers,” protest organiser Falih al-Darraji told Reuters. “That’s unfair and should stop, otherwise we will not only demonstrate near the oilfield but will break in.”  Some local officials said the complaints were justified.  “Protesters have fair demands and they are peaceful so far.  If the government does not respond quickly, we fear things will get out of control in Basra,” said Faris Shaddad, the head of energy panel of Basra provincial council.    Other protesters gathered at a main road to the east of Basra leading to a border crossing with Iran, preventing trucks from moving, custom officials said.

2018-07-12,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Iran will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to India by offering “flexible measures” to boost bilateral trade, a statement from Tehran’s embassy in New Delhi said. Iran is the third-biggest oil supplier to India and has offered refiners incentives including almost-free shipping and an enhanced credit period on oil sales. Imports from Iran could take a hit as the United States reintroduces sanctions on Tehran after withdrawing from a nuclear deal with world powers. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, asked refiners last month to prepare for drastic reductions or even zero Iranian oil imports. “Iran understands the difficulties of India in dealing with (an) unstable energy market and it has done and will do its best to ensure security of oil supply to India,” the statement said. India’s oil imports from Iran fell about 16 percent in June compared to May, tanker arrival data showed. “Iran has always been a reliable energy partner for India and others, seeking a balanced oil market and regional prices of oil which ensure the interest of both countries as consumer and supplier,” the statement said. India was one of the few countries that continued to deal with Iran during previous sanctions although it had to cut imports from Tehran as banking, insurance and shipping channels were choked. “We do share a very strong, very good relationship, we are in touch with them (Iran) on several issues including on the fallout of the U.S. withdrawal from (the nuclear deal),” said Raveesh Kumar, India’s Foreign Ministry spokesman. Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department are expected to meet Indian officials next week regarding sanctions on Iran. Kumar said India is closely watching the situation and will do “whatever is mandated to be done in our national interest”. Iran also wants India to expedite its investment and accelerate engagement for the development of Chabahar port in Iran, the statement said. The Indian-backed Chabahar port complex is being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for land-locked Afghanistan that could open the way for millions of dollars in trade and cut dependence on neighbouring Pakistan. “We are committed to the development of the Shahid-Besheshti terminal of Chabahar port. We are moving with speed and scale and the work is underway on all interim operations,” Kumar said. India is trying to make Chabahar port operational by 2019, India’s transport minister said last month.

2018-07-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German companies active in eastern European business on Thursday dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline plan, a day after he called Berlin “a captive to Russia.” The U.S. State Department overnight repeated a warning to Western firms involved in the deal for the pipeline from Russia under the Baltic Sea, saying the project could divide Europe and they were at risk of sanctions. “Threats of U.S. sanctions against European companies invested in Nord Stream 2 encroach on European energy policy,” the chairman of the German Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations (Ostausschuss), Wolfgang Buechele, told Reuters. He said that Trump’s remarks and sanctions against Russia that also target foreign companies there were “an assault on business relations between German and European countries and Russia”. The $11-billion project, led by Gazprom (GAZP.MM), aims to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from next year, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine. Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE) are among western partners, that also include Anglo-Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Austria’s OMV OMVV.VIE. The German committee groups 350 members active in 29 countries in eastern Europe accounting for about a fifth of Germany’s total foreign trade, which is more sizeable than bilateral trades Germany conducts with the U.S. and China individually. Buechele said it was not up to Washington to identify which countries German companies were allowed to trade with.  The energy partnership with Russia had stretched over decades with mutual benefits, and gas imports from Russia were a competitively priced and reliable energy source for private consumers and industry, he said. Chancellor Angela Merkel insists the project is a private commercial venture. Buechele also said that to claim Russia would be able to control gas markets was “factually wrong and politically absurd.” A spokesman for Uniper declined comment on the latest exchanges but offered a wider statement by chief executive Klaus Schaefer saying that he wished for a de-escalation of the sanctions spiral. “We are holding on to our contractual obligations regarding Nord Stream 2, of whose value for Germany and Europe we are convinced, given the background of declining gas production in Europe,” Schaefer said. “This is a project for coming decades and thus partially independent of short-term developments.” Reporting by Gernot Heller, additional reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff, writing by Vera Eckert, editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/europe-gas-nordstream/german-business-group-enraged-by-trump-attacks-on-nord-stream-pipeline-idUKL8N1U84M2,12 Jul 2018,"German companies active in

2018-07-12,"(Adds Abu Attifel restart, details, background) TUNIS, July 12 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Thursday that it was reopening the El Feel oilfield after resolving a dispute with guards over pay and benefits that shut it down in February. Production at El Feel was expected to reach 50,000 bpd in two days, and 72,000 bpd three days later, NOC said in a statement. The restart is a boost for Libya’s oil industry, coming one day after an unrelated stoppage at major eastern oil terminals was ended. That disruption, which began in mid-June, had more than halved Libya’s national oil production from highs in February of 1.28 million bpd. Operations at fields linked to the eastern ports are gradually resuming, with production restarting at the 70,000 bpd Abu Attifel field on Thursday. Both El Feel and Abu Attifel are operated by Mellitah Oil and Gas, a joint venture between NOC and Italy’s Eni. El Feel was shut on February 23, when guards stormed offices at the southwestern field to press their demands. “The dispute caused by the local Petroleum Facilities Guards’ (PFG) demands regarding pay and benefits was brought to an end,” the NOC statement said. “Negotiations succeeded in guaranteeing an unconditional return of Fezzan Branch PFG to their previous locations.” The NOC said it had lifted force majeure, a legal waiver on contractual obligations for exports from El Feel. Libya’s oil production has been repeatedly disrupted by blockades and conflict over the past five years. Before a 2011 uprising threw the OPEC member into turmoil, it was producing more than 1.6 million bpd. Reporting by Aidan Lewis, Ayman al-Warfalli and Ahmad Ghaddar

The last El Niño, a pattern that brings a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific every few years, was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods before it went away in 2016. “The forecaster consensus favors the onset of El Niño during the Northern Hemisphere fall, which would then continue through winter,” the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) said in a monthly forecast. Last month, the weather forecaster put the chances of El Nino emerging at 50 percent during the fall and 65 percent during the winter.

2018-07-12,"OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian union representing striking oil workers and employers’ representatives were not talking to each other as of Thursday, days before a possible escalation of the industrial action. Hundreds of workers on Norwegian offshore oil and gas rigs went on strike on Tuesday after rejecting a proposed wage deal, leading to the shutdown of one Shell-operated (RDSa.L) field and helping send Brent crude prices LCOc1 higher. “We haven’t been contacted by the shipowners yet. They have to make the contact, they know our demands. Could be a strategic move from them to reach out before we shut more rigs on Sunday,” Safe union leader Hilde-Marit Rysst told Reuters. The union plans to have an additional 901 workers on strike from 2200 GMT on Sunday, unless the dispute is resolved. Those employees work on exploration and production drilling rigs owned by Saipem (SPMI.MI), Transocean (RIGN.S), Songa Offshore, Odfjell Drilling (ODLL.OL), Archer (ARCHER.OL) and COSL (601808.SS), among others. Still, Sunday’s possible escalation is not expected to lead to any further drops in output for now.  The Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, representing employers, does not intend to initiate contact with Safe on Thursday, a spokeswoman said. “We have no contacts planned today,” she said. “What happens afterwards can change any minute.” The Shipowners’ Association is in contact with all drillers involved to assess the situation. Shell told Reuters it had completed the shutdown of the Knarr field, which had a daily output of 23,900 barrels of mostly oil, but also natural gas liquids and natural gas. Equinor (EQNR.OL), Norway’s largest oil and gas producer, reiterated that the strike had halted some of its drilling and well intervention operations, though the company’s output remained unaffected. “We will continue to evaluate what is happening and will monitor the situation,” said a spokesman for Equinor, formerly known as Statoil. One strike-hit rig, the Songa Enabler, is due to drill an exploration well in the Barents Sea for Equinor in August. “At the moment, it (this strike) will not have any immediate effect on our exploration plans.

This path will continue,” the adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, told Iranian state television from Moscow. The Kremlin said Putin and Velayati discussed the situation in Syria and bilateral relations and Velayati had given Putin messages from Khamenei and from Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani. Russia, China and the big European powers say they still back a 2015 multinational nuclear deal with Iran, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out and to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran that were lifted as part of the accord. “Putin reiterated that Russia rejects America’s decision to impose sanctions on Iran ... He said Russia will stand by Iran and will defend Tehran’s rights,” Velayati said. Under the 2015 agreement, Iran strictly limited uranium enrichment capacity to satisfy the powers that it could not be used to develop atomic bombs. In exchange, Iran received relief from sanctions. U.S. officials said in June they would push countries to reduce their Iranian oil imports to zero. However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that Washington would consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions it will put in effect in Nov. 4. China and India are among the largest importers of Iran’s oil, as well as Turkey and Iraq. In May, India’s oil ministry asked refiners to prepare to limit imports of Iranian oil while Turkey said had no intention to halt its oil imports from Iran. Tehran has been pushing hard to hold output steady amid U.S. sanctions that are expected to hit its exports, pressuring other signatories of the deal to come up with a package of economic measures to salvage the deal. “Putin said that Russia is prepared to continue its oil investment in Iran at the level of $50 billion. It means Russia is ready to invest this amount in Iran’s oil sector,” Velayati said. “This is an important amount that can compensate for those companies that have left Iran (amid U.S. sanctions fear),” Velayati said, in a reference to a number of firms, wary of U.S. sanctions, that have already said they plan to pull out of Iran’s market. He said one of Russia’s major oil companies has signed a $4 billion deal with Iran, which he said “will be implemented soon”, without elaborating. “Two other major Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Gazprom, have started talks with Iran’s Oil Ministry to sign contracts worth up to $10 billion,” Velayati added. Velayati said Iran and Russia shared the same view over Syria, where Tehran and Moscow as allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have played decisive roles in turning the tide of war in his favour and in winding down some of the violence. “Iran and Russia will continue to cooperate in Syria,” Velayati said. “Putin underlined the importance of political and defence cooperations between Iran and Russia in Syria. Soon the presidents of Iran, Russia and Turkey will attend a summit in Tehran,” said Velayati, who is expected to visit China shortly. Trump and Putin are expected to discuss Iran’s regional role and the Syrian conflict at a summit in Helsinki next Monday.

2018-07-12,"* U.S. companies Aerion, Boom, Spike developing supersonic jets * Europe wants same noise standards as for subsonic jets * European demands could delay industry development By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed MONTREAL/SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. push for new global standards to kickstart its fledgling supersonic jet industry is facing resistance by European nations that want tough rules on noise, according to documents and people familiar with the situation. Fifteen years after Concorde’s last flight, U.S. regulators are weighing rule changes to allow testing of early-stage supersonic jets, amid plans for American-made business and small passenger jets due in service by the mid-2020s. But the new industry could face delays at the United Nations aviation agency where the United States and European countries - including France, Germany and Britain - are squaring off over new noise rules needed for the jets to fly, five sources told Reuters, speaking about confidential talks on condition of anonymity. The previously unreported dispute follows a 1990s clash on noise standards, when the European Union wanted to ban noisy older U.S.-made jets like the Boeing 727 from its airports and Washington threatened to retaliate by banning the Anglo-French Concorde. This latest round pits U.S. ambitions for an American-led revival of supersonic jets by start-ups Aerion Supersonic, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace against European fears of disruptive noise from the planes. Aerion, backed by Lockheed Martin Corp and GE, is considered by industry sources as the most advanced of the supersonic projects. For a FACTBOX on the players, click Boom will be making its first appearance at the Farnborough Airshow next week as it looks to cement the revival of the supersonic industry, which is struggling to design jets that meet current subsonic noise standards due to engine constraints. “The politics are that Europe is way more worried about noise (around airports),” said an industry source familiar with the matter. “Europe has a problem but they have no reason to solve (it) because they have no industry pushing for this.” That’s a reversal of disputes which delayed the beginning of Concorde’s transatlantic services in the 1970s, as first the U.S. Congress and then the New York Port Authority banned it due to noise. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flights over U.S. land since 1973. For now, the new jets plan to stick to over-water routes, though the FAA will eventually decide whether to allow overland flights after analyzing data from NASA in a study by 2025. An FAA spokesman couldn’t immediately comment. Both Boeing and Airbus have mapped out futuristic visions for ultra-fast air travel. But since the demise of Boeing’s planned near-supersonic Sonic Cruiser in 2002, the world’s two largest planemakers have focused on slower, fuel-efficient planes that allow airlines to lower ticket prices. Now, U.S. startups are working to develop quieter and more fuel-efficient supersonic planes than Concorde, aimed at business travelers. They claim these can be economically viable with the right engine. They also pledge to dampen the famous sonic boom which depressed Concorde’s sales and restricted its operations until it was grounded for economic reasons in 2003. The United Nations’ Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which sets many global standards, has started looking at supersonic jets by seeking technical information from planemakers. ICAO will then be in a better position to assess options for standards on noise and emissions, and “how long the process should take,” a spokesman said. The European countries think current noise limits should be used as “guidelines” for developing landing and take-off rules, according to a document presented to a recent ICAO committee meeting and seen by Reuters. The United States, echoing industry’s demand, has called for new standards that reflect “fundamental differences” between subsonic and supersonic jets, according to a second document. “Supersonic aircraft are different from subsonic aircraft and need to be treated as such,” said Mike Hinderberger, Aerion senior vice president of aircraft development at an industry conference last month. “You can’t try to shoehorn a supersonic aircraft into a subsonic standard.” Aerion declined to comment further. It’s not yet clear how other countries see supersonics or whether ICAO could craft a compromise. Lengthy delays by ICAO would likely force planemakers to hold off, or risk investing millions in a design that “no one will certify,” said a U.S. industry source. “It’s a chicken and egg argument,” added the first industry source. “How can you bring a plane to market if you don’t have the standards to meet?” The United States has urged ICAO to “move forward expeditiously” on new standards, according to a document reviewed by Reuters. “The sooner the agencies finalize guidelines and standards, the sooner we can ensure our design meets those requirements,” said Vik Kachoria, CEO of Boston-based Spike Aerospace, which hopes to select an engine for its jet early next year. The European nations, however, are seeking robust data. In a separate document on emissions, they said they do not expect new standards “before 2025 or later” because of insufficient data. Boom CEO Blake Scholl said he had faith that the international community would ultimate reach agreement on supersonic noise standards, due in part to customer demand to get to destinations faster. “Supersonic flight will be a critical driver of human progress, and we believe Europe’s citizens will embrace it,” he said. “We know noise is a sensitive issue, and we are designing with that in mind.” Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Jamie Freed in

2018-07-12,"(Updates with more comments, background, details) BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran’s economic troubles were going to force it to seek a security deal with Washington following his withdrawal from a nuclear pact. In May the United States pulled out of a multinational deal to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures. This may cut Iran’s hard currency earnings from oil exports, and the prospect has triggered a panicked flight of Iranians’ savings from the rial into dollars, weighing on an already ailing local currency, hit by economic woes and financial difficulties at local banks. Speaking to a news conference at a NATO leaders summit in Brussels, Trump said Iran was treating the U.S. with ‘so much more respect’ following the move and he expected Tehran to reach out for a fresh deal. “I know they’re having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing. But I will tell you this: at a certain point they’re going to call me they’re going to say ‘Let’s make a deal’. They’re feeling a lot of pain right now.” Tehran’s Grand Bazaar was hit by strikes late in June and protesters angered by the rial’s collapse clashed with the police and traders massed outside parliament to complain about a sharp fall in the value of the national currency. European powers still support the 2015 deal, under which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear development in exchange for international sanctions relief. They say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran, though a number of firms have already said they plan to pull out as they also face sanctions following Trump’s decision. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday called on American allies to help impose economic pressure on Iran. “We must cut off all funding the regime uses to fund terrorism & proxy wars,” Pompeo said in a Twitter post ahead of his scheduled meeting with European Union’s foreign affairs and security policy representative Federica Mogherini in Brussels.

In May, the United States pulled out of a multinational deal that lifted many sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program. Washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures, with no exemptions. Since President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the agreement, European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to maintain the nuclear curbs required in the deal. But so far it has proven difficult to offset the impact of  U.S. sanctions, with European firms reluctant to risk far-reaching U.S. financial penalties to do business in Iran. Pompeo, who has been attending a NATO summit in Brussels flew in from Abu Dhabi, where he discussed Iran with leaders of the United Arab Emirates.  Earlier on Thursday, Trump was asked at a NATO news conference about rising tensions with Iran and replied:  “I would say there might be an escalation between us and the Iranians.” However, Iran was now “treating us with much more respect right now, than they did in the past,” Trump added. “I know they’re having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing, but I will tell you this - at a certain point they’re going to call me and they’re going to say let’s make a deal. And we’ll make a deal. But they’re feeling a lot of pain right now,” Trump said. Senior State Department officials have also completed three days of talks on Iran in Saudi Arabia, and “discussed new ways to deprive the regime of revenues,” a State Department official told reporters traveling on Pompeo’s plane. In Saudi Arabia, the officials discussed U.S. oil sanctions to deny Iran revenue, maintaining a well-stocked oil market to guard against volatility and helping partners find alternatives to Iran oil, the official said. In another tweet, Pompeo said that on Thursday, together with allies from Britain, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Jordan “we reaffirmed our support for the Syrian political process and our goals of removing Iran’s influence, defeating #ISIS, deterring chemical weapons use.” Pompeo said Iran continued to send weapons across the Middle East, “in blatant violation of #UN Security Council resolutions.”  “Iran’s regime wants to start trouble wherever it can.

2018-07-12,"BASRA, Iraq, July 12 (Reuters) - Iraqi police fired into the air to disperse protesters demanding jobs and better public services at one of three demonstrations outside major oilfields in the southern oil hub of Basra on Thursday, police sources said. Two protesters were wounded, police and hospital sources said, without elaborating after the incident near an entrance to the giant West Qurna 2 oilfield, run by Lukoil. Local workers said around 10 protesters managed to briefly enter a crude separation facility before police pushed them back. An angry crowd set fire to a caravan used by police, said two policemen at the scene. The unrest did not impact production at West Qurna 2 or the other two fields, West Qurna 1 and Rumaila, two oil officials said. Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of OPEC producer Iraq’s state revenues. Any potential disruptions to production could severely impact the economy. The demonstrations escalated after police opened fire last week to disperse dozens of protesters near the giant southern West Qurna-2 oilfield, killing one person and wounding three. Tensions over basic services come at a sensitive time when Iraqi political blocs are attempting to form a coalition government after a May 12 parliamentary election tainted by allegations of fraud. Easing hardship will not be easy. Iraq needs tens of billions of dollars to rebuild after its war with Islamic State. “We want jobs, we want to drink clean water, and electricity. We want to be treated like human beings and not animals,” said Husam Abdul Ameer, 25, an unemployed college graduate from Basra. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered a ministerial committee to look into the protesters’ demands. About 70 people gathered near a joint entrance leading to the key oilfields of Rumaila, operated by BP, and West Qurna 1, run by Exxon Mobil, said police officers in charge of protecting the oilfields perimeters. Some called on foreign companies to create jobs. “Why should young men from Basra beg for jobs while oil companies are hiring foreign workers,” protest organiser Falih al-Darraji told Reuters. “That’s unfair and should stop, otherwise we will not only demonstrate near the oilfield but will break in.” Some local officials said the complaints were justified. “Protesters have fair demands and they are peaceful so far. If the government does not respond quickly, we fear things will get out of control in Basra,” said Faris Shaddad, the head of energy panel of Basra provincial council. Other protesters gathered at a main road to the east of Basra leading to a border crossing with Iran, preventing trucks from moving, custom officials said.

A 2 percent rebound on China’s big bourses had steadied Asian nerves, Wall Street futures were pointing higher and oil markets clawed back some of Wednesday’s 7 percent slump that had marked their worst day in 2-1/2 years. Beaten-up industrial metals including copper and nickel pulled higher, as did European stocks, while there was even some relief for Turkey’s lira after it had been dumped to a record low by talk of interest rate cuts from its re-elected President Tayyip Erdogan. “It mostly seems to be relief after the all-red, risk-off day yesterday,” said Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen. “The basis for this is not entirely clear to me though, because it doesn’t seem like this (U.S. threat of tariffs on another $200 billion of goods) has actually restarted negotiations with China... In fact I would argue that it has made the risk of an accident or an unwanted outcome bigger.” Europe’s moves were less pronounced than Asia’s had been, perhaps reflecting that caution. The Shanghai Composite and blue-chip CSI300 indexes had both ended the day up 2.2 percent. Shares in Japan , Australia and Hong Kong closed 1.1, 1 and 0.6 percent higher respectively. The pan-European STOXX 600 managed a more modest 0.5 percent, with gains in the healthcare and consumer sectors offset by minor losses in the banking sector and in energy firms after the dramatic drop in oil prices. Germany’s 10-year bond yield and the euro were both broadly steady with traders digesting minutes from the most recent European Central Bank meeting. A separate Reuters report showed its policymakers remain split on when to raise interest rates next year. The dollar rose to a six-month high against the Japanese yen of 112.60 after U.S. inflation data that bolstered the case for more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. U.S. consumer inflation figures are due at 1230 GMT ahead of Wall Street trading, but the fact the Fed and the ECB have such different rates means the gap between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and equivalent German Bund yields is the widest in nearly 30 years at 2.59 percent. “If stocks drop sharply then the Fed will pause and, moreover, we think the U.S. is towards the end of its rate hike cycle,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, an FX analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. There was also relief for markets as U.S. President Donald Trump came out of a meeting of the NATO military allience in Belgium with a positive assessment, after a string of earlier barbs. “We had a fantastic meeting at the end,” Trump told reporters. “Very unified, very strong, no problem.” Focus was still on what the next steps in the tit-for-tat trade conflict might be. China has accused the United States of bullying and warned it could hit back, although the form of retaliation is not yet clear. The options available to Beijing include boycotting American goods, selling off U.S. Treasury holdings or sharply devaluing the yuan Xiao Minjie, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, wrote in a note. China’s yuan had strengthened 0.3 percent overnight though, , partially recovering from a big slide the previous day and after the the People’s Bank of China set an official currency level that was not as weak as some traders had feared. “It shows the central bank intends to stabilise the market and calm investors. One-way speculation on the yuan’s depreciation is not in Chinese authorities’ interests,” said Qi Gao, Asia FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was up at 94.92 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight. Against the yen, which usually strengthens in times of political tension and market turmoil, the greenback stretched its overnight rally and rose to 112.60 yen, its highest since January. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar crawled higher having suffered deep losses on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar was also shade higher at C$1.3201 per dollar following a loss of 0.75 percent the previous day. In commodities there was also a stabilisation. Brent crude futures rose 1.2 percent to $74.26 a barrel after tanking 6.9 percent on Wednesday, after the trade tensions and signs Libya’s oil exports could pick up again, triggered the biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016. Metals were recovering from their own 2-4 percent meltdown too. Copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.8 percent to $6,194.00 a tonne. The industrial metal sank nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, plumbing a one-year low of $6,081.00. Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo; editing by

2018-07-12,"BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said Donald Trump did not directly threaten to leave the NATO security alliance during a summit on Thursday. Some news agencies reported the U.S. president had threatened to pull out of the 70-year-old alliance over frustration with member states’ lack of commitment to agreed goals including spending 2 percent of GDP on defence.

2018-07-12,"HANOI (Reuters) - A court in central Vietnam on Thursday jailed six Vietnamese for clashing with police during last month’s nationwide protests over new economic zones and feared dominance of Chinese investors. The court in Binh Thuan province handed down prison sentences of between two and two and a half years for “disturbing public order”, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its website. The six hurled bottles, bricks and petrol bombs at police during the protests on June 11, according to the statement. Their lawyers were not immediately available for comment.  The protests, by thousands of people in several cities, were fuelled by concerns that a draft law to develop economic zones offering land leases of up to 99 years would be dominated by investors from China, a neighbour with which Vietnam has a rocky history. Police have detained dozens of people following the protests, including in the economic hub of Ho Chi Minh City and the capital, Hanoi. Last month, police in Ho Chi Minh City issued a prosecution order for an American man of Vietnamese descent for his alleged involvement in the protests. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised the issue of Will Nguyen during his meetings with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi this week, encouraging a speedy resolution. The police statement said the convicted six had admitted guilt during the one-day trial.

2018-07-12,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese banks are moving to stop handling all Iran-related transactions to meet a November deadline set by the United States, after President Donald Trump in May pulled out of a nuclear program agreement with Tehran. Japan’s biggest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) (8306.T), will halt all Iran transactions to comply with the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran later this year, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday. The banking unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T) said later on Thursday it would take the same action. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) (8316.T) will carefully consider its response in compliance with the law and based on U.S. sanctions, it said in a statement emailed to Reuters. The move by MUFG is likely force a halt in Iranian crude oil purchases by Japanese companies as its banking unit handles the bulk of those imports, industry sources have told Reuters. The bank was fined hundreds of millions of dollars in 2014 for misleading U.S. regulators about its transactions with sanctioned countries including Iran. “The bank is afraid of U.S. sanctions, so cannot handle trade transactions. Other Japanese banks are likely to be in the same position,” said a Japanese analyst who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Trump in May withdrew the United States from a multi-party deal on Iran’s nuclear program and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 agreement. Washington later told countries to stop buying Iran’s crude oil, that nation’s most important export item, by Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. Japan is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude but the country’s oil refiners have said they may have to stop loading Iranian crude oil from October if they cannot get an exemption from U.S. sanctions to allow imports to continue. Beyond oil, trade between Japan and Iran is minimal.  MUFG Bank Ltd [MTFGTU.UL] has informed customers in Japan about its decision, given that dealings with Iranian financial institutions will be prohibited after a 180-day wind-down period, which ends on Nov. 4, the document showed. MUFG may revise its policy should additional guidance be given by the United States, the bank said in the document. MUFG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2018-07-12,"MAZAR-I SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Supporters of exiled Afghan Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum blocked sections of the main highway linking the capital, Kabul, with northern Afghanistan on Thursday, the latest in a spate of protests against the central government. The action followed days of demonstrations in several northern provinces that started when a militia commander loyal to Dostum was arrested after clashing with officers during a meeting with security forces. Some three months ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October, the protests underscore the volatile situation facing ethnically diverse Afghanistan, even as President Ashraf Ghani’s government has raised hope of steps towards talks with the Taliban. “People are frustrated and we’ve been raising our voice for several days,” Gul Mohammad Ayrkin, an official from Dostum’s Junbish-i Milli party said.  “We’ve had demonstrations, protest tents but the government so far hasn’t made the smallest response to people’s demands.” He said the highway had been blocked in Samangan, a mountainous region neighbouring the strategic province of Balkh. Other key points, including the road from the Hairatan border crossing with Uzbekistan, one of the main trade routes into Afghanistan, were also closed. As protests continued in other northern regions, demonstrators also closed down offices of the National Election Commission in Faryab, Jawzjan and Sar-e Pul provinces. Dostum, forced to leave the country following international outrage over accusations that he ordered his guards to seize a political rival and subject him to torture and sexual abuse, has been rumoured to be preparing a return to Afghanistan. A veteran of four decades of tumultuous politics, who has changed sides many times and faced multiple accusations of human rights abuses, he commands strong support among his fellow ethnic Uzbeks, a minority group with a widespread presence across much of northern Afghanistan. However, a return to the political scene would be a severe blow to the credibility of efforts by Afghanistan’s international partners to ensure that even powerful figures are accountable for abuses. With next year’s presidential elections in sight, the standoff has highlighted the increasingly open ethnic divisions in Afghanistan where ethnic Pashtun President Ghani faces growing hostility from many ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras.

2018-07-12,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A month after Cyril Ramaphosa took the helm of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December, he called an urgent meeting with then-President Jacob Zuma and senior ministers to save state power firm Eskom. Ramaphosa understood sweeping changes were needed at the struggling utility company. He persuaded Zuma to replace Eskom’s board and name a new chief executive to appease investors such as the World Bank, according to an official at the meeting. It was Ramaphosa’s first major policy intervention since becoming ANC leader and signaled a determination to reform Eskom, a company nearing breaking point after a string of corruption scandals during Zuma’s nine years in office. Eskom is critical to South Africa. It supplies more than 90 percent of the country’s power, has 220 billion rand ($17 billion) of state-guaranteed debt and is often cited as a threat to South Africa’s credit ratings, which are near junk status. “If Eskom were to collapse, it would be a catastrophe for generations to come,” said the official, who declined to be named. “Ramaphosa explained to Zuma that it was time to act.” Ramaphosa still faces a battle keeping Eskom afloat: new instances of fraud under the firm’s previous management are still being uncovered, a sluggish economy means demand for power is tepid and powerful labor unions are likely to resist change. But what may help Ramaphosa is a realization in the upper echelons of the ANC that Eskom is no longer untouchable, sources in the ruling party said. Since replacing Zuma as president in February, Ramaphosa has pressed on with reform, surprising many with the speed at which he is addressing problems at Eskom that have festered for years. Ramaphosa appointed respected former finance minister Pravin Gordhan to guide turnaround efforts, directed new executives to produce a plan to stabilize the company’s finances and halted a nuclear deal supported by Zuma that could have saddled Eskom with billions of dollars of additional debt. Asked for comment about Ramaphosa’s role in efforts to reform Eskom, his spokeswoman Khusela Diko said the president met regularly with Gordhan to discuss Eskom and that revamping the company was a priority. A spokesman for Zuma was not available for comment. Eskom also employs 47,000 people and has powerful labor unions, some allied with the ANC and others more militant, that have said they will resist attempts to cut the workforce and fight moves to privatize the company. However, ANC sources say Ramaphosa has secured the backing of senior figures in the ruling party for a radical overhaul of Eskom, one which will involve attracting greater private investment into the electricity supply industry. “From an ideological standpoint, Eskom presents a real challenge for the ANC,” said a source in the ANC executive close to Ramaphosa. “Greater private sector involvement does not sit well with some in the party, but there is no other option.” The official involved in the meeting with Zuma, who holds a senior position in the ANC, said there had been a discussion about which assets should be considered “non-core” and sold. The idea that outside investors may be needed to save the company is a dramatic shift for a political party that has rejected any form of privatization of Eskom for years. The desire for change is partly driven by a realization that Eskom is more fragile than many believed. The situation came to a head in November when the World Bank held a flurry of meetings with senior government officials. Eskom had less than 10 billion rand of cash, commercial banks had suspended lending and government officials feared the World Bank might do the same at a time when South Africa’s last investment-grade credit ratings were hanging by a thread. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the World Bank expressed “concerns on progress made on a specific project” at a meeting with Eskom executives and also raised governance concerns but had not told the company it planned to withdraw funding. A senior World Bank official said Eskom, which has borrowed $3 billion from the bank for projects including the Medupi coal-fired plant and renewables ventures, had not defaulted on World Bank loans and the lender did not threaten to suspend lending. (For a graphic of Eskom's financial woes: tmsnrt.rs/2NFfW94) While commercial banks resumed lending when Zuma stepped down and the company finally published long-delayed financial results, Ramaphosa has since faced more Eskom challenges. Workers went on strike in June over pay, forcing the utility to cut power supplies over three days for the first time since 2015, when rolling blackouts cost the economy billions of dollars a month. As South Africans huddled around candles again, commentators joked that Ramaphosa’s pledge to usher in a “New Dawn” after a decade of stagnation had turned into a “New Dusk”. Eskom had proposed a wage freeze due to financial constraints, even though inflation is running at about 5 percent. The unions were holding out for an increase of at least 15 percent in an increasingly acrimonious dispute. Ramaphosa used his close ties to South Africa’s largest union federation COSATU (Congress of South African Trade Unions) to make headway and in what was seen by unions as an unusual move, Gordhan intervened personally. Gordhan called COSATU to a meeting last month and promised that Eskom would rethink its refusal to raise wages, setting the stage for a deal of about 7 percent that is being ironed out. “It was unprecedented that Minister Gordhan met us to unlock the dispute,” said Sdumo Dlamini, president of COSATU, which has more than 10,000 members at Eskom via its National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) affiliate. “The talks were constructive, and we agreed to meet again to discuss Eskom.” Ramaphosa formerly held a senior position in NUM and COSATU supported his bid to become ANC leader. While Ramaphosa’s resolve to fix Eskom doesn’t seem in doubt, most analysts believe it will still take time.   “After the maladministration and corruption under the previous management, the new board is a step in the right direction,” said Ronald Chauke, energy portfolio manager at South Africa’s Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse. “But it will take five to 10 years to restructure Eskom properly. Ramaphosa will need a war room to fix the rot.” Attempts to sell off parts of Eskom will be vehemently opposed by some labor unions and conservative sections of the ANC wary of relinquishing control over parts of the power grid.      The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), a militant group with several thousand Eskom workers, has called for a meeting with Gordhan, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene and other unions to discuss Eskom. “We are vigilant about plans to restructure state firms because that usually leads to job losses,” NUMSA general secretary Irvin Jim said. “We reject privatizing Eskom with the contempt it deserves.” Analysts say any cuts to Eskom’s bloated workforce are likely to be delayed until after next year’s national election, where high unemployment will be a hot-button issue. But Ramaphosa, who played a key role in talks to end white minority rule more than two decades ago, has a reputation for making headway in difficult negotiations. Ramaphosa could also reduce Eskom’s debt without incurring the wrath of opponents of privatization by converting debt held by the Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which invests government employees’ pension money, into equity, said analysts. The state-run PIC held more than 80 billion rand of Eskom debt last year. “Ramaphosa won’t make quick progress with the radical restructuring needed to shore up Eskom’s balance sheet as he balances divergent interests in the ANC before the election,” said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group. “But he will get there eventually.” Reporting by Alexander Winning; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-eskom/insight-south-africas-ramaphosa-embarks-on-eskom-overhaul-idUKL8N1U24KX,12 Jul 2018,"A month after Cyril

2018-07-12,"KURASHIKI, Japan (Reuters) - Japan risks more severe weather and must find ways to alleviate disasters, a government spokesman said on Thursday, as intense heat and water shortages raised fear of disease among survivors of last week’s floods and landslides. Torrential rain in western Japan caused the country’s worst weather disaster in 36 years, killing 200 people, many in communities that have existed for decades on mountain slopes and flood plains largely untroubled by storms. But severe weather has been battering the country more regularly in recent years, raising questions about the impact of global warming. Dozens of people were killed in a similar disaster last year. “It’s an undeniable fact that this sort of disaster due to torrential, unprecedented rain is becoming more frequent in recent years,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference in Tokyo. Saving lives was the government’s biggest duty, he said. “We recognise that there’s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit,” he said.  He did not elaborate on what steps the government could take. More than 200,000 households had no water a week after disaster struck and many thousands of people were homeless. With temperatures ranging from 31 to 34 Celsius (86 to 93 Fahrenheit) and high humidity, life in school gymnasiums and other evacuation centres, where families spread out on mats on the floors, began to take a toll. Television footage showed one elderly woman trying to sleep by kneeling across a folding chair, arms over her eyes to keep out the light. With few portable fans in evacuation centres, many survivors waved paper fans to keep cool. Tight water supplies meant that people were not getting enough fluids, authorities said.  “Without water, we can’t really clean anything up. We can’t wash anything,” one man told NHK television. The government has sent out water trucks but supplies remain limited.  In the hard-hit Mabi district of Kurashiki city in Okayama prefecture, piles of water-damaged refrigerators, washing machines and furniture lined the streets as residents used hoses to wash mud out of their homes.  Unable to join in the strenuous work Hisako Takeuchi, 73, and her husband, spent the past five nights at an elementary school that had been turned into a make-shift evacuation centre. “We only have each other and no relatives nearby. We aren’t able to move large things and we desperately need volunteer helpers,” said Takeuchi.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on a visit to Kurashiki on Thursday, promised to provide help as soon as possible. He is set to visit two other hard-hit areas on Friday and the weekend.  More than 70,000 military, police and firefighters toiled through the debris in a search for bodies. Teams used diggers and chainsaws to clear landslides and cut away wreckage of buildings and trees. Many areas were buried deep in mud that smelled like sewage and had hardened in the heat.

2018-07-12,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Europe’s second highest court rejected Austrian concerns about a planned nuclear plant in southwest England, saying British government aid offered to the project did not violate EU rules. French power utility EDF (EDF.PA) and China General Nuclear Power Corp are building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station which is estimated to cost 19.6 billion pounds and come online in 2025. The European Commission cleared the project in 2014, saying it did not see any competition issues.  A previous Austrian government took issue with the decision and filed a case with the General Court in 2015, arguing that it contradicted EU policy of supporting renewable energy. Vienna has a decades-long policy of opposing nuclear power. Luxembourg has also challenged the approval, backed by a group of more than 20 academics, politicians and renewable energy officials who say it distorts competition and flouts rules on government subsidies. Another contentious issue is the guaranteed price for electricity from the plants which is higher than market rates. The General Court dismissed Austria’s arguments against the project. “The General Court confirms the decision by which the Commission approved the aid provided by the UK in favour of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station,” judges said. The judges said Britain has the right to choose between the different energy sources. The plant is expected to provide 7 percent of Britain’s power needs while helping to replace the country’s ageing nuclear fleet and closing coal plants. “The Commission did not err in taking the view that the UK was entitled to define the development of nuclear energy as being a public-interest objective, even though that objective is not shared by all of the member states,” the court said. In addition, EU regulators were correct to allow British state aid for the project because of the lack of market-based financial instruments and other contracts to hedge against the substantial investment risks in the project, it said. Austria’s ministry for sustainability and tourism said it regretted the judgement which sends a wrong signal about subsidies for building nuclear power plants. “The reasons for rejecting the lawsuit against Hinkley Point C will now be carefully examined, and the Austrian government will then decide on a timely appeal,” it said. An appeal can be made to the EU Court of Justice but only on matters of law. Austria is sticking to its challenge against another nuclear project approved by the Commission, the Paks power plant in Hungary near to the Austrian border, despite the Hinkley Point legal setback, the ministry said.     The case is Case T-356/15 Austria v Commission.

2018-07-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - As Premier Oil (PMO.L) makes progress on shrinking its debt pile, it is turning its attention to growth from its UK Tolmount gas field and by looking at buying existing production in the North Sea. “We would aim to continue to participate in the UK North Sea going forward. And it does seem that there are going to be some opportunities coming up in the next six to 12 months to grow the business through acquisition,” Chief Tony Durrant told Reuters in a phone interview. “It’s going to be biased towards production... We want the cash flow from newly acquired assets,” he said, adding he would expect Premier’s banks to support such a move. Oil majors such as BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) have also shown renewed interest in investing in North Sea assets in recent months as the oil price has rebounded and energy companies recover after slashing production costs following the oil price slump of 2014. In a trading statement on Thursday, Premier said its board had approved its UK North Sea Tolmount project, which will exploit 540 billion cubic feet of gas and target peak production of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  “Letters of interim agreement (for Tolmount) have been signed with the platform and pipeline contractors and the terminal for onshore gas processing selected. Premier’s board approved the Tolmount project in June and formal sanction by partners is scheduled for the third quarter,” Premier said. Tolmount and projects in Mexico are crucial to the future growth of Premier’s output, which it reiterated would average 80,000-85,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year.  In Mexico, Premier snapped up much sought after blocks in the Zama basin containing up to 800 million barrels and said on Thursday that it expects regulatory approval for its appraisal programme this quarter before starting to drill in the fourth quarter. It has been focussing on cutting debt, which stood at $2.65 billion at the end of last month, down from around $2.7 billion at the end of last year. “Full-year debt reduction is estimated at between $300 million and $400 million at current oil prices,” Premier said in its trading statement. It expects its covenant leverage ratio, calculated as net debt plus letters of credit over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, to fall to three times EBITDA by the end of this year and 2.5 times EBITDA by end of March 2019, it said.

The expected drop in Iranian crude exports this year due to renewed U.S. sanctions, coupled with a decline in Venezuela’s production and outages in Libya, Canada and the North Sea have driven oil prices to their highest since 2014 in recent weeks.[O/R] OPEC and other key producers including Russia responded to the tightness by easing a supply-cut agreement, with Saudi Arabia vowing to support the market as U.S. President Donald Trump accused the group of pushing prices higher. The Paris-based IEA said in its monthly Oil Markets Report that there were already “very welcome” signs that output from leading producers had been boosted and may reach a record. The global energy watchdog however said the disruptions underscored the pressure on global supplies as the world’s spare production capacity cushion “might be stretched to the limit”. Spare capacity refers to a producer’s ability to ramp up production in a relatively short time. Much of it is located in the Middle East. The IEA said OPEC crude production in June reached a four-month high of 31.87 million barrels per day. Spare capacity in the Middle East in July was 1.6 million bpd, roughly 2 percent of global output. As U.S. sanctions on Iran are expected to “hit hard” in the fourth quarter of the year, Saudi Arabia could further ramp up output, which would cut the kingdom’s spare capacity to an unprecedented level below 1 million bpd, the IEA said. Non-OPEC production including from surging U.S. shale also continued to rise, but the IEA said that might not be enough to assuage concerns.    “This vulnerability currently underpins oil prices and seems likely to continue doing so. We see no sign of higher production from elsewhere that might ease fears of market tightness,” it said. The IEA maintained its 2018 oil demand growth forecast at 1.4 million bpd, but warned that higher prices could dampen consumption. “Higher prices are prolonging the fears of consumers everywhere that their economies will be damaged. In turn, this could have a marked impact on oil demand growth.” The IEA said Iran’s crude exports could be reduced by significantly more than the 1.2 million bpd seen in the previous round of international sanctions. Iran exports roughly 2.5 million bpd, most of which goes to Asia. China and India, the world’s second and third largest oil consumers, could face “major challenges” in finding alternative crude oil following the drop in Iranian and Venezuelan exports, the IEA said. Iranian crude exports to Europe dropped by nearly 50 percent in June, the IEA said, as refiners gradually wind down purchases before U.S. sanctions take effect in November.

2018-07-12,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Foreigners have been banned from working as interns for Australian members of parliament, a spokesman for the Senate said on Thursday, in a reform apparently aimed at blocking Chinese prying into Australian affairs. The programme placing young people in a much-prized position working for a federal legislator for a three-month stint had been open to all nationalities, as long as the applicant did not have a criminal record. “Internships at Parliament House are restricted to Australian citizens,” said a spokesman for Senator Scott Ryan, president of the Senate, which oversaw the change. The spokesman declined to comment on what prompted the alteration or if it was made to block Chinese interference. Late last year, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accused China of meddling in domestic affairs. China denied the accusation which led to a strain in ties between the important trading partners.     The Financial Times newspaper reported in September that a New Zealand citizen who had previously interned at an Australian parliamentary committee had links to a Chinese military spy school. That report prompted a review of the intern system, which concluded standards should be bought in line with the rest of the government. Chinese students had often applied to the programme and many worked as interns over the years. A spokeswoman for the Australian National University (ANU), which provides many of the interns, said it had been informed of the change in the eligibility rule late last year. The change was only publicly disclosed some months later when the ANU amended the rules it posted on its website. Last month, Australia passed legislation designed to prevent interference by foreign governments, a reform Turnbull said was needed to combat Chinese meddling.     Under the law, lobbyists for foreign countries will be required to register and they will be liable to criminal prosecution if they are deemed to be interfering in domestic affairs.

2018-07-12,"(Repeats item unchanged) By Parisa Hafezi, Jonathan Saul and Bozorgmehr Sharafedin ANKARA/LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said last week that Tehran would block all exports through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if countries heed U.S. calls to stop buying Iranian oil from November. A fifth of global oil consumption passes through the Strait from Middle East crude producers to major markets. Outlined below are previous confrontations in the Gulf involving Iran, the military capabilities of the various parties and the diplomatic context of the latest threats: Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Oman’s territorial waters. However, ships pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy. In 2016, the Guards interrogated and held U.S. sailors overnight after they entered Iranian territorial waters elsewhere in the Gulf. A year earlier, Iran fired shots at a Singapore-flagged tanker which it said damaged an Iranian oil platform and held a container ship and its crew for a week over a debt dispute after diverting it with patrol boats in the Strait. In 2007, Iran detained British sailors further north in the Gulf. Iran also performs annual war games and tests medium range cruise and ballistic missiles. The deputy head of IRGC, Hossein Salami said in 2014 that Iran could use its cruise and ballistic missiles and drones, mines, speedboats, and missile launchers in the Gulf area to confront the United States. In 2015, the Guards staged a drill, shown on state television, in which a replica of a U.S. aircraft carrier was destroyed with missiles and speed-boats loaded with explosives while the guards practiced laying mines in the Strait. In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Guards and U.S. military in the Gulf. The U.S. navy has said that from January 2016 to August 2017 there was an average of 2.5 “unsafe” or “unprofessional” interactions per month between U.S. Navy and Iranian maritime forces, including an Iranian drone flying near a U.S. Navy warplane and Iranian military boat sailing close to a US Navy vessel. Tehran has accused U.S. forces of provocation. “Their security and the security of their interests in the region are in our hands” the Guards’ Salami said this year, although the number of incidents has dropped in recent months. During the Iran-Iraq war in 1980-1988 the two sides attacked ships in the Gulf to hamper one another’s oil exports in what was known as the Tanker War. In 1988, a U.S. frigate struck an Iranian mine, blowing a hole in its hull and breaking its keel, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) said. The United States destroyed two Iranian oil terminals, sank an Iranian warship and damaged another in response, the ONI said. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is tasked with protecting commercial ships in the area. U.S. officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a “red line” and have pledged to take action to reopen it. “We have the forces we need to maintain free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation,” Navy Capt. Bill Urban, U.S. Central Command spokesman told Reuters. Western navies also stage military exercises in the Gulf and Arab states across the Gulf from Iran, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have high-tech naval capacities. An ONI report said last year that Iran’s Guards’ naval doctrine was “based on speed, numbers, stealth, survivability, and lethality” and that it had aquired fast attack craft, small boats, anti-ship cruise missiles and mines. “Individually, these improvements cannot compete with Western technology. However, taken together, they could create an overall capability that is greater than the sum of its parts, particularly when employed in tight operational spaces like the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz,” the ONI said. The U.S. has said it would use minesweepers, warship escorts and potentially air strikes to protect the free flow of commerce but reopening the Strait could be a lengthy process especially if the Guards laid mines. Michael Connell, head of the Iran programme with U.S. non-profit research body CNA, said of all Iran’s capabilities, mines were probably the one that caused the most concern. He also said a misjudged incident which would trigger direct fire was a more likely scenario than a blockade of the Strait. “I would be less worried about a bolt out of the blue attempt to close the Strait and more worried about stumbling into a conflict,” he said. Iranian officials differ over the significance of the latest threat to close the Strait. “By calling on countries to cut their oil exports from Iran, America has already declared war on Iran,” a senior Iranian official and a former Revolutionary Guards commander who served during the 1980s war with Iraq told Reuters. “If we come to that point of not being able to export any oil, we will surely close the waterway.” Another official, who like the first declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, placed the threat in the context of talks with world powers on the future of the nuclear deal. Iran has said it would remain in the deal, which frees it from international sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, only if its interests were guaranteed. “The Strait issue gives Iran an upper hand in the talks. Everyone should know that Iran cannot be pressured,” the second senior Iranian government official said. “Iran has never closed the waterway ... even under the worst conditions and mounted pressure on the country.” Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Philippa Fletcher",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-iran/rpt-explainer-how-could-iran-disrupt-gulf-oil-flows-idUKL8N1U75IA,12 Jul 2018,"The commander of Iran's

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher, with Britain’s FTSE gaining 0.3 percent, Germany’s DAX adding 0.35 percent and France’s CAC 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent. The index slumped 1 percent on Wednesday along with a slide in global equities after U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to imposing tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods deepened the trade row between the world’s two largest economies. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.0.percent and the Shanghai Composite Index bounced 2.2 percent. Australian stocks rose 1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.3 percent. “The markets had some time to digest the latest trade war developments and are poised to begin consolidating,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “It has become a pattern of reacting to each new development and hoping that trade strains ease in the next few months through negotiations,” he said. Focus turned to what the next steps in the tit-for-tat trade conflict might be. China has accused the United States of bullying and warned it could hit back, although the form of retaliation was not clear. “The retaliatory options available to China include boycotting American goods, sharply devaluing the yuan, and selling off U.S. Treasury holdings,” Xiao Minjie, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, wrote in a note. “But we believe none of these moves are realistic or productive... the wisest move in our view is for China to accelerate the opening of its market rather than continue to trade blows with the United States.” China’s yuan strengthened 0.3 percent versus the dollar , partially recovering from a big slide the previous day and pulling back from 11-month lows brushed last week. The yuan firmed after the currency’s Thursday midpoint, set by the People’s Bank of China, was not as weak as the market braced for. “It shows the central bank intends to stabilise the market and calm investors. One-way speculation on the yuan’s depreciation is not in Chinese authorities’ interests,” said Qi Gao, Asia FX strategist at Scotiabank in Singapore. The dollar was buoyant, supported by mounting trade tensions and Wednesday’s strong U.S. inflation data. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 94.700 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight. Against the yen, which usually strengthens in times of political tension and market turmoil, the greenback stretched its overnight rally and rose to 112.385 yen, its highest since January. “The dollar has managed to gain even against the yen due to ongoing trade concerns, with commodity-linked currencies having slid along with the downturn in commodities and providing a broad lift for the dollar,” said Ichikawa of Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar suffered deep losses on Wednesday. The Aussie crawled up 0.2 percent to $0.7383 after dropping 1.2 percent overnight. The Canadian dollar was a shade higher at C$1.3201 per dollar following a loss of 0.75 percent the previous day. The euro was little changed at $1.1680 after shedding 0.6 percent on Wednesday. In commodities, Brent crude futures rose 1.5 percent to $74.52 a barrel after tanking 6.9 percent overnight, the biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016 as trade tensions threatened to hurt oil demand and news that Libya would reopen its ports raised expectations of growing supply. Copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.8 percent to $6,194.00 a tonne. The industrial metal sank nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, plumbing a one-year low of $6,081.00.

2018-07-12,"* Scorching heat, lack of water raises disease fears * Death toll nears 200, dozens still missing * Over 200,000 households still without water By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Issei Kato KURASHIKI, Japan, July 12 (Reuters) - Intense heat and water shortages raised fears of disease outbreaks in flood-hit western Japan on Thursday as the death toll from the worst weather disaster in 36 years neared 200. More than 200,000 households had no water a week after torrential rains caused floods and set off landslides across western Japan, bringing death and destruction to decades-old communities built on mountain slopes and flood plains. The death toll rose to 195, with several dozen people still missing, the government said on Thursday. With daily temperatures above 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) and high humidity, life in school gymnasiums and other evacuation centres, where families spread out on mats on the floors, began to take a toll. Television footage showed one elderly woman trying to sleep by kneeling with her upper body on the seat of a folding chair, arms over her eyes to keep out the light. With few portable fans in the evacuation centres, many survivors tried to cool themselves with paper fans. The limited water supply meant that people are not getting enough fluids and in danger of suffering from heatstroke, authorities said. People are also reluctant to use what water they do have to wash their hands, raising fears of epidemics. “Without water, we can’t really clean anything up. We can’t wash anything,” one man told NHK television. The government has sent water trucks to the disaster area, but supplies remain limited. More than 70,000 military, police and firefighters toiled through the debris in a grim search for the missing. Some teams shovelled dirt into sacks and piled the bags into trucks. Others used diggers and chainsaws to work through landslides and splintered buildings. Many areas were buried deep in mud that smelled like sewage and had hardened in the heat, making the search more difficult. Disasters set off by torrential rains have become more frequent in Japan, perhaps due to global warming, experts say. Dozens of people died after similar rains caused flooding around the same time last year. “It’s an undeniable fact that this sort of disaster due to torrential, unprecedented rain is becoming more frequent in recent years,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference in Tokyo. “Preserving the lives and peaceful existence of our citizens is the government’s biggest duty. We recognize that there’s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit,” he added.

2018-07-12,"HOUSTON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil exports to India hit a record in June and so far this year are almost double last year’s total as the Asian nation’s refiners move to replace supplies from Iran and Venezuela in a win for the Trump administration.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has been pressuring its allies to cut imports of Iranian goods to zero by November and India’s shift advances the U.S. administration efforts to use energy to further its political goals.  The United States has become a major crude exporter, sending 1.76 million barrels per day (bpd) abroad in April, according to the latest government figures. All told, producers and traders in the United States will send more than 15 million barrels of U.S. crude to India this year through July, compared with 8 million barrels in all of 2017.  The exports to India could go higher if China imposes levies on its U.S. oil imports over the latest round of U.S. tariffs, which could damp Chinese purchases and lead U.S. crude prices lower.   A. K. Sharma, head of finance at Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS), the country’s top refiner, said U.S. crude is gaining appeal because of its lower cost, and could expand further if China cuts its imports of U.S. energy.    “If China levies a tariff on U.S. oil then U.S. imports to India will probably rise,” he said. “We are looking for a mini-term deal to buy three to four cargoes of U.S. oil over a period of three to six months instead of buying single cargoes.” Last month, India’s oil ministry asked refiners to prepare to limit imports of Iranian oil ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect in November.  The United States is reimposing sanctions after withdrawing from a 2015 agreement with Iran, Russia, China and several Western European countries where Iran agreed to curtail its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of earlier sanctions. Venezuelan crude shipments to the Asian country also fell 21 percent in the first half of this year as production has been hampered by inadequate investment, mismanagement and U.S. sanctions. Adding to its exports crisis, the U.S. has been increasing sanctions on various Venezuelan nationals and companies, part of a campaign to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to make political and market reforms.  Iran and Venezuela are among India’s top five oil suppliers.     Last month, India’s imports of Iranian crude fell by 16 percent from May, paring sharp year-over-year increases during the first half of this year. The Trump administration plans to send a delegation in the coming months to India to discuss Iran sanctions and oil issues.  “Our focus is to work with those countries importing Iranian crude to get as many of them as possible down to zero by Nov. 4,” a U.S. State Department official said. The world’s fourth largest refiner by capacity is “cutting back on Iranian crude imports,” said Reid l’Anson, an analyst at cargo tracking firm Kpler. “That’s an opportunity for U.S. producers to sell into the Indian market. Indian demand is quite robust.”  Reuters’ vessel tracking data show three of the eight tankers charted by Swiss and Chinese traders and sent to India in recent weeks were destined for a port near Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS)’s Jamnagar refinery, the world’s largest. Three others are headed for undisclosed ports on India’s west coast from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment. Swiss trader Vitol SA and Chinese oil companies including PetroChina (601857.SS) last month lifted four vessels carrying 6.83 million barrels combined to western India, according to Thomson Reuters trade flow data.  June’s 228,000 bpd of U.S. exports to India are more than double the previous export record of 98,000 bpd last September, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.  The FPMC C Melody, a very large crude carrier (VLCC), is scheduled to arrive next month at Sikka, near Jamnagar. It is carrying 1.93 million barrels of U.S. crude, Reuters tracking data shows.  Another Vitol-chartered VLCC, the Maharah, sailed from Galveston last week and was headed to Sikka with 1.98 million barrels of oil.  Two more VLCCs - the Ghinah and the Eagle Victoria - were scheduled to leave the Texas coast for undisclosed ports in India this month, bringing planned U.S. oil exports to India to at least 191,000 bpd for the month. Vitol and PetroChina declined to comment. A trader familiar with the Chinese company’s purchases confirmed PetroChina is supplying U.S. crude to India.  Some Indian refiners have finished testing runs of U.S. oil this year, often by mixing it with heavier grades those plants typically process, analysts and traders said.  “They really have started to make the shift,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of energy consultancy PetroMatrix. “India is comfortable with a regular flow from the U.S. now.”      Reliance is blending lighter U.S. oil with heavier crudes from other nations, said a trader familiar with plant operations and trade flows. Indian refiners began testing U.S. crudes last year, and volumes have climbed as they became confident the blends would work.

2018-07-12,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska, July 11 (Reuters) - Alaska officials on Wednesday said they remain confident that China will help the state achieve its decades-old dream of building a pipeline to carry now-stranded natural gas from the North Slope to markets, despite growing U.S.-China trade tensions. China is expected to buy about 75 percent of the liquefied natural gas shipped through the yet-to-be-built pipeline, so any tariffs that result from trade disputes could cause problems, Alaska Gasline Development Corp Vice President Lieza Wilcox said at a legislative hearing in Anchorage on Wednesday. “That said, this project is very well regarded in the government circles of both countries, in the trade circles of both countries,” Wilcox told lawmakers. The $43 billion project would send natural gas from the North Slope by pipeline to a liquefaction plant at Cook Inlet in southern Alaska. From there, the gas would be shipped overseas by tanker vessel. The field is expected to produce about 3.5 billion cubic feet per day. The proposed pipeline has been touted frequently by Trump administration members as important to its goal of exporting more energy. However, a series of tariffs levied by the United States and China - and subsequent additional threats - have raised concerns on both sides of the Pacific that the project could be a victim of increased tensions. In June, China warned that it could impose tariffs on U.S. energy exports, but that list did not include liquefied natural gas (LNG). Since the United States started exporting LNG from Louisiana in February 2016, China has been the third biggest buyer of the fuel behind Mexico and South Korea. Chinese firms bought about 169.2 billion cubic feet of gas, or 14 percent of the LNG the United States shipped between February 2016 and April 2018, according to federal energy data. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. AGDC and other state agencies say the project is on track, having secured agreements with institutions in China for help in developing and financing the project. “It is frequently seen as kind of an olive branch in the trade discussions. And that’s part of the reason why we’re progressing the agreements on a fairly quick pace,” Wilcox said. For nearly half a century Alaskans pushed for a pipeline to carry gas to markets. But the project has been considered uneconomic because of geographic isolation, competition and high cost.

2018-07-12,"TOKYO, July 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose more than $1 on Thursday as focus turned to a big drawdown in U.S. stockpiles, recouping some of the market’s heavy losses from the previous session that had been sparked by news that Libya would resume oil exports. Brent crude was up 96 cents, or 1.31 percent, at$74.36 by 0102 GMT, after earlier rising to $74.46. On Wednesday, the contract slumped 6.9 percent in its largest one-day percentage decline since Feb. 9, 2016. U.S. crude rose 21 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $70.59, after falling 5 percent the previous session. “Both oil contracts have recently stalled around key long-term and psychologically-important levels at $80 and $75 respectively, as market participants weigh the risks of a potential correction in prices,” Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at FOREX.com, said in a note. The announcement by Libya’s National Oil Corp that four export terminals were being reopened, ending a standoff that had shut down most of Libya’s oil output, was the catalyst for a correction, Razaqzada said. The reopening allows the return of as much as 850,000 barrels per day of crude into international markets. But in the U.S. stockpiles are falling as refiners suck crude out of inventories to produce more gasoline for drivers in the peak summer season. U.S. crude oil stocks fell by nearly 13 million barrels last week, the most in nearly two years, dropping overall crude stocks to their lowest point since February 2015, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

2018-07-12,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s top diplomat has indicated the United States might grant waivers to some countries allowing them to continue importing Iranian crude when sanctions snapback in November. “There will be a handful of countries that come to the United States and ask for relief,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday in a television interview with Sky News Arabia. “We’ll consider it.” In a separate briefing for reporters travelling with the secretary, a senior State Department official elaborated on recent discussions between U.S. diplomats and their Saudi counterparts. “In our meeting with the Saudi energy minister, we discussed maintaining a well-supplied oil market to guard against volatility,” the unnamed official told reporters in a background briefing. “We coordinated – we discussed U.S. oil sanctions to deny Iran revenue to finance terrorism. We talked about minimizing market disruptions and helping partners find alternatives to Iranian supply of oil,” the official added. It remains unclear whether the latest comments from Pompeo about considering applications for waivers, and his unnamed briefer, represent a softening of the administration’s position. Press briefings given earlier this month suggested that the administration’s goal was to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero, possibly with effect from November. “Our goal is to increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue from crude oil sales,” a senior State Department official told reporters at a press briefing earlier this month. “We are working to minimize disruptions to the global market, but we are confident that there is sufficient global spare oil production capacity,” Brian Hook, the director of policy planning, said on July 2. “We are not looking to grant licences or waivers broadly on the re-imposition of sanctions, because we believe pressure is critical to achieve our national security objectives.” On the other hand, the administration has also briefed journalists on background it will review waiver applications on a case-by-case basis and work with countries that are reducing their oil imports from Iran (“U.S. says to work with allies to cut Iran oil imports”, Reuters, June 28). The current position seems to be that sanctions will definitely snapback on Nov. 4 but the United States will “consider” applications from “a handful” of countries to be allowed to continue importing some oil. The compromise would ensure at least some Iranian oil continues reaching the global market, as it did under the previous sanctions in force between 2012 and 2015. There are doubts about whether Saudi Arabia and other producers can increase output by enough to cover all the 2.4 million barrels per day of Iranian oil exports if sanctions attempted to push them to zero. Waivers and exemptions allowing at least some Iranian barrels to continue being exported may be the only practical way to re-impose sanctions without risking a sharp spike in oil prices. Price increases are especially sensitive at this time because the re-imposition of sanctions coincides with U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6. Despite multiple briefings and statements by senior U.S. officials, the administration’s policy on sanctions and oil supplies remains unclear. The ambiguity may be intentional to increase pressure on Iran, but it is also maximising uncertainty in the oil market about future supplies and is likely to keep upward pressure on prices. Traders, refiners and hedge funds have been left without a clear picture of how much oil will be available to the market towards the end of the year and into 2019. Because the oil market is forward-looking, uncertainty about supplies in the final quarter and next year is directly affecting prices now. Market participants will be looking for clarity from the State Department on several key issues as they try to assess the severity of sanctions and oil availability: (1) If the administration’s target is not zero oil exports, how much crude does the United States plan to allow Iran’s customers to purchase without imposing financial penalties on them? (2) If there are to be sanctions exemptions, which countries and/or companies will receive them, on what basis will they be granted, and will sanctions relief be conditional? (3) Has the United States reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia (and perhaps also the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia) to offset the impact of oil volumes lost from Iran? (4) Is the imposition of sanctions, and granting of waivers, being coordinated with the European Union (especially France, Germany and Britain) and with Russia and China? Under the last round of oil sanctions, in effect from 2012 until early 2016, Iran was still able to continue exporting reduced volumes of crude amounting to around 1 million bpd, mostly to customers in Asia. If the United States plans to allow a similar volume of exports this time, it would cut exports by around 1.5 million bpd, but the administration has given no indication about likely export volumes beyond November. Last time, refiners in Japan, South Korea, India, China and Turkey were among those that continued importing limited volumes of Iranian crude, without financial penalties from the United States. In most cases, sanctions exemptions were implicitly or explicitly conditional on promises to reduce the volume of imported Iranian crude over time (“Iran sanctions”, Congressional Research Service, June 29, 2018). The administration has given no indication of whether the same countries will be exempted this time and if so on what conditions. France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China have all pledged to uphold the 2015 nuclear agreement, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for limits on the country’s nuclear activities. These five countries have been negotiating a package of economic measures to provide Iran with an incentive to remain within the agreement, accept continued restrictions on nuclear activities and permit inspections. The contents of the economic package have not been published but Iran has indicated an early draft does not go far enough (“Negotiations over saving Iranian nuclear deal to continue”, Radio Free Europe, July 6). France has indicated the package might only be ready by November and Germany has said it will not be able to fully compensate for the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions. The tougher the U.S. sanctions, the more they reduce Iran’s oil export revenues, the more economic incentives that the other foreign powers may need to offer Iran to persuade the country to abide by the agreement. There may therefore be a link between the waiver process between the United States and Iran’s refining customers on the one hand, and the negotiations the Europeans, Russia and China are holding with Iran on the other. The other awkward linkage is between U.S. sanctions on Iran and the U.S. trade dispute with China over intellectual property protection, technology transfers and the bilateral trade imbalance. China is one of the largest importers of oil from both the United States and Iran. China has already targeted oil imports from the United States for retaliation in the trade dispute. If China stops buying crude oil from the United States, it will need to find other sources of supply, one of which might be Iran. China’s leaders must make a tricky calculation. The country might actually increase oil imports from Iran to express its displeasure with the United States and diversify its crude supply. But that would be provocative and risk secondary sanctions being applied to China’s major oil companies – many of which have business dealings with the United States. Alternatively, China could leave its imports from Iran unchanged, reduce them and apply for waivers, or cut them to zero. Heeding sanctions would avert a further intensification of disputes with the United States but reduce China’s oil buying options, reduce its supply security, and risk further upward pressure on oil prices. China has so far matched U.S. actions at each step of the bilateral trade dispute, but it has not sought to escalate the conflict, so the country may try to avoid the provocation of increasing oil imports from Iran. If the U.S.-China trade dispute continues to worsen, however, sanctions policy could become entangled in the broader strategic conflict between the two superpowers.

2018-07-12,"* Day 2 of summit to focus on Afghanistan, Ukraine, Georgia * Leaders hope to steer away from trade, spending tensions (Adds Trump tweet, background) By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - NATO leaders will try on Thursday to move beyond U.S. President Donald Trump’s demands for higher defence spending, and focus on ending the long war in Afghanistan, in the second day of a summit in Brussels underscored by transatlantic tensions. On a trip that will also take Trump to Britain and to Helsinki to meet Russia’s Vladimir Putin, the president spent the first day of the NATO summit lambasting allies for failing to spend the targeted 2 percent of GDP on defence and accused Germany of being a prisoner to Russian energy. Trump, in a late-night post on Twitter, wrote: “Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn’t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much.” It followed an uncomfortable first round at the summit where anxious Western allies were subjected to the U.S. president’s “America first” approach. His comment that Germany was controlled by Russia earned a rebuke from Berlin. On day two, leaders will welcome non-NATO partners including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Ukraine’s Petro Poroshenko to the alliance’s new glass-and-steel headquarters as they seek to focus on policy rather than politics. British Prime Minister Theresa May tried to set the tone on Wednesday by announcing more troops for NATO’s Afghan training mission. “We will be deploying an additional 440 personnel to NATO’s Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan and I think that shows when NATO calls, the UK is one of the first to step up,” May told reporters. North Atlantic Treaty Organization chief Jens Stoltenberg wants leaders to agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024, despite public fatigue in Western countries about their involvement in the conflict. Funding has averaged at about $1 billion annually and Stoltenberg has said he expected that level to be met. Leaders will be keen to hear more about Trump’s military approach to Afghanistan, which he revamped last August to include a surge in air strikes to force Taliban militants to the negotiating table. U.S. officials have told Reuters that Washington is preparing another review of strategy, a year after Trump begrudgingly agreed to extend involvement in the 17-year-old war. Trump was opposed to remaining in America’s longest war, but his advisers convinced him to give it more time. He authorized the deployment of an additional 3,000 troops, bringing the total to around 15,000. Trump’s late tweet also repeated his insistence from earlier in the summit that Germany was wrong to support an $11 billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet targets for NATO spending. “Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!” he wrote. But Trump appeared earlier to substantially overstate German reliance on Russian energy and to imply Berlin was funding a pipeline that Chancellor Angela Merkel says is a commercial venture. Having chided NATO members for failing to reach a target of spending 2 percent of national income on defence, Trump told fellow leaders on Wednesday he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, officials said. That would represent a massive upheaval of budgetary priorities in Europe where Germany and many others have pledged only to reach 2 percent by 2024 or later, and it was not clear what allies would spend the money on. At the summit on Thursday, leaders will discuss ties with Georgia and Ukraine, two NATO membership hopefuls that contribute to troop levels in Afghanistan but have seen their chances of joining the alliance hampered by Russian incursions into their territory. Under NATO rules, countries with territorial conflicts cannot join the Western alliance and neither country is expected to progress in membership talks. Macedonia, however, which was formally invited to start accession talks on Wednesday, will be part of a special ceremony on Thursday as the alliance sets the stage for expanding to its 30th member state.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.25 percent. The index slumped 1 percent on Wednesday along with a slide in global equities after U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of imposing tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods deepened the trade row between the world’s two largest economies. Australian stocks rose 0.35 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI was flat and Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.75 percent. “The markets had some time to digest the latest trade war developments and are poised to begin consolidating. It has become a pattern of reacting to each new development and hoping that trade strains ease in the next few months through negotiations,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The dollar was buoyant, supported by mounting trade tensions and strong U.S. inflation data. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 94.703 after gaining 0.6 percent overnight. Against the yen, which usually gains in times of political tension and market turmoil, the greenback rallied 0.9 percent on Wednesday to touch a six-month high above 112.00 yen. “The dollar has managed to gain even against the yen due to ongoing trade concerns, with commodity-linked currencies having slid along with the downturn in commodities and providing a broad lift for the dollar,” said Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar suffered deep losses on Wednesday. The Aussie traded little changed at $0.7366 after dropping 1.2 percent overnight. The Canadian dollar was steady at C$1.3208 per dollar following a loss of 0.75 percent the previous day. The euro was flat at $1.1675 after shedding 0.6 percent on Wednesday. In commodities, U.S. crude futures inched up 0.25 percent to $70.57 a barrel after tumbling 5 percent the previous day as trade tensions threatened to hurt oil demand and news that Libya would reopen its ports raised expectations of growing supply.

2018-07-12,"* Opaque LNG pricing seen as hurdle to market entry * Platts, GLX platform see first transparent LNG trades * But majority of LNG in Asia still on long-term contracts By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - Long dominated by deals struck in secret, the $230 billion liquefied natural gas industry is slowly seeing light as global traders push for more transparency in the booming market. Over the past two months, commodity price agency S&P Global Platts and Australia-headquartered LNG trading marketplace Global LNG Exchange (GLX) facilitated the first transparent physical trades in their platforms. It was the first time in nearly a decade since Platts kicked off its Asian LNG derivative price assessment that it disclosed trading parties of a physical trade on its platform. Pricing transparency is critical to boost liquidity in commodity markets but is often tough to do particularly in cash contracts with participants wary about exposing trading positions. LNG producers also prefer fixed, long-term contracts because they provide steady revenues needed to fund multi-billion dollar projects. But the LNG trading landscape is slowly changing, as more market participants push for transparency and Japan’s JERA, the world’s biggest LNG buyer, and leading merchants like Vitol expand their trading desks. “These first few transparent bids or offers are the first steps to encourage greater market participation in using the (Platts) marker to price cargoes,” said Edmund Siau, analyst with energy consultancy FGE. Platts started publishing a daily Asian LNG price assessment in 2009. But it was only in 2016 that volumes picked up, then more than tripled in 2017. Volumes in January-May this year have already surpassed last year’s, according to Platts data. And for the first time, Platts last week published the counterparties of one LNG trade for its pricing process, three weeks after receiving its first transparent bid from commodity trader Trafigura. “We have seen a significant number of market participants that have stated they would like to see a more transparent (price) process,” said Jonty Rushforth, senior director of energy pricing at Platts. Platts has approved six other entities in the transparent bidding process including Britain’s BP, Japan’s Itochu , Swiss Vitol, Singapore’s Pavilion Gas and Diamond Gas International, a subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. Perth-headquartered Global LNG Exchange (GLX), an online platform for physical cargoes launched in April 2017, saw its first trade done in May this year as its members more than doubled to 44 from last December, most of them from Asia, which imports over 70 percent of the world’s LNG. GLX Chief Executive Damien Criddle said the platform has received four tenders since its launch. Petronas LNG, a subsidiary of Malaysia’s state-owned Petronas and a major producer of the fuel, completed the first GLX deal in late May. “Traders spend a lot of time talking on a bilateral basis with other traders to see whether they can sell spot cargoes,” Ahmad Adly Alias, vice president of Petronas LNG marketing and trading division said at a conference in late May, adding that a platform like GLX was a more effective way for price discovery. On Tuesday, CME Group Inc said it will develop the first physically deliverable U.S. LNG futures contract on its New York Mercantile Exchange. Still, LNG has a long way to go before reaching the level of liquidity and transparency in oil - by far the world’s most traded commodity - but which only came after many years. Steelmaking raw material iron ore only shifted to transparent spot pricing after four decades of yearly-set contracts. Majority of LNG in Asia remains under opaque long-term contracts linked to the price of oil, as producers opt for steady revenues to fund LNG export projects, some of which have cost $50 billion to develop, said FGE’s Siau. “Until providers of project debt and equity are comfortable with the risks and rewards of using a spot LNG index, we expect the proportion of spot LNG available will be limited,” he said.
