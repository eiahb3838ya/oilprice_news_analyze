2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans by 2040 to develop the world’s first net-zero carbon industrial centre by teaming up emitters with industries that can reuse their polluting gases or by moving to lower carbon fuels such as hydrogen, it said on Thursday. The government said it will commit up to 170 million pounds to the project, which could include capturing emissions from factories and reusing them in industries such as brewing to put the fizz in drinks. Britain has been making progress in cutting emissions from the electricity sector by increasing renewable power generation as it seeks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025. “But to sustain this track record we need to tackle emissions from energy intensive sectors and bring clean growth to our great industrial centres,” energy minister Claire Perry said in a statement. Industrial emissions, such as from the production of steel, ceramics and chemicals account for 25 percent of the country’s greenhouse gases. The hub could be developed in existing industrial regions such as Grangemouth in Scotland, in South Wales or in England at Merseyside, Teeside, Humberside or Southampton. The announcement comes as delegates from more than 190 countries meet in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius this century.  Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 43 percent since 1990, meaning it is more than half way towards meeting a legally binding target to cut them by 2050 to 80 percent below 1990 levels.

2018-12-13,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: U.S. soybean exports to China and others: tmsnrt.rs/2Q3DCbZ By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 13 (Reuters) - There is a risk that investors will get carried away with optimism over an easing of the U.S.-China trade dispute on the back of China resuming purchases of U.S. soybeans. This is especially the case given there is yet no sign of new imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal, the energy commodities that will provide a far better signal of any detente in the trade spat. China ended a six-month boycott of buying U.S. soybeans on Wednesday, with state-owned companies purchasing at least 500,000 tonnes of the oilseed, traders said. Traders also said it appears the Chinese may seek more soybeans in coming weeks as they are struggling to meet all their import requirements from other suppliers. This sounds extremely positive for U.S. President Donald Trump and the trade war truce he claimed to have brokered with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Argentina earlier this month. It may well be the first sign of a major thaw between the two administrations, and it may even herald the start of positive moves towards some kind of settlement that would see no more tariffs being imposed, and perhaps even the removal of the ones already implemented. But it’s also worth putting things in context. China used to be the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, taking about 60 percent of exports in 2017, worth an estimated $12 billion. However, since Beijing slapped a tariff on soybean imports from the United States, the trade has fallen away, with U.S. exports to China dropping to 8.2 million tonnes in the first 10 months of the year, down from 21.4 million in the same period last year, according to government figures. What this shows is that China would have to dramatically boost its buying from the United States to return to former levels, which makes the recent 500,000-tonnes purchase a spit in the bucket. It’s also likely that China finds it convenient to go back to the U.S. market at the present time, given the U.S. crop is ready for export, while that from southern hemisphere rival Brazil isn’t. This means there is a seasonal element to trade in soybeans, and the Chinese government may have had little choice but to resume U.S. imports, but they have done so in a way that delivers Trump a little victory that may appease the mercurial U.S. president. What would be far more significant than buying some cargoes of soybeans, which China needs anyway, is the resumption of imports of energy commodities. One of Trump’s aims in starting a trade fight with Beijing was that he wanted to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, but the opposite has proven to be the case. While Trump focused on putting tariffs on imports from China, the Chinese simply stopped the one area of trade that was growing rapidly and helping lower the trade imbalance, namely imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States - about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. But this dropped to zero in October, and in November one cargo of U.S. crude was discharged, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. More importantly, there is no sign of the trade resuming, with no cargoes currently booked to arrive in December, or beyond, according to the data. It’s worth noting that crude oil isn’t subject to any Chinese import tariff, although LNG and coal are. In LNG, no U.S. cargoes of LNG arrived in China in October, although two were discharged in November. However, no cargoes are slated for arrival in December or beyond. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. China imported zero U.S. coal in October, two cargoes totalling about 211,000 tonnes in November, and none are scheduled to arrive in December or January. In the first nine months of the year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, the majority of this being higher-value metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Obviously this situation can change, and Chinese importers of crude, LNG and coal may well choose to resume buying from the United States. But, perhaps unlike soybeans, they don’t have to as there are currently plenty of alternative suppliers. If there really was a detente looming in the U.S.-China trade dispute, then a clear sign of that would be a resumption of energy imports.

2018-12-13,"SAO PAULO/LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil’s epic “Car Wash” corruption investigation has taken down presidents and elite businessmen, and led to the largest corporate leniency deal ever signed.  But graft allegations lodged by prosecutors last week against four of the world’s largest oil trading companies - Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL], Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], Glencore PLC and Mercuria Energy Group - have opened an explosive new phase in the long-running probe. Federal prosecutors allege the European multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras  to sell them oil at sweetheart prices. They said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by creativity, competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks, allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries.  Emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections, authorities said. Some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked Petrobras employees.  Prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favor of the big oil-trading firms. Some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals. One intermediary griped that Vitol was “not at all sentimental” and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns. “Now you are the flavor of the month, next month there is a new flavor,” the middleman lamented in the email. Brazilian authorities last week searched the Rio de Janeiro-area offices of Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme. Police said they could not locate a physical office in Brazil for Mercuria. No charges have been filed. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations.  Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously.  Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption. Eight people have been arrested, including two employees of Petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of “strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities,” the company said in a written statement.  Interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside Brazil, including a Petrobras trader based in Houston. None have been arrested. The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the three others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading. They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world, including in Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina’s gross domestic product. Brazilian federal Judge Gabriela Hardt, as part of her legal order authorizing last week’s arrests and search warrants, wrote “there is proof” the companies and their affiliates “paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from Petrobras, to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the state-run company.”   The stakes are high for the trading firms. The probe could jeopardize their current and future business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer. A Vitol-led consortium has a $1.5 billion deal pending to purchase Petrobras’ stake in prized Nigerian oilfields. The new developments also signal that Brazil’s landmark Car Wash probe may be far from over. Launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the law-enforcement juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures, including the former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazil’s Odebrecht SA[ODBES.UL], Latin America’s largest construction firm, in 2016 cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least $3.5 billion for its role in a massive bribes-for-contracts ring. Foreign firms are now in the crosshairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. “All foreign companies that have done business with Petrobras in the past 15 years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations, to have confidence that they are not exposed to Car Wash,” Costa told Reuters. He said several foreign oil companies had already approached Brazilian prosecutors to “sound them out” about leniency deals. Costa would not disclose names of the firms. Some of Brazil’s political class have maneuvered to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralyzed key sectors of the economy. But President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is under pressure from the public to keep going. He has chosen Sergio Moro, a crusading judge who led Car Wash, to be Brazil’s next Justice Minister. “Car Wash will continue its brutal transformation of Brazil’s corporate culture,” said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Brazilian business school. “It is not going to stop.”      Costa said the supply and refining units at Petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery.  Traders in the company’s far-flung offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from Petrobras executives, he said. Because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on liters, Costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight, with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved. Brazilian authorities allege that Petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate, and also sold them Petrobras oil products and storage leases at below-market rates, hurting the state-run firm’s bottom line, authorities said.   Prosecutors say Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with Petrobras insiders. Authorities allege the illicit funds moved through U.S. and European banks, among others.  A pivotal figure, Brazilian authorities allege, was Swedish-national Bo Hans Wilhelm Ljungberg, an independent oil broker who operated out of Rio de Janeiro. They say he was a key agent who secured business for Vitol and other firms by funneling bribes to Petrobras traders, in particular to one in Houston. Vitol’s first business relationship with Ljungberg dates back to the 1990s when it bought one of his companies; more recently, he acted as an agent, Vitol said. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg, who prosecutors said returned to Sweden. He did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents, nor to messages sent to social media accounts. Prosecutors allege Vitol paid just over $5 million to offshore trading entities that Ljungberg co-owned called Encom Trading SA and Celixore AB to secure deals with Petrobras between 2011 and 2014. Prosecutors showed Reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms’ accounts. Judge Hardt’s ruling said that one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, was “fully aware” that Ljungberg was securing Vitol’s business through bribes, based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the Swede about the alleged scheme. Loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media. As for Trafigura, prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe Petrobras employees. Judge Hardt’s order alleges that Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura top executive, and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes, a local country representative, funneled bribes to Petrobras employees between mid-2009 and September 2014.    Lawyers for Ferraz and Magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment. Ferraz is already serving a 10-year sentence in Brazil for bribing a former Petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was arrested in late 2016 and resigned from Trafigura.    Prosecutors allege that Magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies, including Glencore’s fully-owned subsidiary Chemoil.     Apart from payments via Magalhaes, Glencore subsidiaries paid $4 million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed Petrobras officials, the judge’s ruling said.     Prosecutors say that they know the least about Mercuria’s dealings with Petrobras. They said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company’s representatives in Brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Climate change talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the 2015 Paris global warming deal are in their last week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s coal mining district. Below is a look at the latest mood round the event, in a sprawl of temporary passageways and rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped venue on the site of the former Katowice coal mine.  The Polish presidency of the climate conference is expected to present a draft of the final package to include a rule book to implement the Paris pact, a deal on climate change finance, and another accord increasing ambitions to curb emissions. The draft will be shown to delegates around 1600 GMT and ministers will endeavour to get an acceptable version by the end of the conference on Friday. “The text should be getting cleaned up and we should see where the landing ground is for the different pieces of the package, but we are not there right now,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “Every country here needs to take a step back and remember why we are here. Our very humanity is at stake.” It remains unclear how delegates will finalise a deal to implement the Paris agreement - which aims to restrict warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - and whether the package would take into consideration the latest U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.  “If it is not sorted by Saturday, then it won’t be sorted,” a delegate said as corridor talk turned from how long into the weekend the talks may continue to whether they could collapse.  Countries most vulnerable to climate change called for the conference to send a strong signal that ambitions to reduce global emissions should be enhanced by 2020. But Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives, a nation threatened by climate change, said nothing seems to have changed since he last addressed a climate summit a decade ago.  “A whole dictionary of words has been born into these climate conferences. We go round and round and round with these words and end up not getting anywhere. “Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.”   The Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, was a top billing on the list of speakers. But by the time he got on stage during the plenary on late Wednesday night, after a marathon session with over 100 speakers, there was barely a soul in the hall to hear him.  He said “unequivocally that the oil industry must remain and be part of the solution to the climate change challenge”, and that OPEC members also believe there is no plan B.

2018-12-13,"MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCA) could review its 5 billion euro (4.5 billion pounds) Italian investment plan, which includes a shift to cleaner engines, if Rome raises taxes on petrol and diesel cars. “Were these measures to be confirmed as of 2019, a thorough examination of their impact and an update to plans already announced would be necessary,” FCA’s (FCHA.MI) Europe head, Pietro Gorlier, said in a letter to government representatives in the northern Piedmont region, where some of the new investment would be targeted.  In an amendment to the 2019 budget law passed in Italy’s lower house last week, the government approved subsidies of up to 6,000 euros for lower emission vehicles, but included a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros on petrol and diesel cars.  However, the government immediately vowed to change it in the Senate, where it will be voted on next, after one of the ruling parties contested the measure. Italy’s ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - have been at odds over the issue, with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars, while the pro-environment 5-Star has encouraged the new rules. Unions and auto sector associations have also warned about the proposed new tax, saying it would hurt not only the carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs. FCA said last month it plans to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and cleaner engines in Italy over the next three years to boost jobs and profitability. 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has since said the government would seek to improve the measures to not harm families in difficulties and to not create a shock to the Italian economy. “We will find a solution ... without damaging or causing a shock to companies’ industrial plans,” Di Maio said when asked about Gorlier’s letter. Possible changes to the amendment could result in the exclusion of smaller-engine vehicles from the proposed tax, government officials have said. “The sector scenario has been significantly modified by interventions in the car market under discussion in the budget law, which in our opinion alter the whole framework within which we outlined our plan for Italy,” FCA’s Gorlier said. “At the moment we do not yet have visibility on what the regulatory scenario will be in the coming years,” he added.

2018-12-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A growing percentage of Americans see climate change as an “imminent” threat driven mainly by human activity, and more than two-thirds want Washington to work with other nations to combat it, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday. The public concern over global warming in the United States clashes with President Donald Trump’s policies aimed at maximizing fossil fuels production and dismantling climate protections he views as too onerous and costly for industry. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, an accord to curb global warming struck by nearly 200 nations in 2015 that he said would kill American jobs and have no tangible environmental benefit.  Delegates from over 130 countries are now meeting in the Polish city of Katowice to write a rulebook for the deal and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday warned failure to reach an agreement would be suicidal. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken from Nov. 29 to Dec. 10, found that 35 percent of U.S. adults now see global warming as an “imminent” threat, up from 32 percent in 2017 and 24 percent in 2015. More than half, or 57 percent, also think global warming is caused by “human activity” or “mostly human activity”, according to the survey, up from the 47 percent who attributed it to human activity in a similar poll in 2012. And 69 percent said in the poll that the United States should work with other nations to curb climate change, including 64 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats. That marks a decline from 72 percent in a similar poll in 2017. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,660 adults in English in the United States and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points. The survey came close on the heels of a U.S. government report released last month that said climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, undermining health, infrastructure, and industries from farming to energy production. Trump rejected the report’s findings, saying “I don’t believe it.” The White House said the report relied on faulty methodology and that the next assessment of the threats posed by climate change would be more transparent and data driven. The United States has seen a surge in oil and gas output in the past decade, due mainly to advances in drilling technology, and this year became the world’s top producer of petroleum ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.

2018-12-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Authorities in China’s major steelmaking cities of Tangshan and Xuzhou have asked mills to curtail output as city officials are concerned they will not meet their pollution reduction targets for the year. The Tangshan city government ordered steel mills to comply with cuts mandated under a so-called first-level smog alert, meaning production should be cut by 40 percent, from the current second-level alert with cuts of only 30 percent, according to a notice sent to municipal officials on Tuesday that was reviewed by Reuters.  Mills will also be required to shut all sintering machines, facilities that process raw iron ore before being smelted into steel, and shaft furnaces that have failed to meet ultra-low emission standards, the document said. “The government told us to trim out more output due to bad air,” said an executive at a steel mill in Tangshan who received the notice.      A manager from Donghai Special Steel Co in Tangshan also confirmed to Reuters that she received the notice to curtail production.        Both officials declined to be named as they are not authorized to talk to media. An official at the Luannan county government, part of the Tangshan metropolitan government confirmed receiving the statement but declined to comment on the detailed measures.  The propaganda department for the Tangshan city government referred questions to the city’s emergency command center. However, a person contacted at the center said they were not authorized to speak to the media. Meanwhile, the city of Xuxhou in China’s No.2 steelmaking province of Jiangsu, 800 km (500 miles) south of Tangshan, ordered steel mills to shut down operations throughout December. “We were ordered on Tuesday to stop production until Dec. 31 as the city government has struggled to reach pollution targets,” said an executive at Xuzhou Jinhong Iron and Steel Co.  Reuters could not confirm the Xuzhou government order with officials contacted at Xuzhou Dongnan Iron and Steel Group, one of the three mills that operate in the city.

2018-12-13,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A consortium led by Electricité de France SA is ready to fill the reservoir of a hydroelectric dam built in Brazil’s soy belt, but could be delayed by a year over removal of trees from the area to be flooded, the company and state officials said. Prosecutors are asking Mato Grosso’s state environmental agency to deny the 402 megawatt UHE Sinop dam an operating license until all the vegetation is cleared, which could add 400 million reais ($103 million) to its 2.9 billion reais price tag. If the trees are not removed, environmentalists say, the wood will rot in the water and create methane gas emissions that will contribute to global warming and pollute downstream waters for indigenous communities that live off fishing. Jean-Christophe Delvallet, chief executive officer of Sinop Energia, in which EDF has a 51 percent stake, said the company has already started to buy energy on the market to fulfill its obligations to supply Brazil’s national grid starting January 1. State-run Eletrobras, Brazil’s biggest utility company and whose privatization is being studied by the incoming government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, holds the remaining 49 percent through two subsidiaries, Eletronorte and Chesf. About 75 percent of Brazil’s electricity comes from hydropower and the country is the world’s third largest producer of hydroelectricity, behind China and Canada. Bolsonaro, a right-wing politician who takes office Jan. 1 with strong backing from the farming and agribusiness sectors, plans to relax rules for environmental licensing and revive plans to build dams held up by environmental criticism and resistance from indigenous tribes. With the rainy season beginning and lasting through May, Sinop Energia is running out of time. “This is really the time to start filling the reservoir. If not, the major risk would be losing the hydrological window, which would delay power generation for many months, until even a year,” Delvallet said by telephone. According to documents seen by Reuters, the prosecutors say the company has only removed 8,000 hectares of vegetation from the 34,000-hectare area to be flooded. They also dispute the mathematical model used by Sinop Energia to argue that the remaining trees will not pollute the environment with methane. Delvallet said his company has suppressed 46 percent of the relevant reservoir vegetation and is negotiating an agreement. A meeting is scheduled for Friday to find a solution, state prosecutor Joelson Maciel said by telephone. “If the wood is not removed, our concern is that the water of the reservoir will become a soup that will be highly damaging for the environment and increase greenhouse gases,” Maciel said. The prosecutors backed up their case with a study by climate change expert Philip Fearnside, a critic of plans to build more hydroelectric dams in Amazonia, the world’s largest rainforest. He  contributed to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 jointly with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Although proponents see hydroelectric dams as a renewable source of energy, they emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, especially methane, which has a greater impact per ton of gas than carbon dioxide in the short term, Fearnside said by email.  “Sinop is an important case not only because of potential impacts there, but also as a precedent for what happens with the many planned dams in Amazonia,” said Fearnside, who works at the Amazon National Institute of Research in Manaus. Sinop, a major soy producing area, is on the border of the Amazon region and the dam has been built on the Teles Pires river that flows north into the Amazon.

2018-12-13,"SAO PAULO/LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil’s epic “Car Wash” corruption investigation has taken down presidents and elite businessmen, and led to the largest corporate leniency deal ever signed.  But graft allegations lodged by prosecutors last week against four of the world’s largest oil trading companies - Vitol SA, Trafigura, Glencore PLC (GLEN.L) and Mercuria Energy Group - have opened an explosive new phase in the long-running probe. Federal prosecutors allege the European multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to sell them oil at sweetheart prices. They said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fuelled by creativity, competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks, allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries.  Emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections, authorities said. Some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked Petrobras employees.  Prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favour of the big oil-trading firms. Some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals. One intermediary griped that Vitol was “not at all sentimental” and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns. “Now you are the flavour of the month, next month there is a new flavour,” the middleman lamented in the email. Brazilian authorities last week searched the Rio de Janeiro-area offices of Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme. Police said they could not locate a physical office in Brazil for Mercuria. No charges have been filed. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations.  Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously.  Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption. Eleven people had arrest warrants issued against them, including one current employee of Petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of “strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities,” the company said in a written statement. Eight total people have been arrested, including four former Petrobras employees. Interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside Brazil. None have been arrested. The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the three others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading. They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world, including in Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina’s gross domestic product. Brazilian federal Judge Gabriela Hardt, as part of her legal order authorizing last week’s arrests and search warrants, wrote “there is proof” the companies and their affiliates “paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from Petrobras, to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the state-run company.”   The stakes are high for the trading firms. The probe could jeopardize their current and future business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer. A Vitol-led consortium has a $1.5 billion deal pending to purchase Petrobras’ stake in prized Nigerian oilfields. The new developments also signal that Brazil’s landmark Car Wash probe may be far from over. Launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the law-enforcement juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures, including the former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazil’s Odebrecht SA[ODBES.UL], Latin America’s largest construction firm, in 2016 cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least $3.5 billion for its role in a massive bribes-for-contracts ring. Foreign firms are now in the crosshairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. “All foreign companies that have done business with Petrobras in the past 15 years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations, to have confidence that they are not exposed to Car Wash,” Costa told Reuters. He said several foreign oil companies had already approached Brazilian prosecutors to “sound them out” about leniency deals. Costa would not disclose names of the firms. Some of Brazil’s political class have manoeuvred to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralysed key sectors of the economy. But President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is under pressure from the public to keep going. He has chosen Sergio Moro, a crusading judge who led Car Wash, to be Brazil’s next Justice Minister. “Car Wash will continue its brutal transformation of Brazil’s corporate culture,” said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Brazilian business school. “It is not going to stop.”      Costa said the supply and refining units at Petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery.  Traders in the company’s far-flung offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from Petrobras executives, he said. Because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on litres, Costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight, with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved. Brazilian authorities allege that Petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate, and also sold them Petrobras oil products and storage leases at below-market rates, hurting the state-run firm’s bottom line, authorities said.   Prosecutors say Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with Petrobras insiders. Authorities allege the illicit funds moved through U.S. and European banks, among others.  A pivotal figure, Brazilian authorities allege, was Swedish-national Bo Hans Wilhelm Ljungberg, an independent oil broker who operated out of Rio de Janeiro. They say he was a key agent who secured business for Vitol and other firms by funnelling bribes to Petrobras traders, in particular to one in Houston. He already faces a corruption charge in a separate Car Wash case. Vitol’s first business relationship with Ljungberg dates back to the 1990s when it bought one of his companies; more recently, he acted as an agent, Vitol said. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg, who prosecutors said returned to Sweden. He did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents, nor to messages sent to social media accounts. Prosecutors allege Vitol paid just over $5 million to offshore trading entities that Ljungberg co-owned called Encom Trading SA and Celixore AB to secure deals with Petrobras between 2011 and 2014. Prosecutors showed Reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms’ accounts. Judge Hardt’s ruling said that one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, was “fully aware” that Ljungberg was securing Vitol’s business through bribes, based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the Swede about the alleged scheme. Loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media. As for Trafigura, prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe Petrobras employees. Judge Hardt’s order alleges that Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura top executive, and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes, a local country representative, funnelled bribes to Petrobras employees between mid-2009 and September 2014.    Lawyers for Ferraz and Magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment. Ferraz is already serving a 10-year sentence in Brazil for bribing a former Petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was arrested in late 2016 and resigned from Trafigura. Prosecutors allege that Magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies, including Glencore’s fully-owned subsidiary Chemoil. Apart from payments via Magalhaes, Glencore subsidiaries paid $4 million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed Petrobras officials, the judge’s ruling said.     Prosecutors say that they know the least about Mercuria’s dealings with Petrobras. They said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company’s representatives in Brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Decades of efforts to curb climate-changing emissions are failing, leaving not just small islands but “every country” at this year’s U.N. climate talks facing the threat of disaster, former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed warned on Thursday. “Carbon emissions keep rising and rising and rising, and all we seem to be doing is talking and talking and talking. We are not winning the battle,” said Nasheed, who is leading his Indian Ocean island state’s negotiating team at the talks in Poland. The slow pace of the negotiations - and lagging efforts to change government and business policies - run contrary to stark warnings in an October science report that the world has about 12 years left to clean up its energy system or face potentially catastrophic consequences. Failure to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) or less, compared to pre-industrial times, would likely lead to worsening water and food shortages, rising poverty, more destructive disasters and accelerating natural losses, scientists warned. “The 1.5 report took away all places to hide, all the kicking the can down the road,” said Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) and special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sustainable energy. Governments and businesses must “swallow” the report, “not chew on it”, she said. “That’s the urgency we’re missing here,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But speeding up efforts to switch to clean energy and prepare vulnerable communities for harsher climate impacts is proving frustratingly intractable, for many reasons. A recent plan by French President Emmanuel Macron to hike taxes on diesel, for instance, was a trigger for widespread protests over declining living standards. That has spooked government officials who in 2015 signed the Paris Agreement to curb climate change, experts say. “We have gone from the Paris of 2015 to the Paris of 2018,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, a climate economist and co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “People here (at the talks) say that what we learned from Paris 2018 is that to impose a carbon price on electricity, heat or gasoline is an incredibly bad idea, that for a politician it’s political suicide,” he said. But that view is “a complete misrepresentation”, he added, calling France’s tax poorly thought out and badly handled. It is a combination of low fuel prices worldwide, huge subsidies for fossil fuels and rising interest rates that is making the higher upfront cost of solar and wind power harder to afford and slowing down climate action, Edenhofer said. Countries that want to curb global warming should make sure changes do not hit wallets, and work to reduce widening social inequality, to build trust in government, he said. Growing concerns about air pollution around the world are driving demand for action in some regions, particularly Asian countries such as South Korea and China. In Korea, it has become “the number one issue in elections”, said Frank Rijsberman, director-general of the Global Green Growth Institute, based in Seoul. That has led a government that previously was not really interested in renewable energy to say it intends to phase out coal - though relatively slowly, Rijsberman said. Globally, too many national and multilateral banks are still offering to fund new coal plants, even as scientists say coal use must end rapidly, SEforALL’s Kyte said. “If you ratified the Paris Agreement, no instrument of your government lending should be supporting coal anywhere, period,” she insisted. To grow more cleanly, power-hungry developing countries need to find it as easy to add renewable power capacity as coal or other fossil fuel plants, she added. But so far a lack of big investors in clean power, a shortage of affordable finance to cover its higher initial costs, and insufficient expertise in new technologies mean coal remains an easier option, Kyte said. Pushing businesses and banks to change faster is likely to require making now-voluntary disclosure of climate-related financial risks mandatory “as soon as possible”, she said. Nasheed of the Maldives agreed it was time to up the pressure. ""We are still begging the big polluters to stop polluting on ethical grounds - but they are not listening to us,"" he said.

In the United States, the Dow and S&P 500 were modestly higher while the Nasdaq showed slight losses. Investors have been cautiously optimistic about U.S.-China trade progress, but nervousness has bred volatility. Over the past two sessions, stock indexes gave up most early gains. In Beijing, a commerce ministry spokesman said China and the United States are in close contact over trade, and any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit. Stock market trading “is going to be choppy surrounding the resolution of the trade talks until we see some clarity,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “The market is approaching a seasonally positive time of the year, but right now we have uncertainty about trade and looks like that’s going to drive volatility.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.07 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,588.34, the S&P 500 gained 1.45 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,652.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.19 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,084.12. U.S. economic data showed initial jobless claims fell last week to near 49-year lows, while import prices dropped as the cost of petroleum products tumbled. Shares in Europe will little changed in see-saw trade as investors remained uncertain about Britain’s exit from the European Union. Italian stocks outperforme on hopes of a compromise over Rome’s contested budget. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.13 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.09 percent. Britain’s weakened prime minister, Theresa May, survived a late night no-confidence vote, and then said she did not expect a quick breakthrough in Brexit talks that would help get the deal through parliament. The European Central Bank officially ended its post-crisis asset purchase program but promised to keep feeding stimulus into an economy struggling with an unexpected slowdown and political turmoil. The euro and sterling both fell on Brexit uncertainty and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi following a central bank announcement investors viewed as dovish. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.16 percent to $1.135. Sterling was last trading at $1.2623, down 0.05 percent on the day. Oil prices edged higher after data showed inventory declines in the United States and as investors began to expect the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than previously thought.

2018-12-13,"OSLO (Reuters) - Whatever the outcome of Britain’s tortuous divorce proceedings from Europe, there appears to be little help waiting in the wings from non-EU member Norway to join its own special relationship with the bloc. Some Brexit supporters in Britain have touted a so-called “Norway-plus” scenario, whereby the world’s fifth largest economy would emulate the Scandinavian country in finding its own tailored deal with the European Union.  Their idea has not gained much domestic momentum.  But even so, in Oslo, there would be low prospects of consensus for any potential U.K. bid to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - between Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein Switzerland and the European Union - which it left in 1973. Prime Minister Erna Solberg did tell Reuters that Oslo could lend a hand, but there would be little support from others in her governing coalition or the opposition Labour party, Norway’s biggest party, on a major issue needing consensus. Politicians say the nations’ interests are too diverse - even though Britain is Norway’s biggest trading partner - and they worry U.K. entry to EFTA could swamp other members.  Currently the second largest EU economy, Britain has 66 million people, versus EFTA nations’ combined 14 million. “Norwegian interests are quite different from British interests,” Anniken Huitfeldt, leader of parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee, told Reuters, citing fisheries and agriculture policies. “I do not see the need to extend an invitation for Britain to join EFTA,” said Huitfeldt, a Labour lawmaker. Norway imposes high tariffs on food to protect farmers in a nation that stretches into the Arctic, whereas Britain is a major food exporter. Another concern is that London could veto future EFTA decisions, said Abid Raja, vice president of parliament of the centrist Liberal party that is part of Solberg’s coalition. “Norway must think of its own interests and what is best there is that Britain holds a new referendum and stays in the EU,” he told Reuters. Under its arrangements, Norway is currently part of the EU single market - which allows for free movement of goods, capital, services and people - but not the customs union. With the Norwegian public largely disinterested in the issue, the only political support for Britain joining EFTA seems to be from two small parties, the Socialist Left and the Centre Party, which want to renegotiate Norway’s entire relations with the EU. They think British membership of EFTA would give Oslo better bargaining power with Brussels.  “Northern European countries would have a stronger negotiating position and could assess together what kind of relationship we would want to have with the EU,” Torgeir Knag Fylkesnes, a Socialist Left lawmaker told Reuters.  “We could ... have a better deal for democracy and Norwegian business.”  Additional reporting by Terje Solsvik in Oslo, William Schomberg in London; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-norway/norwegians-nonplussed-at-norway-plus-brexit-idea-idUKL8N1YH4L8,13 Dec 2018,"Whatever the outcome of Britain's

2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity-backed oil firm Chrysaor has hired advisers ahead of talks to buy Chevron’s (CVX.N) British North Sea oil and gas fields for over $2.5 billion (1.97 billion pounds), industry and banking sources said. Chrysaor has signed up investment banks Jefferies and BMO for the discussions as a deadline for bids approaches before Christmas, the four sources said. Chevron said earlier this year it was selling its assets in the central North Sea, which are expected to fetch around $1.5 billion. Chrysaor and Chevron are also discussing the sale of part or all of the U.S. group’s 19.4 percent stake in the BP-operated (BP.L) Clair field, the largest oilfield in the British North Sea, which was not originally up for grabs, the sources said. The Clair stake could easily fetch $1 billion, they said. A Chevron spokeswoman said the company does not comment on industry speculation or commercial matters. Asked about interest in its Clair stake, she said: “While we continue to evaluate our portfolio we are progressing the Clair projects.” Chrysaor, Jefferies and BMO declined to comment.  Chevron’s shares were down 0.9 percent at 1436 GMT, compared with a 0.3 percent decline for the broader sector index .SXEP. Chevron’s net daily production in the North Sea in 2017 averaged 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to its website. The California-based company kicked off in July the sale of its central North Sea oil and gas fields Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin, Erskine and Jade as well as the Britannia platform and its satellites. On Tuesday, Chevron said Britain’s Oil and Gas Authority had approved its development plans for the Captain field. In October, Chevron sold its 40 percent stake in the Rosebank development to Norway’s Equinor. Selling the central North Sea assets as well as the Clair stake would effectively mark Chevron’s full exit from the ageing UK North Sea basin after over 50 years. Chevron has in recent years focused its efforts on rapidly growing its shale production in the Permian basin in Texas as well as the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan.     Chrysaor, backed by Harbour Energy, an investment vehicle of EIG Global Energy Partners, became one of the largest North Sea producers after buying $3 billion of oil and gas fields from Royal Dutch Shell in 2017. With its current portfolio, Chrysaor expects daily production averaging 120,000-130,000 barrels of oil equivalent until 2020.

2018-12-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Green energy is on track to overtake coal as Germany’s main power source this year, with renewables set to cover a record 38 percent of the country’s electricity consumption, two percent up from 2017, two energy industry groups said on Thursday. The figures from the energy industry group BDEW and research institute ZSW confirm their forecast in early November, which predicted the increase in green power’s share of electricity consumption. Renewable production as a single category has been closing in on the contribution of individual fossil fuels in Germany since the country embarked on a path towards greater reliance on wind and solar last decade. The renewables contribution is politically significant in Europe’s biggest economy, which wants the share of renewables to reach 65 percent by 2030.     The final numbers each year depend on weather patterns, which have to produce high enough wind speeds and sunshine to fuel turbines and solar panels. An extensive drought since the spring of 2018 resulted in a fall in hydroelectric power production by 16 percent year-on-year to a total of 17 billion kWh, the two groups noted in a statement. But the expansion of renewables as a whole continued, allowing green power to overtake the share of imported hard coal and domestic brown coal. The two fuels met 36 percent of power consumption in the first nine months of the year. Germany relies on a mixture of coal, renewables, nuclear and gas for its energy. For the full year, output from renewable power sources such as wind, solar, biomass and hydropower plants will contribute a total 229 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), the two parties said in the statement. This accounts for 38 percent of recorded electricity usage of 599 billion kWh. The 38 percent was made up of onshore wind supplying 16 percent, offshore wind with 3 percent, biomass with 8 percent, photovoltaics with 8 percent, hydropower with 3 percent, and waste and geothermal energy supplying 1 percent. The share of green energy had reached 36.1 percent of consumption last year. BDEW’s managing director, Stefan Kapferer, said that Germany’s 65-percent target would require further efforts to expand wind power and power transport links. ZSW board chairman Frithjof Staiss said given the growing share of variable green power production there also needed to be  improved power storage facilities and demand management. Separately, the power industry wants the government to enforce more carbon dioxide reductions from the heat and transport sectors to help Germany to meet its climate goals. Staiss said the car industry had not improved its CO2 record in 15 years.

2018-12-13,"(Reuters) - There is a 90 percent chance of the El Niño weather pattern emerging during the northern hemisphere winter 2018-19, a U.S. government weather forecaster said on Thursday. “The official forecast favors the formation of a weak El Niño,” the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) said in a monthly forecast. The expectation of the weather pattern continuing through spring next year stood at 60 percent, the CPC added. Last month, the weather forecaster pegged the chances of the El Niño emerging at 80 percent during the winter 2018-19 and 55-60 percent during the spring next year. The last El Niño, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, occurred from around 2015 to 2016 and caused weather-related crop damage, fires and flash floods.

2018-12-13,"JOHANNESBURG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa is unlikely to experience more power cuts until mid-January next year as electricity demands eases over the Christmas and New Year holiday season, state-owned utility Eskom said on Thursday. Eskom, which supplies South Africa with more than 90 percent of its electricity, began controlled power cuts late last month due to coal shortages and poor plant performance. The utility has not implemented power cuts, known as load-shedding, in the past four days, but has warned the power system remains vulnerable. “The probability of load-shedding remains low from today until Sunday 13 January 2019,” Eskom said in a statement. “This is as a result of the expected decrease in demand as businesses and industries close down for the festive break.” Eskom said it would intensify maintenance activities in December to improve generation capacity in preparation for the return of businesses and industries in the new year. Separately, Eskom said on Thursday that it had signed a 1.5 billion rand ($106 million) loan agreement with French government agency Agence Française de Développement (AFD) to help it extend and strengthen its power transmission grid. The funds are the first tranche of a 6.5 billion rand multi-tranche loan facility signed in March 2017. Eskom is facing a severe financial crisis and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said last week that the government was considering restructuring the company’s debt. The cash-strapped power firm has said it wants the government to take on 100 billion rand of its debts, about a quarter of its total borrowings of 420 billion rand. It is also eyeing a steep hike in tariffs from the energy regulator in 2019. $1 = 14.1500 rand

2018-12-13,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s monthly oil imports from Iran plunged to their lowest in a year in November with Tehran dropping two places to become only the sixth biggest supplier after New Delhi cut purchases due to the impact of U.S. sanctions, according to ship tracking data and industry sources. Last month, the United States introduced tough sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s oil revenue-dependent economy. Washington did, though, give a six-month waiver from sanctions to eight nations, including India, and allowed them to import some Iranian oil. India is restricted to buying 1.25 million tonnes per month, or about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). In November, India imported about 276,000 bpd of Iranian oil, a decline of about 41 percent from October and about 4 percent more than the year-ago month, ship tracking data obtained from shipping and trade sources showed. After abandoning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. India’s imports from Iran in November, included some parcels that were loaded in October. In November, Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be the top two oil sellers to India.  The UAE, which was the sixth biggest oil seller to India in October, became the third top seller to India in November, knocking down Venezuela by a notch to fourth position.  Nigeria continued at No. 5 position, while Iran slipped to sixth place.      “Iran do not have vessels to export oil on time ... some November loading vessels will arrive in December,” said an industry source, with knowledge of the matter. Local and international shippers are not carrying Iranian cargoes despite India winning a waiver, this source said. The key problem is that while India can import Iranian oil without falling foul of Washington, that may not apply to a shipping company signing a new delivery contract. Instead, India is relying on Iranian tankers for crude imports and Iran is using many of its vessels for crude storage. The sources declined to be identified citing the confidentiality of the numbers. Indian refiners, wary of the impact of U.S. sanctions, had boosted imports from Iran ahead of their introduction, with imports averaging about 563,000 bpd in April-November, a growth of about 32 percent from a low base in the previous fiscal year, the data showed. (For an interactive graphic on 'India's Oil Imports From Iran' click tmsnrt.rs/2SIFkfF) In the previous financial year to March 2018 India had cut oil imports from Iran due to a dispute over development rights of a giant gas field.  Iran was hoping to sell more than 500,000 bpd of oil to India in 2018/19, its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said in February, and had offered almost free shipping and an extended credit period to boost sales to India. Government sources say Reuters’ calculations showing India’s oil imports from Iran in this fiscal year would be higher than the 452,000 bpd, or 22.6 million tonnes, it imported in the previous year, are correct. During January-November this year India’s oil imports from Iran rose by an annual 18.4 percent to 552,000 bpd, the data showed.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Maldives will do all in its power to keep “our heads above water”, the head of its delegation at U.N. climate talks said on Thursday in an impassioned appeal for nations to overcome their divisions over how to tackle global warming. The low-lying Maldives is among countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and coral reef deterioration. “We are not prepared to die. We are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis. Instead, we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water,” Mohamed Nasheed told delegates at the talks in Katowice, Poland. “Climate change is a national security issue for us. It is an existential threat,” he said, adding that a rise in global temperatures could still be avoided but countries had to unite. Nasheed was the Maldives’ first democratically elected leader but was ousted in 2012 in a coup, imprisoned then granted asylum in Britain. The Maldives’ current president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, invited Nasheed to head the country’s negotiating delegation at the Katowice talks, which are aimed at agreeing rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. With less than two days until the conference is formally scheduled to end, delegates are still grappling with many issues - not just how the accord will be implemented - including finance, strengthening emissions cuts and monitoring action. A draft, more concise text of the deal should be available later on Thursday but it is expected to still be laden with brackets for wording to be decided on and gaps. Since last addressing a U.N. climate conference in 2009, Nasheed said he had been deposed in a coup, imprisoned and then forced into exile. “But almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. We are still using the same old, dinosaur language,” he said. “Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.”  Reporting by Nina Chestney and Bate Felix; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord-maldives/maldives-tells-un-climate-talks-we-are-not-prepared-to-die-idUKL8N1YI440,13 Dec 2018,"The Maldives will do

2018-12-13,"* Milan trial related to same oil deal ongoing * Nigeria also suing JPMorgan over transfers for same deal (Adds detail) LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government said it had filed a $1.1 billion lawsuit against Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in a commercial court in London on Thursday in relation to a 2011 oilfield deal. The OPL 245 oilfield is also at the heart of an ongoing corruption trial in Milan in which former and current Shell and Eni officials are on the bench. Milan prosecutors allege bribes totalling around $1.1 billion were paid to win the licence to explore the field which, because of disputes, has never entered into production. The new London case also relates to payments made by the companies to get the OPL 245 oilfield licence in 2011. “It is alleged that purchase monies purportedly paid to the Federal Republic of Nigeria were in fact immediately paid through to a company controlled by Dan Etete, formerly the Nigerian minister of petroleum, and used for, amongst other things, bribes and kickbacks,” Nigeria said on Thursday. “Accordingly, it is alleged that Shell and Eni engaged in bribery and unlawful conspiracy to harm the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that they dishonestly assisted corrupt Nigerian government officials.” The Nigerian attorney general’s office did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment. Shell said “the 2011 settlement of long-standing legal disputes related to OPL 245 was a fully legal transaction with Eni and the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by the most senior officials of the relevant ministries.” Eni said in an emailed statement it rejected “any allegation of impropriety or irregularity in connection with this transaction.” “Eni (...) signed a commercial agreement in 2011 for a new licence for OPL 245 with the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and the consideration for the license was paid directly to the Nigerian government,” it said. Nigeria has already filed a London case against U.S. bank JPMorgan for its role in transferring over $800 million of government funds to Etete, who has been convicted of money laundering. In another separate trial, a Milan court in September found a middleman guilty of corruption after prosecutors alleged he had received a mandate from Etete, who has denied any wrongdoing, to find a buyer for OPL 245, collecting $114 million for his services.

2018-12-13,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar installations fell 15 percent in the third quarter as the Trump administration’s tariffs on overseas-made panels forced developers to put off large projects, according to a report commissioned by the industry’s primary trade group. Current weakness in the utility-scale market, however, will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever, the report said. Quarterly installations of utility-scale solar were 678 megawatts, the lowest quarter since 2015 and a more than 30 percent decline from a year ago, the report by Wood Mackenzie for the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association said. The total market, which includes residential and commercial installations, came in at 1.7 gigawatts. The slowdown is a shift for solar, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade. Through the first three quarters of the year, solar accounted for 30 percent of electricity generating capacity additions. Large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the 30 percent tariffs as panels can account for up to half their costs. Trump announced the levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline. Solar installers opposed the move because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels. Most of the panels installed in the United States are made in Asia by companies including China’s JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Canadian Solar Inc, and U.S.-based SunPower Corp. Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2018 utility-scale forecast to 6.6 GW from 6.8 GW as more projects get pushed into 2019.  The firm raised its forecasts for 2019 through 2023 by a combined 2.5 GW, however, as utilities procure projects that will qualify for a federal tax credit that begins to phase out in 2020. Developers will start projects next year but delay buying modules until 2020 or later because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year. Sliding solar panel prices are also spurring demand from utilities.  A move by China earlier this year to slash subsidies for solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices. Solar energy system prices are at historical lows in all segments of the market, the report said. U.S. module prices are down more than 15 percent from a year ago.

Miners including BHP Billiton, Glencore , Anglo American and Peabody Energy use Aurizon’s four major railways in the state of Queensland to bring coal to port. Protracted negotiations over pay rises and rostering had broken down, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, which represents train crews and maintenance workers at Aurizon, said in a statement on Thursday. “Members ... will start walking off the job at midday tomorrow in 11 days of action,” the union said. Four days of stoppages and seven days of overtime bans are planned. Aurizon said in a statement that if the strikes go ahead, its coal trains would not run on its Blackwater and Moura networks for 24 hours from noon on Friday. Aurizon coal haulage on the Goonyella and Newlands lines would stop for 24 hours from noon on Saturday and on its corridor into Brisbane from noon on Monday for 24 hours. The lines connect the coal-rich Bowen Basin with ports on Australia’s east coast. “Aurizon has been bargaining in good faith (and) believes solid and constructive progress was being made,” Aurizon said in a statement. “Aurizon is urging the unions to withdraw their proposed industrial action. It is extremely disappointing that unions have elected to take this unnecessary and premature step.” Aurizon shares had risen 0.8 percent by mid-morning, while the broader market rose 0.3 percent.

After a quiet start, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up more than 1 percent by midday, building on early gains made after British Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote. Regional gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.4 percent. U.S. stock futures rose 0.5 percent, pointing to a firmer opening on Wall Street. Markets are slowly growing less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two powers. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. But markets have been stung by false signals in the past and Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines. “U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,” he said. “We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.” China also appears to be toning down its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed “Made in China 2025,” which has long irked the United States, according to new guidance to local governments. But it remains to be seen if Beijing will meet Washington’s demands for stronger protection for U.S. intellectual property. “In the scheme of things and were this to prove true, this is far more relevant than China agreeing to restart purchases of American soybeans, or even reducing the tariff on US car imports from 40 percent to 15 percent, as has been indicated in the last 24 hours,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a note. But China’s economic woes are deeper rooted than just trade, and global investors are also banking that Beijing will roll out more support measures in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities, said investor expectations of further policy support were rising ahead of a key policy meeting. The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) is typically held in mid-December. Major economic growth targets and policy goals are discussed but typically not publicly announced until the National People’s Congress in March. Some analysts expect China’s economic growth could slow to around 6 percent next year, the slowest pace since 1990, from around 6.5 percent in 2018. In the currency market, sterling gave up some gains after rallying from a 20-month low after May survived a party no-confidence vote. It was last trading down 0.04 percent at $1.2624 But analysts expect gains in the pound will be fleeting, as May appeared no closer to getting her EU divorce agreement through parliament, raising the risk of a chaotic exit in March. “The fact remains that the EU is highly unlikely to offer the reassurance MPs are demanding on the Irish backstop,” analysts at ING said, adding there was a risk that a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal will not take place until later in the first quarter of 2019. “In the meantime, the lack of clarity and elevated risk of ‘no deal’ is set to see economic activity slow further,” they said. ING expects UK growth to halve in the fourth quarter from the third. The euro was also higher, up 0.04 percent at $1.1375 after Italy’s government offered to lower its deficit target next year to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product, below the 2.4 percent level that the European Commission had rejected as too high. The European Central Bank is all but certain to formally end its lavish bond purchase scheme on Thursday but will take an increasingly dim view on growth, raising the odds that its next step in removing stimulus will be delayed. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly unchanged at 97.070. The dollar rose 0.15 percent against Japan’s currency, buying 113.45 yen. U.S. treasury yields continued to rise as risk sentiment improved. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9132 percent on Thursday, up from its U.S. close of 2.906 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.7723 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.77 percent.

2018-12-13,"SINGAPORE, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged up on Thursday, buoyed by a drawdown in inventories and by signs of easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Oil prices have also been supported by OPEC-led supply curbs announced last week, although gains have been muted after the producer group lowered its 2019 demand forecast. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.27 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 0.23 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “Crude oil prices rose, helped by the easing trade tension, as well as a fall in inventories,” ANZ bank said on Thursday. “The news that China is looking to redraft its ‘Made in China’ 2025 plan boosted hopes that trade talks are progressing better than expected.” China appears to be easing its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed ‘Made in China 2025’, which has long irked the United States, amid talks between the two countries to reduce trade tensions, according to new guidance to local governments. A drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, though less than expected, has helped boost sentiment, analysts said. U.S. crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, compared with market expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels. Meanwhile, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said 2019 demand for its crude would fall to 31.44 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million less than it currently produces. This adds to the concerns of several market watchers that the decision led by the group to cut production by 1.2 million bpd overall might not be enough to override a glut, especially on the back of soaring U.S. output. “Oil markets have been concerned about the possibility of weaker macroeconomic and oil demand growth; when combined with booming U.S. shale output, this could keep markets oversupplied in 2019, even with the OPEC+ cut,” Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner said in a note. “At this point, the OPEC+ cuts appear to have merely put a floor under prices.” The United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has hit a record 11.7 million bpd, is set to end 2018 as the world’s top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.

In equity markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent in early Asian trade after U.S. stocks finished the previous session higher, amid cautious optimism for progress in Chinese-U.S. trade talks. Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 0.8 percent, while Australian shares were up 0.2 percent. Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, Reuters reported Wednesday, in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. China also appears to be toning down its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed “Made in China 2025,” which has long irked the United States, according to new guidance to local governments. But it remains to be seen if Beijing will meet Washington’s demands for stronger protection for U.S. intellectual property. Beijing plans to replace the “Made in China 2025” initiative with a new one to play down China’s bid to dominate manufacturing and will seek to be more open to participation by foreign companies, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter. “In the scheme of things and were this to prove true, this is far more relevant than China agreeing to restart purchases of American soybeans, or even reducing the tariff on US car imports from 40 percent to 15 percent, as has been indicated in the last 24 hours,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a note. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.09 percent to 24,635.88 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.01 percent to 2,663.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.41 percent to 7,130.79. U.S. treasury yields continued to rise after steep declines as risk sentiment improved. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9114 percent on Thursday, up from its U.S. close of 2.906 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.7744 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.77 percent. U.S. crude rose 0.37 percent to $51.34 a barrel as trade tensions eased, and spot gold was slightly higher, trading at 1,245.77 per ounce on the weaker dollar.
