2018-12-13,"Dec 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. government auction for three wind leases off the coast of Massachusetts was on track to blow through a previous sale record on Thursday, with bids standing at combined $285 million after 24 rounds. The bidding, which took place over nine hours on Thursday, will continue on Friday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said. The highly competitive lease sale will give the winner or winners the right to develop nearly 390,000 acres, divided into three leases near the Massachusetts islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket and Rhode Island’s Block Island. The same areas failed to sell at a 2015 auction, underscoring the industry’s nascent view of the United States as the next major market for offshore wind. The auction attracted 19 companies as potential bidders, including Avangrid Renewables, EDF Renewables Development and Norway’s Equinor, according to a government auction notice published in October. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which conducted the auction, said Thursday it would not disclose which companies were involved in the bidding until the sale’s completion. The Trump administration is streamlining permitting and carving out new areas off the coast for leasing as part of its America First policy to boost domestic energy production and jobs. This effort dovetails with recent mandates in northeast states like New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York requiring utilities to procure energy from offshore wind. That government support, combined with falling prices for the renewable energy source, has intensified interest from European developers with years of success building offshore wind farms in the North Sea. Denmark’s Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer, announced in October that it would buy the top U.S. offshore wind player, Deepwater Wind LLC, for $510 million. Deepwater Wind was listed among the potential bidders in Thursday’s auction. Bidding in an auction last year for nearly 80,000 acres off the coast of New York lasted 33 rounds with Norway’s Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, eventually winning the lease for a record $42.5 million. An individual lease had never before sold for more than $5 million, according to public records.

2018-12-13,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Amid a slowing economy and a slew of mixed signals from the environment ministry, China’s embattled local governments are facing a dilemma: do they go all out to curb smog this winter, or do their best to keep factories humming? China has promised to put an end to a “growth at all costs” economic model, which has blackened its skies and contaminated large stretches of its water and soil. The government just embarked on another winter campaign against polluters in a dozen smog-prone provinces and regions.   Environmental compliance has become a key test of political loyalty among local officials, but this year they must plot a course that will also keep the economy on track. That could be tricky, as China’s third-quarter growth is at its slowest since the global financial crisis a fact Beijing has acknowledged. “Local governments in the polluting regions are working hard to reduce air pollution but also are exhausted,” said Zhu Shu, the regional director of the East Asia Secretariat of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), a Bonn-based think tank that helps local governments tackle pollution.  Though local authorities have been asked to show more flexibility in cracking down on polluters, the new approach has already sown confusion. If officials show leniency, they are accused of chasing growth, but if they come down hard, they are considered brittle bureaucrats.  With the goalposts constantly shifting, few know how to strike the right balance, experts said. “We have seen ‘name and shame’ statements from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment accusing (local governments) of either ‘failing to do their duty’ or ‘overdoing it in a wrong way,’” said a researcher with ties to the ministry who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.            China last year forced 28 northern cities to curb industrial output, traffic and coal consumption to reduce emissions of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5 by at least 15 percent from November 2017 to March 2018. Economists with China’s Tianfeng Securities said last year’s controls - which included the closure of vast numbers of industrial plants, some permanently - would cost 40,000 jobs in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region alone.  Heavy industrial cities throughout the north have struggled to diversify their economies, and delegates to parliament this year urged Beijing to provide more financial support.     The targeted cuts for 2018 are much lower, though the controls have now been extended to as many as 79 cities. Many are under pressure to cut PM2.5 by about 3 percent, but some are still making provisions to close up to half of their factories when required. According to Reuters analysis of official government data, PM2.5 readings in the 79 cities stood at an average of 69.8 micrograms in November this year, 14 percent higher than the same period last year. Of the total, only 32 cities saw improvements over the period.    To minimize disruptions, companies in Hebei province - normally China’s most polluted - have also been placed into four categories, with only those in the lowest class subject to stringent shutdowns this year. “From what I understand, the government is turning a blind eye as long as air quality is good enough for them to meet the targets,” said an official at a steel mill in Tangshan, Hebei’s top steel-producing base, who did not wish to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. “Production cuts are just a measure, not the final aim.”  Nevertheless, regions that missed targets last year will come under increased pressure to make deeper cuts.   Jincheng, which saw emissions rise and its economy tank in the first quarter, is still planning to shut at least half of its industrial plants during smog build-ups.  Authorities must also outperform neighbors. In Hebei, the poorest-performing counties and towns are fined 1 million yuan ($145,490) and the money is awarded to regions that overachieved. Officials from the worst-ranking districts also face disciplinary measures. There are concerns that unfavorable weather conditions will put cities at risk of missing targets. An official with a government-run environmental think tank in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu said poor weather could to boost smog by 5-10 percent this year.             Last winter, a crude “one size fits all” approach to the war on pollution disrupted large parts of the industrial economy, with inspectors forcing companies to shut down whether they caused smog or not.  Environment minister Li Ganjie promised to set up dedicated inspectorates to help make enforcement more nuanced. Authorities were also encouraged to set their own targets based on local circumstances. This year, they have also been instructed to help violators comply instead of simply shutting them down.    Environment ministry spokesman Liu Youbin told a media briefing in November that officials would be punished if they went too far - or not far enough. Hundreds have already been reprimanded.        While China wants to make long-term environmental improvements by devising new laws, raising standards, taxing pollutants and forcing companies to adopt cleaner production methods, it still relies on short-term crackdowns to meet its targets. Many local economies still depend on polluting industries like coal or steel. “The core solution to this dilemma is to adjust the industrial structure,” said Zhu. “That is a problem they will face and have to deal with sooner or later.”  ($1 = 6.8733 yuan) Reporting by David Stanway and Muyu Xu; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution/analysis-smog-and-a-hard-place-china-regions-caught-between-economic-woes-and-pollution-war-idUKL3N1YF1V3,13 Dec 2018,"Amid a slowing economy

2018-12-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed more than 2 percent on Thursday, after data showed inventory declines in the United States and as investors began to expect that the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than they had previously thought.  OPEC’s output agreement with Russia and Canada’s decision to mandate production cuts could create an oil market supply deficit by the second quarter of next year, if top producers stick to the deal, the International Energy Agency said in its monthly Oil Market Report. [IEA/M] U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell by nearly 822,000 barrels in the week through Dec. 11, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.  Brent crude LCOc1 settled $1.30, or 2.16 percent, higher at $61.45 per barrel while U.S. light crude CLc1 rose $1.43, or 2.8 percent, to end the session at $52.58 a barrel. “Other than some additional bullish statement out of the Saudis or Russians regarding strict adherence to last week’s agreement or a supply disruption somewhere around the globe, we don’t expect any headlines capable of pushing oil values much above this month’s highs even when stretching a view through year’s end,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Global oil supply has outstripped demand over the last six months, inflating inventories and pushing crude oil’s price at the end of November to its lowest in more than a year. But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers including Russia said last week they agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). Still, oil demand growth is slowing, OPEC said. OPEC said on Wednesday that demand for its crude in 2019 would fall to 31.44 million bpd, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million bpd below what it currently produces.   Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said his country has no plans to reduce its oil production but will remain a member of OPEC, the official news agency IRNA reported. Factors such as production cuts and output losses elsewhere should keep markets tight in the first half, Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. But he added that U.S. production growth “will almost inevitably re-accelerate in 2H19 as incremental pipeline capacity is installed in the Permian Basin. This means that by early 2020 the market could move back into oversupply.” The United States, where weekly crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has hit a record, is set to end 2018 as the world’s top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. “Global supply and demand should reach a fine balance next year with the market ebbing and flowing on either side of equilibrium compared to trending for prolonged periods of over and undersupply as seen since the turn of the decade,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.  “Whether that is enough to bring apprehensive investors back to the table remains the topic du jour.” Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Koustav Samanta in Singapore; editing by David Gregorio and Phil Berlowitz",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-10-oil-prices-edge-up-on-hopes-global-supplies-will-tighten-idUKL3N1YI135,13 Dec 2018,"* OPEC says has offset drop in sanctions-hit Iran exports

2018-12-13,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Europe’s biggest utility Enel and Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD on Thursday marked the arrival of 100 electric buses in Chile and said they would work together on similar plans for three other Latin American nations.  Enel ENCH.SN provided the financing for Chile to acquire the buses from BYD (0285.HK) for the capital Santiago, as well as the charging stations.  Chile represents a jumping off point into Latin America for two companies both seeking to dominate a green car revolution that is projected to see electric and hybrid vehicles account for 30 percent of the global market by 2030.  Alberto Piglia, Enel’s global head of e-mobility, told Reuters that BYD and Enel were talking to the governments of Brazil, Peru and Colombia as well as private firms with a view to offering the same model. “This is a starting point for us and we will continue to work as we are doing in Chile and across the region,” he said. “There will be an imitation game - others will see how good this is and adapt it to their local markets.”  He said Enel X, Enel’s “e-Solutions” division, would invest more than 300 million euros ($340 million) in electromobility next year, including extending its 30-million euro investment in Chile this year to other parts of Latin America. Chile’s ambitious plan involves rolling out electric scooters, cars, taxis and trucks to increase the number of electric vehicles tenfold by 2022 and electrify public transport entirely by 2050. Stella Li, BYD’s vice-president, said there was no need to wait to 2050. “We can do that in the next five to ten years if they want,” she said. “Shenzhen, the fourth-largest city in China, (where BYD is headquartered) electrified all its buses in three years.  “If you bring the finance model, you don’t need government to put a lot of money in, just to provide the policy and utility and private companies will figure it out.”  Piglia said Enel was looking at financing more buses, and also tackling Chile’s infrastructure shortages for electric vehicles by rolling out car charging stations in supermarkets, shopping malls and cinemas “by the end of next year”. BYD’s Li said it would be bidding to provide more buses for Santiago. She said BYD recently signed a deal with Corpus Saneamento e Obras Ltd (Corpus) to provide refuse and forklift trucks for Indaiatuba, Brazil, and confirmed joint talks with Enel with the governments of Brazil, China and Peru on “tenders, public-private partnerships and battery leasing” for public transport.

2018-12-13,"SOFIA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s state gas network operator Bulgartransgaz plans to seek binding bids from shippers by Jan 16 for a new gas link to transport mainly Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to central Europe, company documents showed on Thursday. Bulgartransgaz plans to take a final investment decision and spend 1.4 billion euros ($1.59 billion) on a new 484-km gas pipeline from its border with Turkey to Serbia by 2020, pending the outcome of the open season. Potential shippers will be invited to register for the bidding from Dec 21 and should file their offers to book capacity for 15 years by January 16, the documents, pending approval by the energy regulator, showed. Bulgartransgaz plans to hold two more rounds of the economic test by the end of January in case it is unable to secure enough interest to make the project viable. Five companies have expressed interest in shipping gas through Bulgaria’s network and sources said Russia’s Gazprom was interested in using most of the capacity. Gazprom said on Nov 30 it was considering whether to book capacity in the Bulgarian gas system. Bulgaria saw that as an intention to ship its gas from TurkStream to Serbia, Hungary and Austria through Bulgaria. Moscow has also suggested that the option for an extension of TurkStream via Greece to Italy is also possible. Gazprom is building TurkStream to bypass Ukraine on the south amid strong political tensions with the West over Russia’s actions against Ukraine in the Kerch Strait. Its two lines will each have an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic meters. The first line, which runs from Russia to Turkey under the Black Sea, is intended for Turkish consumption. The United States has said that an extended TurkStream, along with Nord Stream 2 pipeline that aims to bring Russian gas to Western Europe via the Baltic Sea will deepen EU dependence on Russia and increase Moscow’s grip over Ukraine. Brussels has also said that Bulgaria, currently fully dependent on Russian gas, needs to sell Russian gas through its planned gas hub in Varna along with gas from other sources rather than just building transit pipelines. Sofia has vowed to fully comply with EU rules and seek ways to transit some of the gas and sell part of it via its planned Varna hub.

2018-12-13,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A consortium led by Electricité de France SA is ready to fill the reservoir of a hydroelectric dam built in Brazil’s soy belt, but could be delayed by a year over removal of trees from the area to be flooded, the company and state officials said. Prosecutors are asking Mato Grosso’s state environmental agency to deny the 402 megawatt UHE Sinop dam an operating license until all the vegetation is cleared, which could add 400 million reais ($103 million) to its 2.9 billion reais price tag. If the trees are not removed, environmentalists say, the wood will rot in the water and create methane gas emissions that will contribute to global warming and pollute downstream waters for indigenous communities that live off fishing. Jean-Christophe Delvallet, chief executive officer of Sinop Energia, in which EDF has a 51 percent stake, said the company has already started to buy energy on the market to fulfill its obligations to supply Brazil’s national grid starting January 1. State-run Eletrobras, Brazil’s biggest utility company and whose privatization is being studied by the incoming government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, holds the remaining 49 percent through two subsidiaries, Eletronorte and Chesf. About 75 percent of Brazil’s electricity comes from hydropower and the country is the world’s third largest producer of hydroelectricity, behind China and Canada. Bolsonaro, a right-wing politician who takes office Jan. 1 with strong backing from the farming and agribusiness sectors, plans to relax rules for environmental licensing and revive plans to build dams held up by environmental criticism and resistance from indigenous tribes. With the rainy season beginning and lasting through May, Sinop Energia is running out of time. “This is really the time to start filling the reservoir. If not, the major risk would be losing the hydrological window, which would delay power generation for many months, until even a year,” Delvallet said by telephone. According to documents seen by Reuters, the prosecutors say the company has only removed 8,000 hectares of vegetation from the 34,000-hectare area to be flooded. They also dispute the mathematical model used by Sinop Energia to argue that the remaining trees will not pollute the environment with methane. Delvallet said his company has suppressed 46 percent of the relevant reservoir vegetation and is negotiating an agreement. A meeting is scheduled for Friday to find a solution, state prosecutor Joelson Maciel said by telephone. “If the wood is not removed, our concern is that the water of the reservoir will become a soup that will be highly damaging for the environment and increase greenhouse gases,” Maciel said. The prosecutors backed up their case with a study by climate change expert Philip Fearnside, a critic of plans to build more hydroelectric dams in Amazonia, the world’s largest rainforest. He  contributed to the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 jointly with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Although proponents see hydroelectric dams as a renewable source of energy, they emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, especially methane, which has a greater impact per ton of gas than carbon dioxide in the short term, Fearnside said by email.  “Sinop is an important case not only because of potential impacts there, but also as a precedent for what happens with the many planned dams in Amazonia,” said Fearnside, who works at the Amazon National Institute of Research in Manaus. Sinop, a major soy producing area, is on the border of the Amazon region and the dam has been built on the Teles Pires river that flows north into the Amazon.

But graft allegations lodged by prosecutors last week against four of the world’s largest oil trading companies - Vitol SA, Trafigura, Glencore PLC (GLEN.L) and Mercuria Energy Group - have opened an explosive new phase in the long-running probe. Federal prosecutors allege the European multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to sell them oil at sweetheart prices. They said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fuelled by creativity, competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks, allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries.  Emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections, authorities said. Some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked Petrobras employees.  Prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favour of the big oil-trading firms. Some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals. One intermediary griped that Vitol was “not at all sentimental” and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns. “Now you are the flavour of the month, next month there is a new flavour,” the middleman lamented in the email. Brazilian authorities last week searched the Rio de Janeiro-area offices of Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme. Police said they could not locate a physical office in Brazil for Mercuria. No charges have been filed. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations.  Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously.  Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption. Eleven people had arrest warrants issued against them, including one current employee of Petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of “strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities,” the company said in a written statement. Eight total people have been arrested, including four former Petrobras employees. Interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside Brazil. None have been arrested. The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the three others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading. They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world, including in Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina’s gross domestic product. Brazilian federal Judge Gabriela Hardt, as part of her legal order authorizing last week’s arrests and search warrants, wrote “there is proof” the companies and their affiliates “paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from Petrobras, to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the state-run company.”   The stakes are high for the trading firms. The probe could jeopardize their current and future business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer. A Vitol-led consortium has a $1.5 billion deal pending to purchase Petrobras’ stake in prized Nigerian oilfields. The new developments also signal that Brazil’s landmark Car Wash probe may be far from over. Launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the law-enforcement juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures, including the former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazil’s Odebrecht SA[ODBES.UL], Latin America’s largest construction firm, in 2016 cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least $3.5 billion for its role in a massive bribes-for-contracts ring. Foreign firms are now in the crosshairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. “All foreign companies that have done business with Petrobras in the past 15 years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations, to have confidence that they are not exposed to Car Wash,” Costa told Reuters. He said several foreign oil companies had already approached Brazilian prosecutors to “sound them out” about leniency deals. Costa would not disclose names of the firms. Some of Brazil’s political class have manoeuvred to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralysed key sectors of the economy. But President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is under pressure from the public to keep going. He has chosen Sergio Moro, a crusading judge who led Car Wash, to be Brazil’s next Justice Minister. “Car Wash will continue its brutal transformation of Brazil’s corporate culture,” said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Brazilian business school. “It is not going to stop.”      Costa said the supply and refining units at Petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery.  Traders in the company’s far-flung offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from Petrobras executives, he said. Because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on litres, Costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight, with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved. Brazilian authorities allege that Petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate, and also sold them Petrobras oil products and storage leases at below-market rates, hurting the state-run firm’s bottom line, authorities said.   Prosecutors say Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with Petrobras insiders. Authorities allege the illicit funds moved through U.S. and European banks, among others.  A pivotal figure, Brazilian authorities allege, was Swedish-national Bo Hans Wilhelm Ljungberg, an independent oil broker who operated out of Rio de Janeiro. They say he was a key agent who secured business for Vitol and other firms by funnelling bribes to Petrobras traders, in particular to one in Houston. He already faces a corruption charge in a separate Car Wash case. Vitol’s first business relationship with Ljungberg dates back to the 1990s when it bought one of his companies; more recently, he acted as an agent, Vitol said. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg, who prosecutors said returned to Sweden. He did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents, nor to messages sent to social media accounts. Prosecutors allege Vitol paid just over $5 million to offshore trading entities that Ljungberg co-owned called Encom Trading SA and Celixore AB to secure deals with Petrobras between 2011 and 2014. Prosecutors showed Reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms’ accounts. Judge Hardt’s ruling said that one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, was “fully aware” that Ljungberg was securing Vitol’s business through bribes, based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the Swede about the alleged scheme. Loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media. As for Trafigura, prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe Petrobras employees. Judge Hardt’s order alleges that Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura top executive, and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes, a local country representative, funnelled bribes to Petrobras employees between mid-2009 and September 2014.    Lawyers for Ferraz and Magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment. Ferraz is already serving a 10-year sentence in Brazil for bribing a former Petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was arrested in late 2016 and resigned from Trafigura. Prosecutors allege that Magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies, including Glencore’s fully-owned subsidiary Chemoil. Apart from payments via Magalhaes, Glencore subsidiaries paid $4 million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed Petrobras officials, the judge’s ruling said.     Prosecutors say that they know the least about Mercuria’s dealings with Petrobras. They said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company’s representatives in Brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Decades of efforts to curb climate-changing emissions are failing, leaving not just small islands but “every country” at this year’s U.N. climate talks facing the threat of disaster, former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed warned on Thursday. “Carbon emissions keep rising and rising and rising, and all we seem to be doing is talking and talking and talking. We are not winning the battle,” said Nasheed, who is leading his Indian Ocean island state’s negotiating team at the talks in Poland. The slow pace of the negotiations - and lagging efforts to change government and business policies - run contrary to stark warnings in an October science report that the world has about 12 years left to clean up its energy system or face potentially catastrophic consequences. Failure to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) or less, compared to pre-industrial times, would likely lead to worsening water and food shortages, rising poverty, more destructive disasters and accelerating natural losses, scientists warned. “The 1.5 report took away all places to hide, all the kicking the can down the road,” said Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) and special representative of the U.N. secretary-general on sustainable energy. Governments and businesses must “swallow” the report, “not chew on it”, she said. “That’s the urgency we’re missing here,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But speeding up efforts to switch to clean energy and prepare vulnerable communities for harsher climate impacts is proving frustratingly intractable, for many reasons. A recent plan by French President Emmanuel Macron to hike taxes on diesel, for instance, was a trigger for widespread protests over declining living standards. That has spooked government officials who in 2015 signed the Paris Agreement to curb climate change, experts say. “We have gone from the Paris of 2015 to the Paris of 2018,” said Ottmar Edenhofer, a climate economist and co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “People here (at the talks) say that what we learned from Paris 2018 is that to impose a carbon price on electricity, heat or gasoline is an incredibly bad idea, that for a politician it’s political suicide,” he said. But that view is “a complete misrepresentation”, he added, calling France’s tax poorly thought out and badly handled. It is a combination of low fuel prices worldwide, huge subsidies for fossil fuels and rising interest rates that is making the higher upfront cost of solar and wind power harder to afford and slowing down climate action, Edenhofer said. Countries that want to curb global warming should make sure changes do not hit wallets, and work to reduce widening social inequality, to build trust in government, he said. Growing concerns about air pollution around the world are driving demand for action in some regions, particularly Asian countries such as South Korea and China. In Korea, it has become “the number one issue in elections”, said Frank Rijsberman, director-general of the Global Green Growth Institute, based in Seoul. That has led a government that previously was not really interested in renewable energy to say it intends to phase out coal - though relatively slowly, Rijsberman said. Globally, too many national and multilateral banks are still offering to fund new coal plants, even as scientists say coal use must end rapidly, SEforALL’s Kyte said. “If you ratified the Paris Agreement, no instrument of your government lending should be supporting coal anywhere, period,” she insisted. To grow more cleanly, power-hungry developing countries need to find it as easy to add renewable power capacity as coal or other fossil fuel plants, she added. But so far a lack of big investors in clean power, a shortage of affordable finance to cover its higher initial costs, and insufficient expertise in new technologies mean coal remains an easier option, Kyte said. Pushing businesses and banks to change faster is likely to require making now-voluntary disclosure of climate-related financial risks mandatory “as soon as possible”, she said. Nasheed of the Maldives agreed it was time to up the pressure. ""We are still begging the big polluters to stop polluting on ethical grounds - but they are not listening to us,"" he said.

In the United States, the Dow and S&P 500 were modestly higher while the Nasdaq showed slight losses. Investors have been cautiously optimistic about U.S.-China trade progress, but nervousness has bred volatility. Over the past two sessions, stock indexes gave up most early gains. In Beijing, a commerce ministry spokesman said China and the United States are in close contact over trade, and any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit. Stock market trading “is going to be choppy surrounding the resolution of the trade talks until we see some clarity,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “The market is approaching a seasonally positive time of the year, but right now we have uncertainty about trade and looks like that’s going to drive volatility.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.07 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,588.34, the S&P 500 gained 1.45 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,652.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 14.19 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,084.12. U.S. economic data showed initial jobless claims fell last week to near 49-year lows, while import prices dropped as the cost of petroleum products tumbled. Shares in Europe will little changed in see-saw trade as investors remained uncertain about Britain’s exit from the European Union. Italian stocks outperforme on hopes of a compromise over Rome’s contested budget. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.13 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.09 percent. Britain’s weakened prime minister, Theresa May, survived a late night no-confidence vote, and then said she did not expect a quick breakthrough in Brexit talks that would help get the deal through parliament. The European Central Bank officially ended its post-crisis asset purchase program but promised to keep feeding stimulus into an economy struggling with an unexpected slowdown and political turmoil. The euro and sterling both fell on Brexit uncertainty and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi following a central bank announcement investors viewed as dovish. The dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro down 0.16 percent to $1.135. Sterling was last trading at $1.2623, down 0.05 percent on the day. Oil prices edged higher after data showed inventory declines in the United States and as investors began to expect the global oil market could have a deficit sooner than previously thought.

2018-12-13,"OSLO (Reuters) - Whatever the outcome of Britain’s tortuous divorce proceedings from Europe, there appears to be little help waiting in the wings from non-EU member Norway to join its own special relationship with the bloc. Some Brexit supporters in Britain have touted a so-called “Norway-plus” scenario, whereby the world’s fifth largest economy would emulate the Scandinavian country in finding its own tailored deal with the European Union.  Their idea has not gained much domestic momentum.  But even so, in Oslo, there would be low prospects of consensus for any potential U.K. bid to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) - between Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein Switzerland and the European Union - which it left in 1973. Prime Minister Erna Solberg did tell Reuters that Oslo could lend a hand, but there would be little support from others in her governing coalition or the opposition Labour party, Norway’s biggest party, on a major issue needing consensus. Politicians say the nations’ interests are too diverse - even though Britain is Norway’s biggest trading partner - and they worry U.K. entry to EFTA could swamp other members.  Currently the second largest EU economy, Britain has 66 million people, versus EFTA nations’ combined 14 million. “Norwegian interests are quite different from British interests,” Anniken Huitfeldt, leader of parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee, told Reuters, citing fisheries and agriculture policies. “I do not see the need to extend an invitation for Britain to join EFTA,” said Huitfeldt, a Labour lawmaker. Norway imposes high tariffs on food to protect farmers in a nation that stretches into the Arctic, whereas Britain is a major food exporter. Another concern is that London could veto future EFTA decisions, said Abid Raja, vice president of parliament of the centrist Liberal party that is part of Solberg’s coalition. “Norway must think of its own interests and what is best there is that Britain holds a new referendum and stays in the EU,” he told Reuters. Under its arrangements, Norway is currently part of the EU single market - which allows for free movement of goods, capital, services and people - but not the customs union. With the Norwegian public largely disinterested in the issue, the only political support for Britain joining EFTA seems to be from two small parties, the Socialist Left and the Centre Party, which want to renegotiate Norway’s entire relations with the EU. They think British membership of EFTA would give Oslo better bargaining power with Brussels.  “Northern European countries would have a stronger negotiating position and could assess together what kind of relationship we would want to have with the EU,” Torgeir Knag Fylkesnes, a Socialist Left lawmaker told Reuters.  “We could ... have a better deal for democracy and Norwegian business.”  Additional reporting by Terje Solsvik in Oslo, William Schomberg in London; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-norway/norwegians-nonplussed-at-norway-plus-brexit-idea-idUKL8N1YH4L8,13 Dec 2018,"Whatever the outcome of Britain's

2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Private equity-backed oil firm Chrysaor has hired advisers ahead of talks to buy Chevron’s (CVX.N) British North Sea oil and gas fields for over $2.5 billion (1.97 billion pounds), industry and banking sources said. Chrysaor has signed up investment banks Jefferies and BMO for the discussions as a deadline for bids approaches before Christmas, the four sources said. Chevron said earlier this year it was selling its assets in the central North Sea, which are expected to fetch around $1.5 billion. Chrysaor and Chevron are also discussing the sale of part or all of the U.S. group’s 19.4 percent stake in the BP-operated (BP.L) Clair field, the largest oilfield in the British North Sea, which was not originally up for grabs, the sources said. The Clair stake could easily fetch $1 billion, they said. A Chevron spokeswoman said the company does not comment on industry speculation or commercial matters. Asked about interest in its Clair stake, she said: “While we continue to evaluate our portfolio we are progressing the Clair projects.” Chrysaor, Jefferies and BMO declined to comment.  Chevron’s shares were down 0.9 percent at 1436 GMT, compared with a 0.3 percent decline for the broader sector index .SXEP. Chevron’s net daily production in the North Sea in 2017 averaged 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to its website. The California-based company kicked off in July the sale of its central North Sea oil and gas fields Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin, Erskine and Jade as well as the Britannia platform and its satellites. On Tuesday, Chevron said Britain’s Oil and Gas Authority had approved its development plans for the Captain field. In October, Chevron sold its 40 percent stake in the Rosebank development to Norway’s Equinor. Selling the central North Sea assets as well as the Clair stake would effectively mark Chevron’s full exit from the ageing UK North Sea basin after over 50 years. Chevron has in recent years focused its efforts on rapidly growing its shale production in the Permian basin in Texas as well as the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan.     Chrysaor, backed by Harbour Energy, an investment vehicle of EIG Global Energy Partners, became one of the largest North Sea producers after buying $3 billion of oil and gas fields from Royal Dutch Shell in 2017. With its current portfolio, Chrysaor expects daily production averaging 120,000-130,000 barrels of oil equivalent until 2020.

2018-12-13,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Green energy is on track to overtake coal as Germany’s main power source this year, with renewables set to cover a record 38 percent of the country’s electricity consumption, two percent up from 2017, two energy industry groups said on Thursday. The figures from the energy industry group BDEW and research institute ZSW confirm their forecast in early November, which predicted the increase in green power’s share of electricity consumption. Renewable production as a single category has been closing in on the contribution of individual fossil fuels in Germany since the country embarked on a path towards greater reliance on wind and solar last decade. The renewables contribution is politically significant in Europe’s biggest economy, which wants the share of renewables to reach 65 percent by 2030.     The final numbers each year depend on weather patterns, which have to produce high enough wind speeds and sunshine to fuel turbines and solar panels. An extensive drought since the spring of 2018 resulted in a fall in hydroelectric power production by 16 percent year-on-year to a total of 17 billion kWh, the two groups noted in a statement. But the expansion of renewables as a whole continued, allowing green power to overtake the share of imported hard coal and domestic brown coal. The two fuels met 36 percent of power consumption in the first nine months of the year. Germany relies on a mixture of coal, renewables, nuclear and gas for its energy. For the full year, output from renewable power sources such as wind, solar, biomass and hydropower plants will contribute a total 229 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), the two parties said in the statement. This accounts for 38 percent of recorded electricity usage of 599 billion kWh. The 38 percent was made up of onshore wind supplying 16 percent, offshore wind with 3 percent, biomass with 8 percent, photovoltaics with 8 percent, hydropower with 3 percent, and waste and geothermal energy supplying 1 percent. The share of green energy had reached 36.1 percent of consumption last year. BDEW’s managing director, Stefan Kapferer, said that Germany’s 65-percent target would require further efforts to expand wind power and power transport links. ZSW board chairman Frithjof Staiss said given the growing share of variable green power production there also needed to be  improved power storage facilities and demand management. Separately, the power industry wants the government to enforce more carbon dioxide reductions from the heat and transport sectors to help Germany to meet its climate goals. Staiss said the car industry had not improved its CO2 record in 15 years.

The expectation of the weather pattern continuing through spring next year stood at 60 percent, the CPC added. Last month, the weather forecaster pegged the chances of the El Niño emerging at 80 percent during the winter 2018-19 and 55-60 percent during the spring next year. The last El Niño, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, occurred from around 2015 to 2016 and caused weather-related crop damage, fires and flash floods.

2018-12-13,"JOHANNESBURG, Dec 13 (Reuters) - South Africa is unlikely to experience more power cuts until mid-January next year as electricity demands eases over the Christmas and New Year holiday season, state-owned utility Eskom said on Thursday. Eskom, which supplies South Africa with more than 90 percent of its electricity, began controlled power cuts late last month due to coal shortages and poor plant performance. The utility has not implemented power cuts, known as load-shedding, in the past four days, but has warned the power system remains vulnerable. “The probability of load-shedding remains low from today until Sunday 13 January 2019,” Eskom said in a statement. “This is as a result of the expected decrease in demand as businesses and industries close down for the festive break.” Eskom said it would intensify maintenance activities in December to improve generation capacity in preparation for the return of businesses and industries in the new year. Separately, Eskom said on Thursday that it had signed a 1.5 billion rand ($106 million) loan agreement with French government agency Agence Française de Développement (AFD) to help it extend and strengthen its power transmission grid. The funds are the first tranche of a 6.5 billion rand multi-tranche loan facility signed in March 2017.

The cash-strapped power firm has said it wants the government to take on 100 billion rand of its debts, about a quarter of its total borrowings of 420 billion rand.

2018-12-13,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s monthly oil imports from Iran plunged to their lowest in a year in November with Tehran dropping two places to become only the sixth biggest supplier after New Delhi cut purchases due to the impact of U.S. sanctions, according to ship tracking data and industry sources. Last month, the United States introduced tough sanctions aimed at crippling Iran’s oil revenue-dependent economy. Washington did, though, give a six-month waiver from sanctions to eight nations, including India, and allowed them to import some Iranian oil. India is restricted to buying 1.25 million tonnes per month, or about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). In November, India imported about 276,000 bpd of Iranian oil, a decline of about 41 percent from October and about 4 percent more than the year-ago month, ship tracking data obtained from shipping and trade sources showed. After abandoning the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to force Tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. India’s imports from Iran in November, included some parcels that were loaded in October. In November, Iraq and Saudi Arabia continued to be the top two oil sellers to India.  The UAE, which was the sixth biggest oil seller to India in October, became the third top seller to India in November, knocking down Venezuela by a notch to fourth position.  Nigeria continued at No. 5 position, while Iran slipped to sixth place.      “Iran do not have vessels to export oil on time ... some November loading vessels will arrive in December,” said an industry source, with knowledge of the matter. Local and international shippers are not carrying Iranian cargoes despite India winning a waiver, this source said. The key problem is that while India can import Iranian oil without falling foul of Washington, that may not apply to a shipping company signing a new delivery contract. Instead, India is relying on Iranian tankers for crude imports and Iran is using many of its vessels for crude storage. The sources declined to be identified citing the confidentiality of the numbers. Indian refiners, wary of the impact of U.S. sanctions, had boosted imports from Iran ahead of their introduction, with imports averaging about 563,000 bpd in April-November, a growth of about 32 percent from a low base in the previous fiscal year, the data showed. (For an interactive graphic on 'India's Oil Imports From Iran' click tmsnrt.rs/2SIFkfF) In the previous financial year to March 2018 India had cut oil imports from Iran due to a dispute over development rights of a giant gas field.  Iran was hoping to sell more than 500,000 bpd of oil to India in 2018/19, its oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said in February, and had offered almost free shipping and an extended credit period to boost sales to India. Government sources say Reuters’ calculations showing India’s oil imports from Iran in this fiscal year would be higher than the 452,000 bpd, or 22.6 million tonnes, it imported in the previous year, are correct. During January-November this year India’s oil imports from Iran rose by an annual 18.4 percent to 552,000 bpd, the data showed.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Maldives will do all in its power to keep “our heads above water”, the head of its delegation at U.N. climate talks said on Thursday in an impassioned appeal for nations to overcome their divisions over how to tackle global warming. The low-lying Maldives is among countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels and coral reef deterioration. “We are not prepared to die. We are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis. Instead, we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water,” Mohamed Nasheed told delegates at the talks in Katowice, Poland. “Climate change is a national security issue for us. It is an existential threat,” he said, adding that a rise in global temperatures could still be avoided but countries had to unite. Nasheed was the Maldives’ first democratically elected leader but was ousted in 2012 in a coup, imprisoned then granted asylum in Britain. The Maldives’ current president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, invited Nasheed to head the country’s negotiating delegation at the Katowice talks, which are aimed at agreeing rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. With less than two days until the conference is formally scheduled to end, delegates are still grappling with many issues - not just how the accord will be implemented - including finance, strengthening emissions cuts and monitoring action. A draft, more concise text of the deal should be available later on Thursday but it is expected to still be laden with brackets for wording to be decided on and gaps. Since last addressing a U.N. climate conference in 2009, Nasheed said he had been deposed in a coup, imprisoned and then forced into exile. “But almost 10 years since I was last at these climate negotiations, I must say, nothing much seems to have changed. We are still using the same old, dinosaur language,” he said. “Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.”  Reporting by Nina Chestney and Bate Felix; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord-maldives/maldives-tells-un-climate-talks-we-are-not-prepared-to-die-idUKL8N1YI440,13 Dec 2018,"The Maldives will do

2018-12-13,"* Milan trial related to same oil deal ongoing * Nigeria also suing JPMorgan over transfers for same deal (Adds detail) LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government said it had filed a $1.1 billion lawsuit against Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in a commercial court in London on Thursday in relation to a 2011 oilfield deal. The OPL 245 oilfield is also at the heart of an ongoing corruption trial in Milan in which former and current Shell and Eni officials are on the bench. Milan prosecutors allege bribes totalling around $1.1 billion were paid to win the licence to explore the field which, because of disputes, has never entered into production. The new London case also relates to payments made by the companies to get the OPL 245 oilfield licence in 2011. “It is alleged that purchase monies purportedly paid to the Federal Republic of Nigeria were in fact immediately paid through to a company controlled by Dan Etete, formerly the Nigerian minister of petroleum, and used for, amongst other things, bribes and kickbacks,” Nigeria said on Thursday. “Accordingly, it is alleged that Shell and Eni engaged in bribery and unlawful conspiracy to harm the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that they dishonestly assisted corrupt Nigerian government officials.” The Nigerian attorney general’s office did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment. Shell said “the 2011 settlement of long-standing legal disputes related to OPL 245 was a fully legal transaction with Eni and the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by the most senior officials of the relevant ministries.” Eni said in an emailed statement it rejected “any allegation of impropriety or irregularity in connection with this transaction.” “Eni (...) signed a commercial agreement in 2011 for a new licence for OPL 245 with the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and the consideration for the license was paid directly to the Nigerian government,” it said. Nigeria has already filed a London case against U.S. bank JPMorgan for its role in transferring over $800 million of government funds to Etete, who has been convicted of money laundering. In another separate trial, a Milan court in September found a middleman guilty of corruption after prosecutors alleged he had received a mandate from Etete, who has denied any wrongdoing, to find a buyer for OPL 245, collecting $114 million for his services.

2018-12-13,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Santa made a lacklustre attempt to deliver his traditional end of year rally on Thursday, as world stocks squeezed out a third day of gains and the pound and the euro both stayed firm after the latest bout of Brexit drama. UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s survival in a late night no-confidence vote has not changed the markets’ questions on Brexit  but along with tentative signs of truces in the U.S.-China trade war and Italy’s budget feud it was enough to keep them jolly. The Nikkei and other Asian stocks had pushed roughly 1 percent higher and Europe enjoyed a largely uneventful morning. Even the long-awaited confirmation that the European Central Bank was ending its quantitative easing programme did little to rouse activity. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1390, having largely traded in a $1.16 and $1.12 range since August. That made the dollar a touch softer while the pound was up for a second day at $1.2665. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary,” the ECB said. Though the ECB will technically now stop QE, it will still keep buying German, Italian and other euro zone bonds, possibly for years, using proceeds from the $2.6 trillion mountain of debt it has bought over the last few years. Analysts were now waiting to hear what signals Mario Draghi sends at his 1330 GMT news conference. Next year will be his last in charge of the ECB. Morgan Stanley FX strategist Hans Redeker said all eyes would be on Draghi and the ECB’s messaging. “It may revise its growth projections lower but continue to prepare the markets for allowing QE to end.” Short-dated Italian bond yields - which move inversely to price - hit their lowest in six months after the country’s government confirmed it would cut its deficit goal for 2019, potentially ending months of wrangling with Brussels. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the deficit goal had been lowered to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product from the 2.4 percent it had originally proposed, and it expected the European Commission to accept the proposal. Two-year Italian bond yields tumbled to 0.51 percent, which took them back to where they were before a late May eruption of tensions triggered the worst day for short-term Italian debt in 25 years. Italy’s five-year and 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest level in 2 1/2 months, while the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread improved to its tightest since the start of October. “I think the momentum can carry on in the near term as we have a number of supportive factors for Italian debt beyond just the hopes the budget deal can be reached,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger. On Brexit, May was heading to an EU summit in Brussels after her confidence vote win to try and secure some additional concessions on the controversial Irish border aspect of the agreement to placate rebels within her own party and Northern Irish Ulster Unionist allies. Markets reckon May’s continued premiership for now makes a “no deal” Brexit less likely at the margins, and her survival takes at least some of the immediate headline risk out of the market – even if the parliamentary impasse over the terms of Brexit looks no closer to being resolved. The pound was trading at $1.2670 as the first U.S. trading started, still well up more than cent from the 20-month lows set early Wednesday, and at about the levels seen just before the results of the confidence vote on Wednesday night. In Asia, gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.1 percent. Markets are slowly becoming less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two big powers. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies had bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. But markets have been stung by false dawns in the past. Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines. “U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,” he said. “We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.” In the commodities markets, oil prices steadied, under pressure from high inventories but buoyed by a drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles and the indications that the U.S.-China trade war may be easing. Copper, which is highly sensitive to China’s fortunes, also rose to a one-week high in the metals market at it approached $6,200 a tonne although it remains badly beaten having lost almost 15 percent this year. “Signs of positive progression in trade talks between the U.S. and China should see sentiment in the commodity market remain positive,” analysts at ANZ wrote in a note.

2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans by 2040 to develop the world’s first net-zero carbon industrial centre by teaming up emitters with industries that can reuse their polluting gases or by moving to lower carbon fuels such as hydrogen, it said on Thursday. The government said it will commit up to 170 million pounds to the project, which could include capturing emissions from factories and reusing them in industries such as brewing to put the fizz in drinks. Britain has been making progress in cutting emissions from the electricity sector by increasing renewable power generation as it seeks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025. “But to sustain this track record we need to tackle emissions from energy intensive sectors and bring clean growth to our great industrial centres,” energy minister Claire Perry said in a statement. Industrial emissions, such as from the production of steel, ceramics and chemicals account for 25 percent of the country’s greenhouse gases. The hub could be developed in existing industrial regions such as Grangemouth in Scotland, in South Wales or in England at Merseyside, Teeside, Humberside or Southampton. The announcement comes as delegates from more than 190 countries meet in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius this century.  Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 43 percent since 1990, meaning it is more than half way towards meeting a legally binding target to cut them by 2050 to 80 percent below 1990 levels.

2018-12-13,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: U.S. soybean exports to China and others: tmsnrt.rs/2Q3DCbZ By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 13 (Reuters) - There is a risk that investors will get carried away with optimism over an easing of the U.S.-China trade dispute on the back of China resuming purchases of U.S. soybeans. This is especially the case given there is yet no sign of new imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal, the energy commodities that will provide a far better signal of any detente in the trade spat. China ended a six-month boycott of buying U.S. soybeans on Wednesday, with state-owned companies purchasing at least 500,000 tonnes of the oilseed, traders said. Traders also said it appears the Chinese may seek more soybeans in coming weeks as they are struggling to meet all their import requirements from other suppliers. This sounds extremely positive for U.S. President Donald Trump and the trade war truce he claimed to have brokered with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Argentina earlier this month. It may well be the first sign of a major thaw between the two administrations, and it may even herald the start of positive moves towards some kind of settlement that would see no more tariffs being imposed, and perhaps even the removal of the ones already implemented. But it’s also worth putting things in context. China used to be the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, taking about 60 percent of exports in 2017, worth an estimated $12 billion. However, since Beijing slapped a tariff on soybean imports from the United States, the trade has fallen away, with U.S. exports to China dropping to 8.2 million tonnes in the first 10 months of the year, down from 21.4 million in the same period last year, according to government figures. What this shows is that China would have to dramatically boost its buying from the United States to return to former levels, which makes the recent 500,000-tonnes purchase a spit in the bucket. It’s also likely that China finds it convenient to go back to the U.S. market at the present time, given the U.S. crop is ready for export, while that from southern hemisphere rival Brazil isn’t. This means there is a seasonal element to trade in soybeans, and the Chinese government may have had little choice but to resume U.S. imports, but they have done so in a way that delivers Trump a little victory that may appease the mercurial U.S. president. What would be far more significant than buying some cargoes of soybeans, which China needs anyway, is the resumption of imports of energy commodities. One of Trump’s aims in starting a trade fight with Beijing was that he wanted to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, but the opposite has proven to be the case. While Trump focused on putting tariffs on imports from China, the Chinese simply stopped the one area of trade that was growing rapidly and helping lower the trade imbalance, namely imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States - about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. But this dropped to zero in October, and in November one cargo of U.S. crude was discharged, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. More importantly, there is no sign of the trade resuming, with no cargoes currently booked to arrive in December, or beyond, according to the data. It’s worth noting that crude oil isn’t subject to any Chinese import tariff, although LNG and coal are. In LNG, no U.S. cargoes of LNG arrived in China in October, although two were discharged in November. However, no cargoes are slated for arrival in December or beyond. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. China imported zero U.S. coal in October, two cargoes totalling about 211,000 tonnes in November, and none are scheduled to arrive in December or January. In the first nine months of the year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, the majority of this being higher-value metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Obviously this situation can change, and Chinese importers of crude, LNG and coal may well choose to resume buying from the United States. But, perhaps unlike soybeans, they don’t have to as there are currently plenty of alternative suppliers. If there really was a detente looming in the U.S.-China trade dispute, then a clear sign of that would be a resumption of energy imports.

2018-12-13,"SAO PAULO/LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil’s epic “Car Wash” corruption investigation has taken down presidents and elite businessmen, and led to the largest corporate leniency deal ever signed.  But graft allegations lodged by prosecutors last week against four of the world’s largest oil trading companies - Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL], Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], Glencore PLC and Mercuria Energy Group - have opened an explosive new phase in the long-running probe. Federal prosecutors allege the European multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras  to sell them oil at sweetheart prices. They said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by creativity, competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks, allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries.  Emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections, authorities said. Some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked Petrobras employees.  Prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favor of the big oil-trading firms. Some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals. One intermediary griped that Vitol was “not at all sentimental” and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns. “Now you are the flavor of the month, next month there is a new flavor,” the middleman lamented in the email. Brazilian authorities last week searched the Rio de Janeiro-area offices of Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme. Police said they could not locate a physical office in Brazil for Mercuria. No charges have been filed. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations.  Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously.  Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption. Eight people have been arrested, including two employees of Petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of “strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities,” the company said in a written statement.  Interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside Brazil, including a Petrobras trader based in Houston. None have been arrested. The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the three others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading. They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world, including in Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina’s gross domestic product. Brazilian federal Judge Gabriela Hardt, as part of her legal order authorizing last week’s arrests and search warrants, wrote “there is proof” the companies and their affiliates “paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from Petrobras, to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the state-run company.”   The stakes are high for the trading firms. The probe could jeopardize their current and future business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer. A Vitol-led consortium has a $1.5 billion deal pending to purchase Petrobras’ stake in prized Nigerian oilfields. The new developments also signal that Brazil’s landmark Car Wash probe may be far from over. Launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the law-enforcement juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures, including the former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazil’s Odebrecht SA[ODBES.UL], Latin America’s largest construction firm, in 2016 cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least $3.5 billion for its role in a massive bribes-for-contracts ring. Foreign firms are now in the crosshairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. “All foreign companies that have done business with Petrobras in the past 15 years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations, to have confidence that they are not exposed to Car Wash,” Costa told Reuters. He said several foreign oil companies had already approached Brazilian prosecutors to “sound them out” about leniency deals. Costa would not disclose names of the firms. Some of Brazil’s political class have maneuvered to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralyzed key sectors of the economy. But President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is under pressure from the public to keep going. He has chosen Sergio Moro, a crusading judge who led Car Wash, to be Brazil’s next Justice Minister. “Car Wash will continue its brutal transformation of Brazil’s corporate culture,” said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Brazilian business school. “It is not going to stop.”      Costa said the supply and refining units at Petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery.  Traders in the company’s far-flung offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from Petrobras executives, he said. Because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on liters, Costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight, with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved. Brazilian authorities allege that Petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate, and also sold them Petrobras oil products and storage leases at below-market rates, hurting the state-run firm’s bottom line, authorities said.   Prosecutors say Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with Petrobras insiders. Authorities allege the illicit funds moved through U.S. and European banks, among others.  A pivotal figure, Brazilian authorities allege, was Swedish-national Bo Hans Wilhelm Ljungberg, an independent oil broker who operated out of Rio de Janeiro. They say he was a key agent who secured business for Vitol and other firms by funneling bribes to Petrobras traders, in particular to one in Houston. Vitol’s first business relationship with Ljungberg dates back to the 1990s when it bought one of his companies; more recently, he acted as an agent, Vitol said. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg, who prosecutors said returned to Sweden. He did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents, nor to messages sent to social media accounts. Prosecutors allege Vitol paid just over $5 million to offshore trading entities that Ljungberg co-owned called Encom Trading SA and Celixore AB to secure deals with Petrobras between 2011 and 2014. Prosecutors showed Reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms’ accounts. Judge Hardt’s ruling said that one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, was “fully aware” that Ljungberg was securing Vitol’s business through bribes, based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the Swede about the alleged scheme. Loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media. As for Trafigura, prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe Petrobras employees. Judge Hardt’s order alleges that Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura top executive, and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes, a local country representative, funneled bribes to Petrobras employees between mid-2009 and September 2014.    Lawyers for Ferraz and Magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment. Ferraz is already serving a 10-year sentence in Brazil for bribing a former Petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was arrested in late 2016 and resigned from Trafigura.    Prosecutors allege that Magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies, including Glencore’s fully-owned subsidiary Chemoil.     Apart from payments via Magalhaes, Glencore subsidiaries paid $4 million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed Petrobras officials, the judge’s ruling said.     Prosecutors say that they know the least about Mercuria’s dealings with Petrobras. They said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company’s representatives in Brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals.

2018-12-13,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Climate change talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the 2015 Paris global warming deal are in their last week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s coal mining district. Below is a look at the latest mood round the event, in a sprawl of temporary passageways and rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped venue on the site of the former Katowice coal mine.  The Polish presidency of the climate conference is expected to present a draft of the final package to include a rule book to implement the Paris pact, a deal on climate change finance, and another accord increasing ambitions to curb emissions. The draft will be shown to delegates around 1600 GMT and ministers will endeavour to get an acceptable version by the end of the conference on Friday. “The text should be getting cleaned up and we should see where the landing ground is for the different pieces of the package, but we are not there right now,” said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. “Every country here needs to take a step back and remember why we are here. Our very humanity is at stake.” It remains unclear how delegates will finalise a deal to implement the Paris agreement - which aims to restrict warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times - and whether the package would take into consideration the latest U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report.  “If it is not sorted by Saturday, then it won’t be sorted,” a delegate said as corridor talk turned from how long into the weekend the talks may continue to whether they could collapse.  Countries most vulnerable to climate change called for the conference to send a strong signal that ambitions to reduce global emissions should be enhanced by 2020. But Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives, a nation threatened by climate change, said nothing seems to have changed since he last addressed a climate summit a decade ago.  “A whole dictionary of words has been born into these climate conferences. We go round and round and round with these words and end up not getting anywhere. “Carbon emissions are rising, rising and rising and all we seem to be doing is talking, talking and talking.”   The Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petrol Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, was a top billing on the list of speakers. But by the time he got on stage during the plenary on late Wednesday night, after a marathon session with over 100 speakers, there was barely a soul in the hall to hear him.  He said “unequivocally that the oil industry must remain and be part of the solution to the climate change challenge”, and that OPEC members also believe there is no plan B.

2018-12-13,"MILAN (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCA) could review its 5 billion euro (4.5 billion pounds) Italian investment plan, which includes a shift to cleaner engines, if Rome raises taxes on petrol and diesel cars. “Were these measures to be confirmed as of 2019, a thorough examination of their impact and an update to plans already announced would be necessary,” FCA’s (FCHA.MI) Europe head, Pietro Gorlier, said in a letter to government representatives in the northern Piedmont region, where some of the new investment would be targeted.  In an amendment to the 2019 budget law passed in Italy’s lower house last week, the government approved subsidies of up to 6,000 euros for lower emission vehicles, but included a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros on petrol and diesel cars.  However, the government immediately vowed to change it in the Senate, where it will be voted on next, after one of the ruling parties contested the measure. Italy’s ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - have been at odds over the issue, with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars, while the pro-environment 5-Star has encouraged the new rules. Unions and auto sector associations have also warned about the proposed new tax, saying it would hurt not only the carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs. FCA said last month it plans to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and cleaner engines in Italy over the next three years to boost jobs and profitability. 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has since said the government would seek to improve the measures to not harm families in difficulties and to not create a shock to the Italian economy. “We will find a solution ... without damaging or causing a shock to companies’ industrial plans,” Di Maio said when asked about Gorlier’s letter. Possible changes to the amendment could result in the exclusion of smaller-engine vehicles from the proposed tax, government officials have said. “The sector scenario has been significantly modified by interventions in the car market under discussion in the budget law, which in our opinion alter the whole framework within which we outlined our plan for Italy,” FCA’s Gorlier said. “At the moment we do not yet have visibility on what the regulatory scenario will be in the coming years,” he added.

2018-12-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A growing percentage of Americans see climate change as an “imminent” threat driven mainly by human activity, and more than two-thirds want Washington to work with other nations to combat it, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday. The public concern over global warming in the United States clashes with President Donald Trump’s policies aimed at maximizing fossil fuels production and dismantling climate protections he views as too onerous and costly for industry. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, an accord to curb global warming struck by nearly 200 nations in 2015 that he said would kill American jobs and have no tangible environmental benefit.  Delegates from over 130 countries are now meeting in the Polish city of Katowice to write a rulebook for the deal and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday warned failure to reach an agreement would be suicidal. The Reuters/Ipsos poll, taken from Nov. 29 to Dec. 10, found that 35 percent of U.S. adults now see global warming as an “imminent” threat, up from 32 percent in 2017 and 24 percent in 2015. More than half, or 57 percent, also think global warming is caused by “human activity” or “mostly human activity”, according to the survey, up from the 47 percent who attributed it to human activity in a similar poll in 2012. And 69 percent said in the poll that the United States should work with other nations to curb climate change, including 64 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats. That marks a decline from 72 percent in a similar poll in 2017. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,660 adults in English in the United States and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points. The survey came close on the heels of a U.S. government report released last month that said climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, undermining health, infrastructure, and industries from farming to energy production. Trump rejected the report’s findings, saying “I don’t believe it.” The White House said the report relied on faulty methodology and that the next assessment of the threats posed by climate change would be more transparent and data driven. The United States has seen a surge in oil and gas output in the past decade, due mainly to advances in drilling technology, and this year became the world’s top producer of petroleum ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.

2018-12-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Authorities in China’s major steelmaking cities of Tangshan and Xuzhou have asked mills to curtail output as city officials are concerned they will not meet their pollution reduction targets for the year. The Tangshan city government ordered steel mills to comply with cuts mandated under a so-called first-level smog alert, meaning production should be cut by 40 percent, from the current second-level alert with cuts of only 30 percent, according to a notice sent to municipal officials on Tuesday that was reviewed by Reuters.  Mills will also be required to shut all sintering machines, facilities that process raw iron ore before being smelted into steel, and shaft furnaces that have failed to meet ultra-low emission standards, the document said. “The government told us to trim out more output due to bad air,” said an executive at a steel mill in Tangshan who received the notice.      A manager from Donghai Special Steel Co in Tangshan also confirmed to Reuters that she received the notice to curtail production.        Both officials declined to be named as they are not authorized to talk to media. An official at the Luannan county government, part of the Tangshan metropolitan government confirmed receiving the statement but declined to comment on the detailed measures.  The propaganda department for the Tangshan city government referred questions to the city’s emergency command center. However, a person contacted at the center said they were not authorized to speak to the media. Meanwhile, the city of Xuxhou in China’s No.2 steelmaking province of Jiangsu, 800 km (500 miles) south of Tangshan, ordered steel mills to shut down operations throughout December. “We were ordered on Tuesday to stop production until Dec. 31 as the city government has struggled to reach pollution targets,” said an executive at Xuzhou Jinhong Iron and Steel Co.  Reuters could not confirm the Xuzhou government order with officials contacted at Xuzhou Dongnan Iron and Steel Group, one of the three mills that operate in the city.

2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC’s supply-cutting deal agreed last week is vague even by the standards of the oil producer group as no individual output targets are likely to be published, although precise plans from top exporter Saudi Arabia boost the agreement’s credibility. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, seeking to prevent a surplus that could weaken oil prices,  agreed to cut production by 2.5 percent or 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-members. OPEC has published less detail on how the cut will work than it did in 2016, when it first announced a supply-limiting deal with its allies.  Unlike last time, there will be no release of any previously secret list of country-specific cuts, two OPEC sources said. “As ever, there’s a bit of smoke and mirrors around the latest OPEC deal,” said David Fyfe, an oil market economist formerly at trading firm Gunvor and the International Energy Agency. Oil ministers said the cuts would be from October production levels except for Kuwait and that Iran, Venezuela and Libya - at risk of output declines due to U.S. sanctions, economic collapse and unrest, respectively - were not required to reduce supply. None of that was confirmed in OPEC’s statement issued after the Vienna meeting. Still, actual supply cuts could exceed the promised volume thanks to Saudi Arabia. Riyadh said it would reduce output to 10.2 million bpd in January, going far beyond a 2.5 percent reduction from October production of 10.64 million bpd. “The OPEC communique is very vague but the production numbers from Saudi Arabia are very precise,” Olivier Jakob of oil consultancy Petromatrix said. “The main thing is that Saudi Arabia is reducing output.” If each OPEC country that is expected to reduce supplies were to curb output by 2.5 percent, the cutback would appear smaller than the 800,000-bpd reduction announced. “A cut of 2.5 percent from October levels for all bar Iran, Libya, Venezuela and Qatar looks closer to a 700,000-bpd cut,” said Fyfe, although he still sees the agreement as enough to support prices.  Qatar, one of OPEC’s smallest oil producers, is leaving the organisation in January. “Assuming we lose another, say, 400,000-500,000 combined from Iran, Libya and Venezuela in the first half of 2019, then the others will have probably done enough to prevent eye-popping stockbuilds early next year.” A third OPEC watcher, who also saw the deal as vague, cited the potential for unplanned output losses such as at Libya’s Sharara oilfield to give tailwind to pledges of lower supply. “A bit of a fudge might turn out a slight understatement,” he said. “But in the end external events seem to support OPEC - Sharara at the moment and who knows what in future.”    The following table shows how a production cut of 2.5 percent would work if shared equally among OPEC members minus Iran, Venezuela and Libya. The baseline for the cut is October’s production as reported in OPEC’s December Monthly Oil Market report, except for Kuwait, which according to delegates will cut from September production.  Production is in barrels per day. Qatar has been removed.

A joint bid for the Erawan (G1/61) concession from PTTEP and its partner, the UAE’s Mubadala Petroleum, won out over a submission from Chevron and Mitsui Oil Exploration. PTTEP will operate the Erawan concession with a 60 percent stake, while Mubadala holds the remaining 40 percent. PTTEP also won with a solo bid for the Bongkot (G2/61) concession, beating out Chevron and Mitsui Oil. “PTTEP has confidence in ensuring production and continuity in natural gas supply according to production sharing contracts,” Chief Executive Phongsthorn Thavisin said in a statement. Winning the concessions would increase the company’s production and reserves in the long-term, he said. This confirms PTTEP’s strategy to secure domestic gas supply and increase its reserves in the country, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Jean-Baptiste Berchoteau. Together the fields have a combined output of 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of gas, government data shows. The concessions require the holders to maintain minimum daily volumes of gas at 800 million and 700 million cubic feet, respectively, for the Erawan and Bongkot fields. The government will take 68 percent of the production profits from Erawan and 70 percent from Bongkot, the energy ministry said in a statement. Chevron Corp’s Thai unit currently operates the Erawan gas block and state-backed PTTEP operates Bongkot. These concessions for the gas fields will expire in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Chevron Thailand Holdings said in an emailed statement that it was deeply disappointed it was not the preferred bidder for the two blocks. “Chevron submitted credible, sustainable bids built on our deep experience operating in the Gulf of Thailand ... (and) allowed for the necessary investment to maximize recovery of Thailand’s resources,” it said. It added, however, that the company respected the decision of the Thai government and remained committed to delivering energy to the Southeast Asian nation. Woodmac’s Berchoteau noted that this is the second major loss for Chevron in Southeast Asia after it lost its Rokan asset to state energy company Pertamina in Indonesia earlier this year. “Chevron’s reserves and production in the region are now expected to fall drastically post-2022 and Southeast Asia could become a non-core region for the major,” Berchoteau said. The new production sharing agreements are expected to be signed in February 2019, the statement said. Both concessions are for 20 years with an option to extend for another 10 years, a ministry official said.

2018-12-13,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Santa delivered his traditional end of year rally on Thursday as world stocks made a third day of gains and the pound and the euro both stayed strong after the latest bout of Brexit drama. UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s survival in a late night no-confidence vote has not changed the markets’ views on Brexit but along with signs of a tentative truce in the U.S.-China trade war and progress in Italy it was enough to keep them jolly. The Nikkei and other Asian stocks had pushed roughly 1 percent higher and Europe also made a steady start ahead of several central bank meetings including a landmark one for the ECB which was set to end its quantitative easing programme. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1394 having largely traded in a $1.16 and $1.12 range since August. That made the dollar a touch softer while the pound was up for a second day at $1.2670. “All eyes will be on the ECB,” said Morgan Stanley FX strategist Hans Redeker. “It may revise its growth projections lower but continue to prepare the markets for allowing QE to end.” Short-dated Italian bond yields - which move inversely to price - hit their lowest in six months after the country’s government confirmed it would cut its deficit goal for 2019, potentially ending months of wrangling with Brussels. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the deficit goal had been lowered to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product from the 2.4 percent it had originally proposed, and it expected the European Commission to accept the proposal. Two-year Italian bond yields tumbled to 0.51 percent which took them back to where they were before a late May eruption of tensions triggered the worst day for short-term Italian debt in 25 years. Italy’s five-year and 10-year government bond yields dropped to their lowest level in 2 1/2 months and the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread improved to its tightest since the start of October. “I think the momentum can carry on in the near term as we have a number of supportive factors for Italian debt beyond just the hopes the budget deal can be reached,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger. On Brexit UK Prime Minister May was heading to an EU summit in Brussels following her confidence vote win to try and get some additional concessions on the controversial Irish border aspect of the agreement to placate rebels within her own party and Ulster unionist allies. Markets reckon May’s continued premiership for now makes a ‘no deal’ Brexit less likely at the margins and her survival takes at least some of the immediate headline risk out of the market – even if the Brexit impasse is really no clearer. The pound was trading at $1.2670 in early London dealing, still well up more than cent from the 20-month lows set early Wednesday and at about the levels seen just before the vote results on Wednesday night. In Asia, gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.1 percent. Markets are slowly growing less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two powers. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. But markets have been stung by false dawns in the past. Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines. “U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,” he said. “We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.” In the commodities markets, oil prices steadied, under pressure from high inventories but buoyed by a drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles and the indications that the U.S.-China trade war may be easing. Copper, which is highly sensitive to China’s fortunes also rose to a one week high in the metals market at it approached $6,200 a tonne although it remains badly beaten having lost almost 15 percent this year. “Signs of positive progression in trade talks between the U.S. and China should see sentiment in the commodity market remain positive,” analysts at ANZ wrote in a note.

2018-12-13,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A European Union court upheld on Thursday a complaint by the city authorities of Paris, Brussels and Madrid against an EU rule change on vehicle emissions they said had increased pollution, and it partly overturned the regulation. The General Court said the European Commission’s 2016 regulatory amendment raising the limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from cars and vans went beyond the powers of the EU executive and broke EU human rights and other laws. “The General Court upholds the actions brought by the cities of Paris, Brussels and Madrid and annuls in part the Commission’s regulation setting excessively high oxides of nitrogen emission limits for the tests for new light passenger and commercial vehicles,” it said in a statement. “The Commission did not have the power to amend the Euro 6 emission limits for the new real driving emission tests.” The French, Belgian and Spanish capitals have imposed their own local restrictions to curb air pollution, the Court said, and notably the oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, emitted especially by older diesel engines. It said only the part of the Commission’s Regulation 2016/646 which sets NOx limits must be annulled, not other parts of the legislation, which sets out the conditions for testing. It gave the Commission a year to make the amendments, so as to avoid legal uncertainty over decisions made already by consumers and carmakers.

2018-12-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - The global oil market could move into deficit sooner than expected thanks to OPEC’s output agreement with Russia and to Canada’s decision to cut supply, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. The Paris-based IEA kept its 2019 forecast for global oil demand growth at 1.4 million barrels per day, unchanged from its projection last month, and said it expected growth of 1.3 million bpd this year. Uncertainty over the global economy stemming from U.S.-China trade tensions could undermine oil consumption next year, as growth in supply gathers pace. “For 2019, our demand growth outlook remains at 1.4 million bpd even though oil prices have fallen back considerably since the early October peak,” the IEA said. “Some of the support provided by lower prices will be offset by weaker economic growth globally, and particularly in some emerging economies.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last week with Russia, Oman and other producers to cut oil output by 1.2 million bpd from January to stem a build-up in unused inventories of fuel.  The decision by the government of Canada’s Alberta province to force oil producers to curtail supply will bring the largest reduction to crude output next year, the IEA said.  Alberta crude and oil sands output will drop by 325,000 bpd from January to force down vast inventories that built up because of pipeline capacity constraints. The oil price LCOc1 has fallen by nearly a third so far this quarter to around $61 a barrel, from a four-year peak close to $87 in early October. In its previous report in November, the IEA said it expected the global oil market to remain in surplus throughout 2019. Now, it expects a deficit to materialise by the second quarter of next year, provided OPEC sticks to its supply deal. “Time will tell how effective the new production agreement will be in rebalancing the oil market,” the IEA said. Part of the oil-price weakness in the second half of this year stems from concern about how much an economic slowdown could eat into demand growth. The International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expect the global economy to expand more slowly next year than forecast six months ago.  The OECD in November projected that world economic growth would slow to 3.5 percent in 2019 from 3.8 percent this year. “Uncertainty about trade tensions and tighter monetary policies continue to affect confidence and investment. The OECD’s lower expectation for the world economy in 2019 could reduce oil demand growth by roughly 100,000 bpd,” the IEA said.

2018-12-13,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - A European Union court upheld on Thursday a complaint by the city authorities of Paris, Brussels and Madrid against an EU rule change on vehicle emissions they said had increased pollution, and it partly overturned the regulation. The General Court said the European Commission’s 2016 regulatory amendment raising the limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from cars and vans went beyond the powers of the EU executive and broke EU human rights and other laws. “The General Court upholds the actions brought by the cities of Paris, Brussels and Madrid and annuls in part the Commission’s regulation setting excessively high oxides of nitrogen emission limits for the tests for new light passenger and commercial vehicles,” it said in a statement. “The Commission did not have the power to amend the Euro 6 emission limits for the new real driving emission tests.” The French, Belgian and Spanish capitals have imposed their own local restrictions to curb air pollution, the Court said, and notably the oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, emitted especially by older diesel engines. It said only the part of the Commission’s Regulation 2016/646 which sets NOx limits must be annulled, not other parts of the legislation, which sets out the conditions for testing. It gave the Commission a year to make the amendments, so as to avoid legal uncertainty over decisions made already by consumers and carmakers. The Court dismissed a claim for damages of a symbolic euro brought by the City of Paris. The French capital said the Commission action had hurt its image.

Inpex has a majority stake of around 66 percent in the $40 billion project in northwestern Australia, which has seen multiple delays and significant cost overruns due to technical problems. The project’s other minority shareholders include CPC, Tokyo Gas (9531.T), Osaka Gas (9532.T), Kansai Electric (9503.T), JERA Corp and Toho Gas (9533.T). At full operational capacity, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tonnes of LPG and about 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil.

2018-12-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States are in close contact over trade, and any U.S. trade delegation would be welcome to visit, a commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this month agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion (159 billion pounds) worth of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal.  China has agreed to cut tariffs on U.S.-built cars and auto parts to 15 percent from 40 percent, a Trump administration official said on Tuesday, setting the stage for new talks aimed at easing the dispute between the world’s two largest economies. China’s tariff cut was communicated during a phone call between  Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the official said. Both sides are in touch, said Gao Feng, spokesman at the Chinese commerce ministry, when asked at a regular news briefing about details of the Tuesday telephone conversation.  “Both sides exchanged views on the timetable and roadmap for next steps,” said Gao, who was also asked if China was planning to send a delegation to the United States to discuss trade. “At this time, both sides are in close contact. China welcomes the U.S. side to come to China for consultations, and also is open to visiting the United States for talks,” he said.  Separately, China on Wednesday bought at least 500,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans in its first major purchase of the oilseed since Trump and Xi struck their trade truce at Dec. 1 talks in Argentina, traders said. “Soybeans have always been an important import product from the United States,” said Gao. “We have a huge domestic market demand.” Reporting by Christian Shepherd; Writing by Ryan Woo; Editing by Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china/update-1-china-commerce-ministry-would-welcome-u-s-trade-delegation-visit-idUKL3N1YI2TI,13 Dec 2018,"China and the United States are

2018-12-13,"DUBAI/DOHA (Reuters) - Even before taking over Qatar’s energy policy in a government reshuffle last month, Qatar Petroleum (QP) CEO Saad al-Kaabi had long wanted the Gulf state to leave OPEC. Kaabi was concerned OPEC membership could be a stumbling block for QP’s ambitions in the United States, where it has one of the world’s biggest LNG terminals, and a distraction as Doha doubles down on gas production, three industry sources said.  Proposed U.S. legislation known as NOPEC (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act) could expose members of the oil exporters club to antitrust lawsuits, a risk for QP at a time it is planning to invest billions more in the United States. The sources said Qatar’s exit had been in the works for months, driven by Kaabi’s desire to focus on Qatar’s strength in liquefied national gas (LNG) rather than OPEC, where Doha has little say anyway because it doesn’t produce much oil. “It takes Qatar out of the whole debate within the U.S. Congress on whether or not OPEC is a cartel,” said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If anything it puts Qatar in America’s good books.” The decision to leave after 57 years just two days ahead of a crucial OPEC output policy meeting in Vienna last week also struck many as a shot at Saudi Arabia, which along with the Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates has imposed a boycott on Qatar since June 2017. The absence of Qatar’s emir from an annual Gulf Arab summit in Saudi Arabia on Sunday was then seen as a sign there is no end in sight to the dispute and that Qatar is set to go it alone - outside a six-nation Gulf Arab bloc fractured by the rift. Qatar would nevertheless still welcome the lifting of the trade and transport boycott which has hit national carrier Qatar Airways, companies with interests in boycotting states and demand from regional investors and banks. The countries boycotting Qatar accuse it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the charge. U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, blaming it for high oil prices. OPEC members have also been unnerved by the souring of U.S.-Saudi relations over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.  The U.S. Senate is considering this week a joint resolution condemning Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi’s murder. Trump told Reuters he stands by the crown prince as de facto ruler of a strategic ally, saying he has repeatedly denied involvement in the killing. But the risk of possible legal action under NOPEC has become a concern for Doha as it aims to cement its rank as the world’s biggest LNG producer, the industry sources told Reuters. State-owned QP is the majority owner of the huge Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips  holding smaller stakes.  QP is also considering buying U.S. gas assets and is due to decide soon on more investment in the Golden Pass LNG project. While Qatar is one of smallest OPEC producers with output of some 600,000 barrels per day, or 0.6 percent of global demand, it is one of the most influential players in the global gas market thanks to annual production of 77 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas. Qatar’s gas production has been a crucial factor in helping it weather the Gulf Arab boycott and it plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-2024. Kaabi said in Vienna last week that being primarily a gas producer, Doha saw no added value in belonging to OPEC and that its departure was “100 percent not a political decision”. “We don’t have enough weight in OPEC to have an effect,” he told reporters on the eve of his first and last meeting as the head of Qatar’s OPEC delegation. Kaabi promised QP would make “a big splash” soon. Industry sources said the OPEC exit bore the hallmarks of a CEO who has aggressively streamlined QP since taking the helm in 2014, merging subsidiaries and laying off thousands of employees to refocus on one thing: producing even more gas. “It’s consistent with his desire to simplify, to focus on oil and gas and try to avoid the peripheral stuff that QP used to do. It’s very much in line with that drive to get out of activities which are not fundamental,” said one source. Kaabi, a U.S.-educated engineer, is one of Qatar’s most powerful figures and after years of dealmaking for QP he is known as Mr Gas. Although not a member of the ruling family, he is in charge of the vital gas resources in a country of just 2.6 million people and is close to inner policy-making circles. The plan to withdraw from OPEC likely started in June when Kaabi attended OPEC talks in Vienna with then energy minister, Mohammed al-Sada, according to the sources. Due to the Gulf rift, Qatar could no longer attend a traditional closed-doors meeting of Gulf oil ministers to agree policy before twice-yearly talks with all OPEC members. “The Qataris felt marginalized,” said one OPEC source.  A Gulf official said despite the boycott, Sada still had some rapport with his Saudi and UAE counterparts. As OPEC president in 2016 Sada was instrumental in bringing together oil producers, including non-OPEC Russia, to agree a reduction in supply to support crude oil prices. But last month, a government reshuffle removed Sada and elevated Kaabi to minister of state for energy affairs, making him de facto energy head. “If Kaabi came it won’t be the same. They don’t have that same relationship. And the Qataris want to be part of the decision-making,” the official said.

2018-12-13,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan +0.8 pct, trims earlier gains * Paris, Frankfurt seen opening higher; FTSE seen flat * Policy support expectations lift China shares * Low volumes, high volatility to remain - JPMorgan analyst * China said to plan “Made in China 2025” replacement By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Asian equity markets rallied on Thursday on signs of easing Sino-U.S. trade tensions and expectations that China will step up efforts soon to support its cooling economy. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent, building on early gains made after British Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote. Financial spreadbetters expect shares in Europe to follow suit, with Frankfurt’s DAX seen opening 0.3 percent higher at 10,963 and Paris’ CAC expected to gain 0.2 percent. London’s FTSE is seen flat. U.S. stock futures rose 0.4 percent, pointing to a firmer opening on Wall Street. In Asia, gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.1 percent. Markets are slowly growing less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two powers. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. But markets have been stung by false dawns in the past. Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines. “U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,” he said. “We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.” China also appears to be toning down its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed “Made in China 2025,” which has long irked the United States. But it remains to be seen if Beijing will meet Washington’s demands for stronger protection for U.S. intellectual property. “In the scheme of things and were this to prove true, this is far more relevant than China agreeing to restart purchases of American soybeans, or even reducing the tariff on US car imports from 40 percent to 15 percent, as has been indicated in the last 24 hours,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a note. But China’s economic woes are deeper rooted than just U.S. trade threats, and global investors are banking that Beijing will roll out more support measures in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities, said investor expectations of further policy support were rising ahead of a key policy meeting. The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) is typically held in mid-December. Major economic growth targets and policy goals are discussed but typically not publicly announced until the National People’s Congress in March. Some analysts expect China’s economic growth could slow to around 6 percent next year, the slowest pace since 1990, from around 6.5 percent in 2018. In the currency market, sterling gave up some ground after rallying from a 20-month low after May survived a party no-confidence vote. It was last trading at $1.2626 Analysts expect gains in the pound will be fleeting, as May appeared no closer to getting her EU divorce agreement through parliament, raising the risk of a chaotic exit from the bloc in March. “The fact remains that the EU is highly unlikely to offer the reassurance MPs are demanding on the Irish backstop,” analysts at ING said, adding there was a risk that a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal will not take place until later in the first quarter of 2019. “In the meantime, the lack of clarity and elevated risk of ‘no deal’ is set to see economic activity slow further,” they said. ING expects UK growth to halve in the fourth quarter from the third. The euro was flat at $1.1369 after Italy’s government offered to lower its deficit target next year to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product, below the 2.4 percent level that the European Commission had rejected as too high. The European Central Bank is all but certain to formally end its lavish bond purchase scheme on Thursday but will take an increasingly dim view on growth, raising the odds that its next step in removing stimulus will be delayed. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly unchanged at 97.054. The dollar rose 0.15 percent against Japan’s currency, buying 113.45 yen. U.S. Treasury yields continued to rise as risk sentiment improved. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9131 percent on Thursday, up from its U.S. close of 2.906 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.7723 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.77 percent. U.S. crude rose 0.3 percent to $51.31 a barrel as trade tensions eased, and Brent crude futures gained 0.5 percent to $60.47 per barrel. Spot gold was little changed at $1,244.65 per ounce.

2018-12-13,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - There is a risk that investors will get carried away with optimism over an easing of the U.S.-China trade dispute on the back of China resuming purchases of U.S. soybeans. This is especially the case given there is yet no sign of new imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal, the energy commodities that will provide a far better signal of any detente in the trade spat. China ended a six-month boycott of buying U.S. soybeans on Wednesday, with state-owned companies purchasing at least 500,000 tonnes of the oilseed, traders said. Traders also said it appears the Chinese may seek more soybeans in coming weeks as they are struggling to meet all their import requirements from other suppliers. This sounds extremely positive for U.S. President Donald Trump and the trade war truce he claimed to have brokered with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20 meeting in Argentina earlier this month. It may well be the first sign of a major thaw between the two administrations, and it may even herald the start of positive moves towards some kind of settlement that would see no more tariffs being imposed, and perhaps even the removal of the ones already implemented. But it’s also worth putting things in context. China used to be the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, taking about 60 percent of exports in 2017, worth an estimated $12 billion.  However, since Beijing slapped a tariff on soybean imports from the United States, the trade has fallen away, with U.S. exports to China dropping to 8.2 million tonnes in the first 10 months of the year, down from 21.4 million in the same period last year, according to government figures. What this shows is that China would have to dramatically boost its buying from the United States to return to former levels, which makes the recent 500,000-tonnes purchase a spit in the bucket. It’s also likely that China finds it convenient to go back to the U.S. market at the present time, given the U.S. crop is ready for export, while that from southern hemisphere rival Brazil isn’t. This means there is a seasonal element to trade in soybeans, and the Chinese government may have had little choice but to resume U.S. imports, but they have done so in a way that delivers Trump a little victory that may appease the mercurial U.S. president. What would be far more significant than buying some cargoes of soybeans, which China needs anyway, is the resumption of imports of energy commodities. One of Trump’s aims in starting a trade fight with Beijing was that he wanted to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, but the opposite has proven to be the case. While Trump focused on putting tariffs on imports from China, the Chinese simply stopped the one area of trade that was growing rapidly and helping lower the trade imbalance, namely imports of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States - about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. But this dropped to zero in October, and in November one cargo of U.S. crude was discharged, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. More importantly, there is no sign of the trade resuming, with no cargoes currently booked to arrive in December, or beyond, according to the data. It’s worth noting that crude oil isn’t subject to any Chinese import tariff, although LNG and coal are. In LNG, no U.S. cargoes of LNG arrived in China in October, although two were discharged in November. However, no cargoes are slated for arrival in December or beyond. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. China imported zero U.S. coal in October, two cargoes totalling about 211,000 tonnes in November, and none are scheduled to arrive in December or January. In the first nine months of the year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, the majority of this being higher-value metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. Obviously this situation can change, and Chinese importers of crude, LNG and coal may well choose to resume buying from the United States. But, perhaps unlike soybeans, they don’t have to as there are currently plenty of alternative suppliers. If there really was a detente looming in the U.S.-China trade dispute, then a clear sign of that would be a resumption of energy imports.

Federal prosecutors allege the European multinationals and some smaller players collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras to sell them oil at sweetheart prices. They said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be ongoing. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by creativity, competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen in an effort to cover their tracks, allowing these businessmen to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries. Emails obtained by investigators show intermediaries hustling to profit from their connections, authorities said. Some shared spreadsheets divvying up to the last cent their cut of the spoils from deals they allegedly sealed with crooked Petrobras employees. Prosecutors said the messages also show that rings of middlemen knew about one another and battled fiercely for the favor of the big oil-trading firms. Some discussed their attempts to woo top executives with promises of delivering more shady trades and fatter profits than rivals. One intermediary griped that Vitol was “not at all sentimental” and would choose whomever could secure them the biggest returns. “Now you are the flavor of the month, next month there is a new flavor,” the middleman lamented in the email. Brazilian authorities last week searched the Rio de Janeiro-area offices of Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore as well as other entities they allege participated in the scheme. Police said they could not locate a physical office in Brazil for Mercuria. No charges have been filed. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations. Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of the alleged corruption. Eight people have been arrested, including two employees of Petrobras whom the oil firm has since fired because of “strong evidence against them that they were involved in irregularities,” the company said in a written statement. Interpol alerts have been issued for three other suspects who are outside Brazil, including a Petrobras trader based in Houston. None have been arrested. The European firms - Vitol is based in London, the three others in Switzerland - are powerhouses in commodities trading. They have investments in strategic energy and commodity infrastructure around the world, including in Brazil. Together they control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have revenues larger than Argentina’s gross domestic product. Brazilian federal Judge Gabriela Hardt, as part of her legal order authorizing last week’s arrests and search warrants, wrote “there is proof” the companies and their affiliates “paid commissions to intermediaries for the buying and selling of combustibles from Petrobras, to the benefit of the companies and to the detriment of the state-run company.” The stakes are high for the trading firms. The probe could jeopardize their current and future business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer. A Vitol-led consortium has a $1.5 billion deal pending to purchase Petrobras’ stake in prized Nigerian oilfields. The new developments also signal that Brazil’s landmark Car Wash probe may be far from over. Launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the law-enforcement juggernaut has already toppled scores of powerful figures, including the former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazil’s Odebrecht SA, Latin America’s largest construction firm, in 2016 cut a deal with prosecutors to pay at least $3.5 billion for its role in a massive bribes-for-contracts ring. Foreign firms are now in the crosshairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. “All foreign companies that have done business with Petrobras in the past 15 years should carry out some rigorous internal investigations, to have confidence that they are not exposed to Car Wash,” Costa told Reuters. He said several foreign oil companies had already approached Brazilian prosecutors to “sound them out” about leniency deals. Costa would not disclose names of the firms. Some of Brazil’s political class have maneuvered to wind down a probe that has consumed the country and paralyzed key sectors of the economy. But President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes office on Jan. 1, is under pressure from the public to keep going. He has chosen Sergio Moro, a crusading judge who led Car Wash, to be Brazil’s next Justice Minister. “Car Wash will continue its brutal transformation of Brazil’s corporate culture,” said Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a leading Brazilian business school. “It is not going to stop.” Costa said the supply and refining units at Petrobras where the alleged corruption took place were ripe for chicanery. Traders in the company’s far-flung offices could make large purchases or sales without approval from Petrobras executives, he said. Because the alleged graft involved tweaking mere cents on liters, Costa said it was easy to hide from any oversight, with the potential for huge illicit gains given the large volumes of product involved. Brazilian authorities allege that Petrobras employees participating in the scheme bought oil from the traders at prices above the going market rate, and also sold them Petrobras oil products and storage leases at below-market rates, hurting the state-run firm’s bottom line, authorities said. Prosecutors say Trafigura, Vitol, Glencore and Mercuria used middlemen as well as their own representatives to execute the corrupt deals with Petrobras insiders. Authorities allege the illicit funds moved through U.S. and European banks, among others. A pivotal figure, Brazilian authorities allege, was Swedish-national Bo Hans Wilhelm Ljungberg, an independent oil broker who operated out of Rio de Janeiro. They say he was a key agent who secured business for Vitol and other firms by funneling bribes to Petrobras traders, in particular to one in Houston. Vitol’s first business relationship with Ljungberg dates back to the 1990s when it bought one of his companies; more recently, he acted as an agent, Vitol said. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg, who prosecutors said returned to Sweden. He did not reply to messages sent to his email address included in court documents, nor to messages sent to social media accounts. Prosecutors allege Vitol paid just over $5 million to offshore trading entities that Ljungberg co-owned called Encom Trading SA and Celixore AB to secure deals with Petrobras between 2011 and 2014. Prosecutors showed Reuters copies of bank transfers from those firms’ accounts. Judge Hardt’s ruling said that one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, was “fully aware” that Ljungberg was securing Vitol’s business through bribes, based on email evidence indicating the executive had spoken with the Swede about the alleged scheme. Loya did not respond to requests for comment sent to his email and via social media. As for Trafigura, prosecutors say the company used its own executives to bribe Petrobras employees. Judge Hardt’s order alleges that Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, a former Trafigura top executive, and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes, a local country representative, funneled bribes to Petrobras employees between mid-2009 and September 2014. Lawyers for Ferraz and Magalhaes did not respond to requests for comment. Ferraz is already serving a 10-year sentence in Brazil for bribing a former Petrobras refinery manager on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was arrested in late 2016 and resigned from Trafigura. Prosecutors allege that Magalhaes also engaged in bribery for other companies, including Glencore’s fully-owned subsidiary Chemoil. Apart from payments via Magalhaes, Glencore subsidiaries paid $4 million to other middlemen who allegedly bribed Petrobras officials, the judge’s ruling said. Prosecutors say that they know the least about Mercuria’s dealings with Petrobras. They said they have identified suspicious trades sealed between the company’s representatives in Brazil and middlemen to broker allegedly illicit deals.

2018-12-13,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Coal railway workers at Australian hauler Aurizon Holdings Ltd are planning strikes after a breakdown in pay negotiations, their trade union said, a move that could delay shipments from the world’s largest coking coal export region.     Miners including BHP Billiton, Glencore, Anglo American and Peabody Energy use Aurizon’s four major railways in the state of Queensland to bring coal to port. Protracted negotiations over pay rises and rostering had broken down, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union, which represents train crews and maintenance workers at Aurizon, said in a statement on Thursday. “Members ... will start walking off the job at midday tomorrow in 11 days of action,” the union said. Four days of stoppages and seven days of overtime bans are planned.  Aurizon said in a statement that if the strikes go ahead, its coal trains would not run on its Blackwater and Moura networks for 24 hours from noon on Friday.  Aurizon coal haulage on the Goonyella and Newlands lines would stop for 24 hours from noon on Saturday and on its corridor into Brisbane from noon on Monday for 24 hours. The lines connect the coal-rich Bowen Basin with ports on Australia’s east coast. A BHP spokesman said the strikes would have no “material impact”. Glencore, Anglo American and Peabody had no immediate comment. “Aurizon has been bargaining in good faith (and) believes solid and constructive progress was being made,” the firm said in a statement. “Aurizon is urging the unions to withdraw their proposed industrial action. It is extremely disappointing that unions have elected to take this unnecessary and premature step.” Aurizon shares were largely steady in the afternoon, in line with the broader market.

2018-12-13,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Hengli Petrochemical Group (600346.SS) will start test-running its new oil refinery in the northeastern city of Dalian on December 15, according to a company statement, slightly behind an earlier timeline of around the end of November.  Once operational, Hengli will become the country’s first privately owned refinery and chemical complex. With a refining capacity of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, the site will rival the largest oil refineries in China, the world’s biggest importer and second-largest consumer of oil.  “Hengli has completed building the 20 million ton per year refinery and chemical complex, with public utilities and auxiliary facilities also ripe for operations,” the firm said in a statement posted on its social media platform late on Wednesday. Diesel fuel will first be injected into the pipes to run through the facilities, before crude oil is fed into the distillation tower about a week to 10 days later, said an industry source involved in the test operation.  A total of 500,000 tonnes of Saudi crude oil will be used for experimental operations for about 20 days, said the source, who declined to be named as not authorized to speak to press. It normally takes several months for a new refinery to begin  stable operations after test runs.  Hengli has agreed to buy 130,000 bpd of crude oil from state-owned Saudi Aramco under an annual supply agreement for 2019, becoming a new major customer for Saudi Arabia which competes with Russia for the top spot in oil sales to China. Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp, controlled by private chemical group Rongsheng Holdings, is expected to start partial test operations at some units around end of this year and early 2019 at its similar-sized complex.

2018-12-13,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar installations fell 15 percent in the third quarter as the Trump administration’s tariffs on overseas-made panels forced developers to put off large projects, according to a report commissioned by the industry’s primary trade group. Current weakness in the utility-scale market, however, will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever, the report said. Quarterly installations of utility-scale solar were 678 megawatts, the lowest quarter since 2015 and a more than 30 percent decline from a year ago, the report by Wood Mackenzie for the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association said. The total market, which includes residential and commercial installations, came in at 1.7 gigawatts. The slowdown is a shift for solar, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade. Through the first three quarters of the year, solar accounted for 30 percent of electricity generating capacity additions. Large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the 30 percent tariffs as panels can account for up to half their costs. Trump announced the levy on all imported solar panels in January, his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline. Solar installers opposed the move because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels. Most of the panels installed in the United States are made in Asia by companies including China’s JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd, Canadian Solar Inc, and U.S.-based SunPower Corp. Wood Mackenzie lowered its 2018 utility-scale forecast to 6.6 GW from 6.8 GW as more projects get pushed into 2019.  The firm raised its forecasts for 2019 through 2023 by a combined 2.5 GW, however, as utilities procure projects that will qualify for a federal tax credit that begins to phase out in 2020. Developers will start projects next year but delay buying modules until 2020 or later because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year. Sliding solar panel prices are also spurring demand from utilities.  A move by China earlier this year to slash subsidies for solar installations has unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing down prices. Solar energy system prices are at historical lows in all segments of the market, the report said. U.S. module prices are down more than 15 percent from a year ago.

After a quiet start, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up more than 1 percent by midday, building on early gains made after British Prime Minister Theresa May survived a no-confidence vote. Regional gains were concentrated in Chinese shares, with Chinese blue-chips up 1.9 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gaining 1.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1 percent higher, while Australian shares gained 0.4 percent. U.S. stock futures rose 0.5 percent, pointing to a firmer opening on Wall Street. Markets are slowly growing less pessimistic about the chances of a Sino-U.S. trade deal after a slew of news this week pointed to easing tensions between the two powers. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Chinese state-owned companies have bought more than 1.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans in the first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months. The purchases are the most concrete evidence yet that China is making good on pledges made when Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on Dec. 1 and agreed to a 90-day detente to negotiate a trade deal. But markets have been stung by false signals in the past and Yoshinori Shigemi, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, cautioned against reading too much into trade headlines. “U.S.-China trade negotiations are subject to very high uncertainty. So lots of headlines come and go, and markets come and go also,” he said. “We have to see the evolution of this negotiation.” China also appears to be toning down its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed “Made in China 2025,” which has long irked the United States, according to new guidance to local governments. But it remains to be seen if Beijing will meet Washington’s demands for stronger protection for U.S. intellectual property. “In the scheme of things and were this to prove true, this is far more relevant than China agreeing to restart purchases of American soybeans, or even reducing the tariff on US car imports from 40 percent to 15 percent, as has been indicated in the last 24 hours,” analysts at National Australia Bank said in a note. But China’s economic woes are deeper rooted than just trade, and global investors are also banking that Beijing will roll out more support measures in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown. Zhang Gang, an analyst at China Central Securities, said investor expectations of further policy support were rising ahead of a key policy meeting. The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) is typically held in mid-December. Major economic growth targets and policy goals are discussed but typically not publicly announced until the National People’s Congress in March. Some analysts expect China’s economic growth could slow to around 6 percent next year, the slowest pace since 1990, from around 6.5 percent in 2018. In the currency market, sterling gave up some gains after rallying from a 20-month low after May survived a party no-confidence vote. It was last trading down 0.04 percent at $1.2624 But analysts expect gains in the pound will be fleeting, as May appeared no closer to getting her EU divorce agreement through parliament, raising the risk of a chaotic exit in March. “The fact remains that the EU is highly unlikely to offer the reassurance MPs are demanding on the Irish backstop,” analysts at ING said, adding there was a risk that a parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal will not take place until later in the first quarter of 2019. “In the meantime, the lack of clarity and elevated risk of ‘no deal’ is set to see economic activity slow further,” they said. ING expects UK growth to halve in the fourth quarter from the third. The euro was also higher, up 0.04 percent at $1.1375 after Italy’s government offered to lower its deficit target next year to 2.04 percent of gross domestic product, below the 2.4 percent level that the European Commission had rejected as too high. The European Central Bank is all but certain to formally end its lavish bond purchase scheme on Thursday but will take an increasingly dim view on growth, raising the odds that its next step in removing stimulus will be delayed. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly unchanged at 97.070. The dollar rose 0.15 percent against Japan’s currency, buying 113.45 yen. U.S. treasury yields continued to rise as risk sentiment improved. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9132 percent on Thursday, up from its U.S. close of 2.906 percent on Wednesday.

2018-12-13,"SINGAPORE, Dec 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices edged up on Thursday, buoyed by a drawdown in inventories and by signs of easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Oil prices have also been supported by OPEC-led supply curbs announced last week, although gains have been muted after the producer group lowered its 2019 demand forecast. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.27 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 0.23 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “Crude oil prices rose, helped by the easing trade tension, as well as a fall in inventories,” ANZ bank said on Thursday. “The news that China is looking to redraft its ‘Made in China’ 2025 plan boosted hopes that trade talks are progressing better than expected.” China appears to be easing its high-tech industrial development push, dubbed ‘Made in China 2025’, which has long irked the United States, amid talks between the two countries to reduce trade tensions, according to new guidance to local governments. A drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, though less than expected, has helped boost sentiment, analysts said. U.S. crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, compared with market expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels. Meanwhile, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said 2019 demand for its crude would fall to 31.44 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million less than it currently produces. This adds to the concerns of several market watchers that the decision led by the group to cut production by 1.2 million bpd overall might not be enough to override a glut, especially on the back of soaring U.S. output. “Oil markets have been concerned about the possibility of weaker macroeconomic and oil demand growth; when combined with booming U.S. shale output, this could keep markets oversupplied in 2019, even with the OPEC+ cut,” Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner said in a note. “At this point, the OPEC+ cuts appear to have merely put a floor under prices.” The United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has hit a record 11.7 million bpd, is set to end 2018 as the world’s top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.

U.S. treasury yields continued to rise after steep declines as risk sentiment improved. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9114 percent on Thursday, up from its U.S. close of 2.906 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.7744 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.77 percent. U.S. crude rose 0.37 percent to $51.34 a barrel as trade tensions eased, and spot gold was slightly higher, trading at 1,245.77 per ounce on the weaker dollar.
