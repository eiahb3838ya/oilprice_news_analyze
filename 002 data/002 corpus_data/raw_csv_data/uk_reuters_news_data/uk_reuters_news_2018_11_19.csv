2018-11-19,"BRATISLAVA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Slovakia will phase out subsidies for coal mines supplying one of the country’s most polluting power plants from 2023, sooner than expected, Economy Minister Peter Ziga said on Monday. The Slovak government subsidises mining at the country’s only coal company, privately owned Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza (HBP), paying around 100 million euros ($114 million) a year, which helps maintain thousands of jobs. The company produced 1.8 million tonnes of brown coal last year, supplying the Novaky power plant in central Slovakia. The facility is operated by Slovenske Elektrarne, a utility co-owned by the state, Italy’s Enel and Czech energy group EPH. Slovenske Elektrarne said this year that extending the life of the 266-megawatt Novaky plant beyond 2023 would require significant investment. The Environment Ministry says the plant is the second-biggest carbon emitter in the country. Closing the mines has long been contentious as they employ around 4,000 people directly and 11,000 indirectly. Slovakia’s car industry is booming, though, potentially giving retrained workers the chance to secure another job. “We will soon unveil an action plan and announce the year 2023 as the end of subsidies for the coal mines,” Ziga told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Bratislava. “It does not mean they would have to close immediately. We have to work with the European Commission to show people alternatives,” he added.

2018-11-19,"(Corrects paragraph 3 to say the fire incinerated Paradise shortly after it broke out on Nov. 8, not in the week after) By Terray Sylvester Nov 19 (Reuters) - Emergency services on Sunday sifted through the charred wreckage of California’s deadliest ever wildfire, searching for signs of nearly 1,000 people believed still missing as crews made progress in bringing the blaze under control. The remains of 77 people have been recovered, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office said late on Sunday, as it cut the number of missing to 993 from 1,276. It gave no other details. The Camp Fire broke out in Northern California on Nov. 8 and quickly all but obliterated Paradise, a mountain town of nearly 27,000 people around 90 miles (145 km) north of state capital Sacramento. Officials said it had consumed about 150,000 acres and was 65 percent contained late on Sunday, up from 60 percent earlier in the day, as prospects of a heavy rainstorm from late Tuesday onwards raised hopes that that percentage will rise as the week progresses. They said full containment was not expected until Nov. 30, however. Up to four inches (10 cm) of rain are forecast to fall north of San Francisco between late Tuesday and Friday, said Patrick Burke, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland. “This weather system is locked in,” he said. The rain would also make it harder for forensic teams sifting through ash and dirt looking for the bones of the dead. “The rain will easily disturb the soil where remains might be found,” Burke said. Pathologists from the University of Nevada, Reno, worked through the weekend as firefighters peeled back debris, collecting bits of burned bones and photographing everything that might help identify the victims. The storm, which is expected to carry moderate winds of 15-20 mph could also cause problems for evacuees, hundreds of whom are sheltering in tens and cars. It isn’t clear how many people are in need of shelter but as many as 52,000 people had been ordered to evacuate “While it isn’t an exceptionally strong storm, the recent burns make mud slides on hills and slopes a real danger,” Burke said. South of Sacramento near Malibu, at least two inches of rain are expected to fall on a second fire, the Woolsey. Known to have killed three people, it was 88 percent contained on Sunday and full containment was expected on Thanksgiving Thursday. The cause of both fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported localized equipment problems around the time they broke out. PG&E Corp has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.

2018-11-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Refineries around the world are squeezing out every last drop of diesel while drowning in gasoline, in what could well become the new normal for the next few years. The imbalance is a confluence of major shifts in oil markets - surging production of light U.S. shale oil, plummeting exports of heavier Venezuelan and Iranian crude, weakening gasoline demand and rising diesel consumption. The coming in 2020 of the biggest change in fuel regulations in decades, when the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will start requiring ships to use cleaner fuel, is likely to prolong this reality, oil executives and analysts say. Refineries that distil crude oil into fuel have always had to adapt their output to shifting demand patterns such as high consumption of gasoline in summer and increased demand for heating oil in winter. But the market for refined products appears out of kilter in a way rarely seen before, and the IMO changes are likely to prolong the imbalance. “We are witnessing a microcosm of the post-IMO environment,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. The new IMO regulations will reduce the allowed content of sulphur in shipping fuel, known as bunker fuel, from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent, increasing demand for diesel at the expense of dirtier fuel oil. Ahead of the change, refineries invested in equipment to remove more sulphur from crude oil and increase production of diesel. At the same time, a slew of new refineries has come or will come on stream in coming years. Several long-term changes are further impacting oil refining. First, gasoline demand is gradually decelerating due to higher engine efficiency, slowing economic growth in China and a gradual expansion of the electric vehicle fleet. The International Energy Agency has estimated that gasoline demand will grow by “a puny” 80,000 barrels per day in 2018, the slowest expansion since 2011. [IEA/M] Diesel demand, on the other hand, has been persistently strong due to higher industrial activity in the United States, while global stocks have tightened as a result of lower exports from China and refinery outages. For a graphic on Diesel vs gasoline (png), see - tmsnrt.rs/2PHAhiM The imbalance has been deepened by the shifting supply of crude oil to lighter, sweet grades that yield less diesel and more gasoline.  Production of light shale oil in the United States surged over the past year, while supply of heavy crudes dropped in Venezuela and Iran, which was hit by newly instated U.S. sanctions this month. So while historically refineries tweak their crude intake and production yields to adapt to seasonal consumption, this time the acute demand for diesel and lighter crude intake means refiners are opting to maximise output. In terms of overall refining profits, strong diesel cracks are able to offset slumping gasoline margins. Refineries have also found support from fuel oil, a “bottom of the barrel” product usually sold at a loss. The abundance of light, sweet crude has pushed up demand for fuel oil, which is blended with lighter crude to increase diesel output.   “We are seeing very healthy demand for diesel and fuel oil and the only weak spot really is gasoline,” Dario Scaffardi, chief executive of Italian refiner Saras (SRS.MI), told Reuters. “The IMO will be very constructive for us, and the question is how constructive. I would agree that this scenario of strong diesel and weak gasoline seems the most reasonable going forward.” Unlike previous years that saw an extreme imbalance between gasoline and diesel, which account for around 70 percent of global refinery output, today’s reality is likely to persist. Refineries will attempt to shift output as much as they can away from gasoline into diesel, said Russell Hardy, chief executive of Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader which owns several refineries in Europe. “As more refineries come on and as more light sweet materials come on ... It is going to tend to weigh heavily on that part of the barrel, which in turn essentially puts all of the onus on distillates to make the refinery margin in 2020,” Hardy told the Reuters Commodities Summit in October.  Consultancy JBC Energy expects the abundance of light crude supply in the United States to hinder the ability of refiners to cut gasoline output, while also forecasting that demand in 2019 is unlikely to rebound strongly. The refineries with the highest diesel production and lowest fuel oil output are generally likely to benefit the most from the IMO changes. Less complex, older plants that have a greater output of gasoline or fuel oil are likely to fall behind. According to Morgan Stanley, in Europe, Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC), Turkey’s Tupras and Saras are best placed for the IMO changes. In the United States, the largest independent refiner Valero (VLO.N) and in Asia, India’s reliance, which operates the world’s largest refinery in Jamnagar, are in pole position.

2018-11-19,"(Adds details, quotes, context) ISTANBUL, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Construction of the offshore part of the TurkStream pipeline that will carry Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey has been completed, Russian gas producer Gazprom said on Monday. TurkStream is part of Moscow’s efforts to bypass Ukraine as a gas transit route to Europe, which imports around a third of its gas needs from Gazprom. “Projects of this kind and this project in particular are not directed against the interests of anyone. Projects of this kind are purely creative,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said as he and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attended an official ceremony in Istanbul. Work will now focus onshore and is on track to be completed by the end of 2019, he said. Gazprom is building the TurkStream in two lines, each with a capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres of gas per year. The first will supply Turkey and the second southern Europe. Turkey is almost completely reliant on imports to meet its energy needs. A crippling currency crisis which has seen the lira plummet has increased costs, prompting energy companies to hike consumer prices. Turkey’s state pipeline operator Botas will build the 69-km section of TurkStream which will carry natural gas from the coast to its distribution centre in Luleburgaz in northwestern Turkey, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez told private broadcaster NTV, adding he expected this to be completed in 2019. A 145-km section of pipeline from the distribution centre to the border will be constructed by Botas and Gazprom, he said.

2018-11-19,"(Reuters) - Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions, which are part of a psychological war doomed to failure, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday. By reimposing sanctions on OPEC’s third biggest crude producer, Washington wants to force Tehran to drop its ballistic missile programs, further curb its nuclear work and limit its support for proxy militias from Syria to Lebanon and Yemen. “We will not yield to this pressure, which is part of the psychological war launched against Iran,” Rouhani said in a speech in the city of Khoy, broadcast live on state television. “They have failed to stop our oil exports. We will keep exporting it ... Your regional policies have failed and you blame Iran for that failure from Afghanistan to Yemen and Syria,” he added, to chants of “Death to America!”. Rouhani said Washington lacked the necessary international support for its sanctions, and noted that it had granted temporary waivers to eight major buyers of Iranian oil. “America is isolated now. Iran is supported by many countries. Except for the Zionist regime (Israel) and some countries in the region, no other country backs America’s pressure on Iran,” he said. The European Union, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, participants with the United States in the 2015 deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, have been trying to find ways to circumvent the U.S. limitations.  In particular, the EU has been trying to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for non-dollar trade with Iran. But this has not stopped foreign businesses ranging from oil companies and trading houses to firms leaving Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties. Iran has threatened to exit the deal if its economic benefits are not preserved, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told a news conference that it remained “hopeful that the Europeans can save the deal”. The SPV was conceived as a clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods, circumventing the U.S. sanctions, which are based on the global use of the dollar for oil trade.  The EU wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but no country has offered to host it, six diplomats told Reuters last week.  “We expect EU to implement the SPV as soon as possible,” Qasemi said. “Iran adheres to its commitments as long as other signatories honor theirs.” Iran’s deputy Oil Minister Amirhossein Zamaninia said “France might host the SPV”, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Monday. The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment. The Finance Ministry has said that all options are on the table for the SPV and that no decisions had been taken. Washington has warned that European banks and firms who engage in the SPV will be at risk from the reimposed U.S. sanctions.

2018-11-19,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is fully complying with sanctions imposed this month by the United States on Iran even though it will mean a further drop in trade with Tehran, a UAE economy ministry official told Reuters on Monday. Abu Dhabi, the political capital of the UAE federation, has taken a hawkish stand on Tehran, although Dubai, the country’s  business hub, has traditionally been a major trading partner with Iran. Washington announced on Nov. 5 a series of sanctions targeting Iran’s banks, shipping sector, national airline and 200 individuals after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.           “We are implementing the sanctions,” Abdullah al-Saleh, undersecretary for foreign trade and industry, said in an interview in Dubai.   The UAE is enforcing the U.S. sanction regime “as it is published by the United States”, al-Saleh said, adding that the relevant authorities would ensure compliance. Al-Saleh said the UAE’s trade with Iran is expected to decline this year and next year due to the sanctions, after falling to $17 billion in 2017 from a peak of $20 billion in 2013. Most trade consists of re-exports via Dubai to Iran, which lies across the Gulf. The sanctions are part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to diminish Iranian influence in the Middle East. The UAE is among U.S. allies in the Gulf region that staunchly oppose Iranian foreign policy and swiftly backed Washington’s decision. It is also a member of a Saudi-led coalition that is opposing the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen’s civil war.  Compliance will mean UAE companies do not face difficulties in the United States, and the UAE government will look to boost trade with other markets such as Africa and Asia to offset the impact of the sanctions on its own economy, al-Saleh said, repeating an existing government policy to diversify trade. Trump’s administration has threatened those who continue to do Iran business with the prospect of losing access to the U.S. market, although it has given temporary exemptions to eight importing countries to keep buying Iranian oil.  The European Union, France, Germany and Britain, which are trying to save the nuclear deal, have said they regret the U.S. decision and will seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran.

2018-11-19,"* Opposition candidate Abubakar releases manifesto * Vows to spend $90 bln annually on infrastructure * Says will privatise state oil refineries (Adds Abubakar quote, details) By Alexis Akwagyiram and Paul Carsten ABUJA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar said on Monday he will boost oil sector investment, cut costly fuel subsidies and double the size of the economy by 2025 if he wins next year’s presidential election. The businessman and former vice president portrayed himself as a champion of the private sector as he released his manifesto and set out his plans to stop incumbent Muhammadu Buhari securing a second term in February. There are few reliable opinion polls in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer. But Abubakar is seen as a substantial challenger to Buhari, a former military leader who has suffered a run of defections, overseen a stumbling economy and struggled to contain militant violence in the northeast. The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate is, like Buhari, a northerner - but analysts say his business background, in port logistics among other ventures, has won him supporters among the southern business elite. “I will be proactive in attracting investment and supporting the 50 million small and medium scale enterprises across Nigeria for the purpose of doubling the size of our GDP to $900 billion by 2025,” Abubakar said in a video message. “These investments will create a minimum of 2.5 million jobs annually and lift at least 50 million people from poverty in the first two years,” he added. In the manifesto, Abubakar said he would privatise government-owned crude refineries, issue new licenses for greenfield investments in refineries and consider re-introducing bidding rounds for marginal fields and oil blocks. The plan, the manifesto said, would make sure Nigeria refined half its current crude output of roughly 2 million barrels per day by 2020. Nigeria remains largely dependent on sales of oil, which make up roughly two-thirds of government revenues. But it refines almost none of its crude, instead exporting what it produces and paying to import refined products - a large drain on the country’s wealth. Abubakar said he would eliminate subsidies on imported fuel and let the market determine the price, a potentially risky strategy in a country where even rumours of price hikes have triggered violence. The candidate also vowed to invest $90 billion in infrastructure annually over the next five years, and set up a $20 billion infrastructure debt fund with private backing to finance projects. He said he would sign the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. Buhari has up to now kept out of the continent-wide pact, saying he wants to carry out wider consultations. Abubakar’s manifesto re-iterated his plan to partially privatise state oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Buhari’s government has tried to keep tight control of exchange rates as the naira weakened in the face of global oil price declines. Abubakar’s manifesto said the exchange rate controls were an issue. But it stopped short of saying whether he would end them. Buhari - who in 2015 became the first opposition candidate to oust a president through the ballot box - has promised to keep up his campaign against corruption.

2018-11-19,"PORT MORESBY (Reuters) - The C in APEC stands for Cooperation. But when the two biggest members are fighting a trade war and using the forum to attack each other’s policies, it was always going to be hard work delivering on that. The weekend’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Port Moresby was one of open disagreement, led by disputes between the United States and China over trade, security and which would be the better investment partner for the region. As APEC approaches its 30th anniversary, the failure to agree on a communique for the first time calls into question its relevance in a crowded summit calendar and as the Trump administration makes clear its aversion to multilateralism.     “It does mark the death of APEC’s founding trade vision,” Euan Graham, executive director of La Trobe Asia at Australia’s La Trobe University, said on Twitter, adding APEC was the “most disposable of the regional summits”.     Rather than cooperation, the theme seemed to be conflict and containment as Beijing and Washington directly criticized each other’s policies and staked their claims as to why they were the security and investment partner the Pacific should choose.         “It’s not even supposed to be binding, it’s APEC,” said one diplomat involved in negotiations for the communique, surprised that the members could not agree on what is usually a humdrum summary of issues discussed.     “China and the U.S. hijacked the APEC spirit, I suppose.” The United States even preferred its own terminology of Indo-Pacific, which it defines as running from “the western shores of Latin America to the furthest reaches of the Indian Ocean”, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence mentioning APEC five times and Indo-Pacific 41 times in his APEC speech on Saturday. Without mentioning China by name, the U.S. State Department sought to cast the blame for the lack of a communique elsewhere, lamenting what it characterized as the unwillingness of some to sign on to a statement agreeing to promote free and fair trade. “It is unfortunate that not all economies - despite their rhetoric - could support these positions,” it said in a statement. Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the United States attended APEC in a “blaze of anger”, causing disputes and disagreements and damaging the “harmonious atmosphere” of the meeting.      “APEC is a platform to deepen cooperation, not a place to criticize each other. China attended to promote cooperation and seek consensus, not to get into a boxing ring,” Geng told reporters.     Founded in 1989 with a view to fostering trade and economic ties around the Pacific Ocean, it operated at a ministerial level until 1993 when U.S. President Bill Clinton established the annual leaders meeting. Each meeting had produced a joint statement at its conclusion, until Sunday. “This is very concerning from a systemic perspective. The WTO faces similar challenges,” said Charles Finny, a Wellington-based trade consultant and a former New Zealand government trade negotiator.     In an editorial, Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the absence of a communique was “not a big deal”, and placed more significance on an upcoming meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.  The two leaders are expected to meet at the G20 summit, which starts in Argentina next week.     “It is hoped Washington makes serious preparations for the summit and not pin its hopes on exerting pressure,” said the tabloid, which is known for its nationalistic stance. Still, there did seem to be some Chinese concern over the communique, with officials rebuffed on Saturday when they tried to meet Papua New Guinea (PNG) Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato on the issue. Pato confirmed to Reuters that Chinese officials had wanted to see him, but said they had not made “necessary arrangements”.     As the APEC host, it was Papua New Guinea’s role to produce a communique. But the hostility and conflicting visions on display meant few blamed the group’s poorest country for being caught between two feuding superpowers.     “In these times, chairing a gathering such as the leaders that we had over the last few days is no easy task,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, adding PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill had shown great integrity and leadership.     Indeed, one big change was that long-forgotten Pacific nations found themselves aggressively courted by the two big-spending superpowers competing for influence in the strategically important ocean.     Pence said the United States would join Australia to help PNG build a navy base on its Manus Island, which was a U.S. base in World War Two, after China had emerged as a possible developer of the deepwater port.     Analysts had said a Chinese presence on Manus could have affected the West’s ability to navigate in the Pacific while offering China a site close to U.S. bases in Guam.          The United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand also unveiled a $1.7 billion plan to bring electricity and the internet to much of PNG, a collective counter-attack to the lure of Beijing’s flagship Belt and Road program.     “Whatever concepts have been raised by the United States or China or Australia doesn’t necessarily mean that these are the same concepts for Papua New Guinea,” Wera Mori, PNG Commerce and Industry Minister, told Reuters by phone.     “We have our own situations and our own priorities to focus on.” Reporting by Tom Westbrook and Charlotte Greenfield; Additional reporting by Philip Wen and Jonathan Barrett, and Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Tim Ahmann in Washington; Writing by John Mair; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/apec-summit/analysis-apec-fails-to-live-up-to-its-name-amid-u-s-china-acrimony-idUKL4N1XU6EB,19 Nov 2018,"The C in APEC stands for

2018-11-19,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A University of Chicago-trained economist named on Monday to head Brazil’s Petrobras will not privatize the state-run company, but wants to push ahead with selling non-core assets and to focus on oil exploration and production.  Brazil’s incoming far-right government announced Roberto Castello Branco as the next chief executive of Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), amid a debate over how far to pursue asset sales at the indebted company, Latin America’s largest by market capitalization. Castello Branco’s appointment is the latest in a string of market-friendly selections by President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, many of them influenced by his adviser and future Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes. The appointments have raised hopes among investors that the former army captain, who takes office on Jan. 1, will deliver significant reforms needed to improve Brazil’s creaking public finances, including a pension overhaul.  Castello Branco, who in the past has spoken in favor of privatizing Petrobras, on Monday said he had not been tasked with selling off the company but signaled his intention to cut costs, do away with some of the company’s downstream operations and focus on its core business. “The privatization of the company is not in question. I do not have a mandate to think about it,” he told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, adding that he expected Brazil’s Supreme Court to approve a path enabling the company to continue selling assets such as majority stakes in two blocks of refineries and in a gas pipeline company.  In an earlier interview, with the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, he said BR Distribuidora (BRDT3.SA), Petrobras’ fuel distribution unit, was not a natural fit for the company and does not generate returns, sending its shares up almost 6 percent as investors bet the government may sell its 70 percent stake in the unit.  Castello Branco also said he would consider all current asset sales, including that of liquid petroleum gas distribution company Liquigas. “Petrobras’ competence is in oil exploration and production,” he told the newspaper.  Guedes has advocated a full privatization of the company while military generals around Bolsonaro oppose such an idea. Underlining that tension, Bolsonaro told reporters on Monday that certain units of Petrobras could be privatized, even though the company is deemed strategic for the nation.        Castello Branco, a one-time post-doctoral fellow at the University of Chicago, will join other school alumni in the ranks of the incoming administration, including Guedes and former Finance Minister Joaquim Levy, who has been tapped to lead Brazil’s powerful state development bank, BNDES. Chicago’s economics department has long been known for orthodox economics, particularly in Latin America, and much of Brazil’s business elite is enthused by the prospect of Chicago-linked appointees in top posts in public administration. “We basically have the University of Chicago economics department taking over the Brazilian economy,” said James Gulbrandsen, chief investment officer for Latin American investments at NCH Capital, welcoming Castello Branco’s appointment. “He’s been public in the past about advocating for less government intervention ... all the way to privatizing parts of Petrobras.”       Castello Branco, a member of Petrobras’s board until 2016,  has also held executive positions at Brazil’s central bank and at iron ore miner Vale SA (VALE3.SA). “We expect Petrobras’ deleveraging process and divestment program to continue under Castello Branco’s tenure,” Vincente Falanga and Oscar Camilo, analysts at Banco Bradesco BBI, wrote in a note to clients.     Petrobras, which is burdened by some $88 billion of gross debt, has played a leading role in developing a bonanza of deep-water oil finds in recent decades.  Castello Branco told Folha that the company would now double-down on that strategy, seeking to maximize potential of the so-called pre-salt deep-water area. “We need to seize this wealth while there is time. In some decades, oil will lose the relevance it has today,” he said. Petrobras is a source of national pride for many Brazilians, but its central role in Brazil’s “Car Wash” investigation, considered by many to be the world’s largest corruption probe, has hurt its public image and bottom line in recent years. Preferred shares of Petrobras rose 0.8 percent after experiencing swings during the day, while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP fell 0.7 percent. Bolsonaro on Monday said that Petrobras’ outgoing boss, Ivan Monteiro, could go to state-run Banco do Brasil, the country’s largest, although no decision has been made. Petrobras said Monteiro would leave his post on Jan. 1.

2018-11-19,"OSLO (Reuters) - Green groups have urged Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund to sell its small stake in German power firm RWE (RWEG.DE), saying the company is a heavy polluter due to its coal-fired plants. Greenpeace said in a report published on Tuesday that it was “disgraceful” that the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund was still invested in RWE. RWE is Germany’s largest power producer and operates a number of coal-fired power plants.  The report, entitled “Last Gasp: The coal companies making Europe sick”, was co-authored by Greenpeace, the Sandbag climate think-tank and other environmentalists. It used a European Commission-approved atmospheric model to estimate how coal power plant emissions impact pollution levels in the air over Europe and found RWE to be the worst offender.  RWE said it was unable to comment specifically on the report as it had not seen it. However, it said that all its coal-fired power stations fully complied with the emission limits established by law and the authorities.  “The legislator’s intention is to keep human health from being jeopardized, with the limits having the greatest protective effect on senior citizens and children. We constantly work on further reducing our specific emissions,” RWE said in an emailed response to Reuters’ request for comment.  “In this context, account should be taken of the fact that the emissions of our power plants – above all nitrous oxides – only account for a very small portion of the emissions in the power stations’ surroundings. Norway’s wealth fund, which is mandated to divest from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal, had a 1.36 percent stake in RWE as of the end of 2017, worth $169 million, according to the fund’s own data.  “This new analysis should be a clear call for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund and other major RWE shareholders to exit the company,” Martin Norman, head of Greenpeace Nordic’s Sustainable Finance Campaign, told Reuters. The wealth fund declined to comment.     Since it was mandated in 2015 to avoid companies heavily reliant on coal, the wealth fund has divested from 71 companies, mostly coal miners but also utilities using coal in their energy mix.  It has kept investments in companies that have a credible plan to reduce their share of revenues from coal and/or increase revenues from renewable energy.  It was not clear whether RWE derives more than 30 percent of its activities from coal. The wealth fund’s CEO, Yngve Slyngstad, said in an interview with Reuters last month that it was generally “very difficult” to get good data from power producers on this. RWE said in its emailed response that it had a set a roadmap to sharply cut carbon dioxide emissions from lignite in 2015. “The roadmap reveals that emissions will be cut by up to 50 percent by as early as 2030. It is regrettable that such facts have apparently not been considered in the report,” RWE said. RWE also said that after its asset swap transaction with German peer E.ON (EONGn.DE) is completed, it would become “Europe’s third-largest renewables player”. It said renewables would account for roughly 60 percent of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and that 60 percent of its power generation portfolio would produce electricity with “low or absolutely no carbon emissions”.

2018-11-19,"(Repeats item published earlier with no changes) * Refiners in talks with Iran to sign new contracts -sources * S. Korea’s Iran oil imports to stay at zero until year-end * Japan buyers may pause in March pending insurance renewal By Osamu Tsukimori and Jane Chung TOKYO/SEOUL, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Refiners in Japan and South Korea are looking to resume Iranian oil imports from January after receiving waivers from U.S. sanctions on Tehran, sources familiar with the matter said. The unexpected resurgence in Iranian oil imports due to the waivers has helped push spot prices for Middle East crude and condensate to their lowest in more than a year. The United States in November granted exemptions to eight countries, allowing them to import some Iranian crude for another 180 days. Japan and South Korea were among the top five buyers of Iranian crude and condensate before they stopped imports in the third quarter ahead of the sanctions. South Korean refiners are set to hold their Iranian oil imports at zero until the end of the year, and they may resume shipments in late January or early February as buyers are in talks with Iran to sign new contracts, industry sources said. “They are seeking to get the best price and are in talks with Iran,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Most tankers are booked until December, so South Korea may load Iran oil shipments in January at the earliest, he said. It takes about 25 days for oil shipments from Iran to arrive at South Korea. Iran also has the option of selling oil from storage in Dalian, China, which would shorten delivery time. Last week, a South Korean delegation was in Iran to negotiate for 2019 supplies of mainly South Pars condensate. “There are some issues to be cleared like payment. We are not able to buy it at the moment and are not rushing,” a second source said. “Iran is also trying not to sell it cheaper. We ... won’t import Iran oil until perhaps after January.” The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Fuji Oil Co, one of Japan’s top Iranian oil buyers, plans to resume Iran crude liftings from January as well, and is also looking to buy condensate. Fuji Oil was considering whether to sign a new contract for Iranian crude, its top executive said last week, adding that oil from Iran is competitively priced against rival grades. Japan’s largest refiner, JXTG Holdings, said earlier this month it may resume Iranian oil loadings from December. But while Japanese buyers are likely to buy Iranian oil through February loadings, they may not take the crude from March onwards, as they wait for the government to extend sovereign ship insurance into the new financial year that starts on April 1, industry sources familiar with the matter said. Started in 2012 to counter sanctions on Iranian oil, Japan’s sovereign insurance scheme covers any shortfalls from Protection & Indemnity (P&I) insurance for ships carrying crude from Iran to Japan. The Japanese government has declined to give information on the volumes of Iranian imports that would be allowed under the 180-day exemption period. Some sources said the sanctions waiver may allow Japan to buy around 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil. That marks a significant reduction for buyers that took about 165,000 bpd of Iranian oil in January-September. Japan joined South Korea in temporarily halting Iranian oil loading around mid-September. Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori in TOKYO, Jane Chung in SEOUL and

2018-11-19,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Underwater surveys began on Monday after an oil spill off Canada’s Atlantic coast as Husky Energy Inc and government agencies assessed a leak that temporarily shut down all crude production in the waters of Newfoundland & Labrador. A leaking flowline from Husky’s White Rose Field to the SeaRose storage vessel was detected on Friday, when Husky was restarting production after suspending operations a day earlier due to stormy weather.  The spill involved 250 cubic meters (1,572 barrels) of oil, Husky spokeswoman Colleen McConnell said on Monday. She said the company is monitoring the area for oil sheens and any impact on wildlife. The leak forced Husky’s White Rose to shut down, along with all other producing oil projects in the area until the regulator, Canada-Newfoundland & Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board, determines it is safe to resume, the board said in a statement on Sunday. Along with White Rose, there are three other producing projects off the shore of Newfoundland - Exxon Mobil Corp’s Hebron and Hibernia fields, and the Suncor Energy Inc-operated Terra Nova. Exxon Mobil said on Monday it had “safely resumed production” at Hebron, while its larger Hibernia field has not yet restarted. It said it shut in production at the two fields prior to the Husky incident. The combined output of Canada’s Atlantic projects is 280,000 barrels per day, a volume that is unlikely to affect oil markets significantly, with global storage levels high and a likely quick return to production, said Mark Oberstoetter, director of upstream Canada for consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Environmental groups said that while government and industry officials have said they can protect oceans from the risks of an offshore spill, the reality is more complicated.     “This is the inevitable nightmare scenario where extreme weather is making it impossible to determine how much oil has been spilled, much less try to clean it up,” said Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada. There were no injuries to oil workers during the storm, one of the worst in decades, the Newfoundland & Labrador regulator said on Sunday. A spokeswoman for the regulator did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.  Shares of Husky Energy closed down 3.21 percent at C$16.87 in Toronto on Monday.

2018-11-19,"(Adds latest natural gas prices) By Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Commodities trading adviser OptionSellers.com suffered losses due to recent volatility in U.S. energy markets, causing accounts to be liquidated, the firm’s clearinghouse, INTL FCStone Inc, said in a statement on Monday. The liquidation of Tampa, Florida-based OptionSellers accounts comes after one of the most volatile weeks in the U.S. natural gas market in years, as commodities funds scrambled to unwind bets after sudden reversals in the oil and gas futures markets. Natural gas posted its biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday, only to follow with its largest one-day loss in 15 years the next day. Natural gas volatility “caused liquidity stress” for commercial and institutional customers of certain futures merchants, INTL FCStone said in a statement. “Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a Commodities Trading Advisor, OptionSellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,” the statement said. OptionSellers.com did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. The extent of investor losses is unknown. Over the past three weeks, natural gas futures jumped about 34 percent. The contract rose 18 percent on Nov. 14 and lost 17 percent on Nov. 15, the biggest one-day percentage gain since 2010 and loss since 2003. Gas prices gained 10 percent on Monday. Funds have been forced to unwind bets swiftly in recent days, as many had placed bets that natural gas would continue its recent weakness while oil rallied. Last week, the reverse happened, with sharp moves in both commodities in the opposing directions. John Chapman of ChapmanAlbin, an investor rights law firm in Cleveland, said his firm has been contacted by at least 100 OptionSellers investors over the past few days. “In this instance they jumped in with both feet and their clients got crushed,” Chapman said, noting he spoke with investors who held $250,000 or more in their accounts. He said some investors who had borrowed through margin accounts could, in effect, be forced to pay for those losses. James Cordier, president of OptionSellers.com, was unavailable for comment. He, his partner and former firm Liberty Trading Group were charged nearly $50,000 for improper trading in a lawsuit before the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2013.

2018-11-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets fell on Monday as worries about softening demand for the iPhone dragged down shares of Apple Inc and persistent trade tensions between China and the United States sapped investor sentiment. Concerns about slowing economic growth also pushed down the dollar. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index dropped 1.7 percent following a decline in shares of Apple and its suppliers. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for iPhone models it launched in September. Renewed tensions between China and the United States also weighed. At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the issue prevented leaders from agreeing on a communique, the first time such an impasse had occurred in the group’s history. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. “That APEC was unable to issue a final statement clearly indicates that China versus the rest of the world isn’t just about the United States,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. “It’s a widening of trade concerns that are already rattling markets.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 395.78 points, or 1.56 percent, to 25,017.44, the S&P 500 lost 45.54 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,690.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 219.40 points, or 3.03 percent, to 7,028.48. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.30 percent. Mixed signals regarding the Federal Reserve’s course of rate hikes in the face of a potential economic slowdown also weighed on markets, investors said. Federal Reserve policymakers have recently raised concern about a potential global slowdown, leading some market watchers to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run. Data released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders showed weakening sentiment in the U.S. housing market, adding to concerns over economic growth. Still, New York Fed President John Williams stated that the U.S. central bank is moving ahead with its plans for gradual rate hikes as it marches toward a more normal policy stance. “There’s a widening gap between the Fed and what the markets think is the right course,” McMillan said. Reflecting economic growth concerns, the dollar dropped to a two-week low on Monday. The dollar index fell 0.3 percent. In similar fashion, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its lowest level in more than a month. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 3.0628 percent, from 3.074 percent late on Friday. Boosted by the drop in the dollar, gold  added 0.2 percent to $1,223.56 an ounce.

2018-11-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude futures rose ahead of settlement in choppy trade on Monday, supported by a reported drawdown of U.S. oil inventories, potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts. Brent crude settled up 3 cents at $66.79 a barrel, strengthening late in the session after earlier hitting a low of $65.27 a barrel. U.S. crude futures traded 30 cents higher at $56.76 a barrel in a session that saw swings in a $2 per barrel range. The market is struggling to find firm footing after a rout that has seen prices fall more than $20 a barrel since early October on global oversupply fears. “The market needs a steady drumbeat of negative pressure to move down further,” said Gene McGillian, director of energy research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “We’ve seen a significant exodus of a lot of the speculative length in the market.” The market pared losses early in the U.S. trading day when energy information provider Genscape reported that crude inventories fell in the latest week, traders said. It then strengthened further into the close.  EU foreign ministers endorsed a French government decision to sanction Iranian nationals accused of a bomb plot in France, diplomats said. That could take additional oil off the market from OPEC member Iran. U.S. sanctions on Iran, which were put in place in November, have taken less oil off the market than anticipated as the U.S. has granted waivers to some of Iran’s oil customers. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pushing allied producers including Russia to join in output cuts of 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day.   Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Russia planned to sign a partnership agreement, and that details would be discussed at OPEC’s Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna. “For a cut to be successful in supporting the market, they’re going to have to present a front that is not fractured and the chance of that is looking less and less likely as Dec. 6 approaches,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. While a large cut would support crude futures, clear signals from producers are needed, Yawger said. “We lack any certainty other than that the market is oversupplied in the U.S. and everybody else is trying to deal with it.”  U.S. crude stockpiles have grown for eight straight weeks,  and data last week showed inventories swelled by the most in more than a year.  Brent is almost 25 percent below early October’s 2018 peak of $86.74 on evidence of slowing global demand while output from the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia hit historic highs.   “Oil prices rose (last week) on hope OPEC and partners will act to reverse bearish sentiment, but from a technical set up, bear mode remains intact,” OANDA strategist Stephen Innes said.  A trade war between the United States and China has made investors warier about the outlook for oil demand growth. (Graphic: U.S. oil drilling points to more output - tmsnrt.rs/2Q97LFW) This month, fund managers cut their bullish exposure to crude futures and options to the lowest since around mid-2017. Weekly exchange data shows money managers hold a combined net long position equivalent to around 364 million barrels of U.S. and Brent crude futures and options, down from over 800 million barrels two months ago.  “The main trend remains bearish as investors no longer believe in a risk of supply tightness for crude,” ActivTrades chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa said.

2018-11-19,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s King Salman urged the international community on Monday to halt Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and reiterated the kingdom’s support for U.N. efforts to end the war in Yemen. The king’s annual remarks to the Shura Council, a top governmental advisory body, were his first public comments since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, which caused a global outcry. King Salman, who did not mention the Khashoggi affair, condemned the actions of Iran, its rival for influence in the region, including in the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  “The Iranian regime has always intervened in the internal affairs of other countries, sponsored terrorism, created chaos and devastation in many countries in the region,” the 82-year-old monarch said. “The international community has to work to put an end to the Iranian nuclear programme and stop its activities that threaten security and stability.” The king said Riyadh supported U.N. efforts to end the conflict in Yemen, where a Saudi-backed coalition has been battling Iran-aligned Houthi rebels for nearly four years to restore the internationally-recognised government. “Our standing by Yemen was not an option but a duty to support the Yemeni people in confronting the aggression of Iranian-backed militias,” he said. The Houthis said on Monday they were halting drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their Yemeni allies, and indicated readiness for a broader ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition “wants peace”. Riyadh has come under growing international criticism for its conduct of the Yemen war, which has brought the country to the brink of famine and killed many civilians in air strikes. The reputation of Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, has been further battered by Khashoggi’s murder. The king had largely stepped back from active political life and handed extensive authority to his son and heir apparent, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but is now trying to defuse the crisis caused by the murder and shore up the crown prince. Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, will participate in the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month as part of a foreign trip, Al Arabiya television quoted the country’s energy minister as saying on Monday. In his speech, King Salman said Riyadh would continue working with OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to maintain stability in global energy markets. He reaffirmed Saudi support for a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, a long-standing position thrown into question last year when the crown prince appeared to back a nascent U.S. peace plan that aligns with Israel on key issues. Later on Monday, the king travelled to the northern Tabuk region, resuming a domestic tour in the latest public outreach apparently intended to show support for his chosen heir. Last week, after offering numerous contradictory explanations for Khashoggi’s disappearance, Riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when “negotiations” to convince him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. The public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five suspects in the case. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the order for the killing of Khashoggi came from the highest level of the Saudi leadership but probably not from King Salman, putting the spotlight instead on the 33-year-old crown prince. U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince as de facto ruler. His administration has imposed economic and travel restrictions on a few individuals for alleged involvement, including a top aide to Prince Mohammed.. On Monday the king signalled that the crown prince remains empowered to pursue ambitious economic reforms, praising a “comprehensive developmental transformation” underway. He directed his son, sitting in the hall, “to focus on ... preparing the new generation for future jobs”. King Salman also praised the Saudi judiciary and prosecution service for “performing the duties they were entrusted with”, without elaborating. In addition to the Khashoggi case, the public prosecutor has participated in an anti-corruption campaign ordered by Prince Mohammed last year in which scores of princes, ministers and businessmen were arrested and the state said it recovered $100 billion in stolen assets.

2018-11-19,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - United Steelworkers union locals representing 30,000 U.S. oil refinery and chemical plant workers ratified terms for contract proposals in negotiations that are to start in January, the union said on Monday.  The proposals, which include an 8 percent pay increase for each year of a three-year agreement, were developed by the USW’s National Oil Bargaining Policy conference in San Diego in late September.  At least 75 percent of the USW locals representing 220 plants were required to ratify the proposals, which will be presented to negotiators from Shell Oil Co., the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS), which will represent refinery and chemical plant owners.  “We look forward to a productive set of talks with the USW and will bargain in good faith to reach a mutually-acceptable agreement,” Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said on Monday.  USW spokeswoman Lynne Hancock said the union also looks forward to the negotiations. “We are hopeful of reaching an agreement that enables both sides to prosper,” Hancock said.  The current contract expires on Feb. 1. It was agreed to after a 2015 strike affecting 7,000 workers at 12 refineries and three chemical plants that lasted nearly six weeks, the industry’s largest work stoppage in 35 years.

2018-11-19,"PARIS (Reuters) - Protesters angered by higher fuel taxes blocked access to three oil depots in France and sporadic unrest erupted in the overseas territory of Reunion, in a third day of demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms. Up to 20,000 protesters clad in fluorescent high-visibility jackets blocked highways across France with burning barricades and convoys of slow-moving trucks, as the government showed no sign of backtracking on a further fuel tax hike on Jan. 1. French oil and gas giant Total said it operated two of the three affected depots on mainland France, one in Vern, near the northwest city of Rennes, and the other in Fos-sur-Mer in the south. A fourth depot was blocked on Reunion, a former French colony that lies between Mauritius and Madagascar. The so-called “yellow vest” movement was born out of a backlash against higher fuel prices, but has tapped a broader frustration at the perceived squeeze in household spending power and mounting public dissatisfaction with Macron. The price of diesel at the pump has increased by about 20 percent in the past year to an average of 1.49 euros ($1.68)/litre, according to website www.carbu.com Some of the increase is due to rising global oil prices earlier in the year.  A protester was killed at the weekend when a panicked driver ran her down at a blockade in the southeastern department of Savoie and more than 400 people were hurt in sometimes violent confrontations between drivers and demonstrators. In Reunion, looters on Monday ransacked a shopping mall in the south of the island and many businesses remained shuttered after mobs torched 70 cars at a dealership and trashed a fast-food outlet. Roadblocks paralysed traffic on some of Reunion’s main highways. In 18 months in power, Macron has stared down trade unions and street protests as he loosened labour laws and overhauled the heavily indebted state rail operator SNCF, unflinching in his resolve to inject new energy into the French economy.  However, derided by political opponents and left-leaning voters as a “president of the rich”, the former investment banker’s popularity has dwindled to new lows.  A survey for pollster IFOP published on Monday showed a four-point fall in the past month in his approval rating, with just one in four people satisfied with his performance. In a sign the “yellow vest” protests might impact the economy if they persist, shopping malls saw revenues fall by an estimated 35 percent on Saturday, according to consultancy group Nielsen. Organisers have vowed to continue their protests until the government drops the taxes.

2018-11-19,"* Prospects of Sino-U.S. trade thaw dim over weekend * Dollar subdued as Fed talks about global risks * European stocks struggle with car woes * Wall Street hit by Apple slide, trade woes (Updates to U.S. market open, changes byline, changes dateline to NEW YORK) By April Joyner NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - World stocks fell on Monday as worries about softening demand for the iPhone dragged down shares of Apple Inc and persistent trade tensions between China and the United States sapped investor sentiment. Concerns about slowing economic growth also pushed down the dollar. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index opened lower as shares of Apple and its suppliers fell. The Wall Street Journal reported Apple had cut production orders in recent weeks for the iPhone models it launched in September. Renewed tensions between China and the United States also weighed. At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the issue prevented leaders from agreeing on a communique, the first time such an impasse had occurred in the group’s history. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. “There’s a back and forth with China seemingly on a daily basis,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. “That seems to drive trading.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 335.06 points, or 1.32 percent, to 25,078.16, the S&P 500 lost 36.12 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,700.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 164.83 points, or 2.27 percent, to 7,083.04. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.74 percent. The Federal Reserve’s course of rate hikes in the face of a potential economic slowdown has also weighed on markets, Schutte said. Federal Reserve policymakers are still signalling rate increases ahead but have recently raised concern about a potential global slowdown, leading some market watchers to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run. On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that it expected the pace of U.S. economic growth to slow towards the global average next year. Data released on Monday by the National Association of Home Builders showed weakening sentiment in the U.S. housing market, adding to concerns over economic growth. Reflecting growth concerns and the possibility that the Fed’s tightening cycle may soon end, the dollar dropped to a two-week low on Monday. The dollar index fell 0.25 percent. In similar fashion, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has fallen from a recent top of 3.25 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.0701 percent, from 3.074 percent late on Friday. In Europe, Renault SA shares helped push the STOXX 0.7 lower as Carlos Ghosn, the joint chairman of Renault and Nissan Motor Co, was arrested for alleged financial misconduct. In commodity markets, gold found support from the drop in the dollar and added 0.1 percent to $1,222.76 an ounce. Oil prices gave up earlier gains as investors mulled the effectiveness of a potential cut in supply from OPEC and other exporters. Brent crude was down 70 cents a barrel at $66.06.

2018-11-19,"BRATISLAVA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Slovakia will phase out subsidies for coal mines supplying one of the country’s most polluting power plants from 2023, sooner than expected, Economy Minister Peter Ziga said on Monday. The Slovak government subsidises mining at the country’s only coal company, privately owned Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza (HBP), paying around 100 million euros ($114 million) a year, which helps maintain thousands of jobs. The company produced 1.8 million tonnes of brown coal last year, supplying the Novaky power plant in central Slovakia. The facility is operated by Slovenske Elektrarne, a utility co-owned by the state, Italy’s Enel and Czech energy group EPH. Slovenske Elektrarne said this year that extending the life of the 266-megawatt Novaky plant beyond 2023 would require significant investment. The Environment Ministry says the plant is the second-biggest carbon emitter in the country. Closing the mines has long been contentious as they employ around 4,000 people directly and 11,000 indirectly. Slovakia’s car industry is booming, though, potentially giving retrained workers the chance to secure another job. “We will soon unveil an action plan and announce the year 2023 as the end of subsidies for the coal mines,” Ziga told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in Bratislava. “It does not mean they would have to close immediately.

2018-11-19,"(Corrects paragraph 3 to say the fire incinerated Paradise shortly after it broke out on Nov. 8, not in the week after) By Terray Sylvester Nov 19 (Reuters) - Emergency services on Sunday sifted through the charred wreckage of California’s deadliest ever wildfire, searching for signs of nearly 1,000 people believed still missing as crews made progress in bringing the blaze under control. The remains of 77 people have been recovered, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office said late on Sunday, as it cut the number of missing to 993 from 1,276. It gave no other details. The Camp Fire broke out in Northern California on Nov. 8 and quickly all but obliterated Paradise, a mountain town of nearly 27,000 people around 90 miles (145 km) north of state capital Sacramento. Officials said it had consumed about 150,000 acres and was 65 percent contained late on Sunday, up from 60 percent earlier in the day, as prospects of a heavy rainstorm from late Tuesday onwards raised hopes that that percentage will rise as the week progresses. They said full containment was not expected until Nov. 30, however. Up to four inches (10 cm) of rain are forecast to fall north of San Francisco between late Tuesday and Friday, said Patrick Burke, a forecaster at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland. “This weather system is locked in,” he said. The rain would also make it harder for forensic teams sifting through ash and dirt looking for the bones of the dead. “The rain will easily disturb the soil where remains might be found,” Burke said. Pathologists from the University of Nevada, Reno, worked through the weekend as firefighters peeled back debris, collecting bits of burned bones and photographing everything that might help identify the victims. The storm, which is expected to carry moderate winds of 15-20 mph could also cause problems for evacuees, hundreds of whom are sheltering in tens and cars. It isn’t clear how many people are in need of shelter but as many as 52,000 people had been ordered to evacuate “While it isn’t an exceptionally strong storm, the recent burns make mud slides on hills and slopes a real danger,” Burke said. South of Sacramento near Malibu, at least two inches of rain are expected to fall on a second fire, the Woolsey. Known to have killed three people, it was 88 percent contained on Sunday and full containment was expected on Thanksgiving Thursday. The cause of both fires is under investigation, but electric utilities reported localized equipment problems around the time they broke out. PG&E Corp has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire.

2018-11-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Refineries around the world are squeezing out every last drop of diesel while drowning in gasoline, in what could well become the new normal for the next few years. The imbalance is a confluence of major shifts in oil markets - surging production of light U.S. shale oil, plummeting exports of heavier Venezuelan and Iranian crude, weakening gasoline demand and rising diesel consumption. The coming in 2020 of the biggest change in fuel regulations in decades, when the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will start requiring ships to use cleaner fuel, is likely to prolong this reality, oil executives and analysts say. Refineries that distil crude oil into fuel have always had to adapt their output to shifting demand patterns such as high consumption of gasoline in summer and increased demand for heating oil in winter. But the market for refined products appears out of kilter in a way rarely seen before, and the IMO changes are likely to prolong the imbalance. “We are witnessing a microcosm of the post-IMO environment,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. The new IMO regulations will reduce the allowed content of sulphur in shipping fuel, known as bunker fuel, from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent, increasing demand for diesel at the expense of dirtier fuel oil. Ahead of the change, refineries invested in equipment to remove more sulphur from crude oil and increase production of diesel. At the same time, a slew of new refineries has come or will come on stream in coming years. Several long-term changes are further impacting oil refining. First, gasoline demand is gradually decelerating due to higher engine efficiency, slowing economic growth in China and a gradual expansion of the electric vehicle fleet. The International Energy Agency has estimated that gasoline demand will grow by “a puny” 80,000 barrels per day in 2018, the slowest expansion since 2011. [IEA/M] Diesel demand, on the other hand, has been persistently strong due to higher industrial activity in the United States, while global stocks have tightened as a result of lower exports from China and refinery outages. For a graphic on Diesel vs gasoline (png), see - tmsnrt.rs/2PHAhiM The imbalance has been deepened by the shifting supply of crude oil to lighter, sweet grades that yield less diesel and more gasoline.  Production of light shale oil in the United States surged over the past year, while supply of heavy crudes dropped in Venezuela and Iran, which was hit by newly instated U.S. sanctions this month. So while historically refineries tweak their crude intake and production yields to adapt to seasonal consumption, this time the acute demand for diesel and lighter crude intake means refiners are opting to maximise output. In terms of overall refining profits, strong diesel cracks are able to offset slumping gasoline margins. Refineries have also found support from fuel oil, a “bottom of the barrel” product usually sold at a loss. The abundance of light, sweet crude has pushed up demand for fuel oil, which is blended with lighter crude to increase diesel output.   “We are seeing very healthy demand for diesel and fuel oil and the only weak spot really is gasoline,” Dario Scaffardi, chief executive of Italian refiner Saras (SRS.MI), told Reuters. “The IMO will be very constructive for us, and the question is how constructive. I would agree that this scenario of strong diesel and weak gasoline seems the most reasonable going forward.” Unlike previous years that saw an extreme imbalance between gasoline and diesel, which account for around 70 percent of global refinery output, today’s reality is likely to persist. Refineries will attempt to shift output as much as they can away from gasoline into diesel, said Russell Hardy, chief executive of Vitol, the world’s largest oil trader which owns several refineries in Europe. “As more refineries come on and as more light sweet materials come on ... It is going to tend to weigh heavily on that part of the barrel, which in turn essentially puts all of the onus on distillates to make the refinery margin in 2020,” Hardy told the Reuters Commodities Summit in October.  Consultancy JBC Energy expects the abundance of light crude supply in the United States to hinder the ability of refiners to cut gasoline output, while also forecasting that demand in 2019 is unlikely to rebound strongly. The refineries with the highest diesel production and lowest fuel oil output are generally likely to benefit the most from the IMO changes. Less complex, older plants that have a greater output of gasoline or fuel oil are likely to fall behind. According to Morgan Stanley, in Europe, Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC), Turkey’s Tupras and Saras are best placed for the IMO changes. In the United States, the largest independent refiner Valero (VLO.N) and in Asia, India’s reliance, which operates the world’s largest refinery in Jamnagar, are in pole position.

2018-11-19,"(Adds details, quotes, context) ISTANBUL, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Construction of the offshore part of the TurkStream pipeline that will carry Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey has been completed, Russian gas producer Gazprom said on Monday. TurkStream is part of Moscow’s efforts to bypass Ukraine as a gas transit route to Europe, which imports around a third of its gas needs from Gazprom. “Projects of this kind and this project in particular are not directed against the interests of anyone. Projects of this kind are purely creative,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said as he and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attended an official ceremony in Istanbul. Work will now focus onshore and is on track to be completed by the end of 2019, he said. Gazprom is building the TurkStream in two lines, each with a capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres of gas per year. The first will supply Turkey and the second southern Europe. Turkey is almost completely reliant on imports to meet its energy needs. A crippling currency crisis which has seen the lira plummet has increased costs, prompting energy companies to hike consumer prices. Turkey’s state pipeline operator Botas will build the 69-km section of TurkStream which will carry natural gas from the coast to its distribution centre in Luleburgaz in northwestern Turkey, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez told private broadcaster NTV, adding he expected this to be completed in 2019. A 145-km section of pipeline from the distribution centre to the border will be constructed by Botas and Gazprom, he said.

2018-11-19,"(Reuters) - Iran will continue to export oil despite U.S. sanctions, which are part of a psychological war doomed to failure, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Monday. By reimposing sanctions on OPEC’s third biggest crude producer, Washington wants to force Tehran to drop its ballistic missile programs, further curb its nuclear work and limit its support for proxy militias from Syria to Lebanon and Yemen. “We will not yield to this pressure, which is part of the psychological war launched against Iran,” Rouhani said in a speech in the city of Khoy, broadcast live on state television. “They have failed to stop our oil exports. We will keep exporting it ... Your regional policies have failed and you blame Iran for that failure from Afghanistan to Yemen and Syria,” he added, to chants of “Death to America!”. Rouhani said Washington lacked the necessary international support for its sanctions, and noted that it had granted temporary waivers to eight major buyers of Iranian oil. “America is isolated now. Iran is supported by many countries. Except for the Zionist regime (Israel) and some countries in the region, no other country backs America’s pressure on Iran,” he said. The European Union, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, participants with the United States in the 2015 deal that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, have been trying to find ways to circumvent the U.S. limitations.  In particular, the EU has been trying to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for non-dollar trade with Iran. But this has not stopped foreign businesses ranging from oil companies and trading houses to firms leaving Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties. Iran has threatened to exit the deal if its economic benefits are not preserved, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told a news conference that it remained “hopeful that the Europeans can save the deal”. The SPV was conceived as a clearing house that could be used to help match Iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of EU goods, circumventing the U.S. sanctions, which are based on the global use of the dollar for oil trade.  The EU wanted to have the SPV set up by this month, but no country has offered to host it, six diplomats told Reuters last week.  “We expect EU to implement the SPV as soon as possible,” Qasemi said. “Iran adheres to its commitments as long as other signatories honor theirs.” Iran’s deputy Oil Minister Amirhossein Zamaninia said “France might host the SPV”, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Monday. The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment. The Finance Ministry has said that all options are on the table for the SPV and that no decisions had been taken. Washington has warned that European banks and firms who engage in the SPV will be at risk from the reimposed U.S. sanctions.

2018-11-19,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is fully complying with sanctions imposed this month by the United States on Iran even though it will mean a further drop in trade with Tehran, a UAE economy ministry official told Reuters on Monday. Abu Dhabi, the political capital of the UAE federation, has taken a hawkish stand on Tehran, although Dubai, the country’s  business hub, has traditionally been a major trading partner with Iran. Washington announced on Nov. 5 a series of sanctions targeting Iran’s banks, shipping sector, national airline and 200 individuals after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran.           “We are implementing the sanctions,” Abdullah al-Saleh, undersecretary for foreign trade and industry, said in an interview in Dubai.   The UAE is enforcing the U.S. sanction regime “as it is published by the United States”, al-Saleh said, adding that the relevant authorities would ensure compliance. Al-Saleh said the UAE’s trade with Iran is expected to decline this year and next year due to the sanctions, after falling to $17 billion in 2017 from a peak of $20 billion in 2013. Most trade consists of re-exports via Dubai to Iran, which lies across the Gulf. The sanctions are part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to diminish Iranian influence in the Middle East. The UAE is among U.S. allies in the Gulf region that staunchly oppose Iranian foreign policy and swiftly backed Washington’s decision. It is also a member of a Saudi-led coalition that is opposing the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen’s civil war.  Compliance will mean UAE companies do not face difficulties in the United States, and the UAE government will look to boost trade with other markets such as Africa and Asia to offset the impact of the sanctions on its own economy, al-Saleh said, repeating an existing government policy to diversify trade. Trump’s administration has threatened those who continue to do Iran business with the prospect of losing access to the U.S. market, although it has given temporary exemptions to eight importing countries to keep buying Iranian oil.  The European Union, France, Germany and Britain, which are trying to save the nuclear deal, have said they regret the U.S. decision and will seek to protect European companies doing legitimate business with Tehran.

2018-11-19,"* Opposition candidate Abubakar releases manifesto * Vows to spend $90 bln annually on infrastructure * Says will privatise state oil refineries (Adds Abubakar quote, details) By Alexis Akwagyiram and Paul Carsten ABUJA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar said on Monday he will boost oil sector investment, cut costly fuel subsidies and double the size of the economy by 2025 if he wins next year’s presidential election. The businessman and former vice president portrayed himself as a champion of the private sector as he released his manifesto and set out his plans to stop incumbent Muhammadu Buhari securing a second term in February. There are few reliable opinion polls in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer. But Abubakar is seen as a substantial challenger to Buhari, a former military leader who has suffered a run of defections, overseen a stumbling economy and struggled to contain militant violence in the northeast. The opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate is, like Buhari, a northerner - but analysts say his business background, in port logistics among other ventures, has won him supporters among the southern business elite. “I will be proactive in attracting investment and supporting the 50 million small and medium scale enterprises across Nigeria for the purpose of doubling the size of our GDP to $900 billion by 2025,” Abubakar said in a video message. “These investments will create a minimum of 2.5 million jobs annually and lift at least 50 million people from poverty in the first two years,” he added. In the manifesto, Abubakar said he would privatise government-owned crude refineries, issue new licenses for greenfield investments in refineries and consider re-introducing bidding rounds for marginal fields and oil blocks. The plan, the manifesto said, would make sure Nigeria refined half its current crude output of roughly 2 million barrels per day by 2020. Nigeria remains largely dependent on sales of oil, which make up roughly two-thirds of government revenues. But it refines almost none of its crude, instead exporting what it produces and paying to import refined products - a large drain on the country’s wealth. Abubakar said he would eliminate subsidies on imported fuel and let the market determine the price, a potentially risky strategy in a country where even rumours of price hikes have triggered violence. The candidate also vowed to invest $90 billion in infrastructure annually over the next five years, and set up a $20 billion infrastructure debt fund with private backing to finance projects. He said he would sign the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. Buhari has up to now kept out of the continent-wide pact, saying he wants to carry out wider consultations. Abubakar’s manifesto re-iterated his plan to partially privatise state oil firm Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Buhari’s government has tried to keep tight control of exchange rates as the naira weakened in the face of global oil price declines.

2018-11-19,"(Adds quotes, background) BRATISLAVA, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Oil supply cuts by key producers could have negative implications for markets, the head of the International Energy Agency said on Monday, appealing to market players to use “common sense”. IEA chief Fatih Birol, speaking at a news conference with central European energy ministers in Bratislava, said markets were currently well supplied but spare capacity in Saudi Arabia was thin and cuts by key players could tighten markets. “Currently markets are very well supplied but we should not forget that spare capacity in Saudi Arabia is very thin, therefore cutting the production significantly today by key oil producers may have some negative implications for the markets and further tightening the markets,” he said. “My appeal to all producers and consumers across the world is to have common sense in these difficult days.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is pushing for the group and its partners to reduce output by 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day to prevent a build-up of unused fuel. Oil rose for a fourth session in a row on Monday, buoyed by the prospect that Saudi Arabia will push OPEC and maybe Russia to cut supply towards the end of this year. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that Russia, which is not an OPEC member, planned to sign a partnership agreement with the group, and that details would be discussed at OPEC’s Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna.

Asia had taken a while to warm up but finished strongly and Europe was heading for its first rise in four sessions as mining, tech and bank share gains helped offset a nasty prang to the car sector. It was a bit touch-and-go though. Renault’s shares crashed more than 10 percent as it and Nissan’s joint chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Japan for financial misconduct. The sector’s gloom was further compounded by a 10 percent slump in VW’s global October numbers, and with Wall Street futures dithering either side of flat in New York overall sentiment was starting to backslide again. “I’m not sure one man warrants such a big drop in the share price,” CMC markets senior strategist Michael Hewson said referring to Nissan and Renault’s woes. “But maybe people think it could prompt the French government — which has a stake in Renault — to launch an enquiry into the running of the company.” Over in the currency markets, the pound saw some respite from last week’s Brexit trauma as the dollar and euro both went limp, as focus switched back to the U.S.-China trade feud. Wall Street had firmed on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he might not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions. The comment stoked speculation of a deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina this month. However, Chinese-U.S. tensions were clearly on display at an APEC meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, where leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. “The comments from Trump were seen as offering a glimmer of hope that further tariff action could be held in abeyance,” said NAB’s head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill. “The exchange of barbs between Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping in PNG on the weekend continues to suggest this is unlikely.” Also uncertain was the outlook for U.S. interest rates. Federal Reserve policymakers are still signalling rate increases ahead but also sounded more concerned about a potential global slowdown, leading markets to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run. Investment bank Goldman Sachs chimed in, saying on Monday that it expected the pace of U.S. economic growth to slow towards the global average next year and that the dollar would see a broad based drop as a result. On top of that, it revised its long-standing bearish view on the Japanese yen and tipped Latin American currencies, the Swedish krona, the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars and Israeli shekel for rises next year too. “We see several changes to the global economic backdrop which, combined with a few negative medium-run factors, point to more downside than upside to the broad dollar in 2019,” Goldman analysts said in a macroeconomic outlook report. That will focus attention on an appearance by New York Fed President John Williams later on Monday to see if he echoes the same theme. Investors have already lengthened the odds on further hikes, with a December move now priced at 73 percent, down from over 90 percent. Futures imply rates around 2.74 percent for the end of next year, compared to 2.93 percent early this month. Yields on U.S. 10-year paper have duly declined to 3.08 percent, from a recent top of 3.25 percent. The dollar followed, to hover at 96.356 against a basket of currencies, down from a peak of 97.693. The euro was parked at $1.1424, while the dollar backed off to 112.72 yen. Sterling edged higher to $1.2854 after political turmoil over Brexit caused steep losses last week. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday that toppling her would risk delaying Brexit as she faces the possibility of a leadership challenge from within her own party. With both pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers unhappy with the draft agreement, it is not clear that she will be able to win the backing of parliament, increasing the risk that Britain will leave the EU without a deal. Westminster “seems to be playing a high-stakes game of risk, where the outcome could be an accidental no-deal,” the head of Britain’s main business lobby, the CBI, said. “Surely, surely, we can do better than this.” In commodity markets, gold found support from the drop in the dollar and held at $1,220. Oil prices suffered their sixth straight week of losses last week, but have found some support from expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut output. Brent crude was up 54 cents at $67.30 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained 70 cents to $57.16.

2018-11-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have exited from all the bullish positions in crude oil and fuels they accumulated in the second half of 2017 as the bull market has unwound. Upside price potential from Iran sanctions and prospective production cuts by OPEC is matched by downside risks from rapidly rising U.S. shale production and a deteriorating economic outlook. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by a further 74 million barrels in the week to Nov. 13. Portfolio managers have sold the equivalent of 553 million barrels of crude and fuels in the last seven weeks, the largest reduction over a comparable period since at least 2013. Funds now hold a net long position of just 547 million barrels, less than half the recent peak of 1.1 billion at the end of September, and down from a record 1.484 billion in January. Net length has been reduced to the lowest level since July 2017 essentially unwinding the petroleum bull market of 2017/18. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QPSxmw) Bullishness towards oil prices has evaporated and hedge funds now have the fewest outright long positions in crude and fuels since January 2016, when oil prices were hitting the bottom of the last slump. By contrast, short positions have climbed to 261 million barrels, the highest for a year, and up from a recent low of just 96 million barrels at the end of September. In the last five weeks, funds have sold 47 million barrels of U.S. gasoline, 31 million barrels of U.S. heating oil and 29 million barrels of European gasoil. But the heaviest selling has been in crude, where fund managers have sold 282 million barrels of Brent in the last seven weeks and 221 million barrels of WTI in the last 10 weeks. Fund managers still have a residual net long position of 380 million barrels in Brent and WTI, according to an analysis of exchange and regulatory data. But most of the remaining positions appear to be long-term, passive and structural in nature rather than expressing an active view on prices. The money manager category of positions reported by exchanges and regulators includes passive index funds and pension funds as well as more actively managed hedge funds. Pension funds and index funds play little role in the short-term price formation process in contrast to the much more active strategies pursued by hedge fund managers. Because of the way the data is published, there is no way to identify how many of these positions were active positions held by hedge funds and how many were more passive long-term positions held by a range of players. But it may be possible to make a rough division between active/dynamic positions and more structural/permanent positions by a careful inspection of the data. There appears to be a structural net long position in crude oil futures and options of around 385 million barrels in the crude oil market (“Hedge funds’ active positioning in crude oil”, Reuters, July 2017). Fund managers have never held long positions amounting to less than 450 million barrels in Brent and WTI since 2013, or short positions amounting to less than 65 million barrels. By subtracting structural positions from current positions, it is possible to estimate the remaining active positions held by hedge fund managers. Following the recent wave of liquidation, fund managers have reduced their actual net long position down almost exactly in line with this long-term structural position. Hedge funds’ active positions in crude are close to zero for the first time since July 2017 and before that August 2016. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QWcBDG) Fund managers now have an essentially neutral position on the outlook for oil prices for the first time in more than a year. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-11-19,"MOSCOW, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Russian nickel and palladium producer Norilsk Nickel (Nornickel) plans to ramp up output over the next five years to tap an expected boom in demand from electric vehicle makers, its CEO and top shareholder Vladimir Potanin told Reuters. The company, which vies with Brazil’s Vale to be the world’s largest nickel producer, has been profitable for years thanks to its resource-rich Arctic operations, but output has been relatively stable due to a decline in metal content in ore and as it focused on revamping production facilities. Now, with nickel set to benefit from its use in batteries for electric vehicles, Potanin thinks the time is right to step up production, he said in an interview. The firm could lift nickel and copper output by 15 percent, and production of platinum group metals (PGMs) by 25 percent, by 2025 from 2017 levels if it launches two new projects. Nickel output alone could rise to 240,000 tonnes by 2025 from 210,000 tonnes in 2017. This 30,000 tonnes equates to about a third of Nornickel’s estimate of the world’s nickel deficit for 2019. The two projects being considered by Nornickel, which currently accounts for 23 percent of global high-grade nickel output and is the world’s top palladium producer with the share of 40 percent, are the third stage of its Talnakh concentrator upgrade and South Cluster, which may start PGM production. These projects would require the company to raise capital expenditure (capex) by $1.3-1.5 billion to $10.5-11.5 billion in 2019-2022, Potanin said, adding he hoped Russia would support some of Nornickel’s projects as part of the list of strategic projects which metals and mining companies are discussing with the government. Nornickel’s current capex plan includes $6.5-7.5 billion for its base investment programme and $2.5 billion for its environmental programme. These programmes remain a priority, and are expected to add $1 billion to core earnings in 2019-2020 as well as boosting output of nickel and PGMs by up to 5 percent. If Nornickel goes ahead with the two new projects, Potanin said he would like to make sure the company’s dividend payments are evenly distributed in the years of high investment, while remaining the same in total over the next 4-5 years. The environmental programme will peak in 2020-2021. He said there were no immediate plans to discuss dividends with aluminium giant Rusal, which holds 28 percent in Nornickel. Potanin owns a 34 percent stake. Potanin also said he planned to introduce the maximum amount of digital technology into Nornickel, which could help it get a bigger slice of the market to supply electric vehicles (EV). The company recently agreed to join forces with Germany’s BASF in the European EV battery market, and could do more such partnerships in other markets, Potanin said, adding there were no concrete negotiations underway. Nornickel is also betting on palladium, used in emissions-reducing auto catalysts for gasoline cars, amid stricter emissions limits. Prices for palladium hit a record high in London on Friday. Nornickel and Russian Platinum, a company backed by Russian businessman Musa Bazhaev, are considering a joint project called Arctic Palladium, which could become one of the world’s largest producers of PGMs. The cost - subject to a feasibility study which is not ready yet - could potentially reach $6 billion, and so it could require other partners, Potanin said. A decision is expected in the second half of 2019.

2018-11-19,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Authorities on Sunday sifted through the charred wreckage of California’s deadliest ever wildfire, searching for any signs of the 993 people now listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise. The number of believed missing fell 283 late on Sunday, down from 1,276 people, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement, but gave no other details. The remains of 77 people have been recovered, officials said late on Sunday. The blaze ignited on Nov. 8 was 65 percent contained, up from 60 percent earlier in the day. Rain is forecast for the area this week, potentially helping douse the flames, but raising the risk of floods and mudslides that will swell the misery of 46,000 people under evacuation orders. Many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and relatives, while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles. The death toll far surpasses the previous fatality record from a single California wildfire - 29 in the Griffith Park fire of 1933 in Los Angeles - and already ranks among the deadliest U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Eighty-seven people perished in the Big Burn firestorm that swept the Northern Rockies in August 1910. Minnesota’s Cloquet Fire in October 1918 killed 450 people. In Paradise, the flames moved so fast that some victims died in their cars in a chaotic evacuation as gridlock formed on the two exit routes out of town. The Butte County Sheriff’s Office said the list of the missing is compiled using information received from a special hotline, as well as emails and emergency-911 calls that came in during the first chaotic hours of the blaze. Authorities said some of those listed likely survived but have not yet notified family or officials, either because they lack phone service or were unaware anyone was looking for them. In Paradise, home to nearly 27,000 people before the Camp Fire struck, two forensic anthropologists for the University of Nevada, Reno, were helping firefighters on Saturday sort through the wreckage at a mobile home park for senior citizens. Firefighters peeled back the metal sheet of a collapsed roof as the anthropologists picked up charred bone fragments, sorting them into paper bags. Roger Fielding, chief deputy coroner with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, said each site was treated as a crime scene, with every step of recovery documented with photographs. “Our job is to pick up any items that might reflect who this person might be,” he said. Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents. At last count, the Camp Fire had destroyed more than 13,600 homes and other structures, authorities said late on Sunday. Up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain is expected to fall from late Tuesday through Friday in the Sierra foothills, said Patrick Burke, a forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “It’ll bring much needed relief to the firefighters and to the air quality, but there’s a potential for dangerous mudslides wherever vegetation is burned away on slopes and hills,” Burke said. Up to 2 inches of rain is also expected to fall on southern California this week, where the Woolsey Fire claimed at least three lives.  That blaze was 88 percent contained on Sunday, authorities said, with full containment expected on Thanksgiving Thursday. The precise causes of the both fires were under investigation, but electric utilities have reported equipment problems in the vicinity of both blazes around the time they erupted.  PG&E Corp (PCG.N) has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire. On Friday, the company reported to regulators a second power-line outage that it experienced in Butte County on the morning of Nov. 8 when the Camp Fire started. During a visit to both fire zones on Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the recent spate of wildfires on forest mismanagement, and he said he discussed the issue with California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom. Scientists say the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the U.S. West are largely attributable to prolonged drought symptomatic of climate change.

2018-11-19,"* OPEC expected to cut supply to prevent glut * US oil drilling points to more output: tmsnrt.rs/2Q97LFW By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday as traders expected top exporter Saudi Arabia to push producer club OPEC to cut supply towards the end of the year. Despite that, market sentiment remains weak on signs of a demand slowdown amid deep trade disputes between the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China. Front-month Brent crude oil futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $67.29 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 53 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were up 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $57.07 per barrel. “The market’s bullish radar is still waiting for OPEC+ to deliver a sizeable cut number,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, is pushing for the producer cartel and its allies to cut 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply to adjust for a slowdown in demand growth and prevent oversupply. Despite Monday’s gains, crude prices remain almost a quarter below their recent peaks in early October, weighed down by surging supply and a slowdown in demand growth. On the demand-side, Japan’s October crude oil imports - which are the world’s fourth biggest, but which are in structural decline because of a falling population and improving energy efficiency - fell by 7.7 percent from the same month last year, to 2.77 million barrels per day (bpd), the Ministry of Finance said on Monday. This comes as supply in the United States is surging. U.S. energy firms added two oil rigs in the week to Nov. 16, bringing the total count to 888, the highest level since March 2015, a weekly report by energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. The rising drilling activity points to a further increase in U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has already jumped by almost a quarter this year, to a record 11.7 million bpd. Put off by a surge in supply and the slowdown in demand, financial markets have been becoming increasingly wary of the oil sector, with money managers cutting their bullish wagers on crude futures and options to the lowest level since June 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options positions on U.S. and Brent crude during the week ended Nov. 13 to the lowest since June 27, 2017.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tacked on 0.1 percent and South Korea 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.4 percent, but E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent. Wall Street had firmed on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he may not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions. The comment stoked speculation of a deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina later this month. However, Sino-U.S. tensions were clearly on display at an APEC meeting in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, where leaders failed to agree on a communique for the first time ever. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said in a blunt speech that there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. “The comments from Trump were seen as offering a glimmer of hope that further tariff action could be held in abeyance,” said NAB’s head of FX strategy, Ray Attrill. “The exchange of barbs between Pence and Chinese President Xi Jinping in PNG on the weekend continues to suggest this is unlikely.” Also uncertain was the outlook for U.S. interest rates. Federal Reserve policymakers are still signalling rate increases ahead but also sounded more concerned about a potential global slowdown, leading markets to suspect the tightening cycle may not have much further to run. “Fed officials are having an easier time showing a slightly less hawkish leaning by noting the emerging global slowdown,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist Alan Ruskin. “It’s undercutting expectations of rate hikes moving above ‘neutral’,” which the Fed has nominated as between 2.5 and 3 percent. “This shift in tone is subtle, but fits with the more bullish bond market tone of late, and is starting to have a material impact on the dollar.” That will focus attention on an appearance by New York Fed President John Williams later on Monday to see if he echoes the same theme. Investors have already lengthened the odds on further hikes, with a December move now priced at 75 percent, down from over 90 percent. Futures imply rates around 2.75 percent for the end of next year, compared to 2.93 percent early this month. Yields on U.S. 10-year paper have duly declined to 3.06 percent, from a recent top of 3.25 percent. The dollar followed to reach 96.438 against a basket of currencies, down from a peak of 97.693. The euro was up at $1.1414, while the dollar backed off to 112.77 yen . Sterling remained vulnerable at $1.2833 after political turmoil over Brexit caused steep losses last week. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday toppling her would risk delaying Brexit as she faces the possibility of a leadership challenge from within her own party. With both pro-EU and pro-Brexit lawmakers unhappy with the draft agreement, it is not clear she will be able to win the backing of parliament, raising the risk Britain leaves the EU without a deal. In commodity markets, gold found support from the drop in the dollar and held firm at $1,1222.67. Oil prices suffered their sixth straight week of losses last week, but have found some aid from expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut output.
