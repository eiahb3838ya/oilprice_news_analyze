2018-08-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A proliferation of extreme weather events around the world provides ample evidence that climate change is a reality, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday, but she rejected calls for more ambitious climate protection goals. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns that climate change is gathering pace, leading dozens of countries to call for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. But Merkel said such calls, most recently from the European Commission’s climate chief Miguel Arias Canete, for swifter cuts to harmful carbon dioxide emissions would be counterproductive, adding that setting new goals made little sense when European countries were already struggling to meet their cuts targets. “I’m not particularly happy about these new proposals,” she said of Canete’s call to increase from 40 to 45 percent the scale of cuts to target by 2030. “I think we should first stick to the goals we have already set ourselves. I don’t think permanently setting ourselves new goals makes any sense.” Merkel’s government has already faced criticism for abandoning emissions targets it had set itself for 2020 after concluding they were unachievable, while sticking to a target it had set itself for a decade later. This summer’s sweltering temperatures across Europe have reignited the climate debate, with record temperatures across the continent causing sea ice to melt in the Arctic, and triggering forest fires across the continent. “One summer doesn’t on its own express it, but the piling up of extreme weather conditions and the rising temperatures shows climate change isn’t just in Africa and the Arctic and Antarctic, but here too,” Merkel said.

2018-08-26,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane, greatly diminished from the major hurricane it once was, drifted away from the Hawaiian coast on Saturday, but lingering showers threatened to trigger more flooding and landslides. The National Weather Service (NWS) lifted all remaining tropical storm warnings and watch advisories for Hawaii as trade winds finally began to nudge Lane off to the west. But a flash flood watch remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, through Sunday morning, emergency management officials said.  Civil defence officials on the Big Island said more rain and flooding were also possible there, and a high-surf advisory was posted through the day for south- and east-facing shores of all the islands.  Lane’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 50 miles (80 km) per hour, but residual moisture would produce excessive rainfall that could lead to “additional flash flooding and landslides,” a weather service bulletin said. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas one year ago Saturday, then stalled over the Gulf Coast as it drenched the region in rain for several days, causing devastating floods.  Ahead of Lane, Hawaii residents had spent days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows. The island chain was spared the calamity of a direct hit from a major hurricane as the storm steadily weakened on Friday. However, by then torrential showers had drenched the windward side of Hawaii’s Big Island for more than two days, unleashing severe flooding and mudslides that forced multiple road closures and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and other structures, authorities said. At least two neighbourhoods around Hilo, the largest city on the Big Island, were evacuated on Friday, and emergency teams have rescued more than 50 people trapped by high water since Thursday, Hawaii County Civil Defence spokeswoman Kelly Wooten told Reuters by phone. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Rains finally abated on the Big Island on Saturday, she said.  Hilo received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, would diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. By Saturday morning the water had receded enough that many residents of Hilo were mopping up several inches of mud. Jillane Bosscher, a 45-year-old chef, and her family spent Thursday night and Friday in a local shelter. By Saturday the water had receded enough that they were able to return home and start cleaning. In another sign of improving conditions, most harbours around the state were reopened or placed on “hurricane preparedness” status allowing shippers to resume operations with caution, a according to the state Transportation Department. On the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, evacuees have returned home from emergency shelters, and those facilities were being closed, local officials reported.

2018-08-26,"(Reuters) - Iran’s parliament sacked the minister of economic affairs and finance on Sunday, state media said, amid a sharp fall in the rial currency and a deterioration in the economic situation. The Iranian economy is dogged by high unemployment and the rial has lost half its value since April. The United States reimposed some sanctions in early August and a second set targeting Iran’s oil industry is due to take effect in November. The head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said Iran faced  “unique” challenges and the foreign minister accused the United States of waging “psychological war” on his country. The Iranian parliament backed the removal from office of Masoud Karbasian, minister of finance and economic affairs, by 137 votes to 121 against, state media said. The sacking was the latest in a continuing shakeup of top economic personnel. In early August Iranian lawmakers voted out the minister of labour and last month President Hassan Rouhani replaced the head of the central bank. The U.S. sanctions, reimposed after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, have exacerbated an already difficult economic situation in Iran. “(America’s) focus is on a psychological war against Iran and its business partners,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Sunday, according to the Tasnim news agency. “From the time that Trump announced the withdrawal from the nuclear deal, America has not been able to reach its goals,” Zarif added, according to the Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA). Other parties to the 2015 accord - China, Russia, Germany, Britain and France - are trying to salvage the deal, which lifted some economic sanctions against Iran in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme. But their companies now face the risk of U.S. penalties if they do business with Iran.  Washington also wants Tehran to end its support for militant groups in Syria and Iraq. Protests linked to the tough economic situation in Iran began last December, spreading to more than 80 cities and towns and resulting in 25 deaths. Sporadic protests, led by truck drivers, farmers and merchants in Tehran’s bazaar, have continued regularly since then and have occasionally resulted in violent confrontations with security forces. The head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, Major General Ali Jafari said on Sunday Iran was facing a “unique, complicated and sensitive” situation, with both external and internal threats to its security, Tasnim reported. The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal has undermined Rouhani, a relative pragmatist, and emboldened his hardline opponents who always opposed any compromises with Washington. Zarif appeared to offer guarded criticism of Rouhani’s opponents. “There are some in the country who, instead of laying the groundwork for using the opportunities presented by the nuclear deal, chose a political fight,” Zarif said, according to ISNA. “And this political fight led to despair and disappointment.” Reporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear/update-2-iranian-parliament-removes-finance-minister-from-office-idUKL8N1VH02C,26 Aug 2018,"* Foreign minister complains of US ""psychological warfare""

2018-08-26,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) PDVSA.UL said on Saturday it filed an appeal requesting that a Delaware court vacate a decision on Aug. 23 granting Canadian miner Crystallex the right to seize its U.S. assets. In a statement on Twitter, PDVSA said it had filed a petition on Friday to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to direct the Delaware District Court to acknowledge it had been “divested of jurisdiction with respect to PDVSA and its property.” U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Delaware on Thursday had granted a so-called writ of attachment to Crystallex for shares of PDVSA’s U.S. subsidiary PDV Holdings, owner of U.S. oil refiner Citgo. Crystallex has been seeking payment on a $1.4 billion award to compensate it for the 2008 nationalization of its gold mining operations by the now cash-strapped Venezuelan government. The amount is comprised of about $1.2 billion plus $200 million of interest awarded by a World Bank arbitration tribunal in 2016. The judge ruled on Aug. 9 that the Citgo Holding assets were subject to attachment.  Reuters could not immediately reach Crystallex for comment.
