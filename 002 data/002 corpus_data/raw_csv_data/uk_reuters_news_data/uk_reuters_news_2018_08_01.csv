2018-08-01,"Aug 1 (Reuters) - A business executive who controlled multiple energy companies that supplied equipment to Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has been arrested in the latest case to spill out of a broad U.S. bribery investigation. Jose Manuel Gonzalez Testino, 48, was arrested on Tuesday at Miami International Airport on charges he conspired to make corrupt payments to a PDVSA official in exchange for favorable business treatment, the U.S. Justice Department said. He was arrested based on a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Houston and appeared on Wednesday before a federal magistrate judge in Miami, according to court records. A lawyer for Gonzalez, a dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizen, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PDVSA also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gonzalez is the 17th person to face U.S. charges as part of a larger investigation by the Justice Department into bribery at Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) that became public with the arrest of two Venezuelan businessmen in December 2015. According to the prosecutors, Gonzalez paid at least $629,000 in bribes to a former PDVSA official from 2012 to 2013 in exchange for the official helping Gonzalez’s companies secure contracts and gain priority over other vendors to receive payments. The official was not identified by name in court papers but was described as a Venezuelan who served as general manager at PDVSA’s procurement unit, Bariven, and who had already pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money. In total, 12 people have pleaded guilty to date in connection with the investigation, according to the Justice Department.

2018-08-01,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico City’s first woman mayor plans to significantly improve air quality in the smoggy capital, one of the world’s largest cities, by consulting with car manufacturers on a plan for stricter emissions standards, she said in an interview. Environmental scientist Claudia Sheinbaum, 56, who won the election with a large margin and takes office in December, said a top priority was to reduce particulate contamination by 40 percent in her six year term. The city of some 21 million people, known for its deathly smog in the 1980s, made strides towards cleaner air at the turn of the century with measures that restricted the use of older vehicles and moved major industry out of town.  While its air remains far better than smoke-choked Asian capitals such as Delhi, India, in 2016 the city government issued for the first time in 14 years an air quality contingency warning, a measure taken when pollution reaches levels that seriously threaten health.    The number of vehicles in Mexico almost doubled between 2006 and 2016, and autos are now the leading source of nitrogen oxide pollution in the metropolitan area.  Sheinbaum said part of the problem was that Mexico had fallen behind in emissions standards for new vehicles, as well as needing to find ways to bring down costs for hybrid and electric vehicles that are currently out of reach of most consumers.  “What we are proposing, and we want to do this even before we enter government, is to have a meeting ... with the major automakers,” Sheinbaum, 56, told Reuters in an interview, saying she would approach embassies of major automaking powers first. “From there we want to generate a new standard for new vehicles, that allows new vehicles to be less and less polluting,” she said.  Sheinbaum aims to pass her proposal through the national Congress before it becomes law, a task made easier because her Morena party won a majority there in the July 1 election.      However, attempts to make automobile regulation stricter in Mexico have run into opposition in the past.  Toyota and Mexico’s auto industry sued the Mexican government in 2012 to try to block proposed regulations to align the fuel efficiency standard of cars and light trucks with that of the United States to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Business chambers representing Mexico’s auto industry and car dealers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Sheinbaum, who worked for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 and investigated emissions at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said she wanted to work in collaboration with the car companies to make the high-altitude city what she called a global “center of innovation for public and private transport.” “We want to have a workshop with them to explain what our needs are as a city, to see their response and to see what they can do.”   Sheinbaum’s other plans to clean up the city include new investment in the metro system, cleaner buses, and a cable car system to transport people from hillside shanty towns, similar to one in operation in Medellin, Colombia.  “We want to bring them a modern form of transport,” she said.

2018-08-01,"(Adds details of mine dispute, production) By Ernest Scheyder Aug 1 (Reuters) - Gold and silver miner Tahoe Resources Inc posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday that narrowly fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, the result of a Guatemala mine dispute that shows now signs of abating. Nevada-based Tahoe posted a second-quarter loss of $15.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared to a profit of $33.5 million, or 11 cents per share, in the year-ago period. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 4 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tahoe’s flagship Escobal silver mine in Guatemala has been effectively mothballed since last year as part of a long-simmering dispute with the country’s leadership. Guatemala’s top court provisionally suspended Tahoe’s license to operate after an anti-mining organization appealed to the court alleging that the country’s Ministry of Energy and Mines had not consulted with the Xinca indigenous people before awarding the license to Tahoe’s Guatemalan unit, Minera San Rafael. The dispute drained Tahoe’s quarterly earnings by $15.6 million, and the company also spent $8.1 million on maintenance costs. “While we are disappointed that the Constitutional Court decision is still pending, we remain focused on those issues within our control,” Tahoe Chief Executive Jim Voorhees, who took the company’s top spot in June, said in a statement. Tahoe produced no silver during the second quarter as a result of the fracas. Its gold production slipped 8 percent to 103,000 ounces. The company also operates in Peru and Canada. Tahoe plans to hold a conference call to discuss the quarterly results on Thursday morning.

2018-08-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes Iran is preparing to carry out a major exercise in the Gulf in the coming days, apparently moving up the timing of annual drills amid heightened tensions with Washington, U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Senior Iranian officials have  warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed U.S. campaign to strangle Iran’s vital oil exports. The U.S. military’s Central Command confirmed that it has seen an increase in Iranian activity, including in the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway for oil shipments that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block. “We are aware of the increase in Iranian naval operations within the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman,” said Navy Captain Bill Urban, the chief spokesman at Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East. “We are monitoring it closely, and will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways,” Urban added. Urban did not provide further information or comment on questions about the expected Iranian drills.  But U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards has appeared to prepare more than 100 vessels for exercises. Hundreds of ground forces could also be involved. They said the drills could begin within the next 48 hours, although the precise timing was unclear. Details of the Iranian preparations were first reported by CNN. U.S. officials said the timing of the drills appeared designed to send a message to Washington, which is intensifying its economic and diplomatic pressure on Tehran but so far stopping short of using the U.S. military to more aggressively counter Iran and its proxies. Trump’s policies are already putting significant pressure on the Iranian economy, although U.S. intelligence suggests they may ultimately rally Iranians against the United States and strengthen Iran’s hardline rulers, officials say. Iran’s currency plumbed new depths this week as Iranians brace for Aug. 7 when Washington is due to reimpose a first lot of economic sanctions following Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.  A number of protests have broken out in Iran since the beginning of the year over high prices, water shortage, power cuts and alleged corruption. On Tuesday, hundreds of people rallied in cities including Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz and Ahvaz in protest against high inflation caused in part by the weak rial.

2018-08-01,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will soften the impact of a planned carbon tax on major emitters of greenhouse gases after businesses complained it would make them less competitive with the United States, officials said on Wednesday. The move underlines the challenges facing Canada as it tries to deal with Washington under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has slashed domestic corporate taxes and imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. The Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - which took power in 2015 vowing to tackle climate change - had initially proposed a levy on 30 percent of industries’ emissions in any of Canada’s 10 provinces that did not introduce their own carbon pricing systems. Firms complained this would make them less competitive, given the United States has no such carbon tax. The levy has now been cut to 20 percent for most sectors and 10 percent for vulnerable industries such as iron, steel and cement. The initial charge of C$20 a tonne will start in January 2020 and rise to C$50 by 2022. “This really ensures our industries remain competitive but also that we are able to meet our emissions reductions targets,” said Caroline Theriault, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister Catherine McKenna. The decision is significant because the new right-wing government in Ontario - the heartland of Canadian industry - intends to scrap an existing carbon pricing system. This will have the inadvertent effect of forcing heavy emitters in Ontario to pay the new carbon tax. Dennis Darby, president of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters lobby group, said the government’s plan to trim the carbon levy was prudent. “With the U.S. tax changes last year, the playing field has been very much tilted in favor of the United States when it comes to attracting manufacturing and capital,” he said in an interview. Theriault, speaking by phone, said Ottawa would continue to consult industry before issuing a full set of draft proposals later this year. The official opposition Conservative Party, level with the Liberals in opinion polls ahead of a 2019 election, vowed to scrap the carbon tax if it won power. Official data shows Canada currently has no chance of meeting its 2030 emissions reductions targets. Keith Stewart of Greenpeace decried what he called “a step back” and said Canada could not claim to be a leader on fighting climate change if it were not prepared to take significant steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2018-08-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide on Wednesday on persistent fears of an escalation of the trade war between the United States and China although robust results from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) helped cap losses and the Federal Reserve left U.S. interest rates untouched. Apple, which jumped nearly 6 percent to a record high of $201.76 after predicting a surge in current-quarter sales, pulled the NASDAQ into positive territory and lifted the other two major U.S. stock indexes. The Mac and iPhone-maker saw its best day since February 2017. Still, market participants said Wednesday’s reversal after a recent selloff of tech shares might not be sustainable as investors turn their attention back to trade disputes.  “There is a big additional tariff that is being weighed and could be put into place at any moment, which is a concern,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.  The U.S. administration plans to propose tariffs of 25 percent instead of 10 percent on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods. China called the move “blackmail” and warned it would respond in kind.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 81.37 points, or 0.32 percent, to 25,333.82, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 2.93 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,813.36 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 35.50 points, or 0.46 percent, to 7,707.29. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.16 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.48 percent. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept benchmark U.S. interest rates unchanged after a two-day meeting but in a statement characterized the economy as strong, keeping the central bank on track to increase borrowing costs in September.  While equities sold off ahead of the Fed’s statement, Wall Street barely reacted after it was released. “There were no major surprises,” said Mark Grant, managing director and chief global strategist at investment bank B. Riley FBR Inc. “The Fed upgraded their view on the economy from ‘solid’ to ‘strong’ which is a slight positive, but nothing more than that. There was very little reaction to the statements in any of the markets.” The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR was also little moved by the Fed statement, but it broke above 3 percent for the first time since June 13 after the U.S. government said it would boost borrowing in the coming quarter to fund spending and debt obligations. The government needs to fund a rising budget deficit even as the Fed continues to reduce its massive bond portfolio. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.18 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.27 percent to $1.1659.     The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 111.60 per dollar JPY= after Tuesday's pledge by the Bank of Japan to keep rates extremely low for an extended period. Traders appeared to be putting the BOJ’s tolerance for higher yields to the test on Wednesday as the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to 0.12 percent JP10YTN=JBTC in its biggest one-day rise in two years. Oil prices fell on data showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles while investors worried that trade tensions could hit energy demand. The price slump follows their largest monthly decline in two years in July.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell $1.82 to settle at $72.39 a barrel, a 2.5 percent loss.

2018-08-01,"NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Plastic used in everyday objects from bottles to packaging emit greenhouse gases when exposed to sunlight, according to a study released on Wednesday, as global concern about its impact on the world’s oceans grows. Plastic pollution has come under increased scrutiny from environmentalists as the scale of the problem has become clear - this year it emerged that a giant island made up of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean was far larger than thought. Now scientists have discovered that commonly used plastics also generate the potent greenhouse gas methane as well as ethylene as they age, adding to the global tally of planet-warming emissions. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, said plastics were “likely to be an insignificant component of the global (methane) budget” due to the low quantities produced in this way. Nonetheless Jonathan Nichols, an associate professor of earth sciences at Columbia University in New York, said the finding was “definitely important”. “You can’t solve the greenhouse gas problem until you’ve defined every part of it,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. Methane emissions, mainly caused by burning fossil fuels, are a major driver of global warming, putting them in the crosshairs of the global fight against climate change. Jennifer Provencher, a plastic pollution researcher at Acadia University, in Canada, said the results pointed to “another piece of evidence suggesting that losing plastic to the environment is not good”. More than nine billion tons of plastic has been produced since 1950 with most of it discarded in landfills or the environment, previous research has found. Scientists have repeatedly linked exposure to some plastic chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA), to health risks. The so-called garbage patch of plastic floating in the Pacific holds as much as 16 times more debris than was previously thought, posing a significant threat to the food chain, scientists found in March.

Conflicting signs over the state of U.S.-China trade relations pulled markets in opposite directions. A Bloomberg report on Tuesday said that the United States and China were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs. However, later reports that the U.S. administration plans to propose tariffs of 25 percent instead of the initially proposed 10 percent on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods injected uncertainty back into financial markets. A source familiar with the plan said the announcement could come as early as Wednesday. Chinese shares, the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar all weakened. A source familiar with the Trump administration’s tariff plans for China told Reuters that an announcement could come as early as Wednesday. “We maintain our view that negotiated settlement will be the most likely outcome. However, getting to this stage will still lead to marked volatility in the markets as this process will be protracted, with both sides digging their heels to present a better deal to respective constituents,” Everbright Sun Hung Kai analysts said in a note. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1 percent, erasing earlier gains, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 0.8 percent. S&P E-mini futures were down less than 0.1 percent at 2,815.75 after earlier edging higher. Spreadbetters in Europe pointed to more mixed trade in Europe, with London’s FTSE set to open 12 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX 1 point higher and Paris’ CAC down 8 points. The Taiwan weighted index rose 0.4 percent, with tech shares getting a boost after Apple Inc. beat Wall Street expectations for its quarterly results thanks to robust sales of its top-of-the-line iPhone X. The company’s shares rose 3.4 percent to $196.80 in after-hours trade. But shares in mainland China dropped, erasing early gains, with trade war fears and a private survey of purchasing managers pointing to a cloudy economic outlook. The survey showed China’s manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in eight months in July, dragged down by declining export orders. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.8 percent, while the blue-chip CSI300 index lost 1 percent. Australia’s manufacturing sector also showed slower activity in July, with the Commonwealth Bank/Markit purchasing managers index at its lowest level in nearly two years. Australian shares were flat, with some support coming from miners ahead of expected strong results from Rio Tinto later on Wednesday. Policy meetings at the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday also kept some investors on the sidelines. Although the U.S. central bank is expected to hold rates unchanged, investors will be looking for any change in the tone of its policy statement. “Buying sentiment towards the dollar could receive a boost if the central bank strikes a hawkish tone,” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, wrote in a note. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9766 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.964 percent on Tuesday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.6776 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.669 percent. The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 111.96 , and gained 0.5 percent to 6.8390 against China’s offshore yuan on news of the Trump administration’s tariff plans. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7406. The euro was down 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1676. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, gained 0.2 percent to 94.663.

2018-08-01,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Talks next week between Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are not a prelude to a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Wednesday. Nishimura also told Reuters in an interview that Japan did not intend to set numerical targets on either exports or imports. The Aug. 9 talks in Washington come as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration explores raising tariffs on foreign auto imports, including those from Japan, a step that officials say would do serious damage to the two economies and world trade. The United States is a major market for Japan’s automakers, which produced 3.8 million vehicles at their U.S. plants in 2017, roughly one-third of the 12 million total units produced in the country each year. An additional 1.7 million vehicles were exported from Japan last year. Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to reduce America’s trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary of FTA talks because they would increase pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture. “Japan does not desire an FTA and these talks are not at all preliminary discussions on an FTA,” Nishimura said. Nishimura reiterated that Japan would keep trying to persuade Washington to return to a multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership pact abandoned by Trump soon after he took office last year. However, he acknowledged that Washington’s preference was for bilateral deals. “We will be looking for the best path for both the United States and Japan,” Nishimura said. He repeated that Japan was expected to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defence. Japanese firms want to invest in the robust U.S. market and Japan wants to support that, he said. However, Nishimura ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps. “Whether it’s exports or imports, we will not set numerical targets,” Nishimura said. “The fundamental thing is to maintain free and fair trade.” Nishimura declined to say what steps Japan would take if Washington raised its tariffs on auto imports. “Raising tariffs on autos would have a big impact on the world economy and would be a big minus for the American economy, so we want to talk firmly so that does no happen,” he said.

2018-08-01,"* MSCI Asia ex-Japan flat, Nikkei +0.7 pct * China shares lower on weak data, trade worries * Washington could announce plans for tariffs as early as Weds By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Most Asian shares crept higher on Wednesday following a firm Wall Street finish, but gains were curbed by weak data in the region and intensifying fears over volatile Sino-U.S. trade relations. Global markets had inched higher on Tuesday, helped by a Bloomberg report that the United States and China were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs. However, later reports that the U.S. plans tariffs of 25 percent on $200 billion in Chinese imports injected some uncertainty back into financial markets, with the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar lower, and China shares down. A source told Reuters that an announcement on Washington’s tariff plans for China could come as early as Wednesday. The seemingly contradictory signals on U.S.-China trade are puzzling for investors, said Ryan Felsman, senior economist at CommSec in Sydney. “It’s a little bit confusing, but really I think markets are ... focused more broadly on the earnings season that’s going on in the U.S., and also Australia is about to begin its corporate earnings season,” he said. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index gained 0.7 percent. S&P E-mini futures were down less than 0.1 percent at 2,815.25 after earlier edging higher. The Taiwan weighted index rose 0.3 percent, with tech shares getting a boost after Apple Inc. beat Wall Street expectations for its quarterly results thanks to robust sales of its top-of-the-line iPhone X. The company’s shares rose 3.4 percent to $196.80 in after-hours trade. But shares in mainland China dropped, erasing early gains, with trade war fears and newly released manufacturing data pointing to a cloudy economic outlook. China’s manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in eight months in July, dragged down by declining export orders, a private survey showed on Wednesday. The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.3 percent, while the blue-chip CSI300 index lost 0.4 percent. Data from Australia also showed a slowdown in manufacturing activity in July, with the Commonwealth Bank/Markit purchasing managers index at its lowest level in nearly two years. Australian shares were flat, with some support coming from miners ahead of expected strong results from Rio Tinto later on Wednesday. Policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday will also keep some investors on the sidelines, although the U.S. central bank is  expected to keep rates unchanged. While U.S. rates are widely expected to be held, “investors are more likely to be concerned with any potential tweaks in the language of the policy statement. Buying sentiment towards the dollar could receive a boost if the central bank strikes a hawkish tone,” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, wrote in a note. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was at 2.9728 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.964 percent on Tuesday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, touched 2.6735 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.669 percent. The dollar was flat against the yen at 111.85, but rose 0.31 percent against the offshore yuan on news of the Trump administration’s new tariff plans. The Australian dollar fell 0.15 percent to $0.7417. The euro was down 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1682. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, gained 0.1 percent to 94.606. Meanwhile, oil prices fell on industry data showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles. The slump in crude prices comes after their largest monthly decline in two years in July. U.S. crude dipped 0.6 percent to $68.37 a barrel, while Brent gave up 0.4 percent to $73.92 per barrel. Spot gold fell 0.16 percent to $1,221.40 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith

2018-08-01,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s second-largest supermarket, Coles, on Wednesday  halted plans to charge shoppers for plastic bags, succumbing to customer fury about a shift away from single-use plastics.     Coles, owned by Wesfarmers, and its larger rival Woolworths Group Ltd removed one-use plastic bags from stores late in June as part of a national push to reduce waste, selling reusable ones for a small fee instead. It drew a furious response, dubbed “bag rage,” as customers angry about having to bring their own sacks or pay 15 Australian cents (11 U.S. cents) for a reusable plastic bag abused checkout staff and vented on social media. The union representing store workers launched a public  campaign on the issue and both grocers capitulated, temporarily waiving the fee. Coles, which had initially planned to reintroduce the fee on July  12, never levied it and has now extended the waiver indefinitely. “Some customers told us they needed more time to make the transition to reusable bags,” the company said in a statement. “Many customers bringing bags from home are still finding themselves short a bag or two so we are offering complimentary reusable (bags) to help them complete their shopping,” it said. The waiver was “still intended to be an interim measure,” Coles said, but gave no date for the resumption of the fee, saying only it will “assess when customers have become accustomed to bringing their own bags.” Woolworths has levied 15c per bag since July 8. The backflip comes while Coles is under immense pressure to lure customers, as its sales growth lags Woolworths just as Wesfarmers prepares to spin it out and list it separately. “It’s all a part of lifting their customer satisfaction and getting more customers in the door,” said James Tao, a market analyst at stockbroker Commonwealth Securities in Sydney. The cost of the move would probably have a negligible financial impact, he added. “It’s more about the PR side.” However that also appeared to backfire as Coles was lampooned online. “Coles’ colossal plastic bag fail” and “Coles caves” ran headlines on Australia’s main news sites. Major retailers in all but two Australian states face fines if they supply single-use plastic bags. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have so far taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption.

The state-owned company, China’s biggest oil and gas producer, said on its website that its share of January-June output at overseas projects in which it has investments came in at over 47 million tonnes of oil equivalent, or around 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. {nL3N1KI1HE] The period saw CNPC’s listed unit PetroChina , whose domestic oil output is declining, ship in its first equity crude from the sub-salt Ribera project in Brazil, and lift the first barrels from two 40-year offshore concessions in Abu Dhabi. CNPC said its overseas business had focused on low-cost development in 2018, which has so far seen benchmark Brent crude prices rise around 10.5 percent. Various overseas projects are taking full advantage of the oil price recovery by increasing workloads and improving efficiency, the company said. It added that construction work on key projects was progressing in an orderly manner. This includes the second phase of the Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia, from which CNPC recently took delivery of its first LNG cargo in China, and the third phase of the Halfaya oil field in Iraq.

2018-08-01,"TOKYO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after industry data showed U.S. stockpiles of crude unexpectedly rose, starting the new month in negative territory after the largest monthly decline in two years in July. October Brent crude futures dropped 29 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $73.92 a barrel by 0044 GMT, adding to a 1.8 percent loss in the previous session. U.S. crude futures were down 44 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $68.32 a barrel, having dropped nearly 2 percent on Tuesday. Brent fell more than 6 percent in July, while U.S. crude futures slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly decline for both benchmarks since July 2016. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed domestic crude inventories rose by 5.6 million barrels last week. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 2.8 million barrels. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later on Wednesday. Signs that a supply disruption in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea could be resolved also weighed on prices. Yemen’s Houthi group said it was ready to unilaterally halt attacks in the Red Sea to support peace efforts. Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through the strait last week after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers. A Reuters poll showed that oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the United States meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions. OPEC has pledged to offset the loss of supply from Iran, the group’s third-biggest producer. Looming U.S. sanctions have already started to cut Iranian exports, with buyers from its biggest customers in Asia cutting imports to a seven-month low in June.

Production has begun at an initial rate of about 2,000 barrels of oil per day (gross), Oil Search said. The restart of operations at Agogo has brought all Oil Search-operated facilities back online, the company added. Oil Search said the impact of the facility’s closure is included in its 2018 production guidance, which it maintained at towards the upper end of 23–26 million barrels of oil equivalent. Lower output at a key liquefied natural gas project (LNG) in Papua New Guinea, the PNG LNG project, led to an 18 percent fall in Oil Search’s first-half revenue after it was also damaged in the quake.

2018-08-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) on Tuesday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit as expenses rose and a misplaced bet on the direction of oil prices offset higher oil output. Devon’s stock fell as much as 4.6 percent to $43 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Its shares had been up 9 percent this year at 4 p.m. EDT, compared with a 13 percent increase in U.S. crude futures.   The Oklahoma City-based company said costs rose 39 percent to $2.73 billion in the three months ended June 30, as marketing expenses increased. It said revenue realized from producing oil and gas fell 20 percent from a year earlier to $1.07 billion. At the same time, expenses on that production rose 26 percent, the company said.  Oil prices were higher in the quarter than the company had hedged its production, costing $131 million to settle the derivatives, a spokesman said.    Ben Montalbano, co-founder of energy researcher PetroNerds, which tracks hedging by oil and gas firms, said Devon hedged about 57 percent of its second-quarter oil production at prices about $5.80 a barrel below average prices. Oil producers typically use hedges to lock in a price for their oil, guaranteeing a fixed amount for their output. But some independent oil producers this year hedged production at about $55 per barrel, giving up much of the quarter’s increase in oil prices, Montalbano said.    Devon produced 541,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day (boep/d) in the second quarter of 2018, compared with 536,000 boep/d a year ago. The results were largely higher than its expected 524,000-to-549,000 boep/d range. But its realized revenue from oil and gas output fell 20 percent to $1.07 billion because of the derivatives, the company reported.  Devon also took a $154 million asset impairment charge during the quarter on land in Oklahoma it no longer expects to develop, the spokesman said.    The company also cut its yearly oil production target to account for discontinued operations following the more than $3 billion sale of its interest in oil pipeline company EnLink Midstream. Net loss attributable to Devon was $425 million, or 83 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $219 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 34 cents per share, below analysts’ average estimate of 36 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $2.25 billion from $2.17 billion.

2018-08-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Middle distillates, including road diesel and marine gasoil, are the critical link between global growth and the oil market. Distillates will be at the heart of three developments in the next two years that determine the direction of oil prices as well as the longevity of the current economic expansion: It seems unlikely the global economy will still be growing strongly while oil prices remain at comfortable levels for consumers at the same time as the shipping regulations go into effect at the start of 2020. Cyclical tightening of distillate markets plus new fuel regulations are inconsistent with moderate crude oil prices. Something will have to give. Either global economic growth will slow of its own accord, easing the pressure on distillate supplies, or crude oil prices will rise enough to force an economic slowdown. Mid-distillates accounted for 35 million barrels per day of global oil consumption in 2017, around one-third of the total, according to BP (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, 2018). Freight transportation, including cargo moved by road, rail, pipelines, barges, shipping and aviation, is the biggest end-user of fuels derived from the middle part of the crude barrel. Substantial quantities are also used by manufacturing firms, as well as miners and within the oil and gas industry itself, with much smaller volumes used for heating and cooking. Distillate consumption is more closely geared to the level of business activity and the macroeconomic cycle than any other section of the oil market. Distillate stocks are in turn closely correlated with changes in benchmark crude prices and the shape of the futures curve. Since mid-distillates are one of the most important refinery outputs, the link is not surprising. As the distillate market alternates between over- and under-supply, Brent cycles between contango and backwardation. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2M8FqdG) Periods when distillate stocks were abnormally high (1998/99, 2001/02, 2006, 2009/10 and 2015/16), all linked to slower growth in economic activity, have been associated with a large contango in Brent. Likewise, periods when distillate stocks became unusually tight (1999/2000, 2003/04, 2007/08 and 2012-2014), mostly linked with stronger economic growth, have all been associated with Brent backwardations. Stock draws in distillates have been much more closely associated with the shift in Brent spreads than changes in gasoline stocks. The same pattern has been evident during the most recent oil market slump and recovery, with distillate stocks surging in 2015 and 2016, before drawing equally strongly in 2017 and so far in 2018. Strong growth in distillate consumption in 2017 and early 2018 coincided with a period of strong and synchronised growth in the major global economies and a marked acceleration in freight movements. Distillate consumption is outstripping production in the United States, and in much of the rest of the world, resulting in a broad reduction in inventories. U.S. distillate stocks, which were 36 million barrels above the five-year average in early 2017, have now fallen to 18 million barrels below in July 2018. U.S. distillate consumption rose 5 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2018 but production was up by only 1 percent (“U.S. distillate inventories are low for this time of year”, EIA, July 27). The same phenomenon is evident globally. OECD distillate stocks have fallen from 618 million barrels in May 2016 and 605 million in May 2017 to just 521 million in May 2018 (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, July 2018). The drawdown in distillate stocks has corresponded closely with the shift in Brent calendar spreads from contango to backwardation and the rise in Brent spot prices. Distillate markets are tightly coupled with the global economy - and the relationship likely runs in both directions. Changes in the level of manufacturing activity and freight movements have a direct impact on the consumption and availability of transport fuels. But changes in fuel prices also have a significant impact on input costs for a wide range of businesses as well as inflation. The outlook for distillate prices (and by extension oil prices) therefore depends critically on what happens to the global economy over the next 18 months. If the global economic expansion continues at its current rapid pace, distillate availability will become stretched, and oil prices will rise strongly. The scheduled implementation of new International Maritime Organization fuel regulations at the start of 2020 will only exacerbate this tightness and could intensify upward pressure on oil prices even before they go into effect. Eventually, the rise in fuel costs will act as a drag on global economic growth, and bring the cyclical expansion to an end. Conversely, if the global expansion slackens on its own, perhaps as a result of trade tensions, distillate supplies will be more comfortable. Plentiful distillates would curb or even reverse the upward trend in oil prices, and extend the current cyclical upswing for an additional period. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-08-01,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin signalled on Wednesday that it was prepared to use its new power to veto foreign takeovers of German companies in the case of a Chinese bid for toolmaker Leifeld.   Earlier on Wednesday Leifeld’s majority owner Georg Koffler told Reuters that China’s Yantai Taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the German government. The German government tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of high-profile takeovers by Chinese firms fuelled concern over the security implications of China’s growing appetite for European high-tech firms. “The cabinet today decided to grant authorisation for a veto,” a government source said. “This authorisation allows for vetoing the purchase of a domestic company by a foreign company for security reasons.” Leifeld, a maker of metalworking tools that are crucial in the nuclear power sector, is typical of the technically advanced “Mittelstand” manufacturing firms that underpin Germany’s success as a global export powerhouse. Koffler criticised Berlin’s willingness to intervene, saying the security concerns about letting China’s Yantai buy into Germany’s nuclear industry were overblown. “We believe these security policy concerns are unjustified,” he said. He said the company would pursue a partial flotation of its shares this year as an alternative to the sale originally planned. Across Europe, authorities are looking warily at bids by Chinese firms for the kinds of advanced manufacturers that underpin the continent’s relative prosperity compared to lower-value emerging-market economies. Last month, a German state bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China’s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service also warned that Chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms, highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from China with an increase in bids.

2018-08-01,"* Washington could announce plans for tariffs as early as Weds * China shares lead weakness trade worries * Mixed response in European shares to earnings, trade conflict * Fed and BOE rate meetings now a market focus By Tom Finn LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - World stocks fell and the dollar strengthened on Wednesday on fears of an imminent escalation in the U.S.-China tariff war, although strong corporate earnings eased investor concerns about a recent sell-off in the tech sector. Conflicting signs over which direction the trade conflict between the United States and China is headed have yanked markets in opposite directions. A Bloomberg report that the world’s two largest economics were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs saw stock markets edge up globally on Tuesday. But a source said the Trump administration plans to propose a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese imports, up from an original 10 percent, in a bid to pressure Beijing into making trade concessions. That injected uncertainty into financial markets and new concern about what it would mean for China and the global economy. Chinese shares, the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar all weakened. European shares were mixed as a fresh batch of positive corporate earnings offset the worries about the U.S.-China trade conflict. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.2 percent while Germany’s DAX slipped 0.13 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 tumbled 0.86 percent while France’s CAC 40 rose 0.13 percent. Investors fear a trade war between Washington and Beijing could hit global growth, and prominent U.S. business groups have condemned Trump’s aggressive tariffs. But analysts said Wednesday’s reaction remained fairly muted. “Overall the markets’ reaction has been subdued. The markets have calmed down relatively quickly. Maybe the market is underestimating the economic impacts of the tariffs and that is why it is keeping calm,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, a currencies strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Stronger than expected earnings by Apple Inc pushed quarterly results beyond Wall Street targets on Tuesday, allaying some concerns about a tech sector shaken by recent sell-offs in Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and Netflix Inc. The tech retreat has overshadowed a generally buoyant U.S. earnings season, with average 22.6 percent profit growth and 83 percent of companies beating consensus estimates so far. World stocks in July recorded their best monthly returns since January, despite trade tensions, growth fears and tech selling. The yen continued to depreciate, falling 0.2 percent versus the dollar to 112.10 as Tuesday’s pledge by the Bank of Japan to keep rates extremely low for an extended period continued to weigh on the Japanese currency. BOJ’s policy announcement on Tuesday to make its massive stimulus programme more flexible provided some comfort to bond investors. Traders appeared to be putting the BOJ’s tolerance for higher yields to the test on Wednesday as the benchmark 10-year JGB yield rose to 0.12 percent in its biggest one-day rise in two years. “Since the BOJ was vague about what its flexibility means, the market wants to test the bank’s pain threshold,” said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea in Helsinki. The central bank’s policy tweaks did not appear to show any inclination from the central bank to make a radical shift from its accommodative stance. Investors are turning their attention to other central bank decisions this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday. Markets await the Fed policy statement for signs of whether the expected two rate hikes for the remainder of 2018 can be cemented into pricing and for any change in the tone of its policy statement. “Buying sentiment towards the dollar could receive a boost if the central bank strikes a hawkish tone,” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, wrote in a note. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, gained 0.2 percent to 94.663. In Britain, a 25 basis-point hike is now widely expected on Thursday when the Bank of England meets, despite economic weakness linked to Britain’s looming European Union exit. The pound held at $1.3119, above a more than 10-month trough of $1.2955 touched earlier in July. In commodities, oil prices fell on industry data showing an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles. The slump in crude prices comes after their largest monthly decline in two years in July. U.S. crude dipped 0.6 percent to $73.63 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 gave up 0.8 percent to $73.61 per barrel. Spot gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,222.99 per ounce.

2018-08-01,"(Adds details, background) KUWAIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Kuwait’s oil minister said on Wednesday that the global oil market was approaching stability based on current production levels after the recent OPEC and non-OPEC agreement to boost output. “It is clear today based on the current level of production that we are approaching a very stable stage ... whether for the consumers or the producers,” Bakhit al-Rashidi told reporters. Kuwait has raised its oil output under June’s agreement among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and is pumping 2.8 million barrels per day, Rashidi said, adding that the country’s production capacity is 3.1 million bpd. An upcoming joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee meeting in Algeria, set for Sept. 22-23, will review producers’ oil supply levels after OPEC and others led by Russia agreed in June to raise output to cool the market, the minister said. OPEC and non-OPEC said they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. That would mean a roughly 1 million bpd increase in output. Last month, Brent crude prices fell more than 6 percent and U.S. crude slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly declines for both benchmarks since July 2016. Rashidi said he hoped oil production from the Neutral Zone, which Kuwait shares with Saudi Arabia, would resume “very soon”. The Neutral Zone is the only place in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait where foreign oil firms have equity in oilfields, which are otherwise owned and operated by state oil companies. Crude output in the zone is divided equally between the two countries. The joint Khafji oilfield was shut in October 2014 for environmental reasons, while the Wafra oilfield has been shut since May 2015 due to operating difficulties.

2018-08-01,"HANOI, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s state oil firm PetroVietnam said on Wednesday it has signed an agreement with two Japanese companies to sell gas from a South China Sea oil block close to waters disputed by Beijing. Vietnam is struggling to maintain its crude oil and gas output amid declining production from key fields and ongoing pressure from China that has affected work on some projects. “The development of the project is significant since exploration and production activities have slowed down in recent years because of tensions in the South China Sea, the ongoing corruption crackdown and persistently low crude oil prices,” a PetroVietnam official, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The gas sale-purchase agreement, signed in Hanoi on Tuesday, will “significantly contribute to ensuring the country’s energy security” PetroVietnam said in a statement. PetroVietnam said in April that maritime tensions with China will hurt its offshore exploration and production activities this year. China’s U-shaped “nine-dash line” marks a vast expanse of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam’s Exclusive Economic Zone. In March, PetroVietnam told Spanish energy firm Repsol to halt an offshore oil project under pressure from China, and in May a unit of Russia’s Rosneft expressed its concern that its recent drilling could upset China. An anti-graft crackdown in Vietnam, led by the ruling Communist Party, has also seen several high profile executives from state firms, including PetroVietnam, go on trial for corruption.  On Tuesday, the crackdown tried its first military suspect. Sao Vang-Dai Nguyet, located at blocks 05-1b & 05-1c 300 kms (186 miles) southeast of Vietnam’s coast, is 43.08 percent owned by Japan’s Idemitsu Kosan, 36.92 percent by Teikoku Oil (Con Son) Co. and 20 percent by PetroVietnam, the state oil firm said in a statement. The blocks containing the Sao Vang-Dai Nguyet project have not been directly disputed by Beijing in the past, but lie in waters close to the “nine-dash line”. Tuesday’s agreement will pave the way for the project to start commercial gas production from the third quarter of 2020, PetrVietnam said. Vietnam’s crude oil output in the first seven months of this year fell 11.3 percent from a year earlier to 7.16 million metric tonnes, government data released on Sunday showed.

Conflicting signs over the state of U.S.-China trade relations pulled markets in opposite directions. A Bloomberg report on Tuesday said that the United States and China were seeking to resume trade talks to defuse a battle over import tariffs. However, later reports that the U.S. administration plans to propose tariffs of 25 percent instead of the initially proposed 10 percent on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods injected uncertainty back into financial markets. A source familiar with the plan said the announcement could come as early as Wednesday. Chinese shares, the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar all weakened. A source familiar with the Trump administration’s tariff plans for China told Reuters that an announcement could come as early as Wednesday. “We maintain our view that negotiated settlement will be the most likely outcome.

The company’s shares rose 3.4 percent to $196.80 in after-hours trade. But shares in mainland China dropped, erasing early gains, with trade war fears and a private survey of purchasing managers pointing to a cloudy economic outlook.

The Shanghai Composite index fell 0.8 percent, while the blue-chip CSI300 index lost 1 percent. Australia’s manufacturing sector also showed slower activity in July, with the Commonwealth Bank/Markit purchasing managers index at its lowest level in nearly two years. Australian shares were flat, with some support coming from miners ahead of expected strong results from Rio Tinto later on Wednesday. Policy meetings at the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday also kept some investors on the sidelines. Although the U.S. central bank is expected to hold rates unchanged, investors will be looking for any change in the tone of its policy statement. “Buying sentiment towards the dollar could receive a boost if the central bank strikes a hawkish tone,” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, wrote in a note.

2018-08-01,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Talks next week between Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are not a prelude to a two-way free trade agreement (FTA), Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Wednesday. Nishimura also told Reuters in an interview that Japan did not intend to set numerical targets on either exports or imports. The Aug. 9 talks in Washington come as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration explores raising tariffs on foreign auto imports, including those from Japan, a step that officials say would do serious damage to the two economies and world trade. The United States is a major market for Japan’s automakers, which produced 3.8 million vehicles at their U.S. plants in 2017, roughly one-third of the 12 million total units produced in the country each year. An additional 1.7 million vehicles were exported from Japan last year. Trump wants a two-way trade pact as a way to reduce America’s trade deficit with Japan but Tokyo is wary of FTA talks because they would increase pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture. “Japan does not desire an FTA and these talks are not at all preliminary discussions on an FTA,” Nishimura said. Nishimura reiterated that Japan would keep trying to persuade Washington to return to a multilateral Trans-Pacific Partnership pact abandoned by Trump soon after he took office last year. However, he acknowledged that Washington’s preference was for bilateral deals. “We will be looking for the best path for both the United States and Japan,” Nishimura said. He repeated that Japan was expected to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from America and buy U.S. military gear needed for its defence. Japanese firms want to invest in the robust U.S. market and Japan wants to support that, he said. However, Nishimura ruled out setting a numerical limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, a tactic taken during trade wars in the 1980s and early 1990s, before the 1995 launch of the World Trade Organization, which generally bans such steps. “Whether it’s exports or imports, we will not set numerical targets,” Nishimura said. “The fundamental thing is to maintain free and fair trade.” Nishimura declined to say what steps Japan would take if Washington raised its tariffs on auto imports. “Raising tariffs on autos would have a big impact on the world economy and would be a big minus for the American economy, so we want to talk firmly so that does no happen,” he said.

2018-08-01,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s second-largest supermarket, Coles, on Wednesday  halted plans to charge shoppers for plastic bags, succumbing to customer fury about a shift away from single-use plastics.     Coles, owned by Wesfarmers, and its larger rival Woolworths Group Ltd removed one-use plastic bags from stores late in June as part of a national push to reduce waste, selling reusable ones for a small fee instead. It drew a furious response, dubbed “bag rage,” as customers angry about having to bring their own sacks or pay 15 Australian cents (11 U.S. cents) for a reusable plastic bag abused checkout staff and vented on social media. The union representing store workers launched a public  campaign on the issue and both grocers capitulated, temporarily waiving the fee. Coles, which had initially planned to reintroduce the fee on July  12, never levied it and has now extended the waiver indefinitely. “Some customers told us they needed more time to make the transition to reusable bags,” the company said in a statement. “Many customers bringing bags from home are still finding themselves short a bag or two so we are offering complimentary reusable (bags) to help them complete their shopping,” it said. The waiver was “still intended to be an interim measure,” Coles said, but gave no date for the resumption of the fee, saying only it will “assess when customers have become accustomed to bringing their own bags.” Woolworths has levied 15c per bag since July 8. The backflip comes while Coles is under immense pressure to lure customers, as its sales growth lags Woolworths just as Wesfarmers prepares to spin it out and list it separately. “It’s all a part of lifting their customer satisfaction and getting more customers in the door,” said James Tao, a market analyst at stockbroker Commonwealth Securities in Sydney. The cost of the move would probably have a negligible financial impact, he added. “It’s more about the PR side.” However that also appeared to backfire as Coles was lampooned online. “Coles’ colossal plastic bag fail” and “Coles caves” ran headlines on Australia’s main news sites. Major retailers in all but two Australian states face fines if they supply single-use plastic bags. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have so far taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption.

2018-08-01,"BEIJING, Aug 1 (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said on Wednesday its first-half overseas equity oil and gas production rose 7.3 percent from the same period a year earlier, with profit from those operations increasing “substantially”. The state-owned company, China’s biggest oil and gas producer, said on its website that its share of January-June output at overseas projects in which it has investments came in at over 47 million tonnes of oil equivalent, or around 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. {nL3N1KI1HE] The period saw CNPC’s listed unit PetroChina , whose domestic oil output is declining, ship in its first equity crude from the sub-salt Ribera project in Brazil, and lift the first barrels from two 40-year offshore concessions in Abu Dhabi. CNPC said its overseas business had focused on low-cost development in 2018, which has so far seen benchmark Brent crude prices rise around 10.5 percent. Various overseas projects are taking full advantage of the oil price recovery by increasing workloads and improving efficiency, the company said. It added that construction work on key projects was progressing in an orderly manner. This includes the second phase of the Yamal liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Russia, from which CNPC recently took delivery of its first LNG cargo in China, and the third phase of the Halfaya oil field in Iraq.

2018-08-01,"TOKYO, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after industry data showed U.S. stockpiles of crude unexpectedly rose, starting the new month in negative territory after the largest monthly decline in two years in July. October Brent crude futures dropped 29 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $73.92 a barrel by 0044 GMT, adding to a 1.8 percent loss in the previous session. U.S. crude futures were down 44 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $68.32 a barrel, having dropped nearly 2 percent on Tuesday. Brent fell more than 6 percent in July, while U.S. crude futures slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly decline for both benchmarks since July 2016. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed domestic crude inventories rose by 5.6 million barrels last week. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 2.8 million barrels. Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later on Wednesday. Signs that a supply disruption in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea could be resolved also weighed on prices. Yemen’s Houthi group said it was ready to unilaterally halt attacks in the Red Sea to support peace efforts. Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through the strait last week after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers. A Reuters poll showed that oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the United States meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions. OPEC has pledged to offset the loss of supply from Iran, the group’s third-biggest producer. Looming U.S. sanctions have already started to cut Iranian exports, with buyers from its biggest customers in Asia cutting imports to a seven-month low in June.

2018-08-01,"(Adds details, reaffirmed guidance, background) Aug 1 (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search Ltd said on Wednesday it has resumed operations at the Agogo Production Facility which was knocked out by a major earthquake in Papua New Guinea in February. Production has begun at an initial rate of about 2,000 barrels of oil per day (gross), Oil Search said. The restart of operations at Agogo has brought all Oil Search-operated facilities back online, the company added. Oil Search said the impact of the facility’s closure is included in its 2018 production guidance, which it maintained at towards the upper end of 23–26 million barrels of oil equivalent. Lower output at a key liquefied natural gas project (LNG) in Papua New Guinea, the PNG LNG project, led to an 18 percent fall in Oil Search’s first-half revenue after it was also damaged in the quake. ExxonMobil Corp holds a 33.2 percent stake in PNG LNG, while Oil Search has a 29 percent interest. Two PNG government-linked entities and Australia’s Santos Ltd hold smaller stakes.

2018-08-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) on Tuesday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit as expenses rose and a misplaced bet on the direction of oil prices offset higher oil output. Devon’s stock fell as much as 4.6 percent to $43 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. Its shares had been up 9 percent this year at 4 p.m. EDT, compared with a 13 percent increase in U.S. crude futures.   The Oklahoma City-based company said costs rose 39 percent to $2.73 billion in the three months ended June 30, as marketing expenses increased. It said revenue realized from producing oil and gas fell 20 percent from a year earlier to $1.07 billion. At the same time, expenses on that production rose 26 percent, the company said.  Oil prices were higher in the quarter than the company had hedged its production, costing $131 million to settle the derivatives, a spokesman said.    Ben Montalbano, co-founder of energy researcher PetroNerds, which tracks hedging by oil and gas firms, said Devon hedged about 57 percent of its second-quarter oil production at prices about $5.80 a barrel below average prices. Oil producers typically use hedges to lock in a price for their oil, guaranteeing a fixed amount for their output. But some independent oil producers this year hedged production at about $55 per barrel, giving up much of the quarter’s increase in oil prices, Montalbano said.    Devon produced 541,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day (boep/d) in the second quarter of 2018, compared with 536,000 boep/d a year ago. The results were largely higher than its expected 524,000-to-549,000 boep/d range. But its realized revenue from oil and gas output fell 20 percent to $1.07 billion because of the derivatives, the company reported.  Devon also took a $154 million asset impairment charge during the quarter on land in Oklahoma it no longer expects to develop, the spokesman said.    The company also cut its yearly oil production target to account for discontinued operations following the more than $3 billion sale of its interest in oil pipeline company EnLink Midstream. Net loss attributable to Devon was $425 million, or 83 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $219 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 34 cents per share, below analysts’ average estimate of 36 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $2.25 billion from $2.17 billion.
