2019-01-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of world stocks rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, with investors hopeful that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their months-long trade war that has hurt sentiment in financial markets. Increased risk appetite helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, while the dollar, which hit an 11-week low on Monday, rebounded as the euro weakened on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy. Tuesday’s advance for stocks added to gains logged over the past two sessions following last week’s strong U.S. employment  report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth. Trade and concerns over slowing economic growth triggered a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimates and stock valuations. On Tuesday, MSCI’s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.62 percent to a more than three-week high. The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said on Tuesday. Trade talks this week in Beijing are the first face-to-face discussions since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in their trade war. Trump, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, reiterated his recent statement that the talks with China were going well but gave no details. “You’re seeing some negotiations happen and the market is starting to think that perhaps we’ll start to see a framework evolve,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments. The recent stocks rally has lifted the S&P 500 .SPX by about 9 percent from 20-month lows hit around Christmas. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 241.31 points, or 1.03 percent, to 23,772.66, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 20.55 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,570.24 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 63.63 points, or 0.93 percent, to 6,887.10. European shares hit a three-week high in a broad-based rebound on hopes of a possible trade deal between China and the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  closed up 0.87 percent.  U.S. Treasury yields climbed, in line with higher U.S. stocks, on improved risk appetite and as the Treasury Department sold $38 billion in three-year notes to relatively soft demand. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.7101 percent, up from 2.682 percent on Monday. The dollar rose against the euro as investors focused on the risk of a euro zone recession after data showed more signs of slowing in the region. The euro was 0.3 lower against the greenback. “The euro had its upturn halted by German data showing the third decline in as many months in a gauge of factory growth,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The improved appetite for risk and the stronger dollar weighed on gold prices. Spot gold XAU= slipped 0.3 percent to $1,284.71 per ounce.         Oil prices extended gains, supported by hopes that the U.S.-China trade talks might defuse the trade dispute, while OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.39 to settle at $58.72 a barrel, a 2.4 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $1.26 to settle at $49.78 a barrel, a 2.6 percent gain.

2019-01-08,"(Corrects information on Permian holdings to 2.5 million from 1.4 million acres in final paragraph) Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Monday it expects to spend $4.4 billion to $5.3 billion this year, depending on the price of crude oil. Houston-based Oxy spent around $5 billion in 2018. The company is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field, and made the spending announcements Monday at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference. U.S. producers are under pressure from investors to rein in expenses, improve profits and return money to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. Oxy noted in its presentation that even at a price of $40 per barrel it could maintain its dividend, keep its production level steady and not outspend its cash flow. It also said it would complete a $2 billion share repurchase program this year. At $50 crude oil, Oxy would maintain its dividend and grow oil and gas production 5 to 8 percent. Its highest 2019 oil price scenario was $60 per barrel and included spending $5 billion to $5.3 billion and boosting production 11 to 13 percent. The U.S. benchmark crude oil peaked last year at $76 per barrel but has fallen since. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 56 cents to settle at $48.52 a barrel, a 1.17 percent gain. Oxy holds 2.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, the heart of the shale boom. Oxy also has assets in Columbia, Oman and Qatar, as well as midstream and chemicals businesses.

2019-01-08,"NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India has begun paying Iran for oil in rupees, a senior bank official said on Tuesday, the first such payments since the United States imposed new sanctions against Tehran in November. Washington gave a six-month waiver to eight countries, including India, allowing them to import some Iranian oil. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, wants to continue buying oil from Iran as it offers free shipping and an extended credit period, while Iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for imports from India. “Today we received a good amount from some oil companies,” Charan Singh, executive director at state-owned UCO Bank told Reuters. He did not disclose the names of refiners or how much had been deposited. New Delhi recently issued a notification exempting payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from steep withholding taxes, enabling refiners to clear an estimated $1.5 billion in dues. An industry source said India’s top refiner Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals have made payments for Iranian oil imports. Neither was immediately available for comment. Iran is devising payment mechanisms including barter with trading partners like India, China and Russia following a delay in the setting up of a European Union-led special purpose vehicle to facilitate trade with Tehran, its foreign minister Javad Zarif said earlier on Tuesday. In the previous round of U.S. sanctions, India settled 45 percent of oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros but this time it has signed deal with Iran to make all payments in rupees as New Delhi wants to fix its trade balance with Tehran. Indian imports from Iran totalled about $11 billion between April and November, with oil accounting for about 90 percent. Singh said Indian refiners had previously made payments to 15 banks, but they will now be making deposits into the accounts of only 9 Iranian lenders as one had since closed and the U.S has imposed secondary sanctions on five others. The nine banks are Saman Bank Corp., Bank Pasargad, Bank Eghtesad Novin, Karafarin Bank, Bank Samayeh, Middle East Bank, City Bank, Bank Hekmat Iranian, and Tourism Bank.

2019-01-08,"WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The nascent U.S. liquefied natural gas export industry has been particularly vulnerable to the U.S.-China trade war, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group said on Tuesday, adding that he hopes negotiators will soon resolve the dispute. Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters an escalating trade dispute could harm U.S. LNG producers, as other countries move in to fill any gap. “This is a leadership vacuum that will be filled by many of the United States’ opponents,” Sommers told reporters in a teleconference about LNG from other countries filling China’s needs if the fuel does not come from the United States. The United States is the world’s fastest-growing exporter of LNG. China, the fastest-growing importer, bought about 15 percent of U.S. LNG exports in 2017, worth about $447 million. Through much of 2018, China was on track to buy just 10 percent of the exports. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports last year and threatened to pressure Beijing more to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property and hacking. China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The trade dispute has also roiled crude oil markets since last year on worries it could harm consumer demand. Oil prices rose on Tuesday on hopes for successful negotiations. Sommers said countries that elbow their way in to supply LNG to China may not produce the fuel as environmentally responsibly as U.S. companies and in some cases they may be countries that are not favorable to Washington’s foreign policy. He did not mention any other countries but the United States has competed with Russia for LNG markets. “A lot of times energy is used as a club by rogue nations and I think (the United States) has proven itself to be a reliable supplier,” he said. Sommers said the API was encouraged that the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, were having trade talks in Beijing that will continue for an unscheduled third day, as they look to resolve the dispute. Last month Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day freeze on new tariffs to advance trade talks, declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions. U.S. companies proposing new LNG export terminals, including Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd, have been hoping the agreement could help advance their projects.

2019-01-08,"SEATTLE, Jan 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a recent winter beach walk, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee’s 5-year-old grandson beamed with delight as he spotted a crab. Protecting such moments of connection with nature are one of the motivations driving Inslee to consider running for the U.S. presidency, with action on climate change as his major campaign platform. “That type of experience in nature is what is so threatened and I want my grandkids to continue to have those experiences,” Inslee told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. The Washington Democrat, from one of the country’s greenest-leaning states, would likely face a tough uphill climb to the presidency, and plenty of analysts are skeptical of his chances to win the Democratic nomination, much less the Oval Office. But Inslee, 67, believes fighting climate change should be the top priority for the White House - a dramatic shift from the views of the current occupant, who has called global warming a hoax and plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change. “It requires a concerted national will and the political capital of the President of the United States to put their shoulder to this wheel,” he said. “We have to do climate first.” A host of Democratic challengers to Republican President Donald Trump are expected to join the political fray this year, from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to former Vice President Joe Biden. How much any of them would make action on climate change a priority in a new Democratic administration remains unclear. But Inslee believes there is an economic as well as environmental case for embarking on a “Green New Deal” that would transition the U.S. economy off fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable power. He likens such a change to other major historical shifts, from the United States’ build up of World War Two industrial might to the research and development program behind the Apollo space program that landed Americans on the moon. “We have to change our economy so it does not run on oil and diesel and instead runs on clean energy,” Inslee said. “That is the largest economic transition perhaps in human history, since we went from pulling a travois to having a wheel.” If done well, the governor said, decarbonizing the U.S. economy could spark plenty of new jobs in emerging clean energy industries, a view he outlined in his 2007 book Apollo’s Fire. “The number one job growth rate in America today is for solar installer and number two is for wind maintenance engineer,” he said. “These jobs are growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.” Inslee sees his state, which he has governed since 2012, as a model of combined environmentally-friendly legislation and strong economic growth. In recent years, Washington has reviewed its energy portfolio to boost renewables and encouraged cities and towns to buy electric buses. The state has also installed a network of electric vehicle charging stations and seeded a clean energy research and development fund. Home to major companies such as Amazon.com, Microsoft and Starbucks, Washington state had the strongest economy in the United States last year, according to an analysis of 28 indicators by personal finance website WalletHub. In the current state legislative session, Inslee is pushing for 100 percent clean electricity statewide by 2045 and a clean fuel standard in line with other West Coast states. But efforts to put in place carbon pricing in the state have failed three times under his watch. Inslee has not yet officially announced his candidacy for U.S. President. But in October he started a political action committee and has raised $112,000 through November for a potential run, according to federal election filings. Last year he also made multiple visits to early primary voting states as chairperson of the Democratic Governors Association. He believes support for clean energy was a successful campaign issue in the seven governerships that Democrats won from Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. Inslee also points to a September poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus voters, who said restoring U.S. leadership on climate change is one of their top three issues. But a Yale University poll from last March suggested global warming still ranks 15th out of 28 issues of importance for U.S. voters nationally. Political scientists say that is likely to hinder Inslee’s prospects for taking his green campaign national. “The brutal reality is that the electorate does not care about environmental issues,” said Aseem Prakash, director of the University of Washington Center for Environmental Politics. Prakash gives Inslee little to no chance of winning the presidency but believes a bid would boost his national visibility and make him a viable candidate for a cabinet-level post, such as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. In such a role, Prakash said, “he would be able to translate a lot of policies he has been talking about into concrete outcomes.” An Inslee candidacy on a climate change platform also could encourage other Democratic candidates to talk about the issue. The former congressman remains undeterred about his likely slim chances of winning the top job. “Pollsters be damned,” he said. “You’ve got to go with your gut.” He believes combatting climate change could help unify a fractured country - and that he could be the one to push ahead the action needed now to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change and take advantages of new clean energy opportunities. “Unfortunately we’re at the eleventh hour"" in terms of addressing climate change, Inslee said. “But it can be our hour. It can be our shining hour where my state and eventually America leads the world in a clean energy economy.” (Reporting by Gregory Scruggs ; editing by Laurie Goering : (Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

2019-01-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BASF (BASFn.DE) is looking to shed a sizeable portfolio of assets to try to salvage a deal it struck in 2017 to buy Belgian chemicals group Solvay’s (SOLB.BR) polyamide business, people close to the matter said.  The German company is working with investment bank Lazard (LAZ.N) to find a buyer for the plastics assets, which could be valued at about 450 million euros ($515 million), including debt, the people said. Information packages were sent out to potential buyers just before Christmas, and first-round bids are expected by the end of the month, they added.  BASF and Lazard declined to comment, while Solvay was not immediately available for comment.  To try to allay concerns raised by European Union antitrust regulators, BASF offered in October to exclude parts of Solvay’s European polyamide business, including innovation capabilities, from the list of assets it plans to acquire. It also offered to exclude manufacturing assets of Solvay’s intermediate and engineering plastics business.  The European Commission has set a provisional deadline of Jan. 25 for its ruling on the planned deal.  According to people close to the matter, BASF is marketing the assets to companies that also took part in the 2017 auction for the Solvay business, including South Korea’s SK Innovation (096770.KS), China’s KingFa (600143.SS), and private equity group SK Capital, which owns peer Ascend.  The assets, with estimated core earnings of about 60 million euros and an expected enterprise value (equity plus debt) of 7-8 times that, also include engineering plastics that have whet the appetite of peers such as Lanxess (LXSG.DE), they added.  BASF is seeking to strengthen its nylon business and enhance its access to key growth markets in Asia and South America with the Solvay deal. The purchase would boosts its activities in nylon, or polyamide 6-6, a heat-resistant engineering plastic that is used in textiles and also industrial parts such as tube fittings, cooling fans and engine air ducts. For Solvay, the sale is part of its drive to divest high-volume products and focus on specific applications in aerospace, automotive and the oil and gas industries where it can achieve higher margins. EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said last year that as only a few manufacturers provide essential inputs to produce different nylon products, a careful assessment was needed whether the proposed acquisition would lead to higher prices. A main precursor material for polyamide 6-6 is ADN. The main suppliers of this material are Ascend as well as Butachimie, a joint venture of Solvay and Invista, a former DuPont business now held by Koch Industries.

2019-01-08,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday a military-assisted crackdown had dramatically reduced fuel theft and uncovered a secret pipe that was used to siphon gasoline out of one of the country’s refineries. Such fuel theft has dropped from 787 truck loads per day to 177 since thousands of soldiers were sent to state-oil company Pemex’s installations last month, Lopez Obrador said at a daily news conference. The crackdown on years of mounting fuel theft is the leftist government’s first major move against corruption and violence after taking office on Dec. 1, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. By closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages, the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-manufacturing hub in central Mexico. Criminal groups and others who have tapped pipelines have long been blamed for billions of dollars of losses to public coffers over the past few years, but Lopez Obrador said last month that far more fuel was being stolen directly from Pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials. Lopez Obrador said the military had discovered a 3-kilometer (1.9 mile)-long “hose” that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato into a secret storage area. He admitted there were complaints about the shortages, but said they were not widespread, and urged an end to “panic” buying and said shortages were an issue of distribution, not supply. “This is not in vain,” Lopez Obrador said. “We are going to end corruption.” Local media showed images of tanker trucks, escorted by federal police, heading from oil-rich costal states to the country’s interior.

2019-01-08,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition-run congress on Tuesday issued a resolution calling deals between state-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and U.S. and French companies announced this week illegal, since they had not been sent to lawmakers for approval. The body said the oilfield deals with France’s Maurel & Prom (MAUP.PA) and little-known U.S. company Erepla violated article 150 of Venezuela’s constitution, which requires that contracts signed between the state and foreign companies be approved by the National Assembly, as Venezuela’s congress is known. “They are giving concessions that violate the law,” said lawmaker Jorge Millan, mentioning the two contracts. Congress, largely stripped of its power since the opposition took it over in 2016, is unlikely to be able block the deals from going forward. But the rejection could create legal complications under a future government. Maduro is set to be inaugurated for his second consecutive term on Thursday following a May vote considered a sham by the domestic opposition and many foreign governments. A regional bloc of Latin American countries last week called on Maduro, a protege of the late Hugo Chavez, not to take office. The deals are part of Maduro’s effort to reverse a sharp decline in the OPEC nation’s crude output that has crippled its economy. Erepla said it would invest up to $500 million in three fields, while Maurel & Prom said it would invest up to $400 million for a 40 percent stake in an oilfield joint venture. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Maurel & Prom did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours in France. A spokesman for Erepla, registered in Delaware in November and part-owned by a prominent Florida Republican donor and shipping magnate, said Venezuela’s hydrocarbons law “allows PDVSA to contract with companies like Erepla to execute field services without any additional approvals required.”   Referring to the Erepla deal during the congressional session earlier on Tuesday, Millan said that while PDVSA referred to the agreement as an oilfield service contract, “the company will be conducting oil exploration and production activities.” Maurel & Prom Chief Executive Michel Hochard said the company would act “in accordance with the instructions given” by Maduro and Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, according to a statement attributed to him in a PDVSA press release.

2019-01-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of world stock markets rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, with investors hopeful that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their months-long trade war that has hurt financial markets. Increased risk appetite helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, while the dollar, which hit an 11-week low on Monday, rebounded as the euro weakened on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy. Tuesday’s stocks advance added to gains logged over the past two sessions following last week’s strong U.S. employment  report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth. Trade and concerns over slowing economic growth triggered a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimates and stock valuations. On Tuesday, MSCI’s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.71 percent to a more than three-week high. Trade talks this week in Beijing are the first face-to-face discussions since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in their trade war. The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said on Tuesday. Trump, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, reiterated his recent statement that the talks with China were going well but gave no details. “You’re seeing some negotiations happen and the market is starting to think that perhaps we’ll start to see a framework evolve,” said Anik Sen, global head of equities at PineBridge Investments. The recent stocks rally has lifted the S&P 500 .SPX by nearly 10 percent from 20-month lows hit around Christmas.

European shares hit a three-week high in a broad-based rebound on hopes of a possible trade deal between China and the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  closed up 0.87 percent. U.S. Treasury yields climbed, in line with higher U.S. stocks, on improved risk appetite and as the Treasury Department sold $38 billion in three-year notes to relatively soft demand.

2019-01-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, spiked last year after falling for the previous three, as cold weather spurred natural gas demand for heating and as the economy pushed planes and trucks to guzzle fuel, an estimate released on Tuesday showed.  The Rhodium Group, an independent research group, said  emissions rose 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest jump since 2010, when the economy bounced back from the Great Recession.  Rhodium said the boost from the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter after China could make it harder for the United States to meet reductions targets it set under the Paris Agreement in 2015. To do so, the United States would have to cut energy-related carbon emissions by 2.6 percent on average over the next seven years, a pace more than twice that achieved between 2005 and 2017. “It is certainly feasible, but will likely require a fairly significant change in policy in the very near future, and/or favorable market and technological conditions,” the group said.  The spike occurred even though 2018 brought a record number of shutdowns of power plants fired by coal, the fuel richest in carbon output when burned.  Natural gas, which emits about half the carbon of coal, replaced most of the lost coal generation. But it also served the vast majority of load growth for electricity last year, the report said.  The Trump administration, which has announced its intent to leave the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, is relaxing Obama-era rules on emissions from power plants and vehicles as it seeks to boost production of oil, gas and coal. The earliest the administration can leave the accord is after the 2020 presidential election.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not respond to questions about the Rhodium report, saying it would only answer queries related to the partial federal government shutdown or about environmental emergencies.  Trump administration officials have said that emissions can waiver from year to year depending on the economy, but that the country can both cut emissions and enjoy a strong economy at the same time.  Environmentalists say the Trump administration needs to speed up the transition from natural gas to renewables such as wind and solar power and energy storage.  “Coal’s sharp-dressed cousin is continuing us on a path to irreparable and costly climate damage,” said Greg Cunningham, who works on clean energy and climate at the Conservation Law Foundation. “It is imperative that we shift our clean energy transition into high gear and accelerate our clean car standards to reverse this trend.” The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying organization for the U.S. oil and gas industry, says it does not  take a position on forming a carbon tax, which some environmentalists, politicians in both parties and petroleum companies say would harness the power of capitalism to reduce emissions.

2019-01-08,"(Adds picture available) By Brad Brooks SAO PAULO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A Brazilian man facing allegations of bribing officials at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA on behalf of Vitol Group , Glencore and other major oil trading firms has been arrested in the United States, authorities said Tuesday. Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade was detained in the U.S. on Dec. 20, an arrest that was disclosed in a Brazilian court document seen by Reuters. He was arrested with the help of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Besides handling deportation cases, ICE carries out investigations of transnational crime. An e-mail included in the court document from a Brazilian federal police official based in Miami indicated that Andrade is being held in an undisclosed location in the United States and that Brazil has requested his extradition. It was not clear when he may be sent back to Brazil. ICE did not respond to requests for comment. An investigator with Brazil’s federal police confirmed the arrest on condition that they not be named as they were not authorized to speak with the press, but declined to provide more details. Andrade was charged in Brazil for acting as a middleman between top executives at Vitol, allegedly funneling bribes to Petrobras officials in exchange for sweetheart deals from the state-run firm. Officials allege that he also carried out the same services for Glencore and other big oil trading firms to win sweetheart contracts with Petrobras. Two former executives of Trafigura were charged in the same scheme on Dec. 14. The cases are the latest part of Brazil’s “Car Wash” investigation, launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras. The probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazilian prosecutors have said they will pressure the middlemen charged and arrested to turn state’s witness and testify against powerful executives at the massive oil trading firms, the same method they have used for years to take down top targets. Prosecutors alleged in their charges against Andrade that both Vitol’s head of U.S. operations Mike Loya and its Latin American and the Caribbean boss Antonio Maarraoui, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui has been charged. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment. Prosecutors said at least $2.85 million in bribes were involved in the cases involving the oil traders, and have called their discoveries so far the “tip of the iceberg.” A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators. Glencore has said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. The stakes are high for both trading firms. Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case could widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases. The probe has already frozen current business for the trading firms in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms. Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall revenue of $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market. Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras’ prized Nigerian oilfields. Petrobras has said there are no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination.

2019-01-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday, supported by hopes that crude demand may rise more quickly if talks between U.S. and Chinese officials resolve the trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 settled up $1.26, or 2.6 percent, at $49.78 a barrel. During the session, the contract touched $49.95, the highest since Dec. 17.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose $1.39 a barrel, or 2.4 percent, to $58.72.  “The trade situation is definitely bullish; you have a good demand construction if we can wrap up this trade deal,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York.  The talks are going well so far and will continue on Wednesday, U.S. delegation member Steven Winberg said. These are the first face-to-face meetings between officials from the two countries since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has buffeted global financial markets. On Monday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and China’s foreign ministry expressed optimism on resolving the dispute. Some analysts warned, however, that tensions could flare anew. Oil traders also worried that a possible worldwide economic slowdown could dent fuel consumption. The hedge fund industry has cut significantly its bullish positions in crude futures. S&P Global Ratings said it had lowered its average oil price forecasts for 2019 by $10 per barrel to $55 for Brent and $50 per barrel for WTI. “Our lower oil price assumptions reflect slowing demand and rising supply globally,” said S&P Global Ratings analyst Danny Huang. Crude prices have been buoyed by supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries including top exporter Saudi Arabia, and allies including Russia. Saudi-based Arab Petroleum Investments Corp, which funds petroleum projects, estimated that oil prices are likely to trade at $60 to $70 per barrel by mid-2019. Still, U.S. oil supply is surging. A steep rise in onshore shale drilling has helped make the United States the world’s top producer, with crude production C-OUT-T-EIA up 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a world record 11.7 million bpd. The market is closely watching U.S. supplies, which analysts expect pulled back 3.3 million barrels in the latest week. If government data on Wednesday confirms that forecast, it would send a strong bullish signal to the market, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.

2019-01-08,"(Corrects information on Permian holdings to 2.5 million from 1.4 million acres in final paragraph) Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Monday it expects to spend $4.4 billion to $5.3 billion this year, depending on the price of crude oil. Houston-based Oxy spent around $5 billion in 2018. The company is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field, and made the spending announcements Monday at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference. U.S. producers are under pressure from investors to rein in expenses, improve profits and return money to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. Oxy noted in its presentation that even at a price of $40 per barrel it could maintain its dividend, keep its production level steady and not outspend its cash flow. It also said it would complete a $2 billion share repurchase program this year. At $50 crude oil, Oxy would maintain its dividend and grow oil and gas production 5 to 8 percent. Its highest 2019 oil price scenario was $60 per barrel and included spending $5 billion to $5.3 billion and boosting production 11 to 13 percent. The U.S. benchmark crude oil peaked last year at $76 per barrel but has fallen since. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 56 cents to settle at $48.52 a barrel, a 1.17 percent gain. Oxy holds 2.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, the heart of the shale boom. Oxy also has assets in Columbia, Oman and Qatar, as well as midstream and chemicals businesses.

2019-01-08,"NEW DELHI, Jan 8 (Reuters) - India has begun paying Iran for oil in rupees, a senior bank official said on Tuesday, the first such payments since the United States imposed new sanctions against Tehran in November. Washington gave a six-month waiver to eight countries, including India, allowing them to import some Iranian oil. India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, wants to continue buying oil from Iran as it offers free shipping and an extended credit period, while Iran will use the rupee funds to mostly pay for imports from India. “Today we received a good amount from some oil companies,” Charan Singh, executive director at state-owned UCO Bank told Reuters. He did not disclose the names of refiners or how much had been deposited. New Delhi recently issued a notification exempting payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from steep withholding taxes, enabling refiners to clear an estimated $1.5 billion in dues. An industry source said India’s top refiner Indian Oil Corp and Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals have made payments for Iranian oil imports. Neither was immediately available for comment. Iran is devising payment mechanisms including barter with trading partners like India, China and Russia following a delay in the setting up of a European Union-led special purpose vehicle to facilitate trade with Tehran, its foreign minister Javad Zarif said earlier on Tuesday. In the previous round of U.S. sanctions, India settled 45 percent of oil payments in rupees and the remainder in euros but this time it has signed deal with Iran to make all payments in rupees as New Delhi wants to fix its trade balance with Tehran. Indian imports from Iran totalled about $11 billion between April and November, with oil accounting for about 90 percent. Singh said Indian refiners had previously made payments to 15 banks, but they will now be making deposits into the accounts of only 9 Iranian lenders as one had since closed and the U.S has imposed secondary sanctions on five others. The nine banks are Saman Bank Corp., Bank Pasargad, Bank Eghtesad Novin, Karafarin Bank, Bank Samayeh, Middle East Bank, City Bank, Bank Hekmat Iranian, and Tourism Bank.

2019-01-08,"WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The nascent U.S. liquefied natural gas export industry has been particularly vulnerable to the U.S.-China trade war, the head of the American Petroleum Institute industry group said on Tuesday, adding that he hopes negotiators will soon resolve the dispute. Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters an escalating trade dispute could harm U.S. LNG producers, as other countries move in to fill any gap. “This is a leadership vacuum that will be filled by many of the United States’ opponents,” Sommers told reporters in a teleconference about LNG from other countries filling China’s needs if the fuel does not come from the United States. The United States is the world’s fastest-growing exporter of LNG. China, the fastest-growing importer, bought about 15 percent of U.S. LNG exports in 2017, worth about $447 million. Through much of 2018, China was on track to buy just 10 percent of the exports. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports last year and threatened to pressure Beijing more to change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property and hacking. China has retaliated with its own tariffs. The trade dispute has also roiled crude oil markets since last year on worries it could harm consumer demand. Oil prices rose on Tuesday on hopes for successful negotiations. Sommers said countries that elbow their way in to supply LNG to China may not produce the fuel as environmentally responsibly as U.S. companies and in some cases they may be countries that are not favorable to Washington’s foreign policy. He did not mention any other countries but the United States has competed with Russia for LNG markets. “A lot of times energy is used as a club by rogue nations and I think (the United States) has proven itself to be a reliable supplier,” he said. Sommers said the API was encouraged that the United States and China, the world’s two largest economies, were having trade talks in Beijing that will continue for an unscheduled third day, as they look to resolve the dispute. Last month Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day freeze on new tariffs to advance trade talks, declaring a truce following months of escalating tensions. U.S. companies proposing new LNG export terminals, including Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd, have been hoping the agreement could help advance their projects.

2019-01-08,"(Updates prices, adds details) * Dollar ticks up, euro hit by weak German data * Yields rise as trade deal optimism boosts risk sentiment * Oil prices up on trade talk hopes, OPEC cuts By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - An index of world stocks rose for the third straight session on Tuesday, lifted by hopes that the United States and China would strike a deal to end their months-long trade war that has hurt sentiment in financial markets. Increased risk appetite helped lift U.S. Treasury yields, while the dollar, which hit an 11-week low on Monday, rebounded as the euro weakened on concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy. Tuesday’s advance for stocks added to gains logged over the past two sessions following last week’s strong U.S. employment report and comments from the Federal Reserve chief that calmed worries that interest rate hikes would hurt growth. Trade and concerns over slowing economic growth triggered a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimate and stock valuations. On Tuesday, MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.48 percent to a more than three-week high. The United States and China will continue trade talks in Beijing for an unscheduled third day, a member of the U.S. delegation said on Tuesday. The meetings this week are the first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in their trade war. Trump, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, reiterated his recent statement that the talks with China were going well but gave no details. “With the U.S. and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London, wrote in a note. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 203.87 points, or 0.87 percent, to 23,735.22, the S&P 500 gained 15.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,565.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 42.77 points, or 0.63 percent, to 6,866.24. European shares hit a three-week high in a broad-based rebound on hopes of a possible trade deal between China and the United States. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.87 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose for a third day, in line with higher U.S. stocks, on improved risk appetite, while the Treasury Department also prepared to sell new supply. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 7/32 in price on Tuesday to yield 2.705 percent, up from 2.682 percent on Monday. The dollar rose against the euro as investors focused on the risk of a euro zone recession after data showed more signs of slowing in the region. The euro was 0.27 lower against the greenback. “The euro had its upturn halted by German data showing the third decline in as many months in a gauge of factory growth,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The improved appetite for risk and the stronger dollar weighed on gold prices. Spot gold slipped 0.35 percent to $1,284.1 per ounce. Oil prices extended gains, supported by hopes that the U.S.-China trade talks might defuse the trade dispute, while OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets. Brent crude futures were up $1.29, or 2.25 percent, to $58.62 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures climbed $1.2, or 2.47 percent, to $49.72 per barrel.

2019-01-08,"SEATTLE, Jan 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On a recent winter beach walk, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee’s 5-year-old grandson beamed with delight as he spotted a crab. Protecting such moments of connection with nature are one of the motivations driving Inslee to consider running for the U.S. presidency, with action on climate change as his major campaign platform. “That type of experience in nature is what is so threatened and I want my grandkids to continue to have those experiences,” Inslee told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview. The Washington Democrat, from one of the country’s greenest-leaning states, would likely face a tough uphill climb to the presidency, and plenty of analysts are skeptical of his chances to win the Democratic nomination, much less the Oval Office. But Inslee, 67, believes fighting climate change should be the top priority for the White House - a dramatic shift from the views of the current occupant, who has called global warming a hoax and plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement on climate change. “It requires a concerted national will and the political capital of the President of the United States to put their shoulder to this wheel,” he said. “We have to do climate first.” A host of Democratic challengers to Republican President Donald Trump are expected to join the political fray this year, from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to former Vice President Joe Biden. How much any of them would make action on climate change a priority in a new Democratic administration remains unclear. But Inslee believes there is an economic as well as environmental case for embarking on a “Green New Deal” that would transition the U.S. economy off fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable power. He likens such a change to other major historical shifts, from the United States’ build up of World War Two industrial might to the research and development program behind the Apollo space program that landed Americans on the moon. “We have to change our economy so it does not run on oil and diesel and instead runs on clean energy,” Inslee said. “That is the largest economic transition perhaps in human history, since we went from pulling a travois to having a wheel.” If done well, the governor said, decarbonizing the U.S. economy could spark plenty of new jobs in emerging clean energy industries, a view he outlined in his 2007 book Apollo’s Fire. “The number one job growth rate in America today is for solar installer and number two is for wind maintenance engineer,” he said. “These jobs are growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.” Inslee sees his state, which he has governed since 2012, as a model of combined environmentally-friendly legislation and strong economic growth. In recent years, Washington has reviewed its energy portfolio to boost renewables and encouraged cities and towns to buy electric buses. The state has also installed a network of electric vehicle charging stations and seeded a clean energy research and development fund. Home to major companies such as Amazon.com, Microsoft and Starbucks, Washington state had the strongest economy in the United States last year, according to an analysis of 28 indicators by personal finance website WalletHub. In the current state legislative session, Inslee is pushing for 100 percent clean electricity statewide by 2045 and a clean fuel standard in line with other West Coast states. But efforts to put in place carbon pricing in the state have failed three times under his watch. Inslee has not yet officially announced his candidacy for U.S. President. But in October he started a political action committee and has raised $112,000 through November for a potential run, according to federal election filings. Last year he also made multiple visits to early primary voting states as chairperson of the Democratic Governors Association. He believes support for clean energy was a successful campaign issue in the seven governerships that Democrats won from Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. Inslee also points to a September poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus voters, who said restoring U.S. leadership on climate change is one of their top three issues. But a Yale University poll from last March suggested global warming still ranks 15th out of 28 issues of importance for U.S. voters nationally. Political scientists say that is likely to hinder Inslee’s prospects for taking his green campaign national. “The brutal reality is that the electorate does not care about environmental issues,” said Aseem Prakash, director of the University of Washington Center for Environmental Politics. Prakash gives Inslee little to no chance of winning the presidency but believes a bid would boost his national visibility and make him a viable candidate for a cabinet-level post, such as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. In such a role, Prakash said, “he would be able to translate a lot of policies he has been talking about into concrete outcomes.” An Inslee candidacy on a climate change platform also could encourage other Democratic candidates to talk about the issue. The former congressman remains undeterred about his likely slim chances of winning the top job. “Pollsters be damned,” he said. “You’ve got to go with your gut.” He believes combatting climate change could help unify a fractured country - and that he could be the one to push ahead the action needed now to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change and take advantages of new clean energy opportunities. “Unfortunately we’re at the eleventh hour"" in terms of addressing climate change, Inslee said. “But it can be our hour. It can be our shining hour where my state and eventually America leads the world in a clean energy economy.” (Reporting by Gregory Scruggs ; editing by Laurie Goering : (Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.

2019-01-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BASF (BASFn.DE) is looking to shed a sizeable portfolio of assets to try to salvage a deal it struck in 2017 to buy Belgian chemicals group Solvay’s (SOLB.BR) polyamide business, people close to the matter said.  The German company is working with investment bank Lazard (LAZ.N) to find a buyer for the plastics assets, which could be valued at about 450 million euros ($515 million), including debt, the people said. Information packages were sent out to potential buyers just before Christmas, and first-round bids are expected by the end of the month, they added.  BASF and Lazard declined to comment, while Solvay was not immediately available for comment.  To try to allay concerns raised by European Union antitrust regulators, BASF offered in October to exclude parts of Solvay’s European polyamide business, including innovation capabilities, from the list of assets it plans to acquire. It also offered to exclude manufacturing assets of Solvay’s intermediate and engineering plastics business.  The European Commission has set a provisional deadline of Jan. 25 for its ruling on the planned deal.  According to people close to the matter, BASF is marketing the assets to companies that also took part in the 2017 auction for the Solvay business, including South Korea’s SK Innovation (096770.KS), China’s KingFa (600143.SS), and private equity group SK Capital, which owns peer Ascend.  The assets, with estimated core earnings of about 60 million euros and an expected enterprise value (equity plus debt) of 7-8 times that, also include engineering plastics that have whet the appetite of peers such as Lanxess (LXSG.DE), they added.  BASF is seeking to strengthen its nylon business and enhance its access to key growth markets in Asia and South America with the Solvay deal. The purchase would boosts its activities in nylon, or polyamide 6-6, a heat-resistant engineering plastic that is used in textiles and also industrial parts such as tube fittings, cooling fans and engine air ducts. For Solvay, the sale is part of its drive to divest high-volume products and focus on specific applications in aerospace, automotive and the oil and gas industries where it can achieve higher margins. EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said last year that as only a few manufacturers provide essential inputs to produce different nylon products, a careful assessment was needed whether the proposed acquisition would lead to higher prices. A main precursor material for polyamide 6-6 is ADN. The main suppliers of this material are Ascend as well as Butachimie, a joint venture of Solvay and Invista, a former DuPont business now held by Koch Industries.

2019-01-08,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday a military-assisted crackdown had dramatically reduced fuel theft and uncovered a secret pipe that was used to siphon gasoline out of one of the country’s refineries. Such fuel theft has dropped from 787 truck loads per day to 177 since thousands of soldiers were sent to state-oil company Pemex’s installations last month, Lopez Obrador said at a daily news conference. The crackdown on years of mounting fuel theft is the leftist government’s first major move against corruption and violence after taking office on Dec. 1, but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy. By closing off pipelines and refineries while it traced leakages, the government has triggered shortfalls and long lines at gas stations in at least six states, including Guanajuato, a major car-manufacturing hub in central Mexico. Criminal groups and others who have tapped pipelines have long been blamed for billions of dollars of losses to public coffers over the past few years, but Lopez Obrador said last month that far more fuel was being stolen directly from Pemex installations by an internal network of corrupt officials. Lopez Obrador said the military had discovered a 3-kilometer (1.9 mile)-long “hose” that was funneling fuel out of storage tanks at the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato into a secret storage area. He admitted there were complaints about the shortages, but said they were not widespread, and urged an end to “panic” buying and said shortages were an issue of distribution, not supply. “This is not in vain,” Lopez Obrador said. “We are going to end corruption.” Local media showed images of tanker trucks, escorted by federal police, heading from oil-rich costal states to the country’s interior. It was not immediately clear what impact the crackdown will have on imports of fuel. Mexico is the top export destination for U.S. energy products, importing about 1.4 million barrels every day, or nearly a quarter of all U.S. overseas sales.

2019-01-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) said it has discovered two new oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and has identified an additional billion barrels of oil at an existing field thanks to new seismic technology. The British company, which has only recently turned a corner following the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, also on Tuesday announced plans to expand production at its Atlantis oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico, consolidating its status as the largest oil producer in that region. The company has put a heavy emphasis on technology and data processing capabilities in recent years in order to unlock new resources and cut costs.  The $1.3 billion (£1 billion) Atlantis Phase 3 development will include drilling eight wells and a new subsea production system that will boost BP’s production by 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). It is scheduled to start production in 2020. Together with the new discoveries, BP aims to grow its Gulf of Mexico production from over 300,000 boed at present to 400,000 boed by the mid 2020s. BP said that new seismic technology helped it identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil at its Thunder Horse field within weeks, whereas previously it would have taken a year to analyse.  BP also announced oil discoveries in the Manuel and Nearly Headless Nick prospect in the Gulf. The Manuel prospect, half owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), will be linked to the Na Kika platform.  “BP’s Gulf of Mexico business is key to our strategy of growing production of advantaged high-margin oil,” BP head of upstream Bernard Looney said in a statement. “And these fields are still young – only 12 percent of the hydrocarbons in place across our Gulf portfolio have been produced so far. We can see many opportunities for further development,” he added. BP said it is also considering the development of Atlantis phases 4 and 5 as well as expanding the Thunder Horse, Na Kika and Mad Dog fields.

Hopes that Washington and Beijing may be moving towards a trade deal helped the mood again and also gave the dollar a lift in the currency markets after its shaky start to the year. That rise, along with the alarm from South Korea’s Samsung that it would badly miss its earnings forecasts, caused a slip in emerging markets, but Europe held its nerve — unlike last week after a similar warning from Apple. The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 1.5 percent despite some wobbles in Italy as Rome stepped in to support another of its struggling lenders. Britain’s FTSE was up 1.2 percent too as its retailers cheered rare good news about Christmas trading. “I think the market has been quite extreme in pricing recession risks, so I think we have value now in both the equity and bond markets,” SEB investment management’s global head of asset allocation Hans Peterson said. “The discussions between the U.S and China will take some time but I think the markets are prepared to move in the right direction on positive signals.” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted ahead of the start of Wall Street trading that talks with China, which were going into a second day, were going “very well”. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had predicted on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that “we can live with” S&P 500 futures gained 0.8 percent following a near four percent surge on Wall Street since Friday, led by Amazon and Netflix which have been recovering some of the ground they lost during a brutal end to 2018. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares ended down 0.2 percent, however. It was dragged lower by falls in South Korea due to Samsung and in China where government bond yields also saw their biggest daily gain in nine months China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had “good faith” to work with the United States to resolve trade friction, but many analysts doubt the two sides can reach a comprehensive agreement on all of the issues before a March deadline. “Various concerns markets had earlier are receding for now. Still, there’s no denying that U.S. (company) earnings momentum is slowing,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. “Ultimately we need to see whether upcoming earnings reports can dispel market concerns.” The dollar has its tail up, trading at 108.90 yen and $1.1431 to the euro as an unexpected fall in German industrial output for the third straight month also helped to weaken the euro zone currency. The British pound traded a tad lower at $1.2741 as British and European officials played down a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper on plans to extend Britain’s formal Article 50 notice to withdraw from the European Union. “I wouldn’t really want to think about the possibility of extending Article 50 here and now,” said  I don’t think this is what we ought to focus on today,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told journalists during a visit to Dublin. Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar hit one-month highs, having gained 2.7 percent in the past five days on gains in oil prices and on speculation the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates again this week. It last stood at 1.3272 per U.S. dollar . In the government bond markets, Europe’s yields were squeezed higher by a deluge of upcoming debt sales and the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield bounced back to 2.70 percent, from Friday’s near one-year low of 2.543 percent. Still, its latest level is still 50 basis points below its October peak of 3.261 percent and recent caution from the head of the Federal Reserve mean futures markets are now pricing in a slim chance of a U.S. rate cut this year. Oil prices were also up again on Tuesday, supported by hopes for Sino-U.S. trade talks in Beijing and a Wall Street Journal report that Saudi Arabia is planning to cut crude exports to around 7.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of January. Both U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures and International Brent crude futures stayed firm at $49.45 and $58.27 per barrel, respectively, while safe-haven gold eased back to $1,283 an ounce.

2019-01-08,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Commodity markets appear to have delivered their verdict on China’s plans to stimulate its economy, betting that Beijing’s boost to infrastructure spending will work. China’s central bank cut the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves for a fifth time in a year on Jan. 4, a move that will free up as much as $116 billion in new credit. The looser monetary policy announcement came two days after the national rail operator said it planned 6,800 km (4,225 miles) of new track this year, a 40 percent lift on what was laid last year. This implies a substantial hike on the 802.9 billion yuan ($117.2 billion) invested in rail in 2018, cash that will flow through to increased demand for steel, copper and also for coal used to provide energy to process ores into refined metals. Certainly, the prices of these commodities have improved in recent days, taking heart from Beijing’s stimulus, and also from some renewed optimism that progress is being made to resolve the U.S.-China trade dispute. Shanghai copper futures rose 1.2 percent from the 18-month closing low of 46,830 yuan a tonne on Jan. 4 to end at 47,380 yuan on Monday, and they extended gains in early Asian trade on Tuesday. London copper futures also rebounded from a similar 18-month low of $5,736 a tonne on Jan. 3, closing up 3.3 percent at $5,923 a tonne on Monday. Iron ore for delivery to China MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, has been rising since late November, and Monday’s close of $74.80 a tonne was up 2.6 percent since Jan. 3, and almost 16 percent since the 4-month low of $64.55 on Nov. 27. The exception so far is thermal coal, with Argus Media’s assessment of cargoes at Australia’s Newcastle Port dropping to $98.40 a tonne in the week to Jan. 4 from $99.74 the prior week. However, Newcastle coal is still almost 1 percent higher than the 6-month low of $97.50 a tonne reached on Nov. 23. Thermal coal is also likely to have struggled in recent weeks given Beijing was discouraging imports in December as part of efforts to limit total 2018 imports to a level similar to those in 2017. While this failed, it did cause seaborne imports of coal to drop to 15 million tonnes in December, the lowest monthly total since February 2016, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. In contrast, iron ore import volumes have held up, lending some fundamental support to recent gains in prices. China’s seaborne iron ore imports were 86.4 million tonnes in December, according to Refinitiv, up from 82.8 million in November. Imports on unwrought copper were 456,000 tonnes in November, the latest month for which official data is available, up from 420,000 the prior month, and above the average of 442,600 for the first 11 months of the year. For the recent price gains to extend into a sustained rally, it’s likely that physical import volumes will have to hold up, or grow somewhat in coming months. That means that the stimulus measures must translate to actual activity sooner rather than later, or the optimism they have created may ebb away. Of course, there are other factors that will drive short-term sentiment and commodity prices, chiefly the success or otherwise of the latest round of talks between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. Recent positive comments from  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross notwithstanding, there is still considerable uncertainty over whether an agreement can be reached. If a deal is struck that goes some way to normalising trade between the world’s two biggest economies, then commodities should enjoy a relief rally that will add to the positive vibes created by Beijing’s stimulus. The risk is that the opposite also applies, a no deal, or worse, an escalation in the dispute, would likely snuff out any rally in commodities such as iron ore, coal and copper.

2019-01-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin opened Russia’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) on Tuesday, saying it bolsters the country’s energy security.      The Marshal Vasilevskiy FSRU has been set up in Kaliningrad, wedged between European Union members Poland and Lithuania, by Russian energy giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) to bypass pipeline gas deliveries via Lithuania in case transit is disrupted.  Moscow’s decision to set up the FSRU was in part to reduce gas transit risks to Kaliningrad, home to a Baltic Fleet base, as the EU steps up efforts to reduce its dependency on Russia, a Kremlin-published transcript of Putin’s speech said. “In recent years we have paid much attention to energy supplies, to the energy of the region as a whole, including in connection with EU plans to remove the Baltic states from Russia’s energy ring,” Putin said. “This is their (EU countries’) business. Additional tax payers’ money will be invested into that.” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the Interfax news agency that supplies to Kaliningrad from Lithuania had been completely halted on Tuesday and replaced with natural gas from the FSRU. The FSRU, the first of its kind in Russia which arrived from Singapore last month with a cargo on board to commission the LNG import facility, can provide Kaliningrad with 2.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas a year, Gazprom has said. LNG is delivered by tankers, meaning it can be supplied to many markets.

2019-01-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Turkey has resumed imports of Iranian crude oil after a one-month hiatus in November when U.S. sanctions on Iran were reimposed, trading and shipping sources said. The United States granted Turkey and other countries import waivers in early November. Turkey said it was permitted to take 3 million tonnes a year, equivalent to about 60,000 barrels per day (bpd), under the waiver. Turkey used to import about 200,000 bpd of Iranian crude before Washington announced last year that it would pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions.  Turkey had reduced its imports from Iran in the months prior to sanctions coming into force in early November. Its imports fell to zero in November. But in December Turkey took delivery of two tankers carrying Iranian crude, equivalent to about 54,000 bpd during December, according to a shipping and trading source familiar with the matter. The Solan tanker delivered into the port of Aliaga, while the Sea Topaz I discharged at Tutunciftlik. So far in January, Turkey is set to receive a cargo from the Iranian-owned tanker Sinopa, the sources and Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed.

2019-01-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The London Electric Vehicle Company, which makes the city’s famous black taxis, is delaying the arrival of its first van as it now plans to work more closely with Chinese parent company Geely (0175.HK), its boss said.  LEVC was bought out of bankruptcy by the Chinese automaker in 2013, which has since opened a 325-million pound factory in central England and turned the domestic taxi producer into an exporter. The firm said in September it would be trialling its new electric van this year but Chief Executive Chris Gubbey told Reuters on Tuesday that the firm’s first commercial vehicle would now come to market “in the early 2020s.”  “On our own, we’re a relatively small player and for us to charge ahead and develop our own product and then try to maintain that and put further investment in to build off that, does not make sense,” he said. Gubbey said the decision has not been influenced by Brexit which is due to take place on March 29. Geely said on Monday it was forecasting flat sales, a sharp slowdown from 2018 as China’s giant auto market struggles with slowing economic growth and more cautious consumers.  Asked whether the decision regarding LEVC’s first commercial vehicle was linked to economising at Geely, Gubbey said: “That word hasn’t come up in the discussion.”  LEVC built 1,200 taxis at its Ansty factory last year and expects that to slightly more than double this year as the firm sells more of its electric models in both its home market and to countries such as Germany and France. However, like manufacturers across the country, the firm faces the challenge of a possible no-deal Brexit in just 80 days’ time, which could lead to tariffs, adding to costs, and customs checks, disrupting the flow of parts and vehicles. The company is talking to its logistics provider regarding the movement of European-sourced components which are predominately delivered via trucks through the port of Dover and will have a buffer of finished vehicles by the end of March.   “In terms of the export sales... we are working with our partners in terms of the potential for taking deliveries early so that they’ve got them there and they built up their own inventory a little bit earlier,” said Gubbey.

2019-01-08,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - China’s maritime authority has banned the discharge of “wash water” used in ships to strip hazardous sulphur emissions from engine exhaust gases from Jan. 1 for some ports, according to a government document reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday. The ban on water discharge from so-called open-loop scrubbers is part of an effort to prepare for International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules that will ban ships from using fuel oil with a sulphur content of more than 0.5 percent from 2020, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with exhaust “scrubbers” to clean up sulphur emissions. China’s Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) said in a policy document dated on Dec. 29 that it would ban wash water discharge at some river and coastal ports in emission control areas (ECAs), where ships are already limited to burning only fuel with a sulphur content of 0.5 percent. The ban took effect on the first day of 2019, MSA said, adding that ship operators are also not allowed to discharge any residue from wash water or burn it on the ships. China said last September it would impose tighter rules from Oct. 1, 2018, on emissions from vessels in and around the ports in the Yangtze River Delta, with plans to later extend this ECA to include the country’s entire coastline. MSA said in the document dated Dec. 29 that a timeline to expand the ban of wash water discharge to more coastal ports would be announced “at an appropriate time”. To comply with the ban on wash water discharge in the designated waters, shippers will have to switch to using a closed-loop scrubber system, or switch to using fuels with a lower sulphur content. Open-loop scrubbers use seawater to capture sulphur from engine exhausts before discharging this “wash water” back into the ocean after treatment. In closed-loop systems, scrubbing is performed using water treated with additives, recycling the liquid internally. Hybrid scrubbers are a combination of both. China’s effective ban on open-loop scrubbers mirrors a similar move by Singapore, which in late November said it would ban the discharge of wash water from Jan. 1, 2020. Singapore is the world’s biggest hub for ship refuelling, or bunkering. Some Chinese port cities are also increasingly targeting the multi-billion dollar bunkering industry, taking steps to show that they will be ready to meet the new IMO fuel standards.

2019-01-08,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - German energy firm E.ON (EONGn.DE) and Denmark’s Clever A/S have formed a 50-50 joint venture to install high-speed charging stations for electric vehicles, E.ON said on Tuesday, in a move to link up cities across Scandinavia. The 48 charging sites will be installed in Denmark, Sweden and Norway and are expected to be operational next year. They will be operated by the joint venture, E.ON said, adding third-party providers would also get access. Utilities are hoping that an increased uptake of electric vehicles across Europe will enable them to sell more power, leading them to muscle into the field of ultra-fast charging points where car owners can recharge their batteries in minutes. The stations will offer power of more than 150 kilowatts (kW), meaning mid-sized cars can fully recharge in 15-20 minutes. Some rivals have recently begun to test here stations with a capacity of up to 450 kW. No financial details were disclosed of the venture, which follows an initial cooperation agreement between the two companies in late 2017. Across Europe, E.ON operates about 3,000 charging points, of which 800 are in Germany. There were more than 16,100 public charging points in Germany at the end of 2018, according to industry group BDEW.

2019-01-08,"* U.S. Commerce Secretary says trade deal is possible * But concerns about Sino-American relationship linger * OPEC-led crude supply cuts support oil prices * U.S. oil production & drilling levels: tmsnrt.rs/2GYfhAi By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Tuesday, supported by hopes that U.S.-Chinese talks in Beijing would bring a halt to a trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies, while the start of OPEC-led supply cuts also tightened markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $48.69 per barrel at 0024 GMT, up 17 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that “we can live with” as dozens of officials from the world’s two largest economies held talks in a bid to end their trade dispute that has roiled global markets since last year. Despite optimism around the talks in Beijing, some analysts warned that the relationship between Washington and Beijing remained on shaky grounds, and that tensions could flare up again soon. “We remain concerned about the world’s most important bilateral relationship,” political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in its 2019 outlook. “The U.S. political establishment believes engagement with Beijing is no longer working, and it’s embracing an openly confrontational approach ... (and) rising nationalist sentiment makes it unlikely that Beijing will ignore U.S. provocations,” Eurasia Group said. Beyond politics, oil markets are being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia. “Crude oil prices have benefited from OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets,” said Mithun Fernando, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Looming over the OPEC-led cuts, however, is a surge in U.S. oil supply, driven by a steep rise in onshore shale oil drilling and production. As a result, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA rose by a whopping 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a world record 11.7 million bpd. With drilling activity still high, most analysts expect U.S. oil production to rise further this year.
