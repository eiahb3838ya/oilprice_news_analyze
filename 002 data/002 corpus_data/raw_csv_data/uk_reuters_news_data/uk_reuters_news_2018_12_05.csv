2018-12-05,"(Reuters) - Venezuela this month plans to import over 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of refined products to ease domestic fuel shortages caused by hobbled refineries and need to prioritize exports, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.  The country with the world’s largest crude reserves this year has not been able to make enough fuel to meet local demand and fulfill supply contracts with customers, including those under oil-for-loan agreements with Russia and China, the documents showed. From January through November, state-run oil firm PDVSA bought 19,000 bpd of crude mostly to feed its Isla refinery in Curacao and 234,000 bpd of refined products, including naphtha for diluting its extra heavy oil output, gasoline, diesel for power generation and components to make motor fuel. The 253,000 bpd of total imports so far this year represent an all-time record and a 40-percent increase compared with the 180,250 bpd bought last year, according to internal PDVSA data analyzed by Reuters. The purchases, which have expanded despite PDVSA’s cash constraints, have been negotiated almost entirely through swaps with fuel providers and traders, which receive Venezuelan crude and residual fuel, according to the data, a PDVSA employee and traders involved in the deals.     “Since February, we have not paid a single imported cargo with cash. We are exchanging the imported fuel for (Venezuelan) asphalt, virgin naphtha, natural gasoline, fuel oil, residual crude, whatever we have,” said the PDVSA employee who could not be identified because the information is private. From January through August, the total value of the cargoes was $3.15 billion. Suppliers included a unit of India’s Reliance Industries, PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum, Russian oil firms Lukoil and Rosneft, units of China National Petroleum Corp, and several trading firms. UNDER-PERFORMING REFINERIES Venezuelan refineries have worked this year at historical low rates with some of them completely halted for weeks due to technical failure, lack of investment, delayed maintenance and insufficient crude supply. A refinery in Curacao used by PDVSA as auxiliary facility, the 335,000-bpd Isla, has been inactive since the second quarter. Earlier this month, Venezuela’s largest refining complex, Paraguana, worked at 19 percent of its 955,000-bpd capacity, and the smaller Puerto la Cruz refinery was completely halted.  Venezuela’s fuel demand has decreased to 325,000 bpd in recent months - half the peak volume registered a decade ago - according to the PDVSA documents, amid a severe economic recession. Still, PDVSA has been unable to supply gas stations, airports, power plants and industrial customers, leading to drivers waiting to fill their tanks and customers fighting over cooking gas. From January through November, PDVSA delivered 270,000 bpd of domestic and imported fuel to the domestic market, 17 percent below the demand level, the documents showed.

The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” Trump wrote in a tweet ahead of the group’s meeting this week to discuss possible cuts. OPEC meets in Vienna on Thursday to weigh production and on Friday will hold talks with allies such as Russia. Official U.S. government oil production and inventory data are also due on Thursday. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, has pressed for steep output reductions but has faced pressure from Trump to keep oil flows steady to keep prices low, rather than reduce inventory. Trump, who has made the U.S. economy one of his top issues, has frequently complained about OPEC this year, as higher crude oil prices have in turn raised fuel prices for consumers and businesses. Russia’s TASS news agency reported on Wednesday that OPEC and its partners may return production quotas to 2016 levels by reducing oil production by more than 1 million barrels per day.

2018-12-05,"Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Western Canadian province of Alberta this week announced mandated temporary oil production cuts, a rare move aimed at bolstering sagging crude prices caused by rising production that has outstripped pipeline capacity and led to a glut in storage. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said the mandated 8.7 percent cuts, some 325,000 barrels per day (bpd), are needed to draw down near-record volumes of crude in storage in Western Canada and bring relief to sagging Canadian crude prices. Once storage volumes return to more normal levels, the forced cuts will be reduced to 95,000 bpd. The cuts will be spread among companies producing at least 10,000 bpd, based on average production. Crude production in Alberta’s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity, creating a bottleneck and a buildup of product in storage. More crude is now moving across the border by rail and by truck, but it is not enough to clear the glut. Adding to the woes, refinery maintenance has taken some buyers temporarily offline. The steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the Canadian economy by some estimates, and at one point Canadian oil was selling for more than $50 less than U.S. oil traded on futures markets. Canada produces some 4.6 million bpd and exports about 3.3 million bpd to the United States, about 99 percent of Canada’s total crude exports. Very. This is a rare move for a market economy like Canada, but it is not the first time an Alberta government has mandated cuts. In 1980, then-Premier Peter Lougheed forced cuts to protest a national energy program that he said would have harmed the province’s oil industry. The controversial cuts are supported by many Canadian producers, but not all of them. Companies like Cenovus Energy Inc and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd are vocal supporters of the move, with Cenovus saying the move will help it maintain capital spending to prepare it to move more oil when more pipelines are available in 2020. Executives from Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc, Husky Energy Inc and Imperial Oil Ltd, integrated producers with domestic refinery and upgrading capacity, expressed disappointment, however, saying they prefer market solutions to the problem. The larger 8.7 percent cuts are expected to last three or four months into the first half of 2019, according to a number of analysts, at which point much of excess storage will be drawn down. After that, the smaller, 95,000-bpd cuts will remain in place until year-end, to ensure that storage levels do not get too high again. Alberta said it will monitor the market closely and reductions will be adjusted accordingly as storage is drawn down or new transport capacity comes online. Producers will be allowed to choose where they cut production, allowing them to shut in their least lucrative barrels to make up their cut quota, instead of having to cut across the board, Alberta said. The baseline for each company will calculated based on the best six months of the year. Each operator will have their first 10,000 barrels per day exempted, so small producers are not affected. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend crude typically trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark, with the lower price reflecting the cost of transport and the quality of the product. The discount has typically been around $15, but has widened in recent months, hitting a record at $52.50 below WTI in October, according to data from Shorcan. Alberta and oil producers prefer to add more pipelines, but projects face fierce opposition from environmentalists and some Aboriginal groups. Construction is underway on Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline replacement from Alberta to the United States, with the project expected to be in service by the end of 2019. TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline, from Alberta to the United States, is facing a supplementary environmental assessment after a federal judge in Montana halted construction last month. The impact on timing remains unclear. The third project is the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is now owned by the Canadian government. Plans to triple the capacity of that line, which runs from Alberta to a port in the Vancouver area, are undergoing a new regulatory review. It is unclear when construction will begin. Crude by rail has ramped up sharply this year, hitting nearly 270,000 bpd in September. Alberta said last week that it would buy locomotives and rail cars to add an additional 120,000 bpd of crude by rail capacity. It expects the first trains to be running by December 2019, with all online by August 2020. Crude by rail will narrow the differential, but not as much as pipelines. Dealing with the low crude prices is essential for Notley, who faces an election no later than the end of May 2019. Her party faces a tough challenge from the United Conservative Party, led by Jason Kenney, a former Cabinet Minister with the federal Conservatives.

2018-12-05,"JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - South Africa’s Eskom wants the government to take on 100 billion rand ($7.2 billion) of its debts, its chairman told a newspaper, suggesting the struggling state-run power firm wanted relief on almost a quarter of its borrowings. Eskom, which has implemented power cuts in recent months due to coal shortages and poor plant performance, is fighting for survival after a decade of financial decline. Investors said they were told it wanted to cut 16,000 of its 48,000 employees. “Cost compression, revenue enhancement and debt relief are the core of the turnaround strategy,” Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza told the Business Day newspaper, adding that his firm wanted the state to take on 100 billion rand of its debt. He did not give Eskom’s total debt or indicate the profile of the borrowings the firm wanted to offload. Eskom’s balance sheet showed total debts were 419 billion rand at the end of September. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe declined to elaborate on the utility’s debt relief plans. The company is critical to Africa’s most industrialized economy because it supplies more than 90 percent of its power. Eskom executives met investors in London and the United States this week after posting an 89 percent slump in first-half profit.  They told investors that shifting debt to the government and cutting up to 16,000 staff were key parts of a new corporate strategy, one investor who met Eskom in London told Reuters. “Without some form of debt management operation it does question how sustainable this company is in the long run,” said the investor, asking not to be named as the meeting was private. Eskom’s debt plan has not been approved by the finance ministry, which has said it cannot keep pouring money into state firms as it tries to cut the budget deficit. “The government’s policy stance on the funding of state-owned companies remains that such funding must be done in a deficit neutral manner,” ministry spokesman Jabulani Sikhakhane said. Moving Eskom’s debt to the government’s balance sheet could also endanger South Africa’s sovereign credit ratings. Moody’s is the last of the “big three” ratings agencies to have South Africa’s debt in investment grade. Eskom’s bonds ZA186452330= ZA186452275= have been on the slide for months, though some of its most recently issued ones have seen a bounce over the last week. Eskom’s Mabuza said last week that asset sales could not solve the firm’s problems and it favored government support. He said Eskom had discussed turnaround plans with the public enterprises ministry and President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority since taking office in February, but the scale of its financial difficulties has made progress slow. Eskom expects to make a pre-tax loss of more than 11.2 billion rand this financial year.

2018-12-05,"OSLO (Reuters) - Faroe Petroleum has struck a deal to swap Norwegian oil and gas assets with Equinor, in a move that could raise the price that hostile bidder DNO has to pay to secure the British energy company. While Faroe Petroleum’s Chief Executive Graham Stewart said the deal had been in the works before Norway’s DNO launched its 608 million pound ($778 million) offer last month and was not intended to stop the bid, analysts said it would make Faroe a more attractive takeover target. “The deal hasn’t happened overnight. We haven’t pulled it as a rabbit out of the hat as a defense strategy even if it looks like (it),” Stewart told Reuters. He said the company had held discussions about the swap with Equinor for “months”, and most intensely during last summer. Faroe rejected DNO’s 152 pence per share bid on Nov. 26, saying it significantly undervalued the Aberdeen-based firm. Faroe’s CEO declined to discuss what price level could be acceptable to its shareholders, but said that the latest swap deal has made the company more valuable. “We want to secure the best value for our shareholders, and the latest deal cannot be ignored,” he added. DNO, which already owns 28 percent of Faroe, raised questions over the deal however, arguing it switched future growth potential for short-term cash flow from fields with declining output. “While Faroe has asserted this is not designed to stop the DNO offer, we need to ask if this is good value for a company seeking growth... That is the test this deal needs to satisfy,” the Oslo-listed firm said in a statement. Faroe said the swap would significantly reduce the need for capital investments as the company’s stake in $1.9 billion Njord re-development project would fall to zero from 7.5 percent, while it would add 7,000-8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for Faroe in 2019.  Its overall output is expected to rise to 18,000–22,000 boepd in 2019, making the company more confident in its ability to boost production to more than 50,000 boepd in the medium term, Stewart said. As a result of the swap, Faroe will get Equinor’s stakes in the Vilje and Ringhorne East fields, while Equinor gets Faroe’s stakes in Bauge and Hyme, an oilfield connected to Njord. In addition, Faroe will get part of Equinor’s stakes in the Marulk and Alve fields. The companies did not give a value for the assets involved, but RBC Capital estimated that at an oil price of $70 per barrel the overall deal is worth about $140 million. Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said that, at first glance, the deal looked better for Faroe than Equinor, and will make Faroe a more attractive acquisition target. “We believe 170-180 pence per share will be the final transaction price in the DNO/Faroe drama,” Sveen-Nilsen said. “Maybe a tad higher after today’s announcement.” Faroe shares were down 1.1 percent at around 1335 GMT, narrowly outperforming a European oil and gas index down 1.4 percent, weighed down by weaker crude prices. Equinor shares were down 1.5 percent while DNO’s were down 2.0 percent.

Both countries are keen to increase their electricity supplies, with Belgium in particular needing new sources of power with five of its seven ageing nuclear reactors closed for repairs. The 600 million pound Nemo project is being developed by National Grid (NG.L) and Belgian grid operator Elia.  It will enable up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity to flow between the countries, enough to power around one million homes. “Nemo Link is the UK’s first interconnector since 2012, increasing our electricity capacity from these power cables by a quarter and further enhancing security of supply for us and Belgium,” Britain’s business and energy secretary Greg Clark said in a statement issued by National Grid. The British power grid operator said it was investing more than 2 billion pounds in new interconnectors with Europe. It plans to build a 1,400 MW link between Britain and Denmark, a second link with France and another link with Norway. Britain already has power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland, which bring in around 6 percent of its electricity. Britain’s government has warned operators of electrical power links with Europe that they will need to set up alternative trading arrangements if the country leaves the European Union next year with no exit deal.

2018-12-05,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade will begin an investigation on Wednesday that may result in mandatory sales of refineries by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Cade said in a statement. According to the Cade statement, the watchdog will investigate the influence of Petrobras on fuel prices given that it controls 98 percent of Brazil’s refining capacity. Petrobras earlier this year proposed selling a 60 percent stake in four refineries as part of a wider effort to reduce debt. The company said it would retain about 75 percent of its domestic refining capacity after the privatization.  But it stopped the process in July after a decision by the Supreme Court that privatizations must be approved by Congress and after buyers were spooked by a truckers strike in May that forced the company to cut diesel prices. Cade revived the issue on Wednesday, and cited a previous analysis concluded by its technical body, adding that the “partial sale of the assets may not be enough to create independent competitors” and that “the company should sell the assets completely.”  The analysis by the technical body said that Petrobras should include in the refineries sale units that are close to each other to reduce distribution costs and increase competition.  Petrobras should also sell assets in Brazil’s richest region, the Southeast, the technical body said. The refineries the oil company initially intended to offer to investors were in other regions.  In a statement, the oil company said it will prove during the investigation it does not have anticompetitive practices. “Petrobras does not have a monopoly on refining since the 1990s. But more competition in the sector depends on a regulatory framework that attracts new investors.”  Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/petrobras-antitrust-divestiture/update-1-brazil-antitrust-watchdog-says-looking-at-wider-petrobras-refinery-sales-idUKL1N1YA1VK,05 Dec 2018,"Brazilian antitrust watchdog

2018-12-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - About 100 United Steelworkers union (USW) members rallied on Wednesday outside a LyondellBasell Industries (LYB.N) Houston oil refinery over a lack of negotiations there on a new local contract.   Talks on a national oil-workers agreement are due to begin next month with Shell Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS), as the lead industry negotiator. Existing union contracts expire on Feb. 1.  However, local groups are beginning discussions on individual plant issues ahead of the national talks. At least four other plants also have begun exchanging proposals on local issues, according to the USW.  LyondellBasell officials did not begin talks on union local issues as planned on Monday, Marcos Velez, a USW International representative said in an interview on Wednesday. The existing contract covering the plant’s 485 union workers expires on Feb. 1. “They called and said they couldn’t make it (Monday) and would call about meeting Tuesday,” Velez said. “It’s Wednesday and we’re still waiting to meet.” A Lyondell spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment on Wednesday. The USW group carried signs that said “coming soon” and showed silhouettes of people picketing. Union-represented Lyondell workers were off their jobs for 3 1/2 months during a strike and contract talks in 2015.  The national agreement, which covers wages, job security, health and safety issues, will be combined with terms of the agreement on local issues at each plant to complete the contract for each location.  Velez said Lyondell also canceled meetings during the 2015 strike. “It’s not uncommon, but it’s unacceptable,” he said. During the rally, USW activist Joshua Lege used a bullhorn to speak to the workers, many of them wearing blue work coveralls as they lined up in front of the refinery. “They say they want peace and professionalism, but they want war,” Lege said.   The national contract covers about 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers. In September, union officials agreed to seek 8 percent annual wage increases and a 3-year contract in the coming negotiations.  The contract would cover plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) BP Plc (BP.L), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) and Delek US Holdings Inc (DK.N).

2018-12-05,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Wednesday he would not cancel contracts issued to foreign and national oil companies by his predecessor but challenged them to pump oil quickly or no further oil fields would be offered. Lopez Obrador took office on Saturday, promising to increase the government’s role in the energy industry and roll back what he described as a 36-year neo-liberal era in which successive governments gradually opened up the economy.   During the election campaign, he pledged to review the contracts issued under a landmark energy reform for any signs of corruption. He and his team have not said they have uncovered any wrongdoing in the contracts already awarded. “The contracts will not be cancelled, so there won’t be a loss of confidence,” he told reporters at a daily news conference. Under Mexican law, the independent oil regulator known as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) runs the auctions, supervises the contracts and is the only entity that can cancel the contracts. How Lopez Obrador handles the energy industry will be one of the biggest challenges of his six-year term. He has promised to raise oil production from historic lows but has not fully clarified how, beyond promising more investment in the public sector.  During the transition the former Mexico City mayor issued a series of abrupt policy changes that battered stocks, bonds and the peso. Despite the new president’s efforts to reassure investors in recent days, markets have yet to recover lost ground. The 65-year-old president, however, did not rule out inviting more private-sector investment to Mexico’s untapped deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico even as he sharply criticized the energy reform a few days before in his inauguration speech. He said companies that have already won contracts should hurry up with their investment and with pumping oil. “We can’t keep on giving out territory for the extraction of hydrocarbons if there is no investment and there is no production,” he said, adding he was opposed to companies “speculating” with the contracts. “We want them to demonstrate that they are going to invest and produce oil. We will make a decision based on results,” he said, adding that there will be a three-year “truce,” without giving further details. It can take years before investments turn into commercial-scale production. The last government said the 107 contracts  could generate $161 billion of investment over the life of the contracts. Industry experts say it will be several years before significant amounts of crude flows from the projects.  Capital Economics said the challenge of producing significantly more oil in three years would be very hard to meet, suggesting it could take more than twice that time for private oil production to really take off in Mexico.  “It is the clearest sign yet that AMLO intends to stop the much-vaunted energy reform in its tracks” the London-based research group said in a note, referring to Lopez Obrador by a common nickname. According to CNH data, firms have committed hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration and other work plans approved by the regulator. Lopez Obrador did not say whether he would postpone or cancel a round of auctions set for next February, though analysts have said the tenders are unlikely be carried out as scheduled.  The tenders cover 46 oil and gas blocks, including nine shale areas, in addition to partnership rights for seven onshore joint ventures with Pemex.  Mexico’s crude production fell to the lowest level in decades under the previous government. Lopez Obrador says investment in state-owned oil company Pemex has declined as a result of the reform and private sector investment has not risen significantly.  Responding to a question about future deepwater oil auctions, Lopez Obrador said the projects had not produced “one barrel of oil.” While the complicated deepwater projects snapped up by the likes of Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corp Chevron Corp and Total SA are still in the exploration phase, some onshore projects offered under the reform are now producing about 13,400 barrels per day (bpd), official data shows. That includes about 9,200 bpd from two onshore joint ventures with Pemex in which private partners operate the projects, plus another 4,200 bpd from projects operated by new private producers. Pemex produced about 1.76 million bpd in October after 14 consecutive years of decline.

2018-12-05,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The Western Canadian province of British Columbia on Wednesday outlined the first measures it will take to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, including shifting homes and vehicles to clean or renewable energy. The province would still support its nascent liquefied natural gas industry, with the 68-page CleanBC plan calling for LNG firms to use the “greenest technology available.” Some 75 percent of British Columbia’s planned emission cuts would be achieved by shifting homes, vehicles and industry off fossil fuels and onto clean or renewable energy, boosting energy efficiency, and by attracting low-carbon investment. British Columbia wants to cut carbon emissions to 38.2 million tonnes by 2030, down 40 percent from 2007 levels, then dropping to 12.7 million tonnes by 2050. One large LNG export terminal in the northern town of Kitimat is expected to add some 3.45 million tonnes of carbon to the province’s total emissions once operations begin in the mid-2020s. A second smaller LNG plant north of Vancouver is expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2019, with operations in 2023. “We want to make sure British Columbia is a destination for investment and industry that wants to come here and wants to lead the world with new technologies,” Premier John Horgan told reporters. “That includes our traditional foundational industries like mining, forestry and natural gas.” British Columbia last month said it would phase out the sale of new non-electric vehicles in the province by 2040, a bold measure aimed at getting carbon emitting cars and light-duty trucks off the road. In addition, the province said it would speed up the transition to cleaner fuels at the pump, including hydrogen and LNG for use in transport. It said all new homes and buildings must be low-carbon by 2032 and said it will ramp up funding for retrofits of older buildings.

2018-12-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron’s government is dropping further fuel-tax hikes in next year’s budget in the face of protests across France over living costs, his prime minister said on Wednesday, a day after announcing their suspension for six months.  The Macron administration is struggling to defuse the anger driving the “yellow vest” protests, as it reels from the worst riots seen in central Paris in five decades last Saturday. “The government is ready for dialogue and is showing it because this tax increase has been dropped from the 2019 budget bill,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told the lower house of parliament. The concession was the latest attempt to quell the worst crisis of Macron’s presidency after announcing the six-month suspension only the day before. His government indicated earlier that it could also amend a wealth tax that Macron shrank last year to cover only real estate assets, earning him criticism as the “president of the rich”. A Macron aide denied that any eventual revision of the wealth tax would represent a major climb-down by Macron, a pro-business former investment banker, adding that the president remained committed to his reform drive.  Government spokesman Benjamin Grivet said all tax-related policies needed to be periodically evaluated and, if deemed not to be working, should be changed. He said the wealth tax could be reassessed in the autumn of 2019. “If a measure that we have taken, which is costing the public money, turns out not to be working, if it’s not going well, we’re not stupid - we would change it,” Griveaux told RTL radio. The unrest over the squeeze on household budgets comes as OECD data showed that France has become the most highly taxed country in the developed world, surpassing even high-tax Denmark. Griveaux later told a weekly news conference that Macron had called on all political parties, trade unions and business leaders to press the need for calm.  Student protests and planned trade union strikes in the energy and port sectors next week nonetheless underscored the risk of contagion. And with little sign its concessions are calming protesters’ nerves, the government is also preparing for a new round of possible violence on Saturday.  “I want to tell the thugs, we will stand up to them and won’t give an inch,” Philippe told lawmakers. Security sources said the government was considering using troops currently used on anti-terrorism patrols to protect public buildings. U-TURN The “yellow vest” movement - so-called because of the high-vis jackets worn by protesters - began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes but morphed into a broader, sometimes-violent rebellion against 40-year-old Macron. His administration’s shift on fuel tax came after rioters ran amok in central Paris, torching cars, looting boutiques vandalising cafes and private residences and cafes in affluent neighbourhoods. Philippe earlier said the six-month suspension to the carbon-tax would be used to examine other measures to bolster household spending power. It marked the first major U-turn by Macron in his 18-months in office, at a time polls show that barely one in five French people think he is doing a good job.  Nearly seven out of eight people told pollsters that the measures did not satisfy the movement’s demands, according to an Elabe survey for BFM TV. The poll also found that although 82 percent were against the violence seen last Saturday, 72 percent supported the “gilets jaunes” movement. U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock Macron over the policy shift, which could make it harder for France to meet its CO2 emissions reduction target, a core element of the Paris climate agreement of 2015. “I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago,” Trump tweeted late on Tuesday, as U.N. climate talks take place in Poland on how to enforce global action. “The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters.” Adding to Macron’s difficulties, college students are agitating and the hardline CGT trade union on Wednesday called for strikes in the energy industry and at ports on Dec. 13.     Meanwhile, Total said a rising number of its filling stations were running dry as a result of “yellow vest” road blocks.

2018-12-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the world’s biggest exporters, who will discuss cutting output to help shore up prices and curb excess supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers will meet in Vienna this week to discuss a potential cut in production.  A monitoring committee of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed on the need to cut oil output in 2019, two sources familiar with the discussions said, adding that volumes and the baseline for cuts were being debated. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 52 cents to settle at $61.56 a barrel after earlier reaching a session high of $63.29 a barrel and a low of $60.80. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 36 cents to settle at $52.89 a barrel. The contract traded between $54.44 a barrel and $52.16 a barrel during the session. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters he had a “good” meeting with his Saudi counterpart, Khalid al-Falih, on Wednesday and they planned more talks. “All of us, including Russia, agreed there is a need for a reduction,” Oman’s Oil Minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhy told reporters after a ministerial committee that groups Saudi Arabia, Russia and several other producers met on Wednesday. Russia’s No. 2 oil producer Lukoil (LKOH.MM) is ready to cut oil production if OPEC and other leading producers agree to do so, though it would be technically difficult in winter, RIA news agency quoted the company’s head Vagit Alekperov as saying. OPEC wants to avert a buildup in global oil inventories like the one that sent prices from late 2014 into a prolonged slump that brought Brent to below $30 a barrel at the start of 2016. U.S. President Donald Trump pressured OPEC not to reduce output. “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “None of today’s comments should have come as a surprise since the key unknown remains the size of any such reduction and how the cuts are distributed,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “The Trump administration appears to be maintaining pressure on the Saudis to limit any production cuts in precluding significant price advances from current levels. And the fact that Russia still appears somewhat non-committal would appear to tilt odds in favor of about a 1.0-1.1 million barrels per day reduction.” Saudi Arabian crude supply in November rose to 11.3 million barrels per day, a source familiar with the matter said.. That marks a rise from October’s 10.65 million bpd.  U.S. crude inventories rose by 5.4 million barrels in the week to Nov. 30 to 448 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday.  Official U.S. government inventory data is due on Thursday, delayed by one day. A Reuters survey forecast a decline of 900,000 barrels.

2018-12-05,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.S. government confirmed that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met with U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook in Vienna on Wednesday, contradicting a Saudi denial that the talks had taken place. Sources familiar with the meeting said earlier that Hook, a senior policy adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, had spoken with Falih a day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was due to debate oil output cuts. The United States reimposed sanctions on OPEC member Iran last month. The measure has severely reduced Iranian oil flows. Washington has said it wants ultimately to drive Iranian shipments to zero. A Saudi Energy Ministry spokesman said of the talks between Falih and Hook: “We categorically deny such a meeting took place.” However, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman later confirmed the meeting occurred. “Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook met briefly with the Saudi Minister of Energy in Vienna on Wednesday,” the State Department spokeswoman said. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, to refrain from production cuts in order to keep oil prices low. He said higher oil supplies were a payback from Riyadh for U.S. support against Saudi arch-rival Iran. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh criticized Hook over the meeting for what he said was his “meddlesome approach”. “If Mr. Hook has come to Vienna to apply for U.S. membership in OPEC, and this is the reason why he meets OPEC members, this request shall be reviewed,” Zanganeh told Iran’s Oil Ministry news website SHANA. “Otherwise, he has adopted an unprofessional, naive and meddlesome approach.

2018-12-05,"(Adds details on 2019 outlook, crude by rail, share update, quote from executive) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Canadian Natural Resources Ltd on Wednesday forecast a roughly 20 percent drop in capital spending in 2019 compared with 2018, blaming a lack of market access for its oil and the “dysfunctional” pipeline nomination process. But Canada’s largest oil producer also said relief was on the horizon, noting it sees some 615,000 barrels per day (bpd) worth of new takeaway capacity in place for Western Canadian producers by the fourth quarter of 2019. That will be further bolstered by the Alberta government’s controversial decision to mandate output cuts of 8.7 percent, or 325,000 bpd, to help boost sagging Canadian crude prices, a plan which Canadian Natural supports. The company’s shares jumped 4 percent, trading at C$37.26 on the Toronto Stock Exchange as the broader energy sector rallied on higher oil prices. Canadian Natural set its 2019 capital budget at around C$3.7 billion ($2.8 billion), down about C$1 billion from 2018 spending, with maintenance capital targeted at about C$3.1 billion. “If prices normalize further out, combined with more certain market access, we will look to add growth capital in 2019 to the C$4.4 billion range, which would give us growth in 2020 and beyond,” said Canadian Natural President Tim McKay in a webcast presentation to investors. Canadian Natural said the Alberta government’s curtailment plan has already improved the outlook for prices in early 2019, though it continues to monitor the impact. The rare move to mandate cuts is unusual for a market economy like Canada and a number of integrated producers with secured pipeline access and domestic refinery capacity expressed disappointment, saying they prefer “market” solutions to the problem.. Canadian Natural also said it was pushing for immediate changes to the nomination system for Canada’s largest crude pipeline network. Enbridge Inc’s Mainline system that carries about 1.2 million bpd of crude and other liquids operates as a common carrier, which means producers nominate, or request, space on the line on a monthly basis and are allocated a share of capacity based on total requests. Producers game the system by requesting more space than they need, leading to so-called “air barrels” leaving the pipelines running below capacity. “This market inconsistency is the reason why Canadian Natural and other producers feel the nomination process is broken and the market is dysfunctional,” said Bryan Bradley, Canadian Natural’s vice president of marketing. Enbridge has been trying to fix the problem for years. Looking ahead, Canadian Natural said it expects crude-by-rail volumes to rise by 150,000 bpd through 2019, topping some 400,000 bpd by year-end, compared with September’s rail exports of nearly 270,000 bpd. Longer term, the company is watching progress of two export projects that have faced recent delays: TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline and the government-owned Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Together they would add another 1.42 million bpd of export capacity for Canadian producers, of which Canadian Natural has secured 250,000 bpd of space. That transport security would allow the company to move ahead with larger growth projects. Canadian Natural said it expects 2019 production to be between 1.03 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and 1.1 million boepd. The company said it has the ability to produce more condensate, a very light oil that is used in blending and is not included in Alberta’s production caps.

2018-12-05,"BUENOS AIRES, Dec 5 (Reuters) - China will ramp up imports of Argentine soyoil after Argentina begins harvesting its next soy crop in March, a government official told Reuters, but talks toward reaching a deal to sell soymeal livestock feed to China have fizzled. The soyoil agreement is good news for Argentine crushing plants that manufacture soyoil and have been hard hit by the U.S.-China trade war. “The Chinese agreed to buy 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of soyoil from Argentina,” Santiago del Solar, chief of staff to Argentina’s agriculture secretary, said late on Tuesday. He said the deal was signed during President Xi Jinping’s state visit at the weekend. That compares to 120,000 tonnes of soyoil sent to China over the last three years, del Solar said, and would be worth $185 million to $250 million per year, based on current prices. But negotiations aimed at allowing soymeal livestock feed to be exported to China have gone cold, while China and the United States enter talks aimed at ending the trade war, he said. “They are not interested in buying soymeal from us right now, but we will keep talking,” del Solar said. He did not say why China had backed away. The Chinese embassy in Buenos Aires did not respond to a request for comment. China so far has chosen to support its own crushing industry by importing raw beans to be processed in Chinese plants. But trade tensions have all but halted U.S. beans going to China. “If China does not re-establish soybean imports from the United States, it is possible they will come back to Argentina to talk about importing soymeal,” said Gustavo Lopez, head of the local Agritrend consultancy. Argentina is the world’s biggest supplier of both soymeal and soyoil, which is used in cooking and making biofuels. Washington and Beijing’s trade dispute has made Argentine crushing plants uncompetitive against their U.S. counterparts, which are benefiting from a soy glut created by the 25 percent tariff that China has placed on U.S. beans. Argentine crushing plants have been reduced to working at only 55 percent capacity. Until 2009, Argentina was the biggest supplier of soyoil to China, with volumes of 3 or 4 million tonnes per year. “China then introduced a new policy to increase its own crushing facilities, so it put up some technical barriers against importing Argentine soyoil,” said Gustavo Idigoras, president of the CIARA-CEC chamber of grains exporter and soy crushing companies. Toward the end of 2015, China halted all Argentine soyoil imports for two years. The trade started picking up slowly this year.

2018-12-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Wednesday, plagued by a flattening yield curve that sparked concerns about an economic slowdown in the United States and weakening expectations of a lasting U.S.-China trade truce, while the dollar steadied.    U.S. markets were closed to mark former President George H.W. Bush’s death, but the effect of Wall Street’s turmoil in the previous session, when New York-listed shares tumbled more than 3 percent, was felt in Asia and Europe. The MSCI’s all-country index .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.5 percent. Tuesday’s markets chaos came a day after equities boomed on optimism that China and the U.S. had temporarily called a tariff ceasefire to sort out their trade dispute. But doubts began soon after along with President Donald Trump threatening “major tariffs” on Chinese imports if his administration failed to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing.      “As I look into next year, most expectations for further gains have been pared back. Investors have gone from extended bullishness at the start of the year on equities to an uncomfortable neutrality,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson. Trump’s comments, alongside the drop in U.S. stocks and bond yields, pushed Asian shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS 1.4 percent lower. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 1.16 percent. Markets across the world have been rattled by recession fears, exemplified by the flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve. The benchmark Treasury 10-year yield fell to its lowest point since mid-September on Tuesday, while the spread between the 10-year yield over its two-year counterpart also shrank to the smallest since the start of the financial crisis in January 2008. That signaled to some investors an approaching U.S. economic slowdown.  The flattening of the curve gained momentum after last week’s signal by the Federal Reserve that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate-increase cycle.  The dollar steadied on Wednesday after it took a hard hit in the early reaction to recession concerns and the initial thaw in trade tensions between Washington and Beijing sapped demand for the safe-haven greenback.   The greenback rose 0.32 percent against the Japanese yen and the euro gave up all its early gains to trade down 0.04 percent against the dollar. Gold, which moves inversely with the dollar, slipped on expectations of more rate hikes following remarks from a U.S. Federal Reserve official and as some investors booked profits after prices climbed to their highest in more than five weeks. Palladium, on the other hand, surpassed the bullion for the first time in about 16 years, to hit a record high of $1,263.56 per ounce as higher speculative interest and larger supply deficit boosted the auto-catalyst metal. Markets are also bracing for more news on Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, the start of five days of parliamentary debate over her plans to leave the European Union. The pound rose off 17-month lows of $1.2659 GBP=D3 hit on Tuesday to around $1.2751, up 0.3 percent on the day, amid creeping optimism that Britain could opt to stay in the EU after all. The threat of slowing economic activity also weighed on oil prices, but oil prices went higher on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the world’s biggest exporters who will discuss cutting output to help shore up prices and curb excess supply.

2018-12-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s transport minister said on Wednesday he opposed a fuel tax on diesel to encourage a shift towards cleaner vehicles but manufacturers should speed up their push to get polluting cars off the road through incentives for customers. The German government has agreed to reduce emissions from the transport sector by 40 percent but it remains unclear how the goal will be achieved. Andreas Scheuer, a member of the CSU Bavarian conservatives, said he favored a system of incentives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions rather than using a tax on carbon-based fuels, like the one favored by the Social Democratic environment minister. “I oppose taxes and additional burdens,” he told Reuters. German carmakers last month agreed to offer up to 3,000 euros ($3,400) per car to help Germany clean up toxic fumes from heavily polluting diesel vehicles as part of a last ditch effort to avoid a court imposed ban on diesel vehicles.  “The manufacturers have to deliver,” Scheuer said in an interview. “I hope that the pressure in the market leads to improvements for the diesel owners ... The government can’t impose it, but it’s clear the German manufacturers would be well-advised to win back the trust of the domestic market.” Scheuer also faulted the industry for lackluster progress on developing alternative propulsion systems, such as electric cars, despite the fact that the government had spent around 5.2 billion euros on such programs. “Too little has happened there,” he said. “The customers need functioning vehicles and not studies, and not pilot programs that can be shown off at car shows.” Car owners can trade-in older vehicles for cleaner newer ones, or opt for cumbersome retrofits of more effective exhaust filtering systems at a later stage. The global reputation of Germany’s car industry has been tarnished by a series of scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars. The government has been pushing German carmakers - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) - and foreign manufacturers to take quicker action to get polluting cars off the road. He said many Asian manufacturers were moving ahead far more quickly to build large numbers of alternative vehicles, while German firms were still building just small numbers.

2018-12-05,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F ighting climate change is one of the best ways to improve health around the world, and the benefits of fewer deaths and hospitalisations would far outweigh the costs of not acting, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Keeping global warming “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F), as governments have pledged to do under the 2015 Paris Agreement, could save about a million lives a year by 2050 through reducing air pollution alone, the U.N agency said. Burning fossil fuels - which emit carbon dioxide, the main culprit for climate change - is a major driver of air pollution, the WHO said in a report issued at U.N. climate talks in Poland. Maria Neira, WHO’s director for public health, said exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year. “This is one of the most outrageous things happening today,” she said. “We want to tell countries: the more you delay this (clean energy) transition, the more you will be responsible for the ... millions of deaths that are recorded every year.” Health gains resulting from action to curb climate change - from adopting renewable energy to getting people out of cars and onto bicycles - would add up to about twice the cost of rolling out those policies globally, and even more in China and India, the WHO said, citing a recent study. WHO scientist and report author Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum said health had often been disconnected from discussions on climate change, but there was now an urgent need to break down the barriers and talk about the benefits for society. “This is the same fight, and we have the same answers,” he added. In the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gases, the cost of air pollution for public health is estimated at more than 4 percent of gross domestic product, the WHO report said. In comparison, keeping warming to the Paris deal temperature limits would require investing about 1 percent of global GDP. Kristie Ebi, professor of global health at the University of Washington, said the world now had scientific evidence that “people today are suffering and dying from climate change”. The consequences range from chronic diseases linked to air pollution, such as asthma and lung cancer, to under-nutrition as crop yields fall and rising carbon dioxide levels in the air slash nutrients in staple foods, she added. Inia Seruiratu, Fiji’s minister of agriculture and disaster management, said his Pacific island nation was already experiencing the effects of climate change on health, such as an increase in water-borne diseases after storms and floods. It is working to build solar-powered health clinics that can also withstand strong winds and other extreme weather, he noted. Despite such efforts, the WHO report said financial support - particularly for small island nations and the poorest countries - remains “woefully inadequate”. Only about 0.5 percent of funds provided by international institutions for measures to adapt to climate change have been allocated to health projects, it added. Money is also lacking for scientific research into the different options for tackling the problem, Ebi said. If countries do not ramp up efforts to protect their people’s health on a warming planet, the battle is likely to end up in the courts, warned WHO’s Neira. That is already happening, lawyers and plaintiffs in climate change legal cases told reporters on the sidelines of the Dec. 2-14 talks in the Polish coal-mining city of Katowice. In Switzerland, for example, a lawsuit has been filed on behalf of about 1,000 elderly women who are challenging the government’s emissions reduction policy on the grounds that they are vulnerable to heatwaves exacerbated by climate change. And in an ongoing court case filed against the U.S. government, health experts have diagnosed plaintiffs with asthma linked to air pollution and emotional trauma caused by climate stresses, group member Vic Barrett, 19, said in Poland. ""It is not just about saving the planet and the glaciers in the future - it is about protecting the health of the people right now,"" said WHO's Neira.

2018-12-05,"(Reuters) - Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise nearly 3 percent this year due to continued fossil fuel use, scientists said on Wednesday, dashing hopes that an increase in 2017 was temporary after two years of slowdown. World emissions grew by 1.6 percent last year and will increase even more this year due to the sustained use of coal, oil and natural gas, an annual report by the Global Carbon Project showed, a group of 76 scientists in 15 countries. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were roughly flat from 2014-16, which led to hopes that emissions had peaked in 2013. The data, presented during talks among around 190 nations in Poland on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accord, are a setback for a global goal of curbing emissions to avert more floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels. The world is on track for a 3-5 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperature this century and if all known fossil fuel resources are used the rise will be even bigger, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization warned last week. “The projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry is 2.7 percent in 2018, but uncertainties persist and growth rates between 1.8-3.7 percent remain possible,” the Global Carbon Project report said. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, cement and industry, which make up the bulk of manmade greenhouse gases, are on track to rise to a record high of around 37.1 billion tonnes this year. CO2 emissions from all human activities, including fossil fuels, industry and land-use change, will reach around 41.5 billion tonnes, the report said. Despite growth in low-carbon technologies, not enough is being done to support policies which limit emissions, said Glen Peters, one of the leaders of the study at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo. “The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015,” he added. Nearly all countries have contributed to the rise in global emissions: either by growth in emissions, or reductions that are slower than expected. China’s emissions are set to rise around 4.7 percent this year, as it is still expected to be reliant on coal over the next decade even though it has been deploying renewable energy, the report said. Due to strong economic growth and continued use of coal. India’s emissions are expected to grow by 6.3 percent this year.  U.S. emissions are seen rising around 2.5 percent this year, after falling 1.2 percent a year since 2007. However, it is expected that U.S. emissions will decline again in 2019 as cheap gas, wind, and solar will continue to displace coal. The European Union should experience a slight decline in emissions of 0.7 percent this year. In the rest of the world, accounting for 42 percent of global emissions, a rise of 1.8 percent is expected. This group is mainly developing countries and the five contributing the most to emissions growth in the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea.

2018-12-05,"(Adds details on Keystone pipeline, Enbridge statement) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Two major pipelines carrying oil from Canada to the United States resumed operations on Wednesday after brief disruptions due to power outages from severe weather in Saskatchewan, Canada, a day earlier. A number of lines on Enbridge Inc’s Mainline system, which carries about 1.2 million barrels per day of crude and other liquids, and TransCanada Corp’s 590,000 bpd Keystone crude pipeline were hit by power outages on Tuesday in the western Canadian province. TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline was operational on Wednesday after it experienced a brief outage due to power disruptions, the company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Enbridge said its mainline system, which includes Lines 1, 2a, 3, 4 and 67, as well as Line 13, are back in service. The province’s primary utility SaskPower restored electricity to pipeline operations there, but Enbridge said intermittent service outages may still occur. Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy oil prices strengthened on news of the restart, dealers said, trading at $23.50 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate benchmark prices. Prices traded at a discount of about $24.50 on Tuesday. Both pipeline systems originate in Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced. The outages came just days after the Alberta government announced forced cuts in crude production. Western Canadian oil producers have struggled to export crude because of full pipelines as production has surged to a record of more than 4.6 million bpd in 2018.

2018-12-05,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change have begun in the Polish city of Katowice, the capital of the Silesian mining district.  The aim is to make an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce global action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. Wednesday 1700 - Delegates say it is tense behind closed doors as developing countries seek assurances that if they make ambitious cuts to their climate emissions, developed countries will deliver on promises to help pay. The Brazilian chief negotiator issued a statement for a second day in a row and urged an inclusive debate which he said had helped to bring about the Paris deal. “Brazil firmly and loudly advocates for transparency on both climate action and financial support,” J. Antonio Marcondes said. “What must be avoided at all costs is developing countries being sidelined or presented with take-it-or-leave-it texts.” 1300 GMT - The Polish official leading U.N. talks to revive the Paris climate deal says his country is committed to greener fuel - even though his own president has vowed not to let anyone “murder coal mining”. Poland’s Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka told Reuters Warsaw was not building any more new coal structures and was looking at new capacities in renewables.  1245 GMT - Rising anxieties about the impact of mining on global warming is just one factor hitting prospects for the sector.  The Polish head of the talks Michal Kurtyka says he received lessons from Laurent Fabius of France, who was dubbed Laurent Fabulous for his success in sealing the Paris accord of 2015. Tuesday Concerns mount that any outcome from the two weeks of talks will lack ambition because of repeated Polish statements that it plans to build more coalmines. Greta Thunberg, 15, who has been refusing to go to school in Sweden in protest at the world’s climate inaction, says Poland and the rest of the world cannot continue digging for coal. “We cannot go down this road of madness any more,” she said. Finance to help poor countries adapt is always a heated debate at U.N. talks. Brazil’s chief negotiator, J. Antonio Marcondes, issued a statement calling on developed nations to deliver on an existing pledge to provide $100 billion a year from 2020 to help poorer countries deal with climate change. “If developed economies put off their climate payments any longer, the Paris agreement temperature goals will slip out of reach, with tragic consequences for people and planet,” he said. Poland and Britain joined forces to press for electric vehicles, a cause close to the heart of the Polish official presiding over the talks Michal Kurtyka - he helped to draw up a government plan to have 1 million electric cars on the roads by 2025. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said “e-mobility” would help “climate quality and air quality”. Critics say that in Poland electric vehicles will largely run on coal-fired power generation and Polish people often still rely on highly polluting old cars imported mainly from Germany. Tuesday marked the first official day of negotiation following the ceremonial gathering of heads of state and government on Monday and the handover of the presidency from Fiji, one of the island states at the sharp end of climate change, to Poland, a land of coal. It is also the day of Saint Barbara, patron saint of miners. A brass band struck up and marched through the streets before joining miners in a central square, wearing gala uniforms and feathered hats rather than their mining helmets.      Monday  Kurtyka tells the conference in his opening address Katowice is the logical setting to agree the rules for a transition away from fossil fuel. Coal and steel are still central to its economy but it has also developed tourism and buildings where exhausted miners formerly slept off their shifts are now elegant restaurants and up-market flats. Kurtyka earlier this year moved from being deputy energy minister to deputy environment minister, in time to bang his gavel at the climate talks. Actor, body-builder and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, told reporters he wished he could have used his fictional film role as The Terminator to end fossil fuels. “I’d like to be a terminator in real life, and be able to travel back in time and to stop all fossil fuels when they were discovered. Just imagine! The biggest evil is fossil fuels,” Schwarzenegger said. Polish President Andrzej Duda told reporters and environmental campaigners Polish coal reserves would last for another 200 years. He said it was Poland’s strategic fuel, guaranteeing energy security and sovereignty and “it would be hard not to use it”. The reality for Poland, though, is coal does not provide all its needs and its imports from Russia, on whom it already depends for oil and gas, have been rising. On the streets, local citizens are long-suffering and often cynical. Zofia Olszanska, 66, retired, wife of a former coal miner, said the climate talks had kept her awake at night because of the endless police sirens accompanying the visiting dignitaries. “Everybody here uses coal or rubbish to heat their homes. In the evening, I can’t open the windows because of the smell. How can they talk about ecology here? There is no ecology here or in Poland,” she said.

2018-12-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The recent nosedive in crude prices came just as shale producers had started delivering healthy returns after years of heavy spending to boost production and market share. The shift has pleased investors who had grown weary of waiting for a payoff while watching the frenetic west Texas shale boom make the United States the world’s top oil producer and a major exporter. The 29 percent drop in U.S. oil prices since October now threatens those improved margins, and sustained prices below $50 could dent the value of shale reserves, which banks use to determine borrowing power. Activity in the largest U.S. oil field could fall 10 to 20 percent next year if prices stay down, said Steven Pruett, chief executive of shale producer Elevation Resources LLC. The price retreat sparked a sell-off of shale firms’ shares and another setback could sour investors on the sector for years. The dynamic leaves shale producers hoping for a rescue in the form of production cuts from The Organization of the Petroleum Producing Countries (OPEC) when it meets on Thursday - and at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pushed OPEC to keep the taps wide open. Although Trump has generally been a boisterous booster of fossil-fuel firms, he has ridiculed the prospect of OPEC production cuts as “ripping off the rest of the world” by artificially inflating consumer fuel prices. In November, Trump praised Saudi Arabia on Twitter for high production that helped push oil prices down about 30 percent to near $50, calling it “like a big Tax Cut.” Such tweets are an “irritant” to a U.S. oil industry trying to solidify its profitable position. Trump’s “leaning on” Saudi Arabia, the most influential OPEC nation, “has had a great effect,” Pruett said. “To me, it’s a lot of meddling,” he said. Trump’s campaign against OPEC cuts comes after he stood by the kingdom and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite U.S. politicians calling for sanctions over the October killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh’s consulate in Istanbul. Prince Salman wants to avoid confrontation with Trump, Saudi watchers say, including over oil production cuts and prices. While shale producers have made strides in recent years at turning profits with lower oil prices, they are nearing a threshold where some would scale back investment, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The reality is a lot of them get scared at $50, and their bankers get scared at $50,” said Flynn. “They want OPEC to make a cut, and they kind of want Donald Trump to stop tweeting about oil.” U.S. oil production will rise 17 percent this year to average daily output of 10.9 million bpd, and hit 12.06 million bpd by mid 2019, according to U.S. government estimates. After years of increasing capital spending, companies including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) plan to freeze or cut those budgets, passing the savings to investors. Even if OPEC pulls back and global prices stabilize at current levels, it may not be enough for shale to regain investor favor, said Bruce Campbell, president of advisers Campbell, Lee & Ross Investment Management Inc. The firm owns Royal Dutch Shell shares because of its strong dividend and balance sheet, but no longer sees a reason to invest in shale. Shale companies can cut costs further, “but it takes 12 to 18 months to roll through the system” and get profits rising again, he said. Without higher crude prices, it will be tough for investors “to find a place to get excited about,” Campbell said. Since the 2014-2016 price war between OPEC and shale producers - when soaring global supply pushed per-barrel prices down into the $20s - west Texas shale drillers have learned to wring profits at prices as low as $38 a barrel, down from about $71 in 2014, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. But breakeven prices in other U.S. fields range from about $43 to $48 per barrel, not far from November’s low. Meanwhile, Middle East producers’ costs are about $11 a barrel in Iraq, less than $17 in Saudi Arabia, and less than $21 in Kuwait, according to Rystad. These countries, however, need much higher prices to finance their state spending. In Saudi Arabia, crude would have to average $85-87 a barrel to cover this year’s state budget, an International Monetary Fund official said. The U.S. industry is still expanding the use of more efficient drilling techniques, and oil majors’ BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N), and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) are expanding shale operations and building pipeline infrastructure to keep production rising. “Shale is a scale business,” said Shawn Reynolds, a portfolio manager at investment firm VanEck. He sees an industry just now poised to move out of its costly development phase and into what Reynolds calls “harvest mode,” pulling profit from past investments. But a continued price decline would threaten recent robust earnings. Last quarter, ConocoPhillips (COP.N) profit rose four-fold over a year earlier aided by cost cuts that “significantly improved our resilience to low prices,” Chief Executive Ryan Lance said during an earnings call last month. Anadarko (APC.N) swung to a profit and said it expects to increase production 10 percent to 14 percent next year, assuming “$50 oil,” said CEO Al Walker. Other producers are counting on a replay of 2016, when OPEC cut output and prices gradually increased. “I’ve been through it before,” Bob Watson, CEO of Texas shale producer Abraxas Petroleum Corp (AXAS.O), said in an interview. He has told his employees not to worry about the price: “It will come back. You just need to keep executing.” Watson, like other large shale companies, used financial derivatives to lock in some of its future production at $56 a barrel, a move that lets it ride out the recent drop barring a sustained change. Non-OPEC oil output will rise by 2.3 million bpd this year while oil demand should grow by a 1.3 million bpd next year, projects the International Energy Agency, which advises major oil consumers on energy policy. That could lead again to a market awash in oil, lowering global prices. OPEC this week must decide whether the global economy will need more oil or less. After months of producing well below the group’s target, group leaders increased production last summer and by October had added nearly 400,000 barrels per day over September. Russia also increased its production by about 460,000 bpd above its cap. “OPEC realizes that in the last downturn, in an effort to grab market share, they got nowhere. They ended up losing market share to some extent,” said Muqsit Ashraf, senior managing director for energy at consultancy Accenture Strategy. One lesson from the last price war is shale can expand production even at prices that hurt OPEC members’ budgets, said Karr Ingham, a Texas oil and gas economist. Companies in the Permian Basin pumped 1.6 million bpd in June 2014 when prices peaked at $107 and output rose to nearly 2 million bpd two years later as prices fell to $26, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “OPEC can wait from now until kingdom come, but they won’t get … a production decline” from the Permian field, Ingham said.

Riyadh wants Moscow to contribute at least 250,000-300,000 bpd to the cut but Russia insists the amount should be only half of that, OPEC and non-OPEC sources said. “It is not easy but we will always work together with our colleagues,” United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told reporters when asked about Russia’s position. A source close to the Russian Energy Ministry said: “No one is eager to cut unless there is an emergency. It is the United States where we are seeing the bulk of the increase in oil output. OPEC and Russia will be very careful about voluntary ‘blood letting’.” Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its strict anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. Crude prices have sunk since October due to global economic weakness and fears of a glut due largely to rising U.S. production. Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal and Ahmad Ghaddar;

2018-12-05,"WARSAW, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Poland’s main gas firm PGNiG said on Wednesday that its gas storage was full ahead of the winter period. Poland consumes around 18 billion cubic metres of gas a year, most of which it buys from Russia’s Gazprom under a long-term deal which expires in 2022. “For this winter we have the underground gas storages full, we have 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) of it,” PGNiG’s Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak told Radio Wnet. Wozniak has often said that PGNiG pays too much for the gas under the Gazprom contract, which Warsaw has said it does not intend to extend. In June a Swedish arbitration court initially ruled that PGNiG can demand a lower price from Russia. Wozniak expects the court’s final ruling at the start of 2019 at the latest. Wozniak, who has also said that gas supplies from Russia have been interrupted in the past, added that he did not expect problems this winter, as “the Russians attempt to make their position reliable in the arbitration case”.

2018-12-05,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China expressed confidence on Wednesday that it can reach a trade deal with the United States, a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump a day after he warned of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences. The remarks, by the Chinese Commerce Ministry, follow a period of relative quiet from Beijing after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. In a brief statement, the ministry said China would try to work quickly to implement specific items already agreed upon, as both sides “actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map”. “We are confident in implementation,” it said, calling the latest bilateral talks “very successful”. Trump, in a post on Twitter, linked Beijing’s silence to  officials’ travels and said he thought Xi had been sincere during their weekend meeting to hammer out progress over trade. “Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!” Trump wrote on Wednesday.  The U.S. president a day earlier had said the ceasefire could be extended but warned tariffs would be back on the table if the talks failed and that he would only accept a “real deal” with China. China’s Foreign Ministry referred specific questions to the Commerce Ministry, which is due to hold its weekly news briefing on Thursday in Beijing. “We hope the two working teams from both sides can, based on the consensus reached between the two countries’ leaders, strengthen consultations, and reach a mutually beneficial agreement soon,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. The mood has quickly soured, however, on scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period, and markets continued to slide on Wednesday in part from confusion over the ceasefire’s lack of detail.  Failure would raise the specter of a major escalation in the trade battle, with fresh U.S. tariff action and Chinese retaliation possibly as early as March. The White House has said China had committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection. Sources told Reuters that Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume buying U.S. crude by March after the Xi-Trump deal reduced the risk of tariffs on those imports. China’s crude oil imports from the U.S. had ground to a halt. Global financial markets sank to one-week lows on Wednesday amid the renewed trade concerns, extending Tuesday’s slide.[MKTS/GLOB] U.S. markets were closed on Wednesday to observe former President George H.W. Bush's death, but the effect of Wall Street's turmoil the previous day was felt in Europe and Asia with the benchmark Shanghai stock index .SSEC closing down 0.6 percent. “Narrow agreements and modest concessions in the ongoing trade dispute will not bridge the wide gulf in their respective economic, political and strategic interests,” Moody’s Investors Service said in a report that predicted U.S.-China relations “will remain contentious”.  Officials from the United States and a number of other major economies have often criticized China for its slow approach to negotiations and not following through on commitments. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the meeting, and U.S. and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails have sometimes differed. “Officials now face the difficult task of fleshing out a deal that is acceptable to the Chinese but also involves significant enough concessions not to be torpedoed by the China hawks in the Trump administration,” Capital Economics said in a note this week, adding that higher tariffs could simply be delayed. A Chinese official told Reuters that officials were “waiting for the leaders to return” before publicizing details. President Xi and his most senior officials are due back in China on Thursday, having visited Panama and Portugal since leaving Argentina. On Wednesday, the Global Times tabloid, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, said the Trump administration’s statements about the deal - including the agreement that China would buy $1.2 trillion in additional U.S. goods - were designed to highlight or even exaggerate facets of the deal that benefited the United States. “It will be a win-win situation if a deal is realized. But if not, more fights and talks will continue alternately for a longer while. Chinese society should maintain a calm attitude,” it said.

2018-12-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Denmark and Britain are the top countries when it comes to implementing measures to fight climate change, although Britain has lagged in phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, a report published by academics said on Wednesday. The report was launched as delegates from more than 190 nations meet in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius this century. Denmark, Britain and Canada have made the most progress in transforming their energy sectors toward meeting the targets, said the report by researchers from Britain’s Imperial College, commissioned by British power generator Drax. “We researched how the world is progressing on uptake of the five key technologies and measures needed to limit climate change to 2 degrees Celsius. This reveals Denmark, UK and Canada to be world leading,” said Imperial’s Iain Staffell. The five technologies are clean power, fossil fuels, electric vehicles, capacity for carbon storage, and energy efficiency of households, buildings and transport. Denmark has decarbonised its electricity sector, moving away from coal, installing renewables and reducing fossil fuel subsidies by 90 percent over the last decade. Britain has invested heavily in offshore wind and plans to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2025. Canada has also installed renewables and is building facilities to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions. The report assessed the climate change measures of 25 major countries, including all of the G7 and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which together represent 80 percent of the world’s population and 73 percent of its carbon emissions. Britain, however, remained the sixth largest subsidiser of fossil fuels among the 25 countries, the report showed, based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) up until 2016. According to the OECD definition of a fossil fuel subsidy - which includes direct expenditures by governments, foregone tax revenues and other concessions - Britain’s fossil fuel support amounted to around 10 billion pounds ($13 billion) a year. Coal has provided two-fifths of the world’s electricity for the past 30 years, barely changing over the last decade as the falling share in most developed countries is being countered by growing electricity demand in coal-reliant Asian countries, the report said.

2018-12-05,"* Companies have signed preliminary agreement * First Gen operates 4 of country’s 5 gas-fired power plants * Other firms also looking to build nation’s 1st LNG import hub MANILA/TOKYO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Philippine power company First Gen Corp and Tokyo Gas Co on Wednesday said they had signed a preliminary agreement to jointly develop a liquefied natural gas import terminal project in the Philippines. Tokyo Gas will take a 20-percent interest in the project, which will be located in First Gen’s LNG complex in Batangas province, south of the capital Manila, the Philippine company said. No further financial details were disclosed. First Gen operates four of the country’s five gas-fired power plants, with total capacity of about 2,000 megawatts, all of them in Batangas. The Philippines is expected to start importing LNG to feed its gas-fired power plants as domestic gas supply from its Malampaya field is set to run out in 2024. State-owned Philippine National Oil Co (PNOC) was seeking a joint-venture partner to build and run an LNG hub in Batangas Bay, but has twice postponed a meeting with potential investors, the last one previously scheduled for Tuesday. First Gen said in August that PNOC had rejected its unsolicited proposal to PNOC to be part of First Gen’s LNG terminal project in Batangas. Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi earlier told Reuters that three different groups - including the First Gen-Tokyo Gas team - had been shortlisted to build and operate the Southeast Asian country’s first LNG import terminal. China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) is also in the running. CNOOC in June signed an agreement to develop an LNG terminal project in the Philippines with fuel retailer Phoenix Petroleum, owned by local businessman Dennis Uy who helped fund President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 election campaign.

2018-12-05,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China by March after the Xi-Trump deal at the G20 meeting reduced the risk of tariffs being imposed on these imports, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.  The sources told Reuters that Unipec - trading arm of state refiner Sinopec (600028.SS) - is looking to import U.S. oil by March 1, which marks the end of a 90-day negotiating period agreed by the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies.  China’s crude oil imports from the United States ground to a halt in October as this year’s trade war between the two countries escalated.  “Chinese buyers who want to buy U.S. crude will rush to import the oil during this window,” a senior executive from Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec said, adding that the oil has to arrive in China before March 1.  “Oil prices are low, so it makes economic sense to store some crude as commercial inventories,” said the executive, who asked not to be named.  Sinopec said it has a policy not to comment on specific trade deals. Unipec did not respond to an email.  Oil prices have slumped by around a third since early October amid an emerging glut, triggering expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will agree to supply cuts at a meeting this week. [O/R]  It was unclear how much oil Unipec - China’s largest crude oil importer - would order from the United States, but one of the sources said the company could lift a record volume of oil in January.  China’s previous record for a month came in January 2018, when it imported about 472,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States, according to Chinese customs data.  Before the trade dispute erupted in mid-2018, China had become the largest importer of U.S. crude. China imported on average 325,000 bpd of U.S. crude in the first nine months of 2018 before imports fell to zero in October, customs data shows.  Although crude oil was not included on Beijing’s import tariff list, Chinese buyers started avoiding U.S. oil from mid-2018.  U.S.-based trade and shipping sources said Unipec is back in the market, looking to buy U.S. crude and book ships for China.  Unipec may have chartered VLCC Manifa to load U.S. oil this month, one of the sources said. Another said the company has provisionally booked a VLCC to load U.S. oil in January and make the 45-50-day voyage to China for $8.4 million.  While China is expected to maximize U.S. oil imports during the 90-day window, the overall outlook for this trade flow in 2019 remained murky.  “Tensions have eased between the two countries but we can’t forecast what will happen after March,” the Sinopec executive said.  “There is a lot of pressure on both sides to reach a mutual agreement in 90 days.” Reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in NEW YORK and Liz Hampton in HOUSTON; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-oil/exclusive-chinas-unipec-to-buy-u-s-oil-after-xi-trump-tariff-truce-idUKL4N1YA20T,05 Dec 2018,"* Unipec imports of U.S. oil could rival record -source

Seen as a benchmark across Asia, Singapore margins for 92 RON gasoline against Brent crude oil GL92-SIN-CRK hit minus $1.44 a barrel on their last close on Tuesday, the lowest level since November 2011. That means margins have slumped 112.5 percent from their 2018 peaks, hit in August. Gasoline, once the preferred fuel of refiners, has come under intense pressure from swelling supply, and despite a one-third plunge in the cost of crude oil - a refinery’s main feedstock - since early October. “The market should brace itself for more outflows from China with the recent release of additional export quotas,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director of Asia Oil at energy consultancy FGE in Singapore. China’s government has released an additional 2 million tonnes of refined fuel export quotas for this year, mostly gasoline and diesel, taking total quotas for 2018 to about 48 million tonnes. In South Korea, another Asian refinery hub, gasoline output and inventories are also high, said Nevyn Nah of energy consulting firm Energy Aspects. Meanwhile, import demand in Vietnam has shrunk because of the start-up of the country’s Nghi Son oil refinery, while output in the Middle East is set to increase, Nah said. The losses from making gasoline are weighing on overall refining profits, now at their lowest levels since August 2016 at just $2.93 a barrel, data in Refinitiv Eikon showed. DUB-SIN-REF Adding to the supply overhang are concerns over an economic slowdown that could soon dent fuel consumption. In an unusual move, China’s state council on Wednesday issued guidance to support employment as the economy slows, saying the country should pay “high attention” to the impact on employment from increasing economic headwinds. Such as slowdown is also visible in the world’s biggest car market, China, where sales of new automobiles are on track for the first annual fall since at least 1990. With supplies continuing to outpace demand growth in the coming months, “there is limited scope for any significant recovery in Singapore,” said FGE’s Sri.

2018-12-05,"PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The French government could change its position regarding a wealth tax, said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, as protests mount over President Emmanuel Macron’s policies. The government has changed aspects of the wealth tax - known in France as the ‘ISF’ - by narrowing it down to lucrative property deals and real estate assets. However, that move had led to criticism that Macron was a “President of the Rich”, since it would have eased the tax burden for many of the country’s wealthiest citizens. On Wednesday, Griveaux told RTL radio the government could re-consider those proposals if it felt the move was not working. “If a measure that we have taken, which is costing the public money, turns out not to be working, if it’s not going well, we’re not stupid - we would change it,” he said. Earlier this week, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe decided to suspend planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent protests, marking the first major U-turn by Macron’s administration in 18 months in office.

Both countries are keen to increase their electricity supplies, with Belgium in particular needing new sources of power with five of its seven ageing nuclear reactors closed for repairs. The 600 million pound Nemo project is being developed by National Grid (NG.L) and Belgian grid operator Elia.  It will enable up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity to flow between the countries, enough to power around one million homes. “Nemo Link is the UK’s first interconnector since 2012, increasing our electricity capacity from these power cables by a quarter and further enhancing security of supply for us and Belgium,” Britain’s business and energy secretary Greg Clark said in a statement issued by National Grid. The British power grid operator said it was investing more than 2 billion pounds in new interconnectors with Europe. It plans to build a 1,400 MW link between Britain and Denmark, a second link with France and another link with Norway. Britain already has power links with France, the Netherlands and Ireland, which bring in around 6 percent of its electricity.

2018-12-05,"MILAN/ROME (Reuters) - Italy plans to offer subsidies of up to 6,000 euros ($6,800) to buyers of new low emission vehicles and will increase taxes on new petrol and diesel cars, two government officials said on Wednesday.  Concerns over climate change are pushing European lawmakers to tighten emissions regulations, but the car industry says that would harm its competitiveness. Italy’s Lower House Budget Committee approved an amendment to the 2019 budget introducing a bonus for people who buy a new electric, hybrid or methane gas-powered car from Jan. 1, 2019.  If approved, the incentives will run until 2021 and total up to 300 million euros a year. Under the same measure, purchases of new cars running on traditional fuels would be subject to a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros based on the level of carbon emissions produced. “It will become more and more attractive to buy less polluting cars,” said Infrastructure Undersecretary Michele Dell’Orco and Industry Undersecretary Davide Crippa in a statement.  Dell’Orco and Crippa are both members of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which is keen to phase out fossil fuels and promote the use of electricity generated from renewable sources.  The Lower House will start discussing the 2019 budget later on Wednesday. Italy is currently locked in a battle with Brussels about its planned deficit spending policies. Electric, hybrid and methane gas-powered cars made up 7 percent of Italy’s car sales last month, according to data provided by foreign car manufacturers association UNRAE. However, Italy’s main car manufacturer Fiat Chrysler does not sell any electric and hybrid cars at present in Europe. The company said last week it planned to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and engines in Italy between 2019-2021, focused on the development of electric and hybrid engines.      The head of Italian car sector’s association ANFIA Paolo Scudieri on Wednesday asked the government not to incentivize sales of electric cars, saying EU lawmakers were negotiating emissions targets which were “unreasonable” in terms of timing and application. Germany said in October it wants carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes to reduce pollution from diesel vehicles. Daimler said it was prepared to participate in the retrofit program and offered incentives of up to 10,000 euros for those swapping old cars for new Mercedes models. BMW also said it would offer a trade-in incentive of 6,000 euros in the most polluted parts of the country.

2018-12-05,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RA2ncj By John Kemp LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil reserves hit record levels at the end of 2017, as annual reserve additions outstripped production for the eighth time in nine years, government data published last week shows. Reserve growth is the main reason predictions about future oil shortages have been repeatedly proved wrong. U.S. policymakers have long fretted about the damage to the economy and national security of exhausting domestic oil reserves (“Oil scarcity ideology in U.S. national security policy”, Stern, 2012). As early as 1909, the U.S. Geological Survey was predicting reserves might be exhausted by 1935 (“Petroleum resources of the United States – Report of the National Conservation Commission”, GPO, 1909). Scarcity concerns became prominent again in the 1940s, the 1970/80s and the 2000s (“Market madness: a century of oil panics, crises and crashes”, Clayton, 2015). Policymakers responded by pressing for more conservation, encouraging the development of overseas reserves, reserving domestic supplies for future military needs, or experimenting with alternatives. But scarcity forecasts have underestimated the impact of improvements in technology, mostly driven by price changes, of which shale extraction has been the most recent and dramatic. And we will have cooked the planet through global warming long before we run out of fossil fuels. “No mineral, including oil, will ever be exhausted,” wrote the late Morris Adelman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“Genie out of the bottle”, 1995). “If and when the cost of finding and extraction goes above the price consumers are willing to pay, the industry will begin to disappear.” And as former Saudi oil minister Zaki Yamani observed in 2000: “Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.” The oil age, too, will end, if and when it is replaced by a superior energy source – just as mainframe computers, buggy whips and typewriters have all been largely superseded. But it won’t end for lack of oil. Proved oil reserves increased by 6.4 billion barrels (19.5 percent) in 2017 compared with the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“U.S. crude oil and natural gas proved reserves”, EIA, Nov. 29). These are estimated volumes of oil that analysis of geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty are recoverable under existing economic and operating conditions. Estimates change in response to new field discoveries, greater understanding of existing fields, technology and changes in prices and costs, as well as the amount produced. U.S. reserves in 2017 amounted to 39 billion barrels of oil, surpassing the previous peak set in 1970, and enough to sustain production at current rates for 11 years, even if no new reserves are added. Texas accounted for half the total increase (+3.3 billion barrels) followed by New Mexico (+1.0 billion), Alaska (+0.4 billion), Colorado (+0.3 billion), California (+0.3 billion) and North Dakota (+0.2 billion). Tight oil or shale plays accounted for 4.4 billion of extra reserves, with the Permian Basin in western Texas and eastern New Mexico (+3.4 billion) and Eagle Ford in Texas (+0.7 billion barrels) accounting for the lion’s share. Producers also added almost 0.8 billion barrels of additional proved reserves in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. oil producers added 5.7 billion barrels to their proved reserves last year as a result of new field discoveries and extensions of reserves within existing fields, the EIA says. They also added another 2.7 billion barrels as a result of changed estimates of what they can produce using existing technology and at current prices and costs, with other adjustments adding 1.8 billion barrels. Reserve additions from all these sources combined comfortably outstripped the 3.4 billion barrels of oil that were actually produced during the year. “Nobody finds a reserve, just as nobody finds a factory,” according to Adelman. Oil reserves are not gifts of nature, they represent the outcome of improvements in technology and heavy investment in exploration and production. “Reserves are renewable and constantly renewed if - and only if - there is enough inducement to invest in creating them. The inducement depends on price and cost,” Adelman wrote. Proved reserves have risen and fallen broadly in line with contemporary production as both have responded to the same price signals (tmsnrt.rs/2RA2ncj). The ratio of proved reserves to contemporary production has been broadly stable at between 9 and 12 years since at least the late 1940s. Most reserve additions have come from within existing fields as drilling leads to better understanding of the extent of the resource, new oil-bearing strata are discovered, and recovery techniques improve. For example, California’s Kern River oilfield was thought to contain just 54 million more barrels of oil in 1942, but actually produced 736 million more by 1986 and was then estimated to have another 970 million remaining. “The field had not changed, but knowledge had: science, technology, and, not least, the detailed geology learned by development”, Adelman wrote. “At any given moment, reserves are being added everywhere … The reserve increments of any given period are overwhelmingly in existing fields,” he explained. “The constant search for least-cost prospects takes the industry to the fringes of known reservoirs and beyond. The search process is driven by cost comparison. “The industry is a great sensing-selection instrument, scanning all deposits, old and new, to develop the cheapest increment or tranche into a reserve.” In this respect, shale has been no different from earlier technological breakthroughs that have led to enormous reserve growth, mostly within existing fields and plays.

U.S. markets are closed to mark former President George H.W. Bush’s death, but the effect of Wall Street’s turmoil in the previous session, when New York-listed shares tumbled more than 3 percent, was felt in Asia and Europe. That pushed MSCI’s all-country index down 0.4 percent. Tuesday’s declines came just a day after an equity surge driven by optimism that China and the United States would sort out their trade dispute. Then President Donald Trump threatened “major tariffs” on Chinese imports if his administration failed to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. “As I look into next year, most expectations for further gains have been pared back. Investors have gone from extended bullishness at the start of the year on equities to an uncomfortable neutrality,” said Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson. Trump’s comments, alongside the drop in U.S. stocks and bond yields, pushed Asian shares outside Japan 1.5 percent lower. Shanghai markets fell 0.6 percent, their losses limited by Chinese officials expressing confidence that a trade deal would be clinched on time. But European losses were trimmed as the session continued, with a pan-European index down 0.75 percent by 1145 GMT compared with falls of over one percent earlier. Global equities have been shaken by fears of a recession, fanned by the flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve — a phenomenon in which longer-dated debt yields fall faster than their shorter-dated counterparts. Such an inversion of two-year and 10-year yields, when 10-year bonds yield less than their two-year debt, has preceded every U.S. recession in the past 50 years. “The market decline in the U.S. overnight and the flattening of the yield curve reflect that economic growth momentum is taking over as the primary concern for investors,” Tai Hui, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management told clients. So far, 10-year yields are clinging to an 11-basis-point margin over the two-year, although it was the smallest one in over a decade. The flattening of the curve gained momentum after last week’s signal by the Federal Reserve that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate-increase cycle. It has spread to the euro zone, where the German 2-10 yield curve hit its flattest since mid-2017 at 85.70 basis points. German 10-year yields slipped to six-month lows of 0.247 percent before rising back to 0.259 percent. Italian bonds extended their rally, with two-year yields falling 10 bps to 4 1/2-month lows after a cabinet official raised hopes that the government could cut nearly four billion euros from its 2019 budget plans. Markets are also bracing for more news on the Brexit front. British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, the start of five days of parliamentary debate over her plans to leave the European Union. The pound rose off 17-month lows of $1.2659 hit on Tuesday to around $1.2780, up 0.3 percent on the day, amid creeping optimism that Britain could opt to stay in the EU after all. Economists at JP Morgan reckon the odds of Britain staying in the EU have increased to 40 percent from 20 percent previously, after the European Court of Justice’s advocate general said Britain should be allowed to unilaterally revoke its departure notice. The dollar has been undermined by the bond market moves and recession fears, but it has recovered from two-week lows against a basket of currencies to trade around 97, 0.10 percent lower on the day. It rose 0.1 percent to 112.9 yen after losing 0.75 percent the previous day against the safe-haven Japanese currency. The threat of slowing economic activity also weighed on oil prices, but Brent futures trimmed losses to stand 0.4 percent lower at $61.8 per barrel. It had earlier fallen more than 1 percent.

2018-12-05,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission published on Wednesday non-binding proposals to boost the role of the euro in international payments and its use as a reserve currency to challenge the dominance of the dollar. The move follows the decision by the United States to withdraw from an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. That has forced many European companies to stop trading with Iran to avoid U.S. sanctions.   The European Commission called on companies and states to increase their use of the euro in energy contracts. It said it would study possible measures to promote the European Union  currency in financial and commodity markets. “The decision to use a currency is ultimately made by market participants,” the Commission acknowledged. The most effective way to widen the euro’s international role was to overhaul the 19-country currency union and adopt financial reforms that have been blocked for years by conflicting national interests.   In the 20 years since its adoption, the euro’s international role reached its peak at the beginning of the last decade. Its use dropped during the 2007-08 financial crisis.  The euro has not recovered since, and the dollar remains the currency most used in the world. Sixty percent of sovereign debt issuance and global foreign exchange reserves are in dollars. The euro is the second global currency, but its share of each market is just 20 percent. The Commission admitted the dollar dominance was due to higher liquidity, lower transaction costs and its use as a benchmark in commodities and derivatives markets - prerogatives that can hardly be challenged in the short term. But it argued that a stronger euro would be positive not only for Europe but also for the wider world, which “would help improve the resilience of the international financial system.” “More than promotion, you need reforms, stability and convincing investors,” a senior central banker said, airing widespread doubts at the European Central Bank, the body in charge of the euro, over the Commission plan. However, recent trade conflicts and the use of the dollar as an instrument to force sanctions on Iran have raised concern in other countries about the dollar. That could contribute to a stronger role of the euro, EU officials admit. The Commission pushed for strengthening the euro’s role in international payments, where it holds a global share similar to the dollar, more than 35 percent.  The EU is the world’s largest energy importer with an average import bill of 300 billion euros ($340 billion), the Commission said, urging EU states to switch to a default use of the euro in future energy international agreements. It said it would also consider moves to increase the use of the euro by aircraft manufacturers, such as France-based Airbus, and in commodities markets.  In the financial sector, the EU executive said it could propose extending the scope of derivative contracts that have to go through clearing houses in a bid to expand the market in euro-denominated financial products. It said it would also explore measures to facilitate an ECB plan for a European instant payment system, which could challenge the dominance of U.S. payment cards and the emerging financial role of U.S. digital giants in payment services. The plan was proposed by the ECB last week, but so far only eight mostly medium- or small-sized banks from Spain, Germany and France have signed up.

2018-12-05,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - The Polish official leading U.N. talks to revive the Paris climate deal said his country is committed to greener fuel even though his president has vowed not to let anyone “murder coal mining”. On Tuesday, the first full day of negotiations in Katowice, capital of mining region Silesia, President Andrzej Duda told workers celebrating the feast of their patron Saint Barbara that the industry had a long future. The comments sent shock-waves through two-week U.N. talks Poland is hosting to agree rules for implementing the 2015 Paris accord to phase out fossil fuel. Poland’s Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka told Reuters he is working towards an ambitious deal that respects “the letter and the spirit” of Paris and said it was the energy ministry, not the president, who set policy. “Poland is not building any more new coal structures. It’s a very powerful engagement,” he said in the interview. “New additional capacities are being built in the renewables sector.” Poland, which relies on coal for around 80 percent of its power and more than 82,000 mining jobs, is an unlikely host for U.N. climate talks, but Kurtyka said the country was eager to share with the rest of the world its capacity for transition. Over the last 30 years, the former communist-run nation has shifted from a centrally-controlled economy, which the official said was not a good system for humans or the environment. Now, as the presidency of climate talks, he said Poland was seeking “a just transition” to a greener world. Those comments may allay concern over Duda’s speech on Tuesday where he declared to miners: “Please don’t be worried. As long as I’m president of Poland, I won’t let anyone murder coal-mining.”  Together with Britain, Poland on Tuesday launched an initiative to promote electric vehicles, which Kurtyka said would be less polluting than conventional engines even if they were powered by coal-fired electricity. Trained as an engineer, Kurtyka said electric vehicles were more efficient than internal combustion engines, which generate waste heat and pollution. Nearly 40 countries had signed up to the initiative on knowledge sharing, he said, and for Poland electric mobility could help the country generate jobs to replace mining. Campaigners are highly critical of the pace of change as evidence mounts of the growing gap between the need to cut emissions and the work done so far. This week’s U.N. talks are technical negotiations ahead of ministerial debate next week. Kurtyka said challenges included sharing the burden between developed and developing nations of the cost of moving to a low-carbon world. But political will was strong to deliver on the 2015 Paris agreement and climate concern could override national agendas, even in politically divided times, he added. “I think it is considered very much as a unique achievement of humanity,” he said of the Paris agreement. “It is in their hands. It is in the parties’ hands to reach a consensus,” he said, referring to the nearly 200 nations involved, adding:  “I am very reassured. Everybody’s willing to progress.”     Reporting by Barbara Lewis; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-accord-presidency/u-n-talks-leader-sees-greener-future-for-coal-dependent-poland-idUKL8N1Y969V,05 Dec 2018,"The Polish official

2018-12-05,"NEW YORK/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Two major pipelines carrying oil from Canada to the United States were hit by weather-related disruptions on Tuesday, the latest hit to Canada’s oil industry just days after the Alberta government announced forced cuts in crude production. A number of lines on the Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) Mainline system, which carries crude and other liquids, were hit by power outages in the Western Canadian province of Saskatchewan due to severe weather, the company said Tuesday.  TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) 590,000 barrel-per-day crude Keystone pipeline was also shut due to the outage, according to a shipper on the line and traders. There was no estimated restart timeline for the line, one source said, citing a notice to shippers. The company did not respond to a request for comment. The outages, though temporary, are just the latest constraints to hit Western Canadian oil producers already struggling to export crude due to full pipelines as production has surged to a record at more than 4.6 million barrels a day in 2018.  Both systems originate in Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced. Enbridge, for its part, said it will remain in contact with SaskPower, that province’s primary utility, through the night “to evaluate the possibility of starting the lines earlier.” The Mainline system ships about 1.2 million bpd.  The Alberta government on Sunday imposed mandatory output cuts of 8.7 percent, or 325,000 bpd, until excess crude in storage is drawn down. The cuts will begin in January.   Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy oil prices weakened on the news, dealers said, closing at $29.25 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate CLc1 benchmark prices. In October, that discount hit a record of $52 below U.S. prices, but had narrowed to a $19 discount on Monday after the production cuts were announced.  Traders said they expect the outages to be brief.  “If the lines are not up tomorrow, I’m sure folks will start to get nervous,” one shipper on the lines said. TransCanada’s Keystone line runs to Steele City, Nebraska and from there to other U.S. markets. Decreased power consumption on that line was observed at about 9:30 a.m. EST (1430 GMT), according to market intelligence firm Genscape.      Enbridge said its lines 1, 2a, 3, 4, 13 and 67 would be shut through the night, as SaskPower anticipates power will remain down until at least until Wednesday morning.

Global equities have been shaken as a flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve fans worries about a recession, and on growing doubts that Washington and Beijing will be able to clinch a substantive trade deal during a temporary cease-fire agreed at the weekend.

Trump threatened on Tuesday to place “major tariffs” on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. As doubts grew over whether the two sides can resolve their differences, China said on Wednesday it was confident that it can clinch a trade deal with Washington within the 90-day negotiating window that the two sides agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh U.S. tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March.

2018-12-05,"SINGAPORE, Dec 5 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices slipped by 1 percent early on Wednesday, weighed down by a plunge in global stock markets amid concerns over an economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.71 per barrel at 0057 GMT, down 54 cents, or 1 percent, from their last close. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. The slide in U.S. oil followed a tumble in global stock markets on Tuesday, with investors worried about the threat of a widespread economic slowdown. Key to the global economic outlook will be whether the United States and China can resolve their trade disputes. Washington and Beijing announced a 90-day truce last weekend, during which neither side will further increase punitive import tariffs. But U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Tuesday to place “major tariffs” on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration didn’t reach a desirable deal with Beijing. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in its 2019 economic outlook, published on Tuesday, that “most major economies are likely to see decelerating activity”, although it added that “a steady stream of monetary and fiscal stimulus measures” was expected to stem the slowdown. The bank said it expected Brent and WTI prices to average $70 and $59 per barrel respectively in 2019. Brent and WTI have averaged $72.80 and $66.10 per barrel so far this year.

2018-12-05,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipper, aims to be carbon neutral by 2050, in a challenge to the rest of the world’s fossil fuel-dependent fleet. Denmark’s Maersk said on Wednesday it aimed to have carbon neutral vessels commercially viable by 2030 by using energy sources such as biofuels and would cut its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The shipping industry, which carries around 80 percent of global trade, accounts for 2.2 percent of CO2 emissions, the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) says. But along with aviation, it avoided specific emissions-cutting targets in a 2015 global climate pact which aims to limit a global average rise in temperature. However, the United Nations shipping agency reached an agreement in April to cut CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 compared with 2008 levels.  Delegates from more than 190 nations are meeting in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the Paris Accord to keep the rise in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius this century. “The only possible way to achieve the so-much-needed decarbonisation in our industry is by fully transforming to new carbon neutral fuels and supply chains,” Maersk’s Chief Operating Officer Soren Toft in a statement. Given the 20-25 years lifetime of a vessel, the industry would now have to start developing new types of ships that will be crossing the seas in 2050, Maersk said. Last year, Maersk’s greenhouse gas emissions amounted to almost 35.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, mostly from its container business, Maersk’s sustainability report shows. Maersk said CO2 emissions per container had been reduced by 46 percent since 2007.

2018-12-05,"(Adds pix, TV) By Olesya Astakhova and Shadia Nasralla VIENNA, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is seeking to persuade Russia on Wednesday to cut oil production substantially with OPEC next year in an attempt to arrest a decline in the price of crude and prevent another global glut. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was due later in the day to meet his Saudi counterpart Khalid al-Falih, whose country leads the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC holds policy talks on Thursday in Vienna, followed by a gathering with allies including Russia on Friday. Saudi Arabia has indicated it wants OPEC and its allies to cut output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, or 1.3 percent of global production. Riyadh wants Moscow to contribute at least 250,000-300,000 bpd to the cut but Russia insists the amount should be only half of that, OPEC and non-OPEC sources said. “It is not easy but we will always work together with our colleagues,” United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told reporters when asked about Russia’s position. A source close to the Russian Energy Ministry said: “No one is eager to cut unless there is an emergency. It is the United States where we are seeing the bulk of the increase in oil output. OPEC and Russia will be very careful about voluntary ‘blood letting’.” Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its strict anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. Crude prices have sunk since October due to global economic weakness and fears of a glut due largely to rising U.S. production. Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal and Ahmad Ghaddar;

2018-12-05,"WARSAW, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Poland’s main gas firm PGNiG said on Wednesday that its gas storage was full ahead of the winter period. Poland consumes around 18 billion cubic metres of gas a year, most of which it buys from Russia’s Gazprom under a long-term deal which expires in 2022. “For this winter we have the underground gas storages full, we have 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) of it,” PGNiG’s Chief Executive Piotr Wozniak told Radio Wnet. Wozniak has often said that PGNiG pays too much for the gas under the Gazprom contract, which Warsaw has said it does not intend to extend. In June a Swedish arbitration court initially ruled that PGNiG can demand a lower price from Russia. Wozniak expects the court’s final ruling at the start of 2019 at the latest. Wozniak, who has also said that gas supplies from Russia have been interrupted in the past, added that he did not expect problems this winter, as “the Russians attempt to make their position reliable in the arbitration case”.

2018-12-05,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China expressed confidence on Wednesday that it can reach a trade deal with the United States, a sentiment echoed by U.S. President Donald Trump a day after he warned of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences. The remarks, by the Chinese Commerce Ministry, follow a period of relative quiet from Beijing after Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping reached a temporary truce in their trade war at a meeting over dinner in Argentina on Saturday. In a brief statement, the ministry said China would try to work quickly to implement specific items already agreed upon, as both sides “actively promote the work of negotiations within 90 days in accordance with a clear timetable and road map”. “We are confident in implementation,” it said, calling the latest bilateral talks “very successful”. Trump, in a post on Twitter, linked Beijing’s silence to  officials’ travels and said he thought Xi had been sincere during their weekend meeting to hammer out progress over trade. “Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!” Trump wrote on Wednesday.  The U.S. president a day earlier had said the ceasefire could be extended but warned tariffs would be back on the table if the talks failed and that he would only accept a “real deal” with China. China’s Foreign Ministry referred specific questions to the Commerce Ministry, which is due to hold its weekly news briefing on Thursday in Beijing. “We hope the two working teams from both sides can, based on the consensus reached between the two countries’ leaders, strengthen consultations, and reach a mutually beneficial agreement soon,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters. The threat of further escalation in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies has loomed large over financial markets and the global economy for much of the year, and investors initially greeted the ceasefire with relief. The mood has quickly soured, however, on scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal on a host of highly divisive issues within the 90-day negotiating period, and markets continued to slide on Wednesday in part from confusion over the ceasefire’s lack of detail.  Failure would raise the specter of a major escalation in the trade battle, with fresh U.S. tariff action and Chinese retaliation possibly as early as March. The White House has said China had committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection. Sources told Reuters that Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume buying U.S. crude by March after the Xi-Trump deal reduced the risk of tariffs on those imports. China’s crude oil imports from the U.S. had ground to a halt. Global financial markets sank to one-week lows on Wednesday amid the renewed trade concerns, extending Tuesday’s slide.[MKTS/GLOB] U.S. markets were closed on Wednesday to observe former President George H.W. Bush's death, but the effect of Wall Street's turmoil the previous day was felt in Europe and Asia with the benchmark Shanghai stock index .SSEC closing down 0.6 percent. “Narrow agreements and modest concessions in the ongoing trade dispute will not bridge the wide gulf in their respective economic, political and strategic interests,” Moody’s Investors Service said in a report that predicted U.S.-China relations “will remain contentious”.  Officials from the United States and a number of other major economies have often criticized China for its slow approach to negotiations and not following through on commitments. China has said comparatively little about the Trump-Xi agreement after senior Chinese officials briefed the media following the meeting, and U.S. and Chinese accounts of what the deal entails have sometimes differed. “Officials now face the difficult task of fleshing out a deal that is acceptable to the Chinese but also involves significant enough concessions not to be torpedoed by the China hawks in the Trump administration,” Capital Economics said in a note this week, adding that higher tariffs could simply be delayed. A Chinese official told Reuters that officials were “waiting for the leaders to return” before publicizing details. President Xi and his most senior officials are due back in China on Thursday, having visited Panama and Portugal since leaving Argentina. On Wednesday, the Global Times tabloid, which is run by the Chinese Communist Party’s main newspaper, said the Trump administration’s statements about the deal - including the agreement that China would buy $1.2 trillion in additional U.S. goods - were designed to highlight or even exaggerate facets of the deal that benefited the United States. “It will be a win-win situation if a deal is realized. But if not, more fights and talks will continue alternately for a longer while. Chinese society should maintain a calm attitude,” it said.

2018-12-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Denmark and Britain are the top countries when it comes to implementing measures to fight climate change, although Britain has lagged in phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, a report published by academics said on Wednesday. The report was launched as delegates from more than 190 nations meet in Poland to flesh out how to reach commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement to keep the rise in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius this century. Denmark, Britain and Canada have made the most progress in transforming their energy sectors toward meeting the targets, said the report by researchers from Britain’s Imperial College, commissioned by British power generator Drax. “We researched how the world is progressing on uptake of the five key technologies and measures needed to limit climate change to 2 degrees Celsius. This reveals Denmark, UK and Canada to be world leading,” said Imperial’s Iain Staffell. The five technologies are clean power, fossil fuels, electric vehicles, capacity for carbon storage, and energy efficiency of households, buildings and transport. Denmark has decarbonised its electricity sector, moving away from coal, installing renewables and reducing fossil fuel subsidies by 90 percent over the last decade. Britain has invested heavily in offshore wind and plans to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2025. Canada has also installed renewables and is building facilities to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions. The report assessed the climate change measures of 25 major countries, including all of the G7 and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), which together represent 80 percent of the world’s population and 73 percent of its carbon emissions. Britain, however, remained the sixth largest subsidiser of fossil fuels among the 25 countries, the report showed, based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) up until 2016. According to the OECD definition of a fossil fuel subsidy - which includes direct expenditures by governments, foregone tax revenues and other concessions - Britain’s fossil fuel support amounted to around 10 billion pounds ($13 billion) a year. Coal has provided two-fifths of the world’s electricity for the past 30 years, barely changing over the last decade as the falling share in most developed countries is being countered by growing electricity demand in coal-reliant Asian countries, the report said.

2018-12-05,"* Companies have signed preliminary agreement * First Gen operates 4 of country’s 5 gas-fired power plants * Other firms also looking to build nation’s 1st LNG import hub MANILA/TOKYO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Philippine power company First Gen Corp and Tokyo Gas Co on Wednesday said they had signed a preliminary agreement to jointly develop a liquefied natural gas import terminal project in the Philippines. Tokyo Gas will take a 20-percent interest in the project, which will be located in First Gen’s LNG complex in Batangas province, south of the capital Manila, the Philippine company said. No further financial details were disclosed. First Gen operates four of the country’s five gas-fired power plants, with total capacity of about 2,000 megawatts, all of them in Batangas. The Philippines is expected to start importing LNG to feed its gas-fired power plants as domestic gas supply from its Malampaya field is set to run out in 2024. State-owned Philippine National Oil Co (PNOC) was seeking a joint-venture partner to build and run an LNG hub in Batangas Bay, but has twice postponed a meeting with potential investors, the last one previously scheduled for Tuesday. First Gen said in August that PNOC had rejected its unsolicited proposal to PNOC to be part of First Gen’s LNG terminal project in Batangas. Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi earlier told Reuters that three different groups - including the First Gen-Tokyo Gas team - had been shortlisted to build and operate the Southeast Asian country’s first LNG import terminal. China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) is also in the running. CNOOC in June signed an agreement to develop an LNG terminal project in the Philippines with fuel retailer Phoenix Petroleum, owned by local businessman Dennis Uy who helped fund President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 election campaign.

2018-12-05,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China by March after the Xi-Trump deal at the G20 meeting reduced the risk of tariffs being imposed on these imports, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.  The sources told Reuters that Unipec - trading arm of state refiner Sinopec (600028.SS) - is looking to import U.S. oil by March 1, which marks the end of a 90-day negotiating period agreed by the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies.  China’s crude oil imports from the United States ground to a halt in October as this year’s trade war between the two countries escalated.  “Chinese buyers who want to buy U.S. crude will rush to import the oil during this window,” a senior executive from Asia’s largest refiner Sinopec said, adding that the oil has to arrive in China before March 1.  “Oil prices are low, so it makes economic sense to store some crude as commercial inventories,” said the executive, who asked not to be named.  Sinopec said it has a policy not to comment on specific trade deals. Unipec did not respond to an email.  Oil prices have slumped by around a third since early October amid an emerging glut, triggering expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will agree to supply cuts at a meeting this week. [O/R]  It was unclear how much oil Unipec - China’s largest crude oil importer - would order from the United States, but one of the sources said the company could lift a record volume of oil in January.  China’s previous record for a month came in January 2018, when it imported about 472,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States, according to Chinese customs data.  Before the trade dispute erupted in mid-2018, China had become the largest importer of U.S. crude. China imported on average 325,000 bpd of U.S. crude in the first nine months of 2018 before imports fell to zero in October, customs data shows.  Although crude oil was not included on Beijing’s import tariff list, Chinese buyers started avoiding U.S. oil from mid-2018.  U.S.-based trade and shipping sources said Unipec is back in the market, looking to buy U.S. crude and book ships for China.  Unipec may have chartered VLCC Manifa to load U.S. oil this month, one of the sources said. Another said the company has provisionally booked a VLCC to load U.S. oil in January and make the 45-50-day voyage to China for $8.4 million.  While China is expected to maximize U.S. oil imports during the 90-day window, the overall outlook for this trade flow in 2019 remained murky.  “Tensions have eased between the two countries but we can’t forecast what will happen after March,” the Sinopec executive said.  “There is a lot of pressure on both sides to reach a mutual agreement in 90 days.” Reporting by Meng Meng in BEIJING and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in NEW YORK and Liz Hampton in HOUSTON; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-oil/exclusive-chinas-unipec-to-buy-u-s-oil-after-xi-trump-tariff-truce-idUKL4N1YA20T,05 Dec 2018,"* Unipec imports of U.S. oil could rival record -source

Seen as a benchmark across Asia, Singapore margins for 92 RON gasoline against Brent crude oil GL92-SIN-CRK hit minus $1.44 a barrel on their last close on Tuesday, the lowest level since November 2011. That means margins have slumped 112.5 percent from their 2018 peaks, hit in August. Gasoline, once the preferred fuel of refiners, has come under intense pressure from swelling supply, and despite a one-third plunge in the cost of crude oil - a refinery’s main feedstock - since early October. “The market should brace itself for more outflows from China with the recent release of additional export quotas,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director of Asia Oil at energy consultancy FGE in Singapore. China’s government has released an additional 2 million tonnes of refined fuel export quotas for this year, mostly gasoline and diesel, taking total quotas for 2018 to about 48 million tonnes. In South Korea, another Asian refinery hub, gasoline output and inventories are also high, said Nevyn Nah of energy consulting firm Energy Aspects. Meanwhile, import demand in Vietnam has shrunk because of the start-up of the country’s Nghi Son oil refinery, while output in the Middle East is set to increase, Nah said. The losses from making gasoline are weighing on overall refining profits, now at their lowest levels since August 2016 at just $2.93 a barrel, data in Refinitiv Eikon showed. DUB-SIN-REF Adding to the supply overhang are concerns over an economic slowdown that could soon dent fuel consumption. In an unusual move, China’s state council on Wednesday issued guidance to support employment as the economy slows, saying the country should pay “high attention” to the impact on employment from increasing economic headwinds. Such as slowdown is also visible in the world’s biggest car market, China, where sales of new automobiles are on track for the first annual fall since at least 1990. With supplies continuing to outpace demand growth in the coming months, “there is limited scope for any significant recovery in Singapore,” said FGE’s Sri.

2018-12-05,"PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The French government could change its position regarding a wealth tax, said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, as protests mount over President Emmanuel Macron’s policies. The government has changed aspects of the wealth tax - known in France as the ‘ISF’ - by narrowing it down to lucrative property deals and real estate assets. However, that move had led to criticism that Macron was a “President of the Rich”, since it would have eased the tax burden for many of the country’s wealthiest citizens. On Wednesday, Griveaux told RTL radio the government could re-consider those proposals if it felt the move was not working. “If a measure that we have taken, which is costing the public money, turns out not to be working, if it’s not going well, we’re not stupid - we would change it,” he said. Earlier this week, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe decided to suspend planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent protests, marking the first major U-turn by Macron’s administration in 18 months in office.

2018-12-05,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German solar battery maker Sonnen has won approval to join the lucrative market for keeping the country’s power network in balance, giving a boost to its drive to reach profitability.  Jean-Baptiste Cornefert, head of Sonnen’s eServices retail unit, told Reuters it had been accepted by Germany’s biggest power grid firm TenneT to join the so-called balancing market, in which companies compete in auctions to either deliver power or take it into storage to keep the system balanced.   Sonnen will start bidding in so-called primary balancing power auctions from next week by pooling the power generation and storage of its thousands of small customers, he said.  “For the first time, a big network of home storage systems becomes a protagonist in the energy market,” Cornefert said. The move will put Sonnen in competition with 25 German power firms, including big players RWE and Uniper.  Sonnen, which secured 60 million euros ($71 million) in May from Shell Ventures and existing shareholders to expand at home and abroad, has sold around 30,000 battery storage systems to German households with rooftop solar panels. While its customers typically consume 70 percent of the power they produce themselves, the batteries help them store power for later use, release it to the public grid, or share it with other Sonnen community members in an online network. Joining the balancing market provides another option, with the company set to offer 1 megawatt (MW) blocks of flexible production or storage, up to a maximum 100 MW, it said.  That only equates to a small fossil-fuel power plant, but has potential to expand as storage becomes cheaper and generation becomes less centralized.  Germany has 1.5 million solar systems whose subsidized sales tariffs are due to be phased out in the coming years. Providing balancing power is becoming more important. As more variable renewable power capacity is built in Germany’s drive to become a lower-carbon economy, drops or surges in grid frequencies are becoming faster and more intense. Grid frequencies must not deviate too far from around 50 Hertz to keep flows on power transmission lines intact. Control measures taken by grid managers entail adjustments within 30 seconds, currently earning operators potentially around 100,000-150,000 euros per MW per year. Cornefert said Sonnen might pay back earnings from the balancing market to customers in the form of entitlements to free power.

2018-12-05,"MELBOURNE, Dec 5 (Reuters) - A South Korea-based company has proposed building a terminal on Australia’s east coast to import liquefied natural gas, the fifth proposal for such a project in the world’s No.2 LNG exporter. The proposals have come after three new LNG export plants on the east coast have sucked gas out of the southeastern market and nearly tripled wholesale gas prices in places such as Sydney over the past two years. EPIK, a newly-formed LNG floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) project development company, on Wednesday said it had signed an agreement with the Port of Newcastle to do preliminary work on a proposed FSRU that it estimated would cost up to $430 million, including onshore infrastructure. “We are confident that by importing LNG via a new, low-cost FSRU terminal, we will be able to provide an infrastructure solution that is capable of delivering a cost-efficient source of alternative gas supplies to the region,” EPIK Managing Director Jee Yoon said in a statement. Port of Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export terminal, said the plan was in line with its own efforts to diversify. The port faces the long-term decline of coal exports due to the global drive to cut carbon emissions. “Port of Newcastle is uniquely placed as a deepwater port with enviable land and channel capacity,” said the port’s spokesman, Sam Collyer. EPIK’s spokesman, based in Houston, declined to say where the financing for Newcastle LNG would come from. The $400 million to $430 million cost is well above estimates for four other proposed LNG import projects - one in New South Wales, two in the state of Victoria and one in South Australia. Those projects aim to start importing LNG around 2020 or 2021, despite a report by the Australian government’s commodities forecaster in July saying the economics might not work as it might be difficult to find cheap LNG beyond 2022. Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said there was not enough of a market for all five projects to go ahead. Reporting by Sonali Paul;

2018-12-05,"(Adds chief economic minister comments) By Bernadette Christina Munthe JAKARTA, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia has eased rules on palm oil levies and derivative products following a drop in prices, according to a finance ministry regulation on a government website on Wednesday, an effort to make the nation’s palm oil exports more competitive. The world’s top exporter of palm oil will not collect levies from palm exporters when prices are below a threshold of $570 per tonne, but will charge $10-$25 a tonne once prices are in a range of $570-$619 per tonne. The levy will rise to $20-$50 when prices hit above $619 per tonne. Under the previous rules for levies, exporters paid $20-$50 per tonne regardless of palm price levels. The government expects that by lowering the levies, Indonesian exporters can set more competitive prices for palm oil shipments, and that in turn will help local palm farmers. Indonesia also imposes export taxes on crude palm oil when the reference price is above $750 per tonne. The rules on the export taxes remain unchanged. The details of the new regulation were different from those announced last week. Darmin Nasution, coordinating minister for economic affairs, earlier said the zero levy is implemented when prices are below $500 per tonne. Asked on Wednesday about the difference in price thresholds, Nasution said it was due to the adoption of the trade ministry’s reference price for the regulation. The government will use the trade ministry’s monthly reference price in deciding the levy, according to the regulation signed on Dec. 4. The monthly reference price is set based on palm prices in Indonesia, Malaysia and Rotterdam. Nasution said higher crude palm oil prices in Rotterdam means the government has to increase the floor price for exports to be imposed with levies. The trade ministry’s reference price for December stood at $549.37 per tonne. In comparison, palm oil benchmark contracts in Kuala Lumpur were trading around 2,000 ringgit ($481.23) per tonne on Wednesday. Indonesia collects levies from palm exporters to help finance the development of its palm-based biodiesel programme and fund replanting. Nasution said last week, a rapid drop in palm prices has made it “urgent” for the government to take action, especially to help palm farmers. The palm benchmark in Malaysia hit its lowest since August 2015 last week, as stocks of the vegetable oil continue to remain elevated amid soft global demands. “This is a good move (for Indonesia) but bad for Malaysia as we need to compete with them,” said David Ng, derivatives specialist at Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur. “Indonesian crude palm oil is now priced more competitively,” he said. $1 = 4.1560 ringgit

2018-12-05,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 1.5 pct, Nikkei drops 0.5 pct * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open lower * Asia hit as Wall St tumbles on trade woes, growth concerns * Oil falls as trade woes stoke demand concerns By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slid across the board on Wednesday, dragged down by Wall Street’s tumble as sharp declines in long-term U.S. Treasury yields and resurgent trade concerns stoked investor worries about global economic growth. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE losing 0.9 percent, Germany’s DAX falling 1.2 percent and France’s CAC retreating 1 percent. Global equities have been shaken as a flattening U.S. Treasury yield curve fans worries about a recession, and on growing doubts that Washington and Beijing will be able to clinch a substantive trade deal during a temporary cease-fire agreed at the weekend. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.5 percent. Australian stocks lost 0.8 percent, pressured by global losses. The mood further soured after data showed Australia’s third-quarter growth fell short of expectations. The Australian dollar was down 0.7 percent at $0.7288. The Dow retreated 3.1 percent and the Nasdaq sank 3.8 percent on Tuesday. U.S. financial shares, which are particularly sensitive to bond market swings, dropped 4.4 percent. Following Wall Street’s overnight tumble, S&P e-mini futures nudged up 0.3 percent in Asian trade on Wednesday. Signals from the Federal Reserve last week that it may be nearing an end to its three-year rate hike cycle has pushed the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to three-month lows below 3 percent. Concerns about slowing U.S. growth have accelerated the flattening of the yield curve, a phenomenon in which longer-dated debt yields fall faster than their shorter-dated counterparts. The spread between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yields was at its flattest level in more than a decade and edging closer to an inversion, when long rates fall below short rates. “The market decline in the U.S. overnight and the flattening of the yield curve reflect that economic growth momentum is taking over as the primary concern for investors, even as the latest ISM manufacturing data is holding up well,” wrote Tai Hui, market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. A flatter curve is seen as an indicator of a slowing economy, with lower longer-dated yields suggesting that the markets see economic weakness ahead. According to the Cleveland Federal Reserve, an inverted yield curve has preceded the last seven U.S. recessions. It is not a sure indicator, however, with an inversion in 1966 and a very flat curve in 1998 failing to lead to recessions. “The U.S. economy is likely to be able to withstand another rate hike or two, therefore, the flattening of the Treasury curve looks a little over done. That said, it is true that the economic outlook is murkier than before,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “There is also Brexit to keep an eye on, and this is a factor in the ongoing risk aversion.” British Prime Minister Theresa May suffered embarrassing defeats on Tuesday at the start of five days of debate over her plans to leave the European Union that could determine the future of Brexit and the fate of her government. Risk markets were also weighed down as optimism faded over a truce made over the weekend between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump threatened on Tuesday to place “major tariffs” on Chinese goods imported into the United States if his administration is unable to reach an effective trade deal with Beijing. As doubts grew over whether the two sides can resolve their differences, China said on Wednesday it was confident that it can clinch a trade deal with Washington within the 90-day negotiating window that the two sides agreed. Failure would raise the spectre of fresh U.S. tariff action and potential Chinese retaliation as early as March. The U.S. currency bounced modestly after slipping the previous day on lower Treasury yields. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.2 percent higher at 97.144 after stooping to a near two-week low of 96.379 overnight. The greenback rose 0.25 percent to 113.06 yen after losing 0.75 percent the previous day against the safe-haven Japanese currency. The pound was down 0.5 percent at $1.2685 having touched a 17-month low of $1.2659 overnight, rattled by Brexit setbacks in parliament. Oil prices fell, weighed down by swelling U.S. inventories and concerns that slowing economic activity will sap demand for commodities. U.S. crude futures were down 1.65 percent at $52.37 per barrel and Brent shed 1.75 percent to $61.00 per barrel.
