2018-07-22,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday cautioned U.S. President Donald Trump about pursuing hostile policies against Tehran, saying “war with Iran is the mother of all wars”, but did not rule out peace between the two countries. Iran faces increased U.S. pressure and looming sanctions  after Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a 2015 international deal over Iran’s nuclear programme. Addressing a gathering of Iranian diplomats, Rouhani said: “Mr Trump, don’t play with the lion’s tail, this would only lead to regret,” the state new agency IRNA reported.  “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,” Rouhani said, leaving open the possibility of peace between the two countries, at odds since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “You are not in a position to incite the Iranian nation against Iran’s security and interests,” Rouhani said, in an apparent reference to reported efforts by Washington to destabilise Iran’s Islamic government. In Washington, U.S. officials familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Trump administration had launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest and help pressure Iran to end its nuclear programme and its support of militant groups. Current and former U.S. officials said the campaign painted Iranian leaders in a harsh light, at times using information that is exaggerated or contradicts other official pronouncements, including comments by previous administrations.  Rouhani scoffed at Trump’s threat to halt Iranian oil exports and said Iran has a dominant position in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping waterway. “Anyone who understands the rudiments of politics doesn’t say ‘we will stop Iran’s oil exports’...we have been the guarantor of the regional waterway’s security throughout history,” Rouhani said, cited by the semi-official ISNA news agency.  Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday backed Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran may block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are halted.  Rouhani’s apparent threat earlier this month to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries came in reaction to efforts by Washington to force all countries to stop buying Iranian oil.  Iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action.  On Sunday, Iran’s ground forces commander became the latest military figure to back Rouhani’s apparent threat, the semi-official news agency Tasnim reported. “The Strait of Hormuz region must either be safe for all or be insecure for everyone,” said General Kioumars Heydari, quoted by Tasnim.  Separately, a top Iranian military commander warned that the Trump government might be preparing to invade Iran. “The enemy’s behaviour is unpredictable,” Tasnim quoted military chief of staff General Mohammad Baqeri as saying.   “Although the current American government does not seem to speak of a military threat, according to precise information it has been trying to persuade the U.S. military to launch a military invasion (of Iran),” Baqeri said. Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by the end of the year because of new U.S. sanctions, putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere. Washington initially planned to shut Iran out of global oil markets completely after Trump abandoned the deal that limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions, demanding all other countries stop buying Iranian crude by November. But the United States has somewhat eased its stance, saying it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies.

2018-07-22,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The United States doubts whether South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar have the leadership qualities needed to deliver peace to the country at war since 2013, the White House said on Sunday. Peace talks last week in the South Sudanese capital Juba need to be more inclusive to succeed, the White House said, adding that it will impose fresh sanctions on anyone who threatens the country’s stability. The statement constitutes tough U.S. language about South Sudan, a country whose independence in 2011 Washington backed after a war with Sudan that lasted decades. Since then, tens of thousands have been killed in a civil war. “We are deeply concerned about the direction of the current peace process .... A narrow agreement between elites will not solve the problems plaguing South Sudan,” said the statement. It implored the warring parties to implement a ceasefire as a first step and condemned a move by the country’s parliament to extend the government’s term in office. “South Sudan’s political leaders ... have not demonstrated the leadership required to bring genuine peace ... We remain sceptical that they can oversee a peaceful and timely transition to democracy and good governance,” it said.   On June 13, a U.S.-drafted resolution at the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo. [L1N1U90S7]. South Sudan’s parliament voted this month to extend Kiir’s mandate until 2021, a move likely to undermine the peace talks as opposition groups say the change is illegal. Last week Kiir said he is ready to accept a peace deal to end the war and set up an inclusive new government. The proposed deal would give the country five vice presidents and also covers security and power sharing arrangements [L8N1UF2XB].

2018-07-22,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is renting parking spaces from August to stockpile vehicles which cannot be sold due to bottlenecks caused by new engine emissions tests, a spokeswoman said on Sunday. Carmakers are rushing to get models through a new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) tests on a limited number of exhaust emission test benches as they won’t be able to sell new vehicles after Sept. 1 Volkswagen (VW) acknowledged in June a potential delay in up to 250,000 vehicles worldwide triggered by the stricter anti-pollution test procedures and plans to throttle back production of some models at various plants due to testing bottlenecks. VW has rented some multi-storey car parks and open parking lots to park the vehicles it cannot yet deliver, the spokeswoman said.  The timing of when it will have to stockpile inventory depends on the plant where vehicles are built, she added. One option is to use Berlin’s long-delayed international airport, Berlin-Brandenburg, although a decision has not yet been made, she said. VW said in June it would shut its main Wolfsburg factory for 1-2 days a week between August and the end of September. It will also close its Zwickau factory on some days and components manufacturing will face resulting delays. The group’s plant in Emden will be closed on some days in the third and fourth quarter due to lacklustre demand for mid-sized cars. German newswire DPA first reported on Sunday that VW would temporarily park vehicles from August.
