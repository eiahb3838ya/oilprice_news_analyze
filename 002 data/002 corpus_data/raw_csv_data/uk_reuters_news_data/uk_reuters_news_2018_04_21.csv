2018-04-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A multilateral framework like the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact works better in fixing trade imbalances than a bilateral deal, IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa said in an endorsement of Japan’s calls for Washington to rejoin TPP. Japan and the United States are at loggerheads on how to frame trade talks, with U.S. President Donald Trump rebuffing Tokyo’s calls to rejoin the pact, instead preferring a two-way trade deal. Furusawa said multilateral frameworks like TPP were more effective in solving disagreements over trade and fixing imbalances in a globalized world with intertwined supply chains. “Bilateral talks alone can’t solve imbalances. It’s therefore more efficient to solve them with a bigger framework,” Furusawa told Reuters on Saturday on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. “In general, a multilateral framework is more efficient for the global economy,” said Furusawa, a former top Japanese currency diplomat. Japan wants Trump to reconsider his decision to pull the United States out of TPP, and is reluctant to meet Washington’s calls to open talks for a two-way trade deal for fear of coming under pressure to open up markets like agriculture. The two countries agreed at a summit earlier this week to create a new framework focussing on trade talks to iron out differences, though Japanese officials say it will take time to reach a solution agreeable for both. The United States has also engaged in a tit-for-tat trade spat with China, stoking protectionism worries among IMF and Group of 20 finance leaders. Furusawa said such concerns could hurt now-vibrant Asian economies through various channels. “Trade negotiations take time, and during that process the uncertainty continues. That would affect not just goods trade but investment, consumption and sentiment,” he said. While responding to Trump’s tariff threats with retaliation, China recently announced market liberalisation plans such as scrapping a limit on foreign ownership of automotive ventures. “China has been pushing through market reforms for quite some time, so I don’t think it’s just in response to U.S. pressure,” Furusawa said. “It’s a move in the right direction. Pushing forward with reforms is good not just for the Chinese economy but for the global economy.” Referring to Japan’s fiscal policy, Furusawa said it was “obvious” the country must proceed with a scheduled sales tax increase next year to rein in its huge public debt. The government should also take steps to ease the pain from the tax hike on the economy, including through a temporary increase in fiscal spending, he said. As the economy continues to strengthen, Japan must push through reforms to boost its potential growth, he said. “We’ve seen some progress, such as in areas like corporate governance and trade,” Furusawa said. “The biggest challenge is labour market reform, so we’re hoping there will be progress on that front.”     Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao",https://uk.reuters.com/article/imf-g20-trade/interview-imf-endorses-japans-preference-of-tpp-over-two-way-trade-deal-idUKL3N1RY083,21 Apr 2018,"A multilateral framework

2018-04-21,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Armenian opposition supporters rallied on Saturday for a ninth consecutive day to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan, but he said the country needed his experience to tackle problems such as Nagorno-Karabakh. Sarksyan was appointed prime minister this month after serving 10 years as president. The protesters accuse him of clinging to power and demand that he step down. “In this region with a complex geopolitics and at a time of new challenges we must ensure the stable development of the country and continue efforts aimed at a suitable settlement of the Karabakh problem,” Sarksyan said in an open letter cited by the government’s press office. “I believe these problems can be resolved. After that, other figures can take the helm,” he said. Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan, is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991. Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of carrying out attacks in the area. The conflict flared up again in 2016 and saw a number of deadly incidents over the past year. The leader of the protests in Yerevan, opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan, said Sarksyan had agreed to talks with the opposition at a hotel in the capital on Sunday morning. Sarksyan’s spokesman was not immediately available to confirm the meeting. As on previous days, the protesters marched through Yerevan on Saturday waving national flags and chanting: “Make a stand, say no to Serzh.” They blocked several streets in the centre and staged sit-ins. Police detained about 200 activists. Armenia’s new president, Armen Sarkissian, an ally of Sarksyan, on Saturday met with Pashinyan, the protest leader, and urged dialogue. Sarkissian was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament in March. On Tuesday, the parliament voted to allow Sarksyan, who served as president of the small ex-Soviet republic from 2008 until this month, to become premier. Under a revised constitution approved by a referendum in 2015, the prime minister now has the most power in Armenia, while the presidency has become largely ceremonial. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.

2018-04-21,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze has told a newspaper she does not think software updates for diesel vehicles in Germany will be enough to solve air quality problems and that  hardware retrofits are the only way to avoid driving bans. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she will do everything possible to avoid driving bans but disagreements over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions threaten to further strain her coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Asked in an interview with Tagesspiegel to be published on Sunday whether measures already agreed on diesel would suffice to avoid driving bans, Schulze said: “I fear that in cities where the limits have been far exceeded - Munich, Stuttgart and others - software updates alone will not suffice.” She added: “The many measures from the immediate programme for clean air, such as electrification of buses, are good and will help many cities but overall they aren’t enough to solve the problem in cities that are particularly badly affected.” Schulze, of the SPD, said she was therefore campaigning hard for vehicles to get technical retrofits, adding: “In my view that’s the only realistic way to avoid driving bans.” Asked whether the carmakers should pay for the hardware retrofits themselves, she said: “Yes - they are the ones who have caused this.” She said hardware retrofits were especially necessary in particularly badly affected urban areas where there was no other way to stick to NOx limits, adding this was likely to be around 20 cities. However, German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer, a member of the Bavarian CSU sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU), opposes costly hardware retrofits, saying he is committed to meeting emissions targets using measures already being implemented. Schulze said she and Scheuer were discussing the diesel issue intensely and both wanted Germany to have a strong automobile industry with many jobs. But, she said, it would only remain strong if it pioneered vehicles of the future, and China was the biggest future market. “That country wants to improve the air in its cities. Soon no more dirty cars will be purchased there,” Schulze said.

2018-04-21,"ISLE DE JEAN CHARLES, Louisiana, April 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  Standing in the long grass on the land where he was born, with the sea now lapping just meters away, Chief Albert Naquin remembers Isle de Jean Charles as a wonderful place to grow up. “It’s like night and day - we were totally self-sufficient here. Now you have to go off the island to survive,” he said of his community in southeast Louisiana - one that is being dispersed by the encroaching waves of the Gulf of Mexico. Since the 1950s, the small strip of land - once 11 miles (18 km) by 5 miles (8 km) - has lost 98 percent of its mass, according to the U.S. Land Remote Sensing Program. It is linked to the mainland by a road flanked by water on either side. The fear is that the “island”, as it is known, could wash away in the next big storm. Many of the 100 or so extended families that once lived on Isle de Jean Charles have drifted away over the last 20 years, and now, as utility companies refuse to service it, only around 25 homes remain. “To me it’s like watching a family member with cancer - it’s being eaten away little bit by little bit. But this piece of land is lasting longer than a human body can,” Naquin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The sliver of land has been home for generations to the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians, a tribe that found refuge here in the early 19th century. “This is where we were chased by the white man and came to settle, and now Mother Nature is chasing us away,” Naquin said. But the community – after a long search to redefine its future – is now hoping it may finally have found a new home. In the first federal competition to fund innovative resilience projects in the face of worsening storms and extreme weather, the state of Louisiana was awarded $92 million in 2016 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Of that $48 million was earmarked to resettle the community of Isle de Jean Charles after Chantel Comardelle, the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe’s executive secretary, and colleagues worked with state officials and other groups to submit plans. Winning the grant pushed the small community into the international media spotlight. After two years of search and negotiation, 500 acres (202 hectares) has been purchased near Schriever in south Louisiana at a cost of close to $12 million with development to start in 2019. The land is between 6 feet and 12 feet (1.8-3.7 m) above sea level, higher than 50-year projections for coastal flooding released by the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. Comardelle - who left the island for the city of Houma in southeast Louisiana - splits her life between raising her family and the fight for her people’s future, and has spent so much time in the office that her three children keep toys there. The migration plan got funding, she believes, because it blazes a trail for other groups who face the prospect of losing their land, both in the United States and other countries. “Right now, there’s very little positive in the form of relocation or resettlement of people,” she said. “We presented a different model of doing it - a community-designed, community-driven process.” In the late 19th century, construction began on a vast series of levees - earth embankments built to contain and prevent flooding – across the Mississippi River. The levees altered the natural flow of river sediment, and Louisiana’s southeastern wetlands gradually began to sink. Then in the early 20th century, the oil and gas industry discovered huge wealth along the coast and over decades drilled more than 50,000 wells and put in miles of canals and pipelines. The canals provided an easy route for salt water into the area’s marshes, breaking up wetlands. Yet even while it altered the landscape, the fossil fuel industry brought much-needed jobs and infrastructure. “They’re the one that’s putting food on the table and paying the rent and mortgages, so as much as you hate them, you have to like them,” said Chief Naquin. Today, climate change effects in the form of sea level rise and powerful storms are compounding Louisiana’s problems. “We’re both subsiding and suffering global sea level rise at the same time,” former senator Reggie Dupre, executive director of the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in his office in Houma. “We are sinking by 3 mm (0.12 inches) a year. That doesn’t sound like much - but after 40, 50 years, you start to notice differences when you are already only slightly above the water, like Isle de Jean Charles.” A U.S. Geological Survey study says southeast Louisiana is losing wetlands at the rate of a football field an hour. Mat Sanders, resilience policy and programme administrator for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development, said others can be expected to experience similar conditions. Louisiana, as one of the first, is “presenting itself as a laboratory”, he added. On the porch in the still, warm air beneath his home built on stilts, Chris Brunet - who has lived in Isle de Jean Charles all his life - said the place had become a “skeleton” of its former self. “When I was a child, it was very easy to wake up in the morning and see armadillo in the yard - or a possum, or a raccoon,” said Brunet who lives with his teenage son. Ironically, it was building a new levee system in 2002 that pushed the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe to seek a new home. Isle de Jean Charles was left out of a $900-million hurricane protection zone stretching from Morganza to the Gulf, even though it was included in initial studies. Dupre said it became clear that the $300 million cost of extending the levee system to the “island” would be too high. “That’s always been a personal dilemma of mine,” said Dupre, who went to school with many of the tribal inhabitants. “Here I am, the chief executive officer of the agency building the hurricane protection system that excludes the island.” “One thing that is not factored (into) the cost-benefit analysis is: what’s the cost of losing a culture?” For the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians, the goal now is to bring their community back together. But Sanders said the reality was more complex as some residents identify with another tribe - the Houma Nation - while others have no tribal affiliation. The funds will be spent on helping all those living on Isle de Jean Charles to move. “The priority is to move folks out of harm’s way. It’s not a tribal project; it’s a community project,” he said. One major question remains unanswered: Who will own the land on which the community plans to resettle? Initially, it will be held by the state through the Louisiana Land Trust while different models are discussed, including shared community ownership. Standing on the newly acquired land, a sugarcane farm with a large wetland and a stretch of bayou swamp, Comardelle said the lack of clarity was “kinda scary” for those mulling relocation. But people are tired of replacing cars and furniture after every hurricane season, of never having the chance to save or give their kids a leg up in life, she explained. ""This is our rebirth where we can start our re-population, to get off that endangered species list, and begin again,"" she said smiling as her children ran races in the golden afternoon light.
