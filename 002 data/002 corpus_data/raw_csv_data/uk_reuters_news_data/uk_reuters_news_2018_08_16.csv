2018-08-16,"(Adds comments from AFPM on bilateral trade) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the goal set out by Mexico’s incoming president to end massive gasoline and diesel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, as a measure that will boost prosperity in its southern neighbor. During a visit on Wednesday to the Mexican capital where he met with current officials as well as key advisers to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Perry brushed off concerns that U.S. refiners stand to lose their biggest foreign market. “It’s a good goal for Mexico. I tip my hat to the president-elect for having that as a goal,” said Perry, a former governor of Texas, the most prominent energy-producing and refining U.S. state. “I hope they’re successful with that transition.” So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of 1.19 million barrels per day of fuel including gasoline and diesel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Fuel imports now represent 60 percent of the country’s total consumption, as crude processing at Mexico’s domestic refineries has steadily declined. Lopez Obrador, who won a landslide victory last month, in December will take office as Mexico’s first leftist president in decades. He has repeatedly promised to end foreign gasoline imports within three years and increase domestic production of value-added fuels, pledging to revive the six existing state-owned refineries operated by national oil company Pemex, as well as build a new one. “That’s not going to happen overnight. He knows that, we know that,” Perry told a group of reporters on Wednesday afternoon after meeting with Lopez Obrador’s designated chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, and his future energy minister Rocio Nahle. “What I heard today was a bit of realism from both Nahle and Romo,” he added, without going into further detail. Susan Grissom, chief analyst at the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said after Perry’s comments that the “free flow” of energy had bolstered both economies. U.S. refiners have invested billions of dollars in Mexico since it opened its energy market. “The continuation of healthy energy trade between our countries benefits North American consumers, businesses and our collective energy security,” she said. Perry pointed to growing South American markets as potential new buyers of U.S. refined products, noting that Venezuela’s oil output has plummeted amid a major economic crisis. “We’re going to have more markets, most likely, than we’re going to have product,” he said.

2018-08-16,"VANCOUVER, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator on Thursday said it had given the go-ahead for the construction of a large portion of the Trans Mountain expansion project, which will nearly triple capacity on the oil pipeline from Alberta to a Vancouver area port. The National Energy Board (NEB) said all conditions had been met for construction to go ahead on Segments 1-4, which cover a vast swath of land from Edmonton, Alberta to Kamloops, British Columbia. The Canadian government agreed in May to buy the existing pipeline and expansion project from Kinder Morgan Canada , hoping to save a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition. Construction is already underway at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Vancouver, with preliminary work happening at Kinder Morgan’s terminal and tank farm in Burnaby. The NEB said 72 percent of the detailed final route for the pipeline had been approved, with hearings on the last segment set for October.

2018-08-16,"LONDON/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Axpo, a Swiss utility and energy trader, said on Thursday it was in talks for a 10-year supply deal with a Canadian company planning to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. A sales and purchase agreement would boost the chances that Pieridae Energy (PEA.V) would decide to build the C$10 billion ($7.6 billion) Goldboro project, which would be the first LNG export terminal on Canada’s East Coast. Canada is rich in oil and gas but has yet to export major shipments of LNG to Asia from its West Coast or across the Atlantic from its East Coast. “Under the term sheet with Pieridae Energy, Axpo will purchase LNG from Train 2 of the Goldboro liquefaction facility and sell it across Europe,” Axpo said in a statement. Deliveries are estimated to begin in the third quarter of 2023. The Axpo deal is ready to be finalised once Pieridae secures gas supplies from Eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, hopefully within five months, said Chief Executive Alfred Sorensen in an interview. Sorensen declined to identify the size of the Axpo supply agreement. Pieridae already has a 20-year agreement to sell five million tonnes annually to German utility Uniper. Goldboro would produce 10 million tonnes annually starting in 2023 if construction begins by year-end.       Securing financing for such a large project, mainly through offtakes, is a big challenge, however, for a company with a C$195 million market cap. “Are we delusional about how we can get to the finish line? It really has been from the very beginning about how we can work with the Germans and work to improve their energy security,” Sorensen said. Germany depends heavily on gas imports from Russia and is seeking to diversify its suppliers. Pieridae is finalising a loan guarantee of at least $3 billion from the German government.  The company is “very close” to securing enough committed sales to make a positive final investment decision, he said. Pieridae is also in talks to acquire an undisclosed Alberta gas producer to supply Goldboro, he said. Five other projects on Canada’s East Coast have been proposed although initiatives have sputtered in recent years when global LNG prices fell.  Another handful of projects have been proposed for Canada’s West Coast, where LNG would be exported to Asia. One of the largest is LNG Canada, a proposed C$40 billion export terminal in Kitimat, British Columbia. A decision whether to proceed with that project is expected by year-end. LNG Canada is a joint venture led by Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc.

2018-08-16,"HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - There were signs that a natural gas well was not fully sealed before it exploded in January, killing five workers, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board said in an updated report on the accident on Thursday. The incident, which took place at a Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, well being drilled for producer Red Mountain Energy by drilling contractor Patterson-UTI, was the deadliest drilling accident since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion, which killed 11 people. The CSB’s chronology of events in the hours leading to the fatal blowout and fire showed a drill pipe was removed before it was fully emptied of the “mud” used to seal a well. Later, a mud pit at the site accumulated 107 barrels of the material, providing “an indication of a possible gas influx in the well,” the report said. The report does not specifically say what caused the blast. The CSB investigates major industrial accidents and makes recommendations to prevent future incidents. Patterson-UTI Drilling said in a statement that it is cooperating with the CSB. “We value the perspective of outside stakeholders and will be working with the CSB to understand their potential recommendations when they are available at the conclusion of the investigation,” a spokeswoman said. An attorney representing the family of one victim of the explosion said the report illustrates the safety failures that led up to the explosion. “Ten hours before it blew, there were warning signs,” said Michael Lyons, an attorney representing the family of Parker Waldridge, a 60-year-old well-site consultant killed in the accident. “At this point, the well should have been shut in. “The (mud) pit gains were a big deal,” Lyons said.

China said that a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks on Aug. 21 and 22, raising hopes that Beijing and Washington may resolve the escalating tariff war that has roiled financial markets since early March.  The Chinese yuan recovered from its weakest level since January 2017, and the dollar moved slightly lower. “The news of China coming back to the negotiating table is providing relief and you are starting to see markets stabilize a little bit,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Montana has ordered the U.S. State Department to do a full environmental review of a revised route for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, possibly delaying its construction and dealing another setback to TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO). For more than a decade, environmentalists, tribal groups, and ranchers have fought the $8-billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline that will carry heavy crude to Steele City, Nebraska, from Canada’s oilsands in Alberta.   U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled late on Wednesday for the Indigenous Environmental Network and other plaintiffs, ordering the review of a revised pipeline route through Nebraska to supplement one the State Department did on the original path in 2014.  The State Department was obligated to “analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision” to issue a permit for the pipeline last year, Morris said in his ruling.  Supporting the project are Canadian oil producers, who face price discounts over transport bottlenecks, and U.S. refineries and pipeline builders. TransCanada is reviewing the decision, company spokesman Matthew John said. It hopes to start preliminary work in Montana in the coming months and to begin construction in the second quarter of 2019. The company said this month it expects to make a final investment decision late this year or in early 2019. The ruling is negative for TransCanada, since it adds uncertainty to timing, said RBC analyst Robert Kwan, and it was important that the pipeline be constructed during the current U.S. presidential cycle.  President Donald Trump is keen to see the building of the pipeline, which was axed by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on environmental concerns relating to emissions that cause climate change.  TransCanada shares rose 0.2 percent in trading in Toronto. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The State Department is reviewing the court’s order, a spokesman said.  The ruling was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s attempt to ... force Keystone XL on the American people,” said Jackie Prange, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.      Trump pushed to approve the pipeline soon after he took office, and a State Department official signed a so-called presidential permit in 2017 allowing it to move forward. However, Morris declined the plaintiff’s request to void that permit, which was based on the 2014 review.  Last year, Nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the pipeline, which will cost TransCanada millions of dollars more than the original path.  In a draft environmental assessment last month, the State Department said Keystone XL would not harm water supplies or wildlife. That review is less wide-ranging than the full environmental impact statement Morris ordered.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s proposed replacement for the Obama-era’s central regulation on climate change, the Clean Power Plan, is expected to be released by the Environmental Protection Agency late next week, an agency source said on Thursday. The replacement for former President Barack Obama’s plan to slash carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants will grant states the ability to write their own weaker regulations for the plants, a Politico report, citing a portion of an unpublished draft of the plan, said this week. The Trump administration, focused on reversing Obama-era environmental regulations, was not sure at first whether it would replace the Clean Power Plan.  But after pressure from electricity generators and other energy interests concerned about regulatory certainty and litigation over emissions linked to climate change from environmentalists, former EPA head Scott Pruitt, who resigned last month under a cloud of ethics controversies, made replacing the plan with a more industry friendly measure a top priority for 2018.    The EPA in 2015 under Obama finalized the CPP which sought to reduce emissions from power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But the plan never took effect. The Supreme Court put the brakes on it in 2016 after energy-producing states sued the EPA, saying it had exceeded its legal reach. The Trump administration’s replacement plan would also give states the ability to seek permission to opt out of regulations on power plant emissions, the Politico report said. The EPA source did not comment on the report.  But a move to let states opt out would likely face staunch opposition from electricity industry associations because in many states the CPP’s limits on emissions have already been met. In addition, opting out of regulations by states would likely be fought by green groups in the courts. During a public hearing late last year in Charleston, West Virginia - the heart of coal country - health groups, environmentalists and a former coal miner criticized the Trump’s administration’s proposal to dismantle the clean power plan.   After a public comment period on the proposed Trump plan, a final EPA rule is expected later this year.

2018-08-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose slightly as global markets steadied on Thursday, recovering some of the previous day’s 2 percent slide, though a weakening outlook for crude demand kept prices in check. The oil market slid on Wednesday as data showing a large build in U.S. inventories fed concern about the fuel demand outlook, while crude was also pressured by broader selling of industrial commodities such as copper. [EIA/S] [MET/L] “There’s still an overhang from the report yesterday,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York, citing surging imports that boosted inventories despite high refinery run rates.  China and the United States have implemented several rounds of tariffs and threatened further duties on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars, which could knock global economic growth.     The crisis gripping the Turkish lira has rattled emerging markets and reverberated across equities, bonds and raw materials. [FRX/] Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 settled 67 cents higher at $71.43 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 45 cents to $65.46 a barrel.   Earlier, U.S. crude had hovered around its 200-day moving average of $65.18 a barrel, an important technical benchmark. Moving below that level could trigger a further surge downward.  “The growth story is now more or less a U.S. growth story. The rest of the world isn’t playing along any longer,” said Saxo Bank commodities strategist Ole Hansen. “It also really reflects how the theme in the commodities market has so quickly changed from being one where the worry was about supply, with Iran sanctions for oil or Chilean (miner) strikes for copper, and now the focus is on demand.” Brent crude futures are resting on the 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the first time in a year. Analysts say a break below this point could trigger another swift sell-off.  “In Brent, we trace a first support at $71.00 followed by the 200-day moving average at $70.23 and $70.00,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said. On the supply front, U.S. data on Wednesday showed crude output C-OUT-T-EIA rose by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.9 million bpd in the week ending Aug. 10. Crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA increased by 6.8 million barrels, representing the largest weekly rise since March last year. [EIA/S] “As the end of the summer driving season approaches, crude oil processing is likely to have peaked and should decrease from now on. Net crude oil imports therefore need to decline steeply so that crude oil stocks do not rise any further,” Commerzbank said in a note. (Graphic: U.S. oil drilling, production & storage levels: tmsnrt.rs/2nEcW0C) Asian demand is showing signs of slowdown as trade disputes and a stronger dollar drag the economies of some of the world’s largest oil buyers.

2018-08-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the goal set out by Mexico’s incoming president to end massive gasoline and diesel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, as a measure that will boost prosperity in its southern neighbor. During a visit on Wednesday to the Mexican capital in which he met with both current officials as well as key advisers to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Perry brushed off concerns that U.S. refiners stand to lose their biggest foreign market. “It’s a good goal for Mexico. I tip my hat to the president-elect for having that as a goal,” said Perry, a former governor of Texas, the most prominent energy producing and refining U.S. state. “I hope they’re successful with that transition.” So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of 1.19 million barrels per day (bpd) of fuel including gasoline and diesel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Fuel imports now represent 60 percent of the country’s total consumption, as crude processing at Mexico’s domestic refineries has steadily declined. Lopez Obrador won a landslide victory last month and in December will take office as Mexico’s first leftist president in decades.  He has repeatedly promised to end foreign gasoline imports within three years and grow domestic production of value-added fuels at home, pledging to revive the six existing state-owned refineries operated by national oil company Pemex, as well as build a new one. “That’s not going to happen overnight. He knows that, we know that,” Perry told a group of reporters on Wednesday afternoon after meeting with Lopez Obrador’s designated chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, and his future energy minister Rocio Nahle. He said Romo also met with David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury Department’s under secretary for international affairs. “What I heard today was a bit of realism from both Nahle and Romo,” he added, without going into further detail. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which represents U.S. refiners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Perry’s statement. Perry pointed to growing South American markets as potential new buyers of U.S. refined products, noting that Venezuela’s oil output has plummeted amid a major economic crisis. “We’re going to have more markets, most likely, than we’re going to have product,” he said.

Islamic State, which once occupied a third of Iraq’s territory, has been largely defeated in the country but still poses a threat along its border with Syria. “According to intelligence, those terrorists who were killed were planning criminal operations using suicide vests and intended to target innocents in the next few days inside Iraq,” the military said in a statement. The Iraqi military has carried out several air strikes against Islamic State in Syria since last year, with the approval of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants. Iraq has good relations with Iran and Russia, Assad’s main backers in the Syrian war, and also enjoys strong support from the U.S.-led coalition. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State in December but the group still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and in a rugged mountainous area in northeastern Iraq. It has continued to carry out ambushes, killings, and bombings across Iraq since it abandoned its goal of creating a self-sufficient caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria.

U.S. equities rose on hopes that Beijing and Washington may resolve a conflict that has roiled financial markets since early March. China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks. The dollar dipped on news of the U.S.-China talks as investors returned to currencies that had been sold off. The Chinese yuan gained 1.1 percent to 6.87 per dollar. The euro rose 0.3 percent after closing the previous day at its lowest point since July 2017. The Turkish lira rose 3.0 percent to 5.79 per dollar, supported by Qatar’s pledge on Wednesday to invest $15 billion in Turkey. Other emerging market currencies, such as Russia’s ruble and Mexico’s peso, also rose. The retreat in the dollar also steadied global equities. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.7 percent. Emerging market stocks, which on Wednesday had fallen more than 20 percent from their January intraday high, edged up 0.0 percent. Metals markets moved higher as well. Copper rose 1.97 percent to $5,915.00 a tonne, after having confirmed a bear market on Wednesday, closing 20.9 percent lower than its recent high reached on June 7. “Investors around the world have been anxious about the U.S.-China trade dispute and its potential impact on global growth,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Anything that means investors are less concerned about slowing growth in China is good news for emerging markets and good news for parts of the commodities complex.” Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak held a conference call in which he assured international investors that the country would emerge stronger from its currency crisis and that its banks were healthy. Albayrak also said Turkey had no plans to seek help from the International Monetary Fund or impose capital controls to stop money flowing abroad. “I’m not seeing any sign of change in economic policy, but the absence of new bad news is good for the markets,” Warne said of Turkey. In U.S. markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 401.82 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,564.23, the S&P 500 gained 28.4 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,846.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.32 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,840.43.

2018-08-16,"(Adds comments from AFPM on bilateral trade) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the goal set out by Mexico’s incoming president to end massive gasoline and diesel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, as a measure that will boost prosperity in its southern neighbor. During a visit on Wednesday to the Mexican capital where he met with current officials as well as key advisers to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Perry brushed off concerns that U.S. refiners stand to lose their biggest foreign market. “It’s a good goal for Mexico. I tip my hat to the president-elect for having that as a goal,” said Perry, a former governor of Texas, the most prominent energy-producing and refining U.S. state. “I hope they’re successful with that transition.” So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of 1.19 million barrels per day of fuel including gasoline and diesel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Fuel imports now represent 60 percent of the country’s total consumption, as crude processing at Mexico’s domestic refineries has steadily declined. Lopez Obrador, who won a landslide victory last month, in December will take office as Mexico’s first leftist president in decades. He has repeatedly promised to end foreign gasoline imports within three years and increase domestic production of value-added fuels, pledging to revive the six existing state-owned refineries operated by national oil company Pemex, as well as build a new one. “That’s not going to happen overnight. He knows that, we know that,” Perry told a group of reporters on Wednesday afternoon after meeting with Lopez Obrador’s designated chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, and his future energy minister Rocio Nahle. “What I heard today was a bit of realism from both Nahle and Romo,” he added, without going into further detail. Susan Grissom, chief analyst at the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said after Perry’s comments that the “free flow” of energy had bolstered both economies. U.S. refiners have invested billions of dollars in Mexico since it opened its energy market. “The continuation of healthy energy trade between our countries benefits North American consumers, businesses and our collective energy security,” she said. Perry pointed to growing South American markets as potential new buyers of U.S. refined products, noting that Venezuela’s oil output has plummeted amid a major economic crisis. “We’re going to have more markets, most likely, than we’re going to have product,” he said.

The National Energy Board (NEB) said all conditions had been met for construction to go ahead on Segments 1-4, which cover a vast swath of land from Edmonton, Alberta to Kamloops, British Columbia. The Canadian government agreed in May to buy the existing pipeline and expansion project from Kinder Morgan Canada , hoping to save a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition. Construction is already underway at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Vancouver, with preliminary work happening at Kinder Morgan’s terminal and tank farm in Burnaby.

2018-08-16,"LONDON/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Axpo, a Swiss utility and energy trader, said on Thursday it was in talks for a 10-year supply deal with a Canadian company planning to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. A sales and purchase agreement would boost the chances that Pieridae Energy (PEA.V) would decide to build the C$10 billion ($7.6 billion) Goldboro project, which would be the first LNG export terminal on Canada’s East Coast. Canada is rich in oil and gas but has yet to export major shipments of LNG to Asia from its West Coast or across the Atlantic from its East Coast. “Under the term sheet with Pieridae Energy, Axpo will purchase LNG from Train 2 of the Goldboro liquefaction facility and sell it across Europe,” Axpo said in a statement. Deliveries are estimated to begin in the third quarter of 2023. The Axpo deal is ready to be finalised once Pieridae secures gas supplies from Eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, hopefully within five months, said Chief Executive Alfred Sorensen in an interview. Sorensen declined to identify the size of the Axpo supply agreement. Pieridae already has a 20-year agreement to sell five million tonnes annually to German utility Uniper. Goldboro would produce 10 million tonnes annually starting in 2023 if construction begins by year-end.       Securing financing for such a large project, mainly through offtakes, is a big challenge, however, for a company with a C$195 million market cap. “Are we delusional about how we can get to the finish line? It really has been from the very beginning about how we can work with the Germans and work to improve their energy security,” Sorensen said. Germany depends heavily on gas imports from Russia and is seeking to diversify its suppliers. Pieridae is finalising a loan guarantee of at least $3 billion from the German government.  The company is “very close” to securing enough committed sales to make a positive final investment decision, he said. Pieridae is also in talks to acquire an undisclosed Alberta gas producer to supply Goldboro, he said. Five other projects on Canada’s East Coast have been proposed although initiatives have sputtered in recent years when global LNG prices fell.  Another handful of projects have been proposed for Canada’s West Coast, where LNG would be exported to Asia. One of the largest is LNG Canada, a proposed C$40 billion export terminal in Kitimat, British Columbia. A decision whether to proceed with that project is expected by year-end. LNG Canada is a joint venture led by Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc.

2018-08-16,"HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - There were signs that a natural gas well was not fully sealed before it exploded in January, killing five workers, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board said in an updated report on the accident on Thursday. The incident, which took place at a Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, well being drilled for producer Red Mountain Energy by drilling contractor Patterson-UTI, was the deadliest drilling accident since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion, which killed 11 people. The CSB’s chronology of events in the hours leading to the fatal blowout and fire showed a drill pipe was removed before it was fully emptied of the “mud” used to seal a well. Later, a mud pit at the site accumulated 107 barrels of the material, providing “an indication of a possible gas influx in the well,” the report said. The report does not specifically say what caused the blast. The CSB investigates major industrial accidents and makes recommendations to prevent future incidents. Patterson-UTI Drilling said in a statement that it is cooperating with the CSB. “We value the perspective of outside stakeholders and will be working with the CSB to understand their potential recommendations when they are available at the conclusion of the investigation,” a spokeswoman said. An attorney representing the family of one victim of the explosion said the report illustrates the safety failures that led up to the explosion. “Ten hours before it blew, there were warning signs,” said Michael Lyons, an attorney representing the family of Parker Waldridge, a 60-year-old well-site consultant killed in the accident. “At this point, the well should have been shut in. “The (mud) pit gains were a big deal,” Lyons said.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Montana has ordered the U.S. State Department to do a full environmental review of a revised route for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, possibly delaying its construction and dealing another setback to TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO). For more than a decade, environmentalists, tribal groups, and ranchers have fought the $8-billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline that will carry heavy crude to Steele City, Nebraska, from Canada’s oilsands in Alberta.   U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled late on Wednesday for the Indigenous Environmental Network and other plaintiffs, ordering the review of a revised pipeline route through Nebraska to supplement one the State Department did on the original path in 2014.  The State Department was obligated to “analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision” to issue a permit for the pipeline last year, Morris said in his ruling.  Supporting the project are Canadian oil producers, who face price discounts over transport bottlenecks, and U.S. refineries and pipeline builders. TransCanada is reviewing the decision, company spokesman Matthew John said. It hopes to start preliminary work in Montana in the coming months and to begin construction in the second quarter of 2019. The company said this month it expects to make a final investment decision late this year or in early 2019. The ruling is negative for TransCanada, since it adds uncertainty to timing, said RBC analyst Robert Kwan, and it was important that the pipeline be constructed during the current U.S. presidential cycle.  President Donald Trump is keen to see the building of the pipeline, which was axed by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on environmental concerns relating to emissions that cause climate change.  TransCanada shares rose 0.2 percent in trading in Toronto. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The State Department is reviewing the court’s order, a spokesman said.  The ruling was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s attempt to ... force Keystone XL on the American people,” said Jackie Prange, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.      Trump pushed to approve the pipeline soon after he took office, and a State Department official signed a so-called presidential permit in 2017 allowing it to move forward. However, Morris declined the plaintiff’s request to void that permit, which was based on the 2014 review.  Last year, Nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the pipeline, which will cost TransCanada millions of dollars more than the original path.  In a draft environmental assessment last month, the State Department said Keystone XL would not harm water supplies or wildlife. That review is less wide-ranging than the full environmental impact statement Morris ordered.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s proposed replacement for the Obama-era’s central regulation on climate change, the Clean Power Plan, is expected to be released by the Environmental Protection Agency late next week, an agency source said on Thursday. The replacement for former President Barack Obama’s plan to slash carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants will grant states the ability to write their own weaker regulations for the plants, a Politico report, citing a portion of an unpublished draft of the plan, said this week. The Trump administration, focused on reversing Obama-era environmental regulations, was not sure at first whether it would replace the Clean Power Plan.  But after pressure from electricity generators and other energy interests concerned about regulatory certainty and litigation over emissions linked to climate change from environmentalists, former EPA head Scott Pruitt, who resigned last month under a cloud of ethics controversies, made replacing the plan with a more industry friendly measure a top priority for 2018.    The EPA in 2015 under Obama finalized the CPP which sought to reduce emissions from power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But the plan never took effect. The Supreme Court put the brakes on it in 2016 after energy-producing states sued the EPA, saying it had exceeded its legal reach. The Trump administration’s replacement plan would also give states the ability to seek permission to opt out of regulations on power plant emissions, the Politico report said. The EPA source did not comment on the report.  But a move to let states opt out would likely face staunch opposition from electricity industry associations because in many states the CPP’s limits on emissions have already been met. In addition, opting out of regulations by states would likely be fought by green groups in the courts. During a public hearing late last year in Charleston, West Virginia - the heart of coal country - health groups, environmentalists and a former coal miner criticized the Trump’s administration’s proposal to dismantle the clean power plan.   After a public comment period on the proposed Trump plan, a final EPA rule is expected later this year.

2018-08-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose slightly as global markets steadied on Thursday, recovering some of the previous day’s 2 percent slide, though a weakening outlook for crude demand kept prices in check. The oil market slid on Wednesday as data showing a large build in U.S. inventories fed concern about the fuel demand outlook, while crude was also pressured by broader selling of industrial commodities such as copper. [EIA/S] [MET/L] “There’s still an overhang from the report yesterday,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York, citing surging imports that boosted inventories despite high refinery run rates.  China and the United States have implemented several rounds of tariffs and threatened further duties on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars, which could knock global economic growth.     The crisis gripping the Turkish lira has rattled emerging markets and reverberated across equities, bonds and raw materials. [FRX/] Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 settled 67 cents higher at $71.43 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 45 cents to $65.46 a barrel.   Earlier, U.S. crude had hovered around its 200-day moving average of $65.18 a barrel, an important technical benchmark. Moving below that level could trigger a further surge downward.  “The growth story is now more or less a U.S. growth story. The rest of the world isn’t playing along any longer,” said Saxo Bank commodities strategist Ole Hansen. “It also really reflects how the theme in the commodities market has so quickly changed from being one where the worry was about supply, with Iran sanctions for oil or Chilean (miner) strikes for copper, and now the focus is on demand.” Brent crude futures are resting on the 200-day moving average, a key technical level, for the first time in a year. Analysts say a break below this point could trigger another swift sell-off.  “In Brent, we trace a first support at $71.00 followed by the 200-day moving average at $70.23 and $70.00,” Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said. On the supply front, U.S. data on Wednesday showed crude output C-OUT-T-EIA rose by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.9 million bpd in the week ending Aug. 10. Crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA increased by 6.8 million barrels, representing the largest weekly rise since March last year. [EIA/S] “As the end of the summer driving season approaches, crude oil processing is likely to have peaked and should decrease from now on. Net crude oil imports therefore need to decline steeply so that crude oil stocks do not rise any further,” Commerzbank said in a note.

Providing support for Brent crude were looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, set to start from November.

2018-08-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised the goal set out by Mexico’s incoming president to end massive gasoline and diesel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, as a measure that will boost prosperity in its southern neighbor. During a visit on Wednesday to the Mexican capital in which he met with both current officials as well as key advisers to President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Perry brushed off concerns that U.S. refiners stand to lose their biggest foreign market. “It’s a good goal for Mexico. I tip my hat to the president-elect for having that as a goal,” said Perry, a former governor of Texas, the most prominent energy producing and refining U.S. state. “I hope they’re successful with that transition.” So far this year, Mexico has imported an average of 1.19 million barrels per day (bpd) of fuel including gasoline and diesel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Fuel imports now represent 60 percent of the country’s total consumption, as crude processing at Mexico’s domestic refineries has steadily declined. Lopez Obrador won a landslide victory last month and in December will take office as Mexico’s first leftist president in decades.  He has repeatedly promised to end foreign gasoline imports within three years and grow domestic production of value-added fuels at home, pledging to revive the six existing state-owned refineries operated by national oil company Pemex, as well as build a new one. “That’s not going to happen overnight. He knows that, we know that,” Perry told a group of reporters on Wednesday afternoon after meeting with Lopez Obrador’s designated chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, and his future energy minister Rocio Nahle. He said Romo also met with David Malpass, the U.S. Treasury Department’s under secretary for international affairs. “What I heard today was a bit of realism from both Nahle and Romo,” he added, without going into further detail. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), which represents U.S. refiners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Perry’s statement. Perry pointed to growing South American markets as potential new buyers of U.S. refined products, noting that Venezuela’s oil output has plummeted amid a major economic crisis. “We’re going to have more markets, most likely, than we’re going to have product,” he said.

2018-08-16,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq launched an air strike on a gathering of Islamic State fighters in neighbouring Syria, killing members of the hardline militant group who planned cross-border attacks, its military said on Thursday. F-16 fighter jets bombed and destroyed an “operations room” where the militants were meeting. Islamic State, which once occupied a third of Iraq’s territory, has been largely defeated in the country but still poses a threat along its border with Syria. “According to intelligence, those terrorists who were killed were planning criminal operations using suicide vests and intended to target innocents in the next few days inside Iraq,” the military said in a statement. The Iraqi military has carried out several air strikes against Islamic State in Syria since last year, with the approval of President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S.-led coalition fighting the militants. Iraq has good relations with Iran and Russia, Assad’s main backers in the Syrian war, and also enjoys strong support from the U.S.-led coalition. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State in December but the group still operates from pockets along the border with Syria and in a rugged mountainous area in northeastern Iraq. It has continued to carry out ambushes, killings, and bombings across Iraq since it abandoned its goal of creating a self-sufficient caliphate straddling Iraq and Syria.

U.S. equities rose on hopes that Beijing and Washington may resolve a conflict that has roiled financial markets since early March. China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks. The dollar dipped on news of the U.S.-China talks as investors returned to currencies that had been sold off. The Chinese yuan gained 1.1 percent to 6.87 per dollar. The euro rose 0.3 percent after closing the previous day at its lowest point since July 2017. The Turkish lira rose 3.0 percent to 5.79 per dollar, supported by Qatar’s pledge on Wednesday to invest $15 billion in Turkey. Other emerging market currencies, such as Russia’s ruble and Mexico’s peso, also rose. The retreat in the dollar also steadied global equities. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.7 percent. Emerging market stocks, which on Wednesday had fallen more than 20 percent from their January intraday high, edged up 0.0 percent. Metals markets moved higher as well. Copper rose 1.97 percent to $5,915.00 a tonne, after having confirmed a bear market on Wednesday, closing 20.9 percent lower than its recent high reached on June 7. “Investors around the world have been anxious about the U.S.-China trade dispute and its potential impact on global growth,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “Anything that means investors are less concerned about slowing growth in China is good news for emerging markets and good news for parts of the commodities complex.” Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak held a conference call in which he assured international investors that the country would emerge stronger from its currency crisis and that its banks were healthy. Albayrak also said Turkey had no plans to seek help from the International Monetary Fund or impose capital controls to stop money flowing abroad. “I’m not seeing any sign of change in economic policy, but the absence of new bad news is good for the markets,” Warne said of Turkey. In U.S. markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 401.82 points, or 1.6 percent, to 25,564.23, the S&P 500 gained 28.4 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,846.77 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.32 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,840.43. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.44 percent. Hopes that China and the United States could ease trade tensions helped Chinese stocks pare losses. The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.6 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ended 0.8 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei average closed 0.1 percent lower in choppy trade. Oil also recovered somewhat after Wednesday’s slide, though a weakening outlook for crude demand kept prices in check. U.S. crude rose 0.54 percent to $65.36 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.20, up 0.62 percent on the day. U.S. Treasury yields were steady after edging higher overnight on the news of U.S.-China trade talks.

2018-08-16,"OSLO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Norway’s power supply, entirely dependent on hydroelectric dams, will be secure this winter, the energy regulator said on Thursday, as long-awaited rains have begun filling reservoirs. A run of exceptionally warm, dry months until early August depleted Norway’s water supplies, lifting power prices to record highs, triggering power imports from its Nordic neighbours and raising concerns over power security this winter. Rain was so scarce over the summer that the Norwegian Lutheran Church asked believers to light candles and pray for rain. Water had begun flowing into reservoirs more quickly in the last two weeks, although the power market was still in deficit, the water resources and energy directorate (NVE) said in a statement. “However, in NVE’s view, there is no danger of security of supply next winter,” the regulator said. The NVE said that despite the lower-than-normal reservoir filling rate, the reservoirs still contained a lot of water and if necessary, Norway could import power through connections with Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. In years of average rainfall, Norway has a power surplus of about 5 terawatt hours (TWh) and the country can meet its power needs even in years of less than average rainfall, the NVE added. Norway’s reservoirs were 62.6 percent full, power exchange Nordpool said on Wednesday, up from 60.9 percent last week. However, the NVE said the content of the reservoirs was 18 percentage points lower than normal and “will most likely not reach the norm this year.” Even though security of supply will not be at risk, Norway’s regulator said it expected reservoir levels to hit a record low during the winter. Norway’s power imports exceeded its exports in several days during the summer, as its hydropower-driven power price topped those of its Nordic and continental Europe neighbours.

2018-08-16,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - En+ Group (ENPLq.L), hit by U.S. sanctions against Russia in April, said on Thursday it was investigating the possibility of re-domiciling from Britain’s Jersey to one of Russia’s new offshore zones.  London-listed En+ Group, which manages the energy and aluminium businesses of Oleg Deripaska, was one of eight companies with ties to the Russian tycoon to be placed on a U.S. Treasury blacklist in April. The sanctions were related to Moscow’s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. En+ also said on Thursday that its board had already approved a move from Cyprus to Russia of one of its subsidiaries - En+ Holding Limited - which manages the group’s energy division. Relocating En+ Holding Limited would allow the group to benefit from Russian legislation creating a domestic equivalent to foreign offshore tax havens. The legislation, passed through Russia’s lower house in July, established two ‘special administrative regions’ within Russia - on Russky Island in the Sea of Japan and on Oktyabrsky, an island on a river in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Foreign companies registering in these regions enjoy the benefits of special tax regulations, including zero taxes on profits received by way of dividends. Since the sanctions En+ Group has taken several steps to protect its many hydropower and aluminium businesses. Deripaska has stepped down from the group’s board.     Greg Barker, En+ chairman, said: “The Group was an early corporate supporter of the progressive Russian legislation that makes this improvement to our ownership structure possible.” “(En+) looks forward to being amongst the first major international Russian companies to take advantage of this opportunity,” Barker said. The company also said it remained committed to its listing on the London Stock Exchange. En+ listed in London last November via an initial public offering. The London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) declined to comment. Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking in the aftermath of the April sanctions, had said the government could not help Russian companies hit by sanctions and other curbs if they were registered and kept their capital abroad. “I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia,” Putin said. “Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there... (They) are better off being in Russia,” Putin said. In February, Moscow renewed a measure offering amnesty to those returning capital to Russia and scrapping a 13 percent profit tax on repatriated funds.

2018-08-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - If the global economy starts to grow more slowly, the impact will show up first in the price of refined fuels such as road diesel, marine gasoil and jet fuel that play a central role in the freight transport system. Middle distillate fuels are principally burned in the high-powered engines used in trucks, railroads, ships, barges and aircraft to move freight around the world, as well as in factories, on farms and at mines and oilfields. Mid-distillates account for more than a third of the oil used around the world every day, and are the single-largest category of refined products, (“Statistical review of world energy”, BP, 2018). Distillate fuels are closely correlated with the global economic and trade cycle, and at the moment they confirm other indications the rate of growth is slowing. U.S. distillate stocks, which had been drawing down faster than usual during the first four months of 2018, have now been building faster than normal since late May. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2vPGI7d) European gasoil futures prices, which had been in substantial backwardation, have shifted towards flat or even contango since the end of May, reflecting improved availability. Gasoil futures still command a hefty premium over crude for deliveries in 2019, but the premium has been eroding over the same time frame. In line with these trends, hedge funds and other money managers have become markedly less bullish on the outlook for distillate prices over the last three months. Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positioning in U.S. heating oil by 29 million barrels (33 percent) and in European gasoil by 53 million barrels (33 percent) since late May. Over the same period, bullish positions in U.S. gasoline have been cut by 14 million barrels (12 percent), according to regulatory and exchange data. Distillate markets are sending the same signal as a range of other indicators: the rate of global output growth has decelerated in recent months after a very strong expansion in 2017.

Asian equities had hit one-year lows overnight as they tracked Wednesday’s global falls and Tencent results disappointed, but a fresh high for London’s FTSE and modest gains elsewhere pulled Europe and Wall Street futures up. At the same time a dip in the dollar, the sight of the lira moving back to 5.8 per dollar and a higher Chinese yuan also steadied emerging market currencies such as South Africa’s rand, Russia’s rouble and Mexico’s peso. Emerging market stocks did nudge lower again, though, after they had crossed the 20 percent peak-to-trough threshold that defines a ‘bear’ market. Metals markets also clawed higher, however, after copper had also entered ‘bear’ territory. “The Chinese are heading to Washington and yuan bounced, the Qataris are heading to Ankara and the lira bounced and that has left everything else floating around really,” said Societe Generale’s global head of currency strategy Kit Juckes. He added that it was still too early to sound the all clear around Turkey - its new finance minister and son-in-law of President Tayyip Erdogan was about to hold a global conference call - and that the broader worries were still around the extent of China’s economic slowdown. China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks in late August at the invitation of Washington. Hopes that it could ease trade tensions helped Chinese stocks pare losses, with both Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index each down 0.8 percent. Earlier in the day, Shanghai was down as much as 1.9 percent while Hong Kong was off 1.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average closed 0.1 percent lower in choppy trade, with the benchmark falling as much as 1.5 percent before a brief swing into positive territory on China news. The euro rose 0.2 percent from a 13-1/2 month low and the offshore Chinese yuan gained 0.8 percent following the Sino-U.S. trade talk news. U.S. stock futures jumped 0.5-0.8 percent. “The news (of the China-U.S. trade talks) triggered short-covering but I think fundamentally it is of limited significance,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. He said Turkey’s market swings reflect the fact that it is one of the more vulnerable parts of the global economy at this stage in the interest rate cycle, as the Federal Reserve seeks to normalise U.S. monetary policy. However, Sakuma noted there were arguably larger risks for investors, such as the weak earnings from Tencent Holdings. . The Chinese tech giant reported its first quarterly profit fall in nearly 13 years on weak gaming revenue. It holds a 40 percent stake in the U.S. firm that makes cult game Fortnite. While that may be booming, China’s regulator this week has signalled it is clamping down on some of these types of games. That had knocked other Asian tech firms with South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, Asia’s third largest firm by market capitalisation, down to a one-year low. Back in Europe, Italy’s stock market sank 1.6 percent to its lowest level since April 2017 as motorway operator Atlantia fell 20 percent. The Italian government said it could be heavily fined or stripped of its contracts following the deadly collapse of a bridge in Genoa. Though metals strengthened, oil prices were also left flat after data showed a surprise weekly increase in U.S. crude stockpiles, compounding worries about a weaker global economic growth. Brent was at just over $71 a barrel and U.S. crude oil last stood at $65.17, having fallen to two-month lows of $64.42, following Wednesday’s 3.2 percent fall. On the bond market, the tentative recovery in risk appetite also saw yields on German Bunds and U.S. Treasury, regarded as safe investments in times of trouble, nudge up. “The overnight news that the Chinese are sending a delegation to the U.S. is helping support risk sentiment,” said ING strategist Martin van Vliet.

The three platforms are Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar. “The scheduled 24-hour stoppage on Monday (20 August) will still go ahead as planned,” Unite said in an emailed statement. The workers are striking over proposed changes to their working rotas and pay. The union said its officials had met representatives from Total on Thursday where the union made a series of counter-proposals, to be discussed at talks scheduled for Aug. 23. Unite said further strikes are planned for Sept. 3, Sept. 17, Oct. 1, Oct. 15 and Oct. 29. The fields account for about 10 percent of Britain’s gas output, while their oil production contributes about 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the Forties and Brent Blend crude streams.

2018-08-16,"* DNO to pay annual dividend of NOK 434 million * Faroe Petroleum seeks to keep DNO off its board (Adds share price move, analyst, Faroe statement) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - DNO will pay its first dividend in 13 years following strong half-year earnings, and the Middle-East and North Sea focused oil company also said it would demand seats on the board of London-listed rival Faroe Petroleum Plc. Earlier this year, DNO built a 28.23 percent stake in Faroe, becoming its largest shareholder, and prompting speculation about a full takeover. Faroe’s board on Thursday unanimously recommended that shareholders reject DNO’s proposal to appoint two DNO executives to its board, saying it could cause conflicts of interest. DNO’s stake in Faroe means it can call for an extraordinary shareholder meeting and DNO’s Managing Director Bjoern Dale told a news conference that he expected Faroe to hold an EGM within six weeks. DNO’s Executive Chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani declined to speak about the company’s further plans regarding the Faroe stake. “That’s not the conversation we are having today, we are focused on our operational performance,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. In May, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Faroe, which is developing a number of promising oil prospects in Norway, had hired investment bank Rothschild to prepare for a potential takeover bid by DNO. Under British takeover rules, DNO would be free to increase its stake in Faroe from the beginning of November. “As a full takeover of Faroe will reduce the overall cost of capital for DNO ... takeover of Faroe at a cost of 180-200 pence per share may be value accretive for DNO,” Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said. Faroe’s shares traded 0.3 percent higher at 1113 GMT on Thursday at 138.5 pence, while DNO was up 1.3 percent at 19 Norwegian crowns per share.

DNO also said it planned to boost output from its Peshkabir field in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to 50,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) by the year-end, after surpassing a previous target of 30,000 bopd in July. “With growing production and robust and reliable revenues, the dividend announcement underscores confidence in our strong growth prospects,” Mossavar-Rahmani said. “Kurdistan is back and so is DNO.” ($1 = 8.4163 Norwegian crowns) (Editing by Terje Solsvik, David Evans and Jane Merriman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/dno-results/update-2-dno-to-pay-first-dividend-in-13-years-seeks-faroe-board-seats-idUKL5N1V71BQ,16 Aug 2018,"* Faroe Petroleum seeks to keep DNO off its board

2018-08-16,"(Repeats earlier story with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The recent gyrations in the world economy around Turkey’s currency and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute have taken a toll on commodity prices, especially industrial metals. However, while news-driven sentiment can clearly pummel markets, over a longer period of time not all commodities will be equally affected by the changing global economic dynamics. The key to which commodities are likely to perform better is China, which is the world’s largest commodity importer. Even if the Chinese economy does struggle under the weight of the trade barriers erected by U.S. President Donald Trump, there are still likely to be commodities that can hold their own. The key is to look for commodities that are likely to remain in relatively high demand, and are subject to supply constraints. On this basis, coal becomes the darling of the commodity complex, as Chinese import demand has been robust and will likely remain so as Beijing cuts back on domestic output as part of efforts to cut pollution. China’s coal imports surged 15 percent to 175.2 million tonnes in the first seven months of the year from the same period last year, according to customs data. And it’s not just China boosting coal, with the world’s second-largest importer, India, also increasing overseas purchases by about 7.8 percent in the first seven months to about 112.2 million tonnes. While it’s true that Chinese import demand for coal has been partially driven by higher power generation because of the recent heatwave, the market may also be changing from a structural perspective. China’s coal output fell 2 percent in July from the prior month to 281.5 million tonnes, the lowest in two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 14. While coal has in recent weeks reached 6-1/2 year highs of around $120 a tonne, China is also importing more less-polluting natural gas, both in a liquefied state on ships and by pipeline from neighbouring countries. Imports of pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose 34.3 percent in the first seven months of the year to 49.43 million tonnes, according to customs data. While the rate of growth has slowed from 2017’s breakneck speed, China is still increasing its demand for natural gas at a pace that is rapidly eating away expectations of an oversupplied LNG market after the commissioning of several new projects in Australia and the United States. However, coal is still a better bet than LNG from a supply perspective, with major exporters Australia, Indonesia and South Africa all largely unable to boost exports as mines are already running at capacity and new projects have been lacking. Only the United States can realistically supply much more coal to the global market, and its exports to China are now uncompetitive after Beijing slapped a tariff on them in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on its goods. The other commodities that China may exert a positive influence upon are those most likely to benefit from the current ramp-up in infrastructure spending, most likely iron ore, coking coal and steel. Beijing has once again opened the fiscal taps in an effort to counteract any economic slowing caused by the trade dispute with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. China rolled out a $14 billion urban railway plan on Aug. 14 and pushed local governments to speed up the issuance of special infrastructure bonds amid fears of a slowdown in fixed asset investment, which grew at 5.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, below market expectations. While these, and other measures, do little to ease worries about credit quality in China, from a commodity perspective they are likely to underpin demand for the steel complex, and perhaps to a lesser extent copper, which is also used in construction for wiring. Another factor worth noting is that while the commodities likely to perform better on the back of Chinese demand are all tradable, they are nowhere near as liquid as the ones that may underperform. Crude oil, natural gas, copper and other metals such as zinc and nickel, all have deep and liquid futures markets. While paper coal markets are well established, they are tiny in comparison, and the same can be said for iron ore and LNG. They key to success in commodity markets in what may be challenging times ahead may lie in being a commodity that remains in demand in China and is less accessible to your average investor.

2018-08-16,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan must act urgently to protect tens of thousands of workers laboring to clean up the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station from reported exploitation and exposure to radiation, U.N. human rights experts said on Thursday. Tokyo Electric Power Co Holdings (Tepco), which owns the nuclear power station that was struck by a tsunami in 2011 that set off meltdowns, has been widely criticized for its treatment of workers and its handling of the cleanup, which is expected to take decades. A Reuters investigation in 2013 found widespread labor abuses, including workers who said their pay was skimmed and spoke of scant scrutiny of working conditions. Tepco said at the time it was taking steps to limit worker abuses. Three U.N. experts, who report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said in a statement released in Geneva that exposure to radiation remained a major hazard for workers trying to clean up the plant, and workers were in danger of exploitation. “Workers hired to decontaminate Fukushima reportedly include migrant workers, asylum seekers and people who are homeless,” said the three: Baskut Tuncak, an expert on hazardous substances, Dainius Puras, an expert on health, and Urmila Bhoola, an expert on contemporary slavery. “We are deeply concerned about possible exploitation regarding the risks of exposure to radiation, possible coercion into accepting hazardous working conditions because of economic hardships, and the adequacy of training and protective measures,” they said. A spokesman for Tepco and a foreign ministry official said they were unable to immediately comment on the statement. The U.N. rights experts have been engaged in a dialogue with the Japanese government since last year, they said, with the government accepting to “follow up” on some recommendations.

Gazprom Neft’s second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to 193.1 billion roubles, from 114.4 billion roubles in the same period last year. Second-quarter sales totalled 617.1 billion roubles compared with 475.7 billion roubles a year ago. Gazprom Neft’s first half crude oil output declined 0.6 percent year-on-year because of a global oil deal between OPEC and other oil producers to curb output, the company said. Russia in July said it planned to increase production again after OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to ease production curbs. Gazprom Neft said second-quarter crude oil output rose 3.6 percent quarter on quarter due to higher output in Iraq, its increased share in the Arcticgas venture and the longer duration of the second quarter. $1 = 66.8075 roubles

Investors want to see a resolution to the standoff between workers and Eskom as any further strikes could lead to widespread power cuts that have hobbled Africa’s most developed economy in the past. Eskom and its three main unions reached the outline deal a week ago, agreeing on salary increases of 7.5 percent this year and 7 percent next year and in 2020, plus other benefits. As part of the deal, the two largest unions with workers at Eskom, NUM and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, wanted members who participated in an illegal strike to not face disciplinary action, a condition Eskom rejected. The utility on Wednesday sought arbitration relating to the disciplinary dispute, threatening to delay implementation of a wage deal to avoid further power cuts. “As the NUM, we are ready to sign the deal anytime,” said NUM President Joseph Montisetse in a statement. “On the issue of taking disciplinary action against our members, we are saying the matter could be resolved outside the bargaining unit.

2018-08-16,"* Graphic of oil majors' Africa reserves tmsnrt.rs/2MbStPz By Bate Felix PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Shortly after launching a new project in Angola, French oil major Total said it was searching for more resources in Africa, including in Senegal and Mauritania. The company is historically strong in Africa and, buoyed by rising oil prices and improved terms for its multi-billion dollar Kaombo contract in Angola, it is doubling down. Guy Maurice, Total’s head of exploration and production in Africa, told Reuters that the company had completed seismic surveys and planned to start drilling exploratory wells in Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa. He did not give a specific timeframe, but a source familiar with the matter said the drilling would begin at the end of this year or in early 2019. Total has broken ranks with some of its rivals in recent years and largely ignored the rush to U.S. shale. It is looking to eke out conventional oil and gas resources, seeking projects in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The strategy carries risks. It has left the company exposed to political instability that has deterred some competitors. And although production costs in its sub-Saharan Africa oil and gas operations have fallen from $2.1 billion in 2014 to $1.3 billion in 2017, they remain the highest among six geographic regions Total operates in, according to its 2017 annual report. Total started production at the deep offshore Kaombo North project in Angola at the end of July. It has also announced it will launch another field in the southern African country, Zinia 2, which is expected to pump oil in 2020. The company has a bigger presence in Africa than its rivals, although several of them are also major producers there and have invested billions of dollars in recent projects. Exxon Mobil, for example, bought a 25 percent stake in Eni’s Rovuma development in Mozambique last year for $2.8 billion. Total has the largest proven reserves in Africa among the world’s top oil companies last year, according to a Reuters analysis of company statements. With 1.7 billion of barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in reserves in sub-Saharan Africa, it outstrips Eni’s 1.5 billion. For the African continent as a whole, Chevron has 1.34 billion boe, Exxon Mobil 1.1 billion and Royal Dutch Shell 630 million. Investors and analysts are looking closely at whether Total can keep a lid on costs in Angola, where it has struggled to rein in spending in recent years and in 2014 needed oil prices at around $70 a barrel to break even. Total’s Maurice told Reuters that a renegotiation with the Angolan government and suppliers had allowed Total to shave off $4 billion from the initial $20 billion budget for Kaombo. On Zinia 2, capital expenditure was reduced by more than 50 percent to $1.2 billion from $2.8 billion, he added. While prices have rebounded since the 2014 market collapse, nothing can be taken for granted, said Maurice. “Prices have gone from $26 per barrel to over $70, but we are not going to be bringing out the champagne, because volatility is still there. We could still fall back to $50 per barrel tomorrow.” “At higher oil prices at $120 per barrel, you don’t look too closely at what you spend,” said Maurice, referring to negotiating contracts with suppliers and the government. He said the company’s break-even oil price had come down as a result of its cost savings, but did not specify the price. The $16 billion Kaombo project - Kaombo North, plus Kaombo South which is due to start up next year - will produce an estimated 230,000 barrels of oil per day at peak, according to Total, and is expected to increase Angola’s output by 10 percent. Zinia will add another 40,000 barrels per day. “A lot of the majors have had their heads turned by tight (shale) oil in the U.S., but Total has not really gone that route. They’re still focused on West Africa, and Angola’s a big part of that,” said Adam Pollard, a senior research analyst on Africa oil and gas at Wood Mackenzie. For Angola, an oil-dependent OPEC member and Africa’s second largest crude exporter, Total’s commitment was important because its output had been declining steadily due to the lack of investments in its ageing offshore fields. In Nigeria, Total’s Egina field is expected to start production in December and it will make a final investment decision on its Ikike tie-back project this year, as well as its Lake Albert project in Uganda. The company expects these projects to help it increase its African production by 7 percent to 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020 compared with 2014. It has also bought oil blocks in Guinea, Namibia, South Africa and Kenya.

2018-08-16,"* President Lourenço reforming Africa’s No.2 oil sector * New agency would break state energy firm’s monopoly * Angola oil output in decline By Stephen Eisenhammer LUANDA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Angola will launch next year a new agency to handle oil concessions, the government said on Thursday, as President João Lourenço pushes ahead with reforms aimed at boosting production in Africa’s second biggest oil industry. The creation of a National Agency of Petroleum and Gas to manage and sell oil blocks reduces the near total grip state energy firm Sonangol has over the sector. Since Lourenço became president in September, he has moved to overhaul Sonangol which has been criticised by transparency and rights groups for a lack of transparency as both producer and regulator. Angola hopes the shift will help reverse a decline in oil output in the OPEC member by reducing bureaucracy and speeding up the pace at which company investments can be approved. It is part of a series of measures taken by Lourenço aimed at revamping the sector, including tax breaks for the development of marginal fields and new legislation for gas rights. Angola’s oil production is expected to fall to 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018 compared to 1.9 million barrels a decade ago. Without a spike in fresh investment, production is set to fall to 1 million barrels per day by 2023, according to the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Oil. The decline is partly due to a fall in crude prices and a lack of investment appetite from international majors given the high relative cost of production in Angola’s offshore fields. But the government has also concluded that a bottleneck in the approval of new projects at Sonangol under the previous management of Isabel dos Santos, daughter of Lourenço’s predecessor, was also responsible. The ministry said the new agency would be rolled out from January 2019 and would gradually take over functions from Sonangol. By December 2020, the agency should be fully operational. “For Sonangol the proposed model allows it to focus on its core activities,” the ministry said. The restructuring of Sonangol, according to the statement, will also involve the shedding of under-performing assets outside the oil sector in which the company invested during the oil boom.

2018-08-16,"* Japan boosts imports of U.S. LPG after record volumes in 2017 * Chinese imports of LPG from United States slow to trickle * Could help Tokyo ease pressure from Trump over trade surplus * U.S. LPG exports to China, Japan: tmsnrt.rs/2BgiCrz By Osamu Tsukimori TOKYO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Japanese utilities and industrial companies are snapping up U.S. cargoes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) that are seeking a new home after Chinese buyers started to shun them amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing. Taking in fuel that would otherwise be heading for China means Japanese imports of U.S. LPG are set to stay strong after already hitting record levels earlier this year. Robust Japanese purchases of LPG, often used as fuel for transport or cooking, underscore how the impact from the festering trade dispute between Washington and China is rippling across supply chains around the world. The uptick could also help Tokyo rebuff pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cut a multi-billion dollar trade surplus or face rising tariffs. “U.S. LPG is facing difficulties reaching China,” said Seiya Araki, president of Astomos Energy, a major Japanese buyer of the fuel. “That has helped push large flows of U.S. LPG to Japan and South Korea, and there’s a high chance that the share of U.S.-produced LPG would rise further.” Japanese government data released on Thursday shows the country’s imports of LPG from the United States jumped about 13 percent in July from the same month last year to around 460,000 tonnes, while ship tracking data indicates that just a single U.S. LPG cargo has left for China since the start of July. Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade battle, with both sides slapping steep tariffs on each other’s goods in a fight that has sparked dire warnings of economic doom and gloom. China announced earlier this month that it would impose 25 percent additional tariffs on imports of 333 U.S. goods worth $16 billion from Aug. 23, including LPG. In the United States, LPG is a by-product of natural gas production and U.S. exports have surged on the back of the shale gas boom of the past decade. U.S. LPG exports now compete with supplies from the Middle East. In Japan, the world’s No.3 importer of LPG, U.S. supplies hit an all-time high of 6.09 million tonnes in 2017. They marked a monthly record of 738,016 tonnes in April this year. U.S. supplies of the fuel, which includes propane and butane, amounted to about 70 percent of total imports in May, according to the Japan LP Gas Association. The U.S. has become increasingly price competitive. Taking freight and insurance into account, Japanese government data shows U.S. LPG prices are mostly cheaper than Middle Eastern benchmark Saudi Arabian supplies. Trump has already imposed tariffs on Japanese steel and aluminium and is threatening to place duties on crucial auto exports from Japan if trade isn’t more balanced. Talks on “free, fair and reciprocal” trade between the U.S. and Japan ended last Friday without any agreement, with the two sides set to meet again in September. Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori

2018-08-16,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand will ban imports of 432 types of scrap electronics within six months, an environment ministry official said on Thursday, the latest country to respond to China’s crackdown on imports of high-tech trash this year. Southeast Asia nations fear they are the new dumping ground for the world’s trash after China banned the entry of several types of waste as part of a campaign against “foreign garbage”. Thailand’s ban comes weeks after regional neighbour Vietnam said it would stop issuing new licenses for waste imports and crack down on illegal shipments of paper, plastic and metal. The Thai ban covers 432 types of electronic refuse — from electronic circuit boards to old television and radio parts — and will take effect within six months, a senior environment ministry official told Reuters on Thursday. He said the ban was agreed at a meeting on Wednesday chaired by Surasak Kanchanarat, the environment minister. “The meeting yesterday passed a resolution to stop importing 432 kinds of electronic waste and to ensure...that this is enforced within six months,” said the official, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Mongukol Pruekwatana, director general of the department of industrial works, told Reuters a full list of banned items would be announced soon. E-waste - commonly defined as any device with an electric cord or battery - can be mined for valuable metals such as gold, silver and copper. However, it can also include hazardous material such as lead, mercury and cadmium. Surasak told Thai media on Wednesday that imports of some electronic appliances and second-hand devices would be allowed if these items can be repaired and reused. Scrap metal, including aluminium, copper and steel, can still be imported for industrial use, but must be separated at the country of origin and cleaned, he said. Thailand’s e-waste ban follows a series of raids that began in May on factories accused of illegally importing and processing electronic waste. Environmentalists say waste once destined for China is being re-routed to Southeast Asia, and new laws are needed or existing laws better enforced to prevent illegal imports. Vietnam’s central bank said on Wednesday it has asked banks to tighten lending to projects deemed environmentally unfriendly. It said banks must have strategies for environmental risk management by 2025. Thailand also planned to ban imports of plastic waste in the next two years, the environment ministry official said, but he gave no details of the programme. The death of a pilot whale in June found with some 80 pieces of plastic rubbish in its stomach focussed attention on what environmentalists call Thailand’s “addiction” to plastic bags and packaging. Thailand’s military government has said improving the country’s waste management infrastructure is a priority and set goals for 2021. They included cutting the use of plastic bags and bottles in government agencies and businesses, and plastic bans in tourist destinations. A tax on plastic bags has also been mentioned, along with a target to recycle up to 60 percent of plastic by 2021.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent, after shedding as much as 1.1 percent to hit its lowest since Aug. 11, 2017. Spreadbetters expected a better tone in European equities, forecasting a higher open for Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks in late August at the invitation of Washington. That helped Chinese stocks pare losses, with both Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index each down 0.8 percent. Earlier in the day, Shanghai was down as much as 1.9 percent while Hong Kong was off 1.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average closed 0.1 percent lower in choppy trade, with the benchmark falling as much as 1.5 percent before a brief swing into positive territory on China news. The euro rose 0.3 percent and the offshore Chinese yuan gained 0.8 percent following Sino-U.S. trade talk news. U.S. stock futures rose 0.4 percent. The announcement by the Chinese commerce ministry of the planned meeting in late August comes after a lull in talks between the two sides. The last official round of talks was in early June when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing. Despite the modest reprieve, markets remain vulnerable as signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy and Turkey’s volatile currency keep investors on guard. “The news (of the China-U.S. trade talks) triggered short-covering but I think fundamentally it is of limited significance,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. Sakuma said Turkey’s market swings reflect the fact that it is one of the more vulnerable parts of the global economy at this stage in the interest rate cycle, as the Federal Reserve seeks to normalise its monetary policy.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent, after shedding as much as 1.1 percent to hit its lowest since Aug. 11, 2017. Spreadbetters expected a better tone in European equities, forecasting a higher open for Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. China on Thursday said a delegation led by its vice commerce minister would travel to the United States for talks in late August at the invitation of Washington. That helped Chinese stocks pare losses, with both Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index each down 0.8 percent. Earlier in the day, Shanghai was down as much as 1.9 percent while Hong Kong was off 1.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei average closed 0.1 percent lower in choppy trade, with the benchmark falling as much as 1.5 percent before a brief swing into positive territory on China news. The euro rose 0.3 percent and the offshore Chinese yuan gained 0.8 percent following Sino-U.S. trade talk news. U.S. stock futures rose 0.4 percent. The announcement by the Chinese commerce ministry of the planned meeting in late August comes after a lull in talks between the two sides. The last official round of talks was in early June when U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing. Despite the modest reprieve, markets remain vulnerable as signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy and Turkey’s volatile currency keep investors on guard. “The news (of the China-U.S. trade talks) triggered short-covering but I think fundamentally it is of limited significance,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. Sakuma said Turkey’s market swings reflect the fact that it is one of the more vulnerable parts of the global economy at this stage in the interest rate cycle, as the Federal Reserve seeks to normalise its monetary policy. However, he noted there were arguably larger risks for investors, such as weak earnings from Tencent Holdings Ltd .

2018-08-16,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The recent gyrations in the world economy around Turkey’s currency and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute have taken a toll on commodity prices, especially industrial metals. However, while news-driven sentiment can clearly pummel markets, over a longer period of time not all commodities will be equally affected by the changing global economic dynamics. The key to which commodities are likely to perform better is China, which is the world’s largest commodity importer. Even if the Chinese economy does struggle under the weight of the trade barriers erected by U.S. President Donald Trump, there are still likely to be commodities that can hold their own. The key is to look for commodities that are likely to remain in relatively high demand, and are subject to supply constraints. On this basis, coal becomes the darling of the commodity complex, as Chinese import demand has been robust and will likely remain so as Beijing cuts back on domestic output as part of efforts to cut pollution. China’s coal imports surged 15 percent to 175.2 million tonnes in the first seven months of the year from the same period last year, according to customs data. And it’s not just China boosting coal, with the world’s second-largest importer, India, also increasing overseas purchases by about 7.8 percent in the first seven months to about 112.2 million tonnes. While it’s true that Chinese import demand for coal has been partially driven by higher power generation because of the recent heatwave, the market may also be changing from a structural perspective. China’s coal output fell 2 percent in July from the prior month to 281.5 million tonnes, the lowest in two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 14. While coal has in recent weeks reached 6-1/2 year highs of around $120 a tonne, China is also importing more less-polluting natural gas, both in a liquefied state on ships and by pipeline from neighbouring countries. Imports of pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose 34.3 percent in the first seven months of the year to 49.43 million tonnes, according to customs data. While the rate of growth has slowed from 2017’s breakneck speed, China is still increasing its demand for natural gas at a pace that is rapidly eating away expectations of an oversupplied LNG market after the commissioning of several new projects in Australia and the United States. However, coal is still a better bet than LNG from a supply perspective, with major exporters Australia, Indonesia and South Africa all largely unable to boost exports as mines are already running at capacity and new projects have been lacking. Only the United States can realistically supply much more coal to the global market, and its exports to China are now uncompetitive after Beijing slapped a tariff on them in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on its goods. The other commodities that China may exert a positive influence upon are those most likely to benefit from the current ramp-up in infrastructure spending, most likely iron ore, coking coal and steel. Beijing has once again opened the fiscal taps in an effort to counteract any economic slowing caused by the trade dispute with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. China rolled out a $14 billion urban railway plan on Aug. 14 and pushed local governments to speed up the issuance of special infrastructure bonds amid fears of a slowdown in fixed asset investment, which grew at 5.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, below market expectations. While these, and other measures, do little to ease worries about credit quality in China, from a commodity perspective they are likely to underpin demand for the steel complex, and perhaps to a lesser extent copper, which is also used in construction for wiring. Another factor worth noting is that while the commodities likely to perform better on the back of Chinese demand are all tradable, they are nowhere near as liquid as the ones that may underperform. Crude oil, natural gas, copper and other metals such as zinc and nickel, all have deep and liquid futures markets. While paper coal markets are well established, they are tiny in comparison, and the same can be said for iron ore and LNG. They key to success in commodity markets in what may be challenging times ahead may lie in being a commodity that remains in demand in China and is less accessible to your average investor.

2018-08-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tough new rules on marine fuel are forcing shipowners to explore liquefied natural gas as a cleaner alternative and ports such as Gibraltar are preparing to offer upgraded refuelling facilities in the shipping industry’s biggest shake-up in decades.  From 2020, International Maritime Organisation rules will ban ships from using fuels with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped to clean up sulphur emissions. This will be enforced by fines levied by the IMO’s member states. Using LNG to power ships instead of heavy fuel oil or the lighter marine gasoil can reduce polluting emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides by 90 to 95 percent, according to industry estimates. The stakes are high. Analysts at Swiss bank UBS estimate that the green shipping market could be worth at least $250 billion over the next five years.  To scoop up some that market, the British territory of Gibraltar is in the process of launching an LNG-fuelled power station whose accompanying storage tanks will also be able to be used to refuel cargo ships via barges. Gibraltar already supplies the most marine fuel of any port in the Mediterranean and aims to do the same with LNG, said Manuel Tirado, chief executive of the Gibraltar Port Authority. “The GPA’s aim is to be the number one LNG bunker port in the Med, however, this is something that will not happen overnight,” he told Reuters. The shipping industry is under pressure to cut its emissions of the main greenhouse gas which causes global warming - carbon dioxide (CO2) - by at least 50 percent by mid-century from 2008 levels, after the IMO agreed on a target in April after years of debate. [nL8N1RQ4IX]  Although still a fossil fuel, LNG emits 10 to 20 percent less CO2 than even low-sulphur fuel oil.    A period of low oil prices slowed the take-up of LNG as a marine fuel. But over the past year, as the oil price has risen, appetite has grown in the cruise ship industry as well as in the container, cargo and tanker sectors.  There are currently 125 ships around the world using LNG, according to ship certification experts DNV GL, with between 400 to 600 expected to be delivered by 2020. That is a still small fraction of a world fleet of more than 60,000 commercial ships.   Valuation company VesselsValue said 78 ships with dual-fuel engines capable of using LNG would be delivered in 2018, the largest annual number to date. “Over the last year or so there is a growing consensus among shipowners that LNG is a reasonable next step. It is gaining traction,” said Martin Wold, a senior consultant at DNV GL. But the transition to LNG will take time, with low-sulphur oil-based fuels also used to replace heavy oil.  By 2050, DNV GL forecasts that only 47 percent of energy for shipping will come from oil-based fuels. Gas fuels will account for 32 percent, and the rest will be provided by carbon-neutral energy sources, such as biofuels and electricity. The global shipping fleet now consumes about 4 million barrels per day of high-sulphur fuel oil. Thomson Reuters Research estimates show fuel accounts for about half of a ship’s daily operating cost.        One of the challenges in using LNG to power ships has been the investment needed to build the required refuelling facilities. In addition, commercial vessels powered by LNG cost around $5 million more than regular ships. Retrofitting is also costly as existing ships require space to install much bigger fuel tanks to keep the super-cooled gas from evaporating. For Gibraltar, the construction of the new LNG power plant by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) will help to create some of the required ship refuelling infrastructure.  “The LNG for the power plant will be used solely for the power plant. However, the same marine infrastructure that provides the LNG for the power plant will also be able to be utilised to supply LNG to vessels. The current focus is to deliver LNG by barge,” said Tirado, the Gibraltar Port Authority chief. Tirado said authorities in Gibraltar were working on a legal framework that would allow ships to be refuelled with LNG in the near future. A Shell spokeswoman said the supply of LNG to Gibraltar “opens up the possibility for other future LNG applications in Gibraltar, such as the use of LNG as a cleaner burning maritime fuel”.     Malta is studying the provision of LNG refuelling facilities at its ports and other places such as Barcelona are working on providing LNG bunkering. Zeebrugge and Rotterdam are already supplying LNG via barges.  Elsewhere, several LNG bunkering vessels, from which merchant ships can refuel, have been delivered to operate in locations such as the Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp region, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the coast of Florida.  “We are reaching a tipping point where shipowners are starting to commit to LNG-fired ships at scale,” said Maarten Wetselaar, head of integrated gas and new energies at Shell. PLANNING FOR THE LONG-TERM To meet the sulphur rules in 2020, shipping companies can use low-sulphur fuel, install a scrubber and continue to use heavy fuel oil, or switch to LNG. Sulphur scrubbers can cost up to $10 million per ship and will not help lower CO2 emissions in the longer term, according to analysts at UBS. In the future, ships could be fuelled by methanol, biofuels, fuel-cell systems or hydrogen, but these are not technologically advanced enough and very costly. Since demand will inevitably shift to compliant fuels - low sulphur in the short-term, as well as LNG - the main losers will be refiners unless they adjust their production mix. Refuellers slow to switch away from offering heavy oil may also get caught out. French container shipping line CMA CGM, the fourth biggest in the world, has said it has ordered nine mega vessels for delivery from 2020 which will be powered by LNG, one of several options it is pursuing.  “Replacing the entire fleet with long-term solutions will take years so the group is committed to implement several solutions during this period,” CMA CGM said.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas environment regulators should coordinate shutdowns of oil refineries and other petrochemical plants during major storms to avoid big releases of air pollution like during last year’s Hurricane Harvey, a report said on Thursday.   A year ago Harvey dumped more than 60 inches (1.5 meters) of rain on southeastern Texas, halting refineries that produce a quarter of U.S. fuel and damaging infrastructure. Texas industry, including refineries and petrochemical plants, released an extra 8.3 million pounds (3.8 million kg) of air pollutants including cancer-causing benzene, during Harvey, said the report by the Washington-based Environmental Integrity Project.  (The report, called ""Preparing for the Next Storm"" can be seen at: bit.ly/2Mkw1Ur) Most of that pollution was released in the Houston area, where refineries did not shut until the rains arrived, three days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a warning for coastal counties. Much of that pollution resulted from equipment malfunctions and electrical outages, emissions that could have been avoided if the state coordinated early shutdowns, the report said. In Corpus Christi, refineries that shut before rains came released less pollution on average, the report said.   Houston suffered three high ozone days, which can be dangerous for people with lung and heart conditions, following Harvey, including the worst day for smog in Texas in 2017.  “The state should take a more hands-on approach for future storms because with climate change we are going to have more storms like this,” said Tom Pelton, a spokesman at the EIP, headed by former Environmental Protection Agency director of civil enforcement, Eric Schaeffer.  The report recommended that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality “plan, coordinate and stagger the often- complicated shutdowns of major industrial facilities during hurricanes and other disasters, as well as the subsequent restarting of plants,” to reduce pollution. It also recommended that the state not suspend pollution reporting requirements during future natural disasters as it did for months after Harvey. TCEQ spokesman Brian McGovern said every storm is unique and every plant is unique, so developing a one-size-fits-all approach “would be a virtually impossible task.”   Refining companies should invest in robust backup power generation systems and the best available pollution controls to reduce emissions during storms, EIP said. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry group, had no immediate comment on the report’s recommendations and wanted to review the entire report before responding, spokesman Michael Frohlich said.

2018-08-16,"LONDON (Reuters) - Commodity firms and banks have been diving into blockchain pilot schemes over the last two years but the new technology’s application for most trading has likely been over-hyped, a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said. Blockchain, originally the platform behind cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is viewed by some as a solution to inefficiencies, improving transparency and reducing to the risk of fraud. But BCG believes its potential has been exaggerated.  A high-tech ledger, blockchain uses a shared database that updates in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes without the need for third-party verification. The volume of trades through various schemes has been negligible so far and it is too early to tell how soon it might reach a critical mass.  “There are so many pilot schemes but none have become real production scale systems yet. One of the problems is that it’s not designed for physical trades. The fundamental issue: how do you track a physical entity in a virtual world? It’s two worlds colliding,” Antti Belt, co-author of the BCG report, said.  Among the obstacles to scaling up the technology include reconciling terminologies and whether the switch to a blockchain platform is even financially justifiable.  “The industry is very old and everyone uses a different language. How do you define quality, shipment schedules ... a lot of reconciliation is currently needed for both sides,” Belt said.   “People have spent millions, sometimes over $100 million, on IT system, do they want to do it again?” Furthermore, it is uncertain to what degree traders will want to adopt a technology that will erode already razor-thin profit margins. BCG said that as the platforms take shape, it would be “bad news” for merchant traders as the price inefficiencies and unequal dissemination of information that they rely on to make profits would disappear.   “The use of blockchain solutions would significantly improve transparency ... It would also create a more efficient and liquid market, moving commodity trading away from bilateral deals struck directly between two parties to transactions based on electronic platforms to match buyers and sellers,” the report said.  Co-author Steven Kok said interest in the wider adoption of blockchain technology would start where the primary driver is certifying the source of the asset, as with diamonds, rather than efficiency.  Anglo American’s De Beers said in May it had tracked 100 high-value diamonds from miner to retailer using blockchain, in the first effort of its kind to clear the supply chain of impostors and exploitation.      Nevertheless, major companies and banks have tested blockchain across commodities such as in power, diamonds, food and oil. Last year, a consortium including major banks, trading firms and producers BP, Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell announced that they would develop a blockchain-based platform ready to go by the end of 2018. Separately, commodities trader Trafigura set up another platform with IBM and Natixis for the U.S. crude oil market last year. Major agriculture traders have also tried blockchain such as Louis Dreyfus Co with a cargo of soybeans. “Simply put, blockchain may not be the right answer for all players,” the report concluded.

2018-08-16,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Montana on Wednesday ordered the U.S. State Department to do a full environmental review of a revised route for the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, a move that could delay the project and prove a setback for the Trump administration. For more than a decade, environmentalists, tribal groups, and ranchers have fought the $8-billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline to carry heavy crude to Steele City in Nebraska from Canada’s oilsands in Alberta. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled for the Indigenous Environmental Network and other plaintiffs, ordering the review of a revised pipeline route through Nebraska to supplement one the department did on the original path in 2014. In his ruling, Morris said the State Department was obligated to “analyze new information relevant to the environmental impacts of its decision” to issue a permit for the pipeline last year. Supporting the project are Canadian oil producers, who face price discounts over transport bottlenecks, and U.S. oil interests and pipeline builders. TransCanada Corp, which wants to build Keystone XL, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. It hopes to start preliminary work in Montana in coming months and begin construction in the second quarter of 2019. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the State Department. The ruling was “a rejection of the Trump administration’s attempt to flout the law and force Keystone XL on the American people,” said Jackie Prange, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. In 2015, then President Barack Obama, a Democrat, rejected the pipeline, saying it would add to emissions that cause climate change and would mostly benefit Canadians. President Donald Trump, a Republican, pushed to approve the pipeline soon after he took office. A State Department official signed a so-called presidential permit in 2017 allowing the line to move forward. However, Morris declined the plaintiff’s request to vacate that permit, which was based on the 2014 review. Last year, Nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the pipeline which will cost TransCanada millions of dollars more than the original path. In a draft environmental assessment last month, the State Department said Keystone XL would cause no major harm to water supplies or wildlife. That review is less wide-ranging than the full environmental impact statement Morris ordered.

2018-08-16,"JURONG, China (Reuters) - China’s leading solar equipment manufacturer GCL is planning a move into the electric vehicle sector, aiming to make use of its expertise in energy to gain a vital competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded industry, executives said. The firm is currently building a 5 billion yuan ($721.19 million) solar production base in a new “eco-town” at Jurong near the city of Nanjing, which will also involve the construction of solar-powered residences, warehouses and public amenities. But the firm is now in talks with auto manufacturers to build facilities and production lines in Jurong to support China’s electric vehicle revolution, Tang Yanzhe, the head of the Jurong project, told Reuters. “Our investment figures are very conservative and if the car firms come, it is a long industrial chain and many supporting factories will also come,” he said. Jurong is part of a “special town” program launched by Jiangsu aimed at encouraging investment in strategic sectors. Other towns are focusing on areas like fruit farming, automobiles and e-commerce. But the town’s 2-gigawatt solar panel production line will be completed this year and go into operation at a time when China’s solar manufacturers are struggling with overcapacity, weak demand and trade frictions. After generation capacity rose by a record 53 GW in 2017, the government has also put the brakes on new installations this year. GCL managers said low-grade, “outdated” producers were most at risk. The firm will also put only half its new capacity into operation this year so production does not expand too quickly.  Critics say cut-throat competition between China’s cities and regions has caused price-sapping overcapacity in a wide range of sectors, including steel and solar - and electric cars could be next. As many as 11 cities in the Yangtze delta region were competing to become car production bases, and across the country, 118 enterprises had registered 428 different models of electric cars by mid-July, up from 102 firms and 355 models in just four months, according to government data. Automakers have already complained that China’s regions are distorting the market by giving preferential treatment to local champions, and Beijing has promised to take action against “blind” sector growth.   Tang acknowledged that there were a lot of firms entering the sector but said those without “core competitiveness” would soon be eliminated.  GCL is exploring alternative models to boost its competitiveness, and aims to produce lower-cost batteries that can be rented out to drivers and eventually recycled for use in solar energy storage. GCL’s focus was on public transport and delivery vehicles, and there was still room for growth, Tang said.  “The Yangtze river delta is the biggest market for new energy vehicles - the customer base is the most developed, whether for delivery vehicles or passenger vehicles,” he said.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.0 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei and the Australian benchmark dropped 1.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. Chinese stocks continued to sag, with the Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shedding 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively. Tech shares came under pressure after China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd reported its first quarterly profit fall in nearly 13 years on weak gaming revenue. The knock to the rest of the sector sent South Korea’s Samsung Electronics to a one-year low. Wall Street’s major indexes closed lower on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 down 0.8 percent, its biggest percentage drop since late June, amid disappointing earnings and escalating global trade worries. “Negative news come from Turkey and China every day is upsetting global markets,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior market strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “Also, Tencent’s earnings shock hurt tech stocks, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq lower. It reminded investors that the U.S.-China trade spat is starting to harm the health of even the tech firms, which had been a major driver of the U.S. share rally.” Oil prices took an additional hit after data showed a surprise weekly increase in U.S. crude stockpiles, compounding worries about a weaker global economic growth outlook. U.S. crude oil fell to two-month lows, falling 0.6 percent in early Asian trade to as low as $64.42 per barrel, after Wednesday’s 3.2 percent fall. Brent slipped 0.25 percent to $70.58, after a fall of 2.4 percent on Wednesday. Spot gold dropped 1.0 percent to $1,162.31 an ounce in early Asian trade on Thursday, hitting its lowest levels since January last year. Copper lost 4.0 percent to $5,801.00 a tonne and zinc fell 6.3 percent, touching its lowest level since October 2016 on Wednesday. The escalation in global trade tensions continued to weigh on sentiment with Beijing lodging a complaint to the World Trade Organization to determine the legality of U.S. tariff and subsidy policies. Turkey also raised tariffs on some U.S. products in response to Washington’s levies, Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. The United States on Wednesday ruled out removing steel tariffs that have contributed to a currency crisis in Turkey even if Ankara frees a U.S. pastor, as Qatar pledged $15 billion in investment to Turkey, supporting a rise in the Turkish lira.

2018-08-16,"* Beijing to send delegation to Washington in late August * But oil market sentiment remains cautious overall * U.S. crude output, inventories rise - EIA * Weak Asian markets start to eat away at crude demand By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices on Thursday recouped some of the previous day’s losses after Beijing said it would send a delegation to Washington in an attempt to resolve trade disputes between the United States and China that have roiled global markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $65.11 per barrel at 0209 GMT, up 10 cents, or 0.15 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were up 41 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $71.17 per barrel. Both benchmarks lost more than 2 percent the previous day. Traders said Thursday’s market moves followed in the slipstream of a statement by China’s Ministry of Commerce that it would send a delegation led by vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen to the United States for trade talks in late August. The talks are at the invitation of the United States and will be held with U.S. Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs David Malpass, the commerce ministry said. Still, sentiment in oil markets was broadly cautious due to a rise in U.S. crude production and storage levels and weakness in emerging economies, especially in Asia. U.S. crude oil production and storage levels both rose last week, which traders said had pulled prices down. Output of U.S. crude C-STK-T-EIA rose by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the week ending Aug. 10, to 10.9 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly production and storage report. At the same time, U.S. crude inventory levels C-OUT-T-EIA climbed by 6.8 million barrels, to 414.19 million barrels, the EIA said. “This build certainly hasn’t helped market sentiment,” Dutch bank ING said after the release of the EIA report. While supply rose in the United States, Asia’s emerging markets were showing signs of economic slowdown due to trade disputes with the United States and currency weakness, dragging on oil market sentiment. Despite a rise in China’s yuan after, the dollar held near a 13-month peak on Thursday as political turmoil in Turkey and concerns about China’s economic health continued to support safe-haven assets and weighed on emerging market currencies. Providing Brent crude with some support were looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, set to start from November, with Asian buyers including India, South Korea and Japan already scaling back orders in anticipation.
