2018-10-01,"MILAN (Reuters) - The Co-operative, Britain’s sixth-biggest grocer, has struck a deal with Italian bioplastics group Novamont to replace traditional plastic carrier bags at its stores with biodegradable ones, a source said on Monday. The British retailer plans to remove some 60 million single-use bags from its shops, the equivalent of 340 tonnes of plastic, in the first period of phasing-out, the source said. The agreement envisages replacing an overall 180 million plastic bags over three years, the source added. The Co-op was not immediately available for a comment. The move is part of the Co-op’s plans to cut the use of plastics in its stores and use more recycled plastic products. Supermarkets have come under increased pressure to cut their use of plastic as images of littered oceans and beaches become commonplace, shocking both consumers and shareholders. Since October 2015, large retailers in England have been legally required to impose a charge for single-use plastic bags, a measure which the government says has seen plastic bag sales in England’s seven biggest supermarkets drop by 86 percent.

2018-10-01,"MARRAKESH, Morocco, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Egypt and Algeria should further reduce energy subsidies to cut government spending and promote energy efficiency, their energy ministers said on Monday. Speaking at an Arab energy conference in MarrakeSh, Egyptian Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla said subsidies were a burden on the budget, using up funds that could be spent on improving social services. “We will be continuing to remove subsidies,” he said. Egypt has committed to deep cuts to energy subsidies and other tough fiscal measures as part of a three-year, $12 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme begun in 2016. He said subsidised oil encouraged fuel-smuggling, adding that his country had spent $30 billion on oil subsidies in the last five years. “Oil is sold at a market price representing 75 percent to 80 percent of the cost price,” said the minister. Echoing him, Algeria’s Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni said a surge in domestic energy demand should be addressed by gradually reforming the subsidies system. “Algeria spends $15 billion annually in oil subsidies combined with another $15 billion in subsidising food and health services,” he said. Algeria, hit by a fall in energy revenues from 2014 to 2017, has increased gasoline prices and talked about reforming a subsidy system but so far kept in place a welfare state as it faces presidential elections in 2019.

2018-10-01,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq’s parliament postponed a vote on Monday to name a president because the main Kurdish parties, who were supposed to present a candidate, could not overcome differences, said several lawmakers. Iraq’s presidency, traditionally occupied by a Kurd, is largely a ceremonial position but the vote is a key step towards the formation of a new government, which politicians have failed to do since an inconclusive national election in May. Parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said the vote would by delayed until Tuesday due to a lack of quorum. Under Iraq’s constitution, the new president would have 15 days to task the largest parliamentary bloc’s nominee with forming a government. The prime minister-designate would have 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval. Lawmakers said the dominant Kurdish parties — the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) — were unable to iron out differences and agree on a candidate. The two sides competed in a parliamentary election in their semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq on Sunday. Allegations of fraud have created tensions. Results have not been announced. Lawmakers from the parties suggested neither side was showing flexibility.  Rebwar Taha, a PUK member of the parliament in Baghdad, said the party insists on its candidate, veteran politician Barham Salih. “Delaying the session until Tuesday will not change our decision,” he said. KDP lawmaker Sherwan al-Dobardani said his party was entitled to the position because it has more seats in the national parliament.  Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared among Iraq’s three largest ethnic-sectarian components. The prime minister has traditionally been a Shi’ite Arab, the speaker of parliament a Sunni Arab and the president a Kurd.

2018-10-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures jumped more than $2 a barrel Monday, rising to levels not seen since November 2014, as U.S. sanctions on Iran loom and a North American trade deal fosters growth.  Brent futures LCOc1 settled at $84.98 a barrel, up $2.25, or 2.7 percent. In post-settlement trade, the contract continued to strengthen, rising to $85.45 a barrel, the first trade above $85 since November 2014. U.S. light crude futures CLc1 were up $2.05 a barrel at $75.30, the highest since November 2014. The United States and Canada forged a deal on Sunday to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a trilateral pact with Mexico. Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said the NAFTA deal would boost oil prices because it “increases the growth prospects not only for Canada and the U.S., but for North America as a whole.” Investors have loaded up on options that give the holder the right to buy Brent at $90 by the end of October. Open interest in call options at $90 has risen by nearly 12,000 lots in the past week to 38,000 lots, or 38 million barrels.  Exchange data show hedge funds’ combined net long position in Brent and U.S. light crude futures and options at its largest since late July, equivalent to about 850 million barrels. [CFTC/] [O/ICE] Higher oil prices and a strong U.S. dollar could hit demand growth next year, analysts said. For now the market is focused on U.S. sanctions on Iran, which take effect on Nov. 4 and are designed to cut crude exports from the No. 3 producer in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “Iran has attempted to downplay the impact of looming U.S. sanctions by claiming that it has no intention of reducing oil production. However, such optimistic claims are falling on deaf ears,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said. Several major buyers in India and China have signalled that they will cut purchases of Iranian oil. China’s Sinopec (600028.SS) said it halved loadings of Iranian oil in September. “If Chinese refiners do comply with U.S. sanctions more fully than expected, then the market balance is likely to tighten even more aggressively,” Emirates NBD analyst Edward Bell wrote in a note. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Saudi King Salman on Saturday on ways to maintain sufficient supply. “Even if they (Saudi Arabia) wanted to bend to President Trump’s wishes, how much spare capacity does the kingdom have?” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. With about 1.5 million barrels per day of Iranian oil expected to go offline on Nov. 4, prices could “rocket higher with the flashy $100 per barrel price tag indeed a reasonable-sounding target”, he said.

2018-10-01,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc’s (HSE.TO) hostile bid for MEG Energy Corp (MEG.TO) reflects the need for Canadian oil companies to own integrated assets, from production to refineries, to manage the deep price discounts on Canadian crude, Husky’s chief executive said on Monday. Husky’s cash and stock offer announced on Sunday would combine MEG’s heavy oil production with Husky’s output, pipeline space and refineries, in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion. “This is a real hand-in-glove sort of deal. It just fits together extremely well,” Husky CEO Rob Peabody said on a Monday conference call with analysts. Husky’s bid for highly indebted MEG, which hired a new CEO less than two months ago, is a bet that MEG’s production assets will be lucrative once price differentials return to normal. Even so, some investors own Husky shares for its low exposure to heavy oil differentials and may be disappointed by a bid that increases such risks, analysts said.   The offer comes as Canadian oil producers have struggled with transportation bottlenecks as output has surged, pushing Canadian heavy crude to huge discounts to U.S. light crude. Husky shares fell 7 percent to C$21.19 in Toronto, while MEG stock climbed 38 percent to C$11.08, slightly higher than the offer price. Peabody said Husky is taking the bid directly to MEG shareholders after the company’s leadership refused to discuss it. MEG said on Sunday that its board would consider Husky’s offer when it formally receives it. Husky plans to release its bid circular on Tuesday. The companies are based in Canada, so there are no significant regulatory hurdles, Peabody said. Both have strong ties to Asia, as Husky’s majority investor is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka Shing. One of MEG’s largest investors is Chinese state-owned oil producer CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK). MEG’s best options are to negotiate for a higher bid or find another suitor, Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick wrote in a note. He added that Canadian producers Imperial Oil Ltd (IMO.TO) and Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) are potential bidders. Suncor has no offer on the table for MEG but it considers all opportunities, spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said. Imperial declined to comment. Peabody said Husky will soon meet with MEG shareholders about the deal. MEG shareholders will have the option to receive C$11 in cash or 0.485 of a Husky share for every share held, in a proposal that represents a 37 percent premium to MEG’s closing price on Friday.

USMCA is aimed at bringing more jobs into the United States, with Canada and Mexico accepting more restrictive commerce with the United States, their main export partner. It also effectively maintains the current auto sector and largely spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. tariffs on their vehicles, although it will make it harder for global auto makers to build cars cheaply in Mexico.

2018-10-01,"Oct 1 (Reuters) - The average price of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures should be $68.81 a barrel by the end of the year according to results of a survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas on Monday. Responses ranged between $55 and $85 per barrel, according to the results of a poll of oil and gas executives, with WTI spot prices averaging $69.79 during the survey period, which was conducted from Sept. 12-20. On Monday, WTI was trading around $74.75 per barrel. A majority (64 percent) of oil and gas executives said they expect the global oil market to be close to balanced in 2019, while about a quarter of respondents see the market as undersupplied and a small 10 percent of those polled forecast an oversupplied market. The survey also showed utilization of equipment by oilfield services firms slightly increased in the third quarter, with the corresponding index at 44.8, up three points from the second quarter. Input costs on the oilfield services side continued to rise, with the index jumping from 36.3 to 46.6 in the third quarter. More than half the survey’s respondents said they expect that crude oil pipeline capacity will be sufficient to alleviate the current takeaway constraints in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field, by the end of 2019. Production in the Permian in western Texas and eastern New Mexico has nearly doubled in the last three years, to 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd), close to output in OPEC’s No. 3 producer Iran. But booming output has overwhelmed existing pipelines to Gulf Coast export markets. Over slightly half of those surveyed said the steel import tariffs have had a slightly negative impact on their business so far, with 33 percent saying they had no impact. “The steel tariffs have added approximately $100,000 of costs to each of our wells. Some thought should be given to removing the tariffs when domestic mills are not currently running the products,” said a survey respondent. The survey’s respondents included 110 companies focused on exploration and production activities and 61 that operate in the oilfield service sector.

2018-10-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers.    Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit. Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group’s (PEUP.PA) electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge. But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals. “What everyone needs to realize is that clean mobility is like organic food – it’s more expensive,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA. A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW (BMWG.DE), blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was “a first alarm signal”, Tavares said in a weekend radio interview. “Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.” Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party’s annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometer in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2. Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand’s electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact. “VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,” said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners. “Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,” he said. “Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.” Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. “We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,” a spokesman said. Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough. They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years. Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros. When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold. Mass-market electrics such as the Renault (RENA.PA) Zoe and Nissan (7201.T) Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla (TSLA.O) has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall. Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner. Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla’s $49,000 Model 3. “It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,” said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. “Demand doesn’t justify investment at all - it’s all regulation.” Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors’ and customers’ benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region’s 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs. “The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren’t met, and consumers just aren’t ready for full-electric,” ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently. Automotive suppliers are also feeling exposed. “We’ve taken risks as a company,” said Jacques Aschenbroich, chief executive of Valeo (VLOF.PA), a major manufacturer of electrification components and systems. “We have invested a lot even though the market doesn’t exist.” Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand. Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car’s value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise. Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government’s 4,500 pound plug-in incentive. French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, program director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold. “We don’t launch vehicles with negative operating margins,” Salvat said. German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans. That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind. “In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,” BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters. “If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.” ($1 = 0.7675 pounds) <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Shortfall of planned European battery supply for electric vehicles (EV)    tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOX Global electric-battery vehicle sales.    tmsnrt.rs/2oDPjG4 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Reporting by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Esha Vaish in Stockholm, Gilles Guillaume and Joe White in Paris, Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autoshow-paris-electric-squeeze/update-1-electric-cars-cast-growing-shadow-on-profits-idUKL8N1WH5YT,01 Oct 2018,"Electric cars are poised to arrive

2018-10-01,"SARAJEVO/BANJA LUKA (Reuters) - Kayakers from across Europe took to Bosnia’s Vrbas river on Monday to protest against a boom in dam construction across the western Balkans that campaigners say threaten to cause irreparable environmental damage. The kayakers joined activists and local people who have been campaigning for years against plans to build two new hydroelectric power plants on the Vrbas river. The two facilities are part of a planned network of nearly 3,000 plants foreseen across the western Balkans, a region known as the ‘blue heart’ of Europe for its pristine rivers. About a third of them would be located in protected areas, the campaign groups RiverWatch and EuroNatur said in a study. “There is a large gap between nature lovers, who have a chance but also the right to fight for nature, and those who are only driven by money,” said former Slovenian Olympic athlete Rok Rozman, who headed a 10 km-long (6 mile) colorful flotilla of kayakers paddling down the Vrbas. Authorities and investors view hydro power as a strong green alternative to other forms of energy and say it will help the western Balkan nations to achieve the renewable energy targets of the European Union which they all aspire to join. But campaigners say the dams will drain rivers used by local communities for drinking, farming, fishing and tourism, while destroying the habitat of species unique to the region, such as the Danube salmon and the Balkan lynx.      “It’s a dam ‘tsunami’. Literally, there is a project on every kilometer. The dams in the Balkans put 10 percent of the entire fish species population in Europe at risk,” said Ulrich Eichelmann, head of RiverWatch. “We must stop this craziness”. The campaigners complain of poor planning laws, generous subsidies and endemic graft, saying they are exacerbating the problems linked to the mass construction of the dams.     A recent hydro morphological study showed a third of Balkan rivers are in a pristine natural state compared to the rest of Europe where most have already been dammed, said Gabriel Schwaderer, head of EuroNatur. “This network of veins is risking a thrombosis or even heart attack,” Schwaderer told a gathering of more than 200 scientists and activists in Sarajevo last week. Campaigners urged national governments and the EU to streamline environmental and energy laws. They also called on banks to apply more stringent rules for hydro projects and to increase funding for other renewable energy sources, whose potential in the region remains untapped.

The new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) announced on Sunday rescues a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that was on the brink of collapse after nearly a quarter century. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 266.92 points, or 1.01 percent, to 26,725.23, the S&P 500 gained 20.39 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,934.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.99 points, or 0.55 percent, to 8,090.34. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.34 percent. “The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board, especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in London. The Canadian dollar was up 0.85 percent against the dollar at a four-month high and the Mexican peso hit its highest in over seven weeks, up nearly a percent on the day. USMCA is aimed at bringing more jobs into the United States, with Canada and Mexico accepting more restrictive commerce with the United States, their main export partner. It also effectively maintains the current auto sector and largely spares Canada and Mexico from the prospect of U.S. tariffs on their vehicles, although it will make it harder for global auto makers to build cars cheaply in Mexico. Shares of U.S. carmakers rose, with Ford rising 1.6 percent and General Motors up 1.5 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.15 percent, led by Italian stocks, which bounced off two-week lows hit last week. On Friday, Italian stocks, bonds and the euro had all sold off on worries over a budget proposal from Italy’s new anti-establishment government, particularly after a report said the European Union was set to reject the plan. But such were the scale of the losses that some analysts believed the market had gone too far. “The math just does not justify the price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!” Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. The euro was also initially hit by worries about a rise in Italy’s fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark, but it recovered as the session progressed to trade slightly higher at $1.1612. Also casting a shadow on markets were two surveys on Sunday that showed growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in September as domestic and export demand softened. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.19 percent lower. Benchmark Brent oil neared its highest since November 2014 on Monday, driven by concern about a supply crunch once U.S. sanctions against Iran come into force next month. U.S. crude rose 0.6 percent to $73.69 per barrel and Brent was last at $83.31, up 0.7 percent on the day.

Twenty-five of the 30 stocks in Egypt’s blue-chip index fell, as Egypt underperformed MSCI’s emerging markets index, which was almost flat. Middle East fund managers have turned negative towards Egyptian equities because of concern that the currency could weaken as global interest rates rise and foreign investors cut holdings of Egyptian Treasury bills, a Reuters poll showed on Sunday. Thirty-one percent of managers now expect to cut allocations to Egyptian equities and only 8 percent to raise them in the next three months, the most negative balance for Egypt since February 2017. The Saudi Arabian index rose 0.5 percent, lifted by banks and petrochemical stocks. National Commercial Bank jumped 2.6 percent and Sahara Petrochemical added 1.3 percent. Alinma Investment Co, a unit of Alinma Bank, signed an agreement with Saudi Real Estate Co to establish a real estate fund that will develop three sites in Riyadh with a value of 1.5 billion riyals ($409 million). Saudi Real Estate rose 0.9 percent and Alinma Bank was up 1.3 percent. The Dubai index gained 0.5 percent on the back of a 2.4 percent rise by Emaar Properties, which in the past couple of weeks has been recovering from 30-month lows.

2018-10-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - Three new vehicles debuting at the Paris car show this week will show investors and consumers the challenges facing the global auto industry as it grapples with the biggest technological changes in a century. A new BMW 3-series sedan, the latest in a line of cars that defined the concept of a premium sports sedan, will aim to reinvigorate a range that has ceded ground to SUVs and electric drives, while the Mercedes GLE marks an attempt to take an SUV to a new level, with some autonomous driving features.  And the Peugeot e-Legend concept stands for what automakers need to do next, and fast: design electrified vehicles that are both appealing and profitable. The new generation BMW (BMWG.DE) 3-series sedan will immediately fight for attention with a different car bearing the “3” designation - Tesla Inc’s (TSLA.O) electric Model 3.  Tesla’s Model 3 is now out-selling the BMW model in the United States, although the BMW 3 remains the bigger seller by far worldwide.   Tesla’s all-electric car challenges BMW and other traditional premium brands for technological leadership with software that can be constantly upgraded to improve the car’s performance and driver experience, and to add features. The new BMW 3-series will also fight for attention in Paris - as in the marketplace - with the worldwide shift to SUVs. That phenomenon will be represented by the new generation of the Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) GLE sport utility, among other models. The new GLE, which goes on sale next year, will come with a new, 48-volt electronic suspension system that can vary the shock absorbing function at each wheel, individually. Inside the cabin, drivers and passengers can view information on two 12.3- inch screens.  The GLE also takes another step toward automating the process of driving, with a system that can steer and vary the speed of the car within a marked lane up to 37 miles per hour. The GLE can effectively pilot itself in rush hour traffic jams. Mercedes will offer in the GLE a 48-volt electrical system that gives the vehicle an electric boost away from stops. That offers a modest reduction in fuel consumption at a time when regulators worldwide want automakers to eliminate their oil-burning, internal combustion technology and go all-electric.  The GLE highlights the auto industry’s conflicted response to the regulatory and consumer pressure to dump diesel technology and accelerate the shift to all-electric vehicles.  Petroleum-fueled SUVs such as the Mercedes GLE generate the bulk of profits for global automakers. All-electric Tesla gets praise for its innovation, but is scrambling to show a profit in the third quarter after a tumultuous year. The challenge for established automakers is to design electric cars compelling enough to persuade consumers to pay a profitable premium to own them. Legacy automakers have tended to produce electric cars that are drab, small or strange.  PSA Group’s (PEUP.PA) Peugeot e-Legend concept aims to break that pattern with a battery-powered homage to the 1968 Peugeot 504 that looks like it could have starred in a late 1960s French New Wave movie. While not destined for production, the e-Legend does reflect a dilemma facing automakers like PSA - and its track-racing boss Carlos Tavares - over how to reconcile connected, autonomous cars with more traditional product traits such as driving pleasure, where their expertise really lies. While the Peugeot fantasy car is self-driving, it can also be driven manually, or flipped into a “sharp” autonomous mode that accelerates and steers more aggressively - because, as the company said in promoting the concept, “boredom is not part of our DNA”.

2018-10-01,"(Recast with peso open, adds analyst quote) BUENOS AIRES, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Argentina’s troubled peso opened stable on Monday at the start of a new trading band agreed with the International Monetary Fund aimed at halting a decline in the currency, which has dropped more than 50 percent so far in 2018. The peso opened at 41.30 to the dollar, unchanged from Friday, when the currency lost 3.87 percent against the greenback in one day alone. With the economy shrinking, inflation rising and President Mauricio Macri facing opposition to budget cuts ahead of his 2019 re-election campaign, analysts said the peso would likely remain unstable over the months ahead. Under a revised $57 billion standby financing agreement, Argentina has established a trading band for the peso between 34 and 44 per U.S. dollar, a band launched on Monday. The currency has been at the center of emerging market volatility this year. “Doubts continue to hover over the government’s economic plan despite agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” local consultancy Portfolio Personal said in a note to clients. The central bank is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the currency if the 44 per dollar threshold is broken. The bank has spent almost $16 billion in interventions so far this year. “Whenever a new program is implemented there’s a period of transition and adaptation by the market, until it gets used to the new rules and signals given by the central bank,” the central bank’s new chief Guido Sandleris said in an interview published by local daily La Nacion on Sunday.

2018-10-01,"ABUJA, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari sought to reassure voters that next year’s elections would be free and fair on Monday after the opposition and international observers raised concerns over the way a gubernatorial vote was conducted last week. Buhari’s ruling party candidate was narrowly elected governor of the southwestern state of Osun in a vote on Friday which the main opposition party said was marred by voter intimidation and suggested that the 2019 elections in Africa’s top oil producing country were unlikely to be fair. Observers from Britain, the United States and the European Union said in a joint statement that they had witnessed widespread incidents of interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers by some party supporters and security agencies in Osun. In a televised address to mark the anniversary of the west African country’s independence from British rule, Buhari, who will seek a second term in February 2019 elections, tried to address concerns over Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commision (INEC), which the opposition has said was partly to blame for the manner in which the Osun vote was conducted. “I have committed myself many times to ensure that elections are fully participatory, free and fair and that the Independent National Electoral Commission will be exactly independent and properly staffed and resourced,” said Buhari in his address. He did not give further details. Elections in Africa’s most populous nation have for years been marred by allegations of irregularities including vote rigging, voter intimidation and violence. On Saturday Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress party nominated him as its candidate to stand for re-election next year. The main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has yet to select a candidate. Friday’s Osun poll was a re-run after the INEC declared the first vote, in which the main opposition candidate secured a win, as inconclusive due to the high number of spoiled ballots. PDP members criticised INEC for its handling of the election and accused it and security agencies of failing to ensure the second vote was free and fair. INEC’s board members are chosen by the president subject to parliament’s approval. An INEC spokesman did not respond to request for comment.

2018-10-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is important to secure German energy supplies and Russia is a safe and reliable provider, Thomas Bareiss, Germany’s state secretary for energy, said. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the project increases reliance on Russian gas and has warned Western firms invested in it that they are at risk of sanctions. Gas is due to start flowing to Europe through the pipeline at the end of 2019 and will allow Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) to stop piping gas via Ukraine where it has clashed with authorities over pricing and other issues for years. Gazprom and its partners say the project is aimed at ensuring energy security in Europe, where gas production is falling. “I know the U.S. has concerns ... but it is not so easy. For Germany, Russia has always been a safe and reliable supplier for gas,” Bareiss told the Bloomberg NEF Future of Energy summit. “Nord Stream 2 should go on because the pipeline secures energy supply in Europe,” he told the conference in London. Nord Stream 2 will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity from 55 billion cubic metres of gas a year. It is owned by Russian state-controlled Gazprom, which is taking on half of the planned costs of 9.5 billion euros ($11 billion). The rest is divided among five European energy companies - Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Anglo- Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI). Germany is embarking on an expensive energy transition to replace coal and nuclear power capacity with low-carbon energy. The government wants to be free of nuclear power by 2022 and  has appointed a commission to decide this year on the timetable for a withdrawal from coal as part of a wider 2030 climate goal. Bareiss said Germany will invest 50 billion euros ($58 billion) to 2030 in improving and expanding its electricity grids, but it is far behind on this. “This is causing large costs - more than 1 billion euros a year in cost to businesses and consumers. Therefore, we have to speed up grid expansion and upgrades,” he said. “It is a very expensive transition process but it will work in the long run,” Bareiss added. The coal commission aims to bring its proposals to a U.N. climate conference in Poland in December on how many coal plants can be phased out in the next two years and then by 2030 and 2045, the minister said.

2018-10-01,"(Adds details) MARRAKESH, Morocco, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Morocco is preparing to invite bids for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Jorf Lasfar worth $4.5 billion, Energy Minister Aziz Rabbah said on Monday. Speaking on the sidelines of an energy conference in Marrakesh, he declined to give details. Last year, Moroccan state-owned power utility ONEE said it had picked HSBC Middle East Ltd as financial adviser for its plan to boost imports of LNG. The project includes the import of up to 7 billion cubic metres of gas by 2025, and the construction of a jetty, terminal, pipelines and gas-fired power plants, officials have said. Morocco, a net energy importer, aims to diversify fuel supplies and reduce its dependence on foreign oil and coal. Jorf Lasfar, where the terminal will be built, is situated on the Atlantic coast near where state-run phosphate company OCP and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA) have facilities.

2018-10-01,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Talk about inconvenient timing. Just as Saudi Arabia is about to switch the way it prices its oil exports, the new benchmark throws a spanner in the works by surging inexplicably. Oman crude futures traded on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) rushed to their highest level in four years last week, trading as high as $90.90 a barrel on Sept. 26. While the sharp rise in prices isn’t without precedent, especially given market concern over the imminent loss of much of Iran’s exports, what was unusual was that Oman swept past Brent futures, the global benchmark. This has happened only on a handful of occasions in the past decade, most recently in September last year, and then only for a day and at a relatively modest premium of 54 cents a barrel, according to calculations by S&P Global Platts. Oman and Brent futures have different daily settlement times, but when the DME contract finished on Sept. 26 it was at $88.96 a barrel, while at that time Brent was at $82.14. Oman normally trades below Brent as it is a medium-sour crude, which is typically more costly for refiners to process and doesn’t yield as much of the high-value products such as gasoline as does Brent, which is a light, sweet oil. For Oman to romp to such a large premium to Brent, and maintain it for four sessions, is unusual and will no doubt be of concern to both the DME and Saudi Arabia, as well as the refiners who buy Saudi crude. Traders appear largely to have been caught by surprise by last week’s spike in Oman, if comments at the annual industry gathering in Singapore were anything to go by. But the likelihood is that the increase in Oman will be unwound in coming days, given that it seems to have been largely driven by buying by Chinese refiners. The bulk of delivered Oman heads to China and it appears that refiners in the world’s largest crude importer, especially smaller independent operators, were keen to stock up before the end of the year to use up their import allocations. Chinese buying may also have been boosted by the fact that this week is a holiday for the country’s National Day, meaning most crude trading businesses will be closed. There is also likely a smaller element of buying boosting the Oman contract, and that is the potential looming shortage of heavier and sour grades of crude as renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran ramp up to include all of the Islamic Republic’s crude exports from November. Many Asian refiners prefer heavier crudes, having invested in units that can process these grades into higher value products, especially middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel. While it’s likely that Oman’s premium to Brent will be unwound in coming days, the timing couldn’t have been worse for Saudi Aramco, the state-owned producer that is the world’s largest exporter of crude. From October, Aramco was changing the benchmarks used in calculating its official selling prices (OSPs), for the first time since the mid-1980s. The Saudis used to use the average of Oman and Dubai prices, as assessed by S&P Global Platts in calculating the OSPs. From this month it will use the average monthly price of DME Oman futures as well as the Platts average for physical Dubai quotes. The change has been a long time coming and is perhaps a reflection of the success the DME has had in building Oman futures into a viable benchmark for Middle East medium heavy and sour crude. The Platts assessments are also long-standing and well-respected in the market, but were perhaps more vulnerable to price spikes given the relatively small amount of physical crude underpinning the pricing. This happened in 2015 when the trading arms of China’s state-controlled refiners bought up large amounts of the oil available through the Platts pricing mechanism in a matter of days, leaving the pricing subject to volatility and spikes. The switch to using DME futures as one-half of the Saudi benchmark was supposed to make the pricing more transparent and robust, given the Oman contract has more physical volumes behind it and the backing of a cleared exchange. But last week’s surge has shown that the Oman contract can also shift dramatically in a short space of time, if the demand for crude is there. The Saudi OSPs tend to set the pattern for crude pricing from Iran, Iraq and Kuwait, meaning some 12 million barrels per day of exports are impacted. Asian refiners will now be worried that last week’s price action will result in higher than anticipated OSPs, with the Saudis likely to announce their prices at the end of this week. This isn’t the start the DME and Aramco would have wanted for the new pricing system, but the chances are it is merely a blip, rather than the harbinger of sustained volatility and uncertainty.

2018-10-01,"BUENOS AIRES, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Argentina was set on Monday to launch a new currency band under a revised International Monetary Fund deal aimed at halting a more than 50 percent drop in the local peso so far in 2018. Under the $57 billion standby financing agreement, Argentina has established a trading band for the peso between 34 and 44 per U.S. dollar. The currency has been at the center of emerging market volatility this year. It lost 3.87 percent on Friday alone to close at 41.3 per greenback. The question ahead of the market open was weather the peso would weaken enough to test the 44 per dollar limit. The central bank is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the currency if the 44 per dollar threshold is broken. The bank has spent almost $16 billion in interventions so far this year. “Whenever a new program is implemented there’s a period of transition and adaptation by the market, until it gets used to the new rules and signals given by the central bank,” the central bank’s new chief Guido Sandleris said in an interview published by local daily La Nacion on Sunday.

2018-10-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - In the oil market, balance is a difficult game. Calculating whether the 100 million barrel per day world market is likely in the months ahead to have a surplus or deficit of supply, or be balanced, where supply equals demand, is never simple.  Projections must take into account a host of factors — from world economic growth, refinery operations and changing fuel use patterns on the demand side, to investment patterns, rates of mature oilfield decline, weather, politics, war and OPEC on the supply side.  Working out what the oil balance will look like next year  is proving particularly difficult.       “The oil market is basically hardly ever in balance,” said strategist Bjarne Schieldrop of Swedish bank SEB.   “It is either too much or too little. It is very hard to balance it just right. That means that the oil market naturally will move between the two extremes of: low price: demand boost and supply destruction, or high price: supply boost and demand destruction.”      “And since 2005 the middle ground between these two seems to be the $80–$100-a-barrel range where it is neither of the two.” At $83 a barrel, crude now is at its highest for four years and some big trading houses now think $100-a-barrel crude is likely, a price which may trigger some rationing of demand.  An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar in line with rising U.S. interest rates has made oil more costly for emerging market fuel buyers, including India, China and Indonesia which may curb their imports. Even so, an average of the three main public agencies that project world oil demand growth — the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Energy Administration and OPEC — is signalling another year of oil demand growth next year.  The average of the three agencies’ forecasts is growth of 1.53 million bpd in 2018 and 1.46 million bpd in 2019, reaching 100.9 million bpd on average next year.  The three on average expect non-OPEC crude supply — they do not even try to predict what OPEC will do — to outstrip global demand next year by 580,000 bpd, similar to this year, leaving OPEC to supply the difference if it chooses to. (Graphic: Balancing crude oil supply in 2019 - reut.rs/2IlJNB7) On the supply side, Iran is the big unknown. Predictions for how much of Iran’s 2 million bpd of exports will be lost to U.S. sanctions range from half a million bpd to 2 million bpd, or most of it’s exports.  There are two quick sources of extra output: the tapping of spare capacity held largely by OPEC leader Saudi Arabia or from those producers that can respond rapidly to higher prices, namely the shale industry in the United States.   Two high-profile consultancies are taking a very different view of the supply-demand balance next year than the three main agencies.  Washington-based Rapidan Group expects a supply surplus of more than one million bpd, triggered by an aggressive U.S. shale supply response to high prices and a hit on emerging market demand.  “We forecast well over 1 million bpd in global surpluses next year ... even that may be too small, as emerging market currency collapses may harken a big emerging market growth slowdown next year,” said Rapidan Group president Bob McNally.     “Barring big geopolitical disruptions, we’re hearing an echo of 2013 and 2014 when a tidal wave of prospective non-OPEC supply growth compelled OPEC and Russia to either surrender market share with large proactive cuts or accept big price declines.”   Rapidan expects U.S. crude supply alone to grow faster than total global consumption. (Graphic: Rapidan forecast for implied global oil supply balance in 2019 - reut.rs/2OdvzYu) At the other extreme, London-based Energy Aspects is projecting a shortfall in supply of 300,000 bpd, with demand curtailed by the impact of trade tariffs.  First though, Energy Aspects is calling for the final quarter of 2018 to have the tightest supply-demand balance in over a decade.  In a note titled “Empty” the consultancy said: “a combination of the steep decline in Iranian exports, a lack of any near-term spare capacity and the resurgence of Chinese teapot (refinery) buying” would cause an unusually tight balance.  That, trading houses such as Mercuria and Trafigura think, may be enough to drive oil prices to $100 a barrel — perhaps in turn sowing the seeds of demand destruction. So boom, then bust? The history of oil price cycles indicates that is not impossible.

2018-10-01,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Production of hard-to-recover oil in Russia is expected to rise by 10 percent to 43 million tonnes (860,000 barrels per day) this year, boosted by tax incentives, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said in an interview. He also said the government had no immediate plan to reduce oil exports in order to curb an increase in domestic fuel prices. Russia is pinning its hopes on hard-to-recover oil, hidden beneath non-porous rocks, as conventional oil reserves in West Siberia, its main oil-producing region, are becoming increasingly depleted. As part of Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, the United States imposed restrictions on providing Russia with technology for hard-to-recover oil, also known as shale oil. But despite the sanctions, oil production, including hard-to-recover crude, is growing. “Many of our companies have advanced in this direction,” Sorokin said of Russian producers’ ability to extract such oil. “We expect that the production of hard-to-recover oil will rise from 39 million tonnes (in 2017) to 43 million tonnes by the end of 2018,” he said. Russia’s oilfield licenses regulator Rosnedra has put the country’s hard-to-recover oil reserves at around 12 billion tonnes, or 88 billion barrels - two-thirds of all Russian oil reserves, and enough to supply the world with oil for 20 years. The state has introduced tax incentives for hard-to-recover oil production, including a zero-rate mineral extraction tax. Overall oil production in Russia is seen at 553 million tonnes this year, up from 547 million tonnes last year. Sorokin, who with Energy Minister Alexander Novak has been heading Russia’s efforts to forge closer ties with oil producer group OPEC, said Moscow had no immediate plan to restrict oil exports in order to dampen domestic fuel prices. It is more profitable for companies to sell fuel abroad than on the domestic market for several reasons, including the weakening of the rouble. “We’re not talking about physical restrictions at the moment,” the deputy minister said, adding that there are no fuel shortages on the domestic market.

2018-10-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - German utility RWE (RWEG.DE) is still comfortable investing in Britain despite the possibility of a “hard” Brexit when the country leaves the European Union next March, a senior executive at the company told Reuters on Monday. RWE Generation UK is the country’s second-largest electricity generator, producing more than 10 percent of Britain’s power.  It operates the largest fleet of gas-fired power plants in Britain, along with some coal and biomass plants, and employs up to 1,600 people in the UK. Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, yet little about the process is clear. There is so far no full exit deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a second referendum. “A ‘hard’ Brexit is not good for companies on a macro-economic level, with the possibility of economic downturn,” Tom Glover, chief commercial officer at RWE Generation, said on the sidelines of the Bloomberg NEF Future of Energy Summit. “There is operational risk from a hard Brexit but we are still comfortable investing money in the UK,” he said, adding that RWE invests around 100 million pounds ($130 million) a year in Britain currently. The company would like more detail from the government when it delivers its Autumn Budget statement later this month on carbon price plans after Brexit, Glover said. Currently Britain is a member of the EU’s emissions trading system, which charges the EU’s factories and power plants for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. Prices of so-called EU carbon permits have rallied to around 21 euros ($24) a tonne, making it more expensive to burn fossil fuels. However, it is not clear whether Britain will have to leave the EU ETS due to Brexit, and whether it will set up its own carbon market and link to the EU one. In March this year, German utility E.ON (EONGn.DE) and rival RWE announced a major asset swap. Under the deal, RWE’s networks and renewables business Innogy (IGY.DE) will be broken up and its assets split between E.ON and RWE. Glover said RWE will get wind power assets from Innogy and E.ON, becoming the second biggest offshore wind player in the world and the third biggest renewables player in Europe. RWE is still working on its long-term renewables strategy, which will commit at least 1.5 billion euros a year to renewables investment. “Exactly how and where that will be deployed will be detailed in the strategy next year... probably in the first quarter of next year,” Glover added.

2018-10-01,"ISTANBUL/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish manufacturing activity slid to its lowest level in nine years in September, a business survey showed on Monday, in what economists said was among the clearest signs yet that Turkey was headed for a deep recession after months of currency turmoil. Further underscoring the pain for consumers and businesses, authorities hiked electricity and natural gas prices for the third month running, sources said, as the lira’s sell-off drives up the cost of everything from food to fuel. The currency has lost some 37 percent of its value against the dollar so far this year, hit by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan’s control over monetary policy and a diplomatic rift with the United States. The crisis has reverberated across global markets and deepened concerns about the outlook for Turkey’s banks and manufacturers. A closely watched measure of manufacturing health, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), fell to its lowest since March 2009, the survey from Istanbul Chamber of Industry and IHS Markit showed. The decline was driven by a slowdown in output and new orders, the survey showed, which in turn caused scaling back in employment and purchasing activity. “The sharp drop in Turkey’s PMI last month chimes with other very weak survey data and adds to the evidence that the economy has entered a deep recession,” Liam Carson of Capital Economics said in a note to clients.  Inflation hit 18 percent last month, its highest in nearly 15 years, and is expected to surge to 20 percent this year. Turkey is dependent on imports, which are usually denominated in foreign currency, for almost all of its energy needs. Turkey’s energy regulator raised electricity prices for residences by 9 percent and by 18.6 percent for industry from October 1, sources said, after the state-owned gas operator made a similar increase. Highlighting the pain for shoppers, retail prices in Istanbul surged by more than four percent in September from a month earlier, data showed. Retail prices in Turkey’s biggest city were nearly 19 percent more expensive last month than they were in September 2017.  The government has responded to the crisis by cutting its growth forecasts for this year and next and promising to tighten spending. The central bank’s mammoth 6.25 percentage point rate increase, and Erdogan’s attempts to repair ties with the United States have gone some way to ease investor concerns, although worries remain, particularly about banks. In one bright patch for the economy, data showed that exports rose 22.6 percent year-on-year in September, to $14.5 billion, the Trade Ministry said. The trade deficit shrank 76.85 percent, the ministry said. The most exported products were cars, it said, with Germany, Britain and Italy the leading export destinations. Turkey imported the most from Russia, China and Germany, it said.

2018-10-01,"* CO2 goals push electric-car prices lower * VW among brands seen pricing aggressively * Concerns mount over profitability By Laurence Frost PARIS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Electric cars are poised to arrive en masse in European showrooms after years of hyped concept-car launches and billions in investment by automakers and suppliers. Now comes the hard part: selling them at a profit. Battery models making their car-show debut in Paris this week, from PSA Group’s electric DS3 Crossback to the Mercedes EQC, will erode profitability as they struggle to stay in the black, executives generally acknowledge. But concerns are mounting that the impact could be worse, as consumers resist paying more for electrified vehicles - forcing carmakers to sell them at a bigger loss to meet emissions goals. “What everyone needs to realise is that clean mobility is like organic food – it’s more expensive,” said Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Peugeot, Citroen and Opel manufacturer PSA. A Sept. 25 profit warning by BMW, blamed in part on electrification costs and tightening emissions rules, was “a first alarm signal”, Tavares said in a weekend radio interview. “Either we accept paying more for clean mobility, or we put the European auto industry in jeopardy.” Underlining the turbulence facing automakers, British Prime Minister Theresa May will confront Conservative rebels demanding a harder Brexit stance at her party’s annual conference, just as the Paris show gets underway on Tuesday. On its second day, the European Parliament votes on plans to cut carbon dioxide car emissions by as much as 45 percent by 2030 from an average 95 grammes per kilometre in 2021 - a goal many automakers are already in danger of missing, on pain of fines running to hundreds of millions of euros. After declining for a decade, new-vehicle carbon emissions are rising again as customers flock from cars to SUVs, and from diesel to gasoline engines. Diesels emit more nitrogen oxides and particulates, but less CO2. Early signs suggest electric-car prices may fall sooner and faster than production costs, as carmakers adjust for stalled emissions progress and weak consumer appetite. That promises more red ink, as discounted battery car sales finally take off. Volkswagen has said the ID hatchback, due to open the brand’s electric onslaught next year, will be priced close to conventionally powered versions of the Golf compact. “VW is about to launch a load of electric vehicles at the same price as gasolines, and therefore at a loss,” said Laurent Petizon, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners. “Our interpretation is that the 2021 fines have already been factored into their sales strategy,” he said. “Rather than pay penalties they prefer to lose money on vehicles and get the market going.” Volkswagen declined to discuss pricing in detail. “We want our electric cars to be a real alternative to a reasonably equipped Golf Diesel,” a spokesman said. Volkswagen and Mercedes parent Daimler, which between them have announced 30 billion euros ($35 billion) in electrification investment, both warned last month that it would not be enough. They and other carmakers are also mandated to sell more electric cars in China and a group of U.S. states led by California. More than 200 electric and plug-in model launches are already scheduled globally over the next three years. Electric cars still cost 7,800 euros more to produce on average than conventional ones, AlixPartners calculates. Plug-in hybrids - which combine a smaller rechargeable battery with a combustion engine - overshoot by 5,000 euros. When that cost gap is reflected in the price, few are sold. Mass-market electrics such as the Renault Zoe and Nissan Leaf have been on sale for most of the current decade, and heavily subsidized in Europe, while Tesla has made inroads into the premium business. Yet pure-electric cars claim just 1 percent of the market overall. Despite their higher cost, BMW plug-in models are already priced broadly on a par with diesels. The luxury carmaker acknowledges that their margins are significantly thinner. Mercedes also says the EQC electric SUV will be priced close to its GLC cousin to tackle Tesla’s $49,000 Model 3. “It absolutely is impacting the profitability of the industry,” said Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks vehicle pricing. “Demand doesn’t justify investment at all - it’s all regulation.” Which is why, on this subject more than most, European carmakers talk from both sides of their mouths. While executives exude confidence for investors’ and customers’ benefit, their Brussels lobby group ACEA warns of an imminent threat to the region’s 3.4 million automotive manufacturing jobs. “The conditions for such a systemic change clearly aren’t met, and consumers just aren’t ready for full-electric,” ACEA Secretary General Erik Jonnaert said recently. Carmakers are demanding increased public investment in recharging networks - which may yet awaken mass demand. Economies of scale should also bring some relief. But lithium-ion batteries, which claim 40 percent of an electric car’s value, face global cobalt and nickel shortages that will pull the other way, inflating costs as production volumes rise. Perhaps more critically, generous government sales subsidies are unlikely to survive much growth. In markets where incentives have been dropped, electric car sales have fallen. Renault is discounting its recently upgraded Zoe in the UK market with a 5,000 pound ($6,500) trade-in bonus, in addition to the government’s 4,500 pound plug-in incentive. French rival PSA will price its new rechargeable hybrids to match diesel leasing rates, programme director Olivier Salvat told reporters on a recent factory visit - adding that the carmaker aimed to avoid losing money on each vehicle sold. “We don’t launch vehicles with negative operating margins,” Salvat said. German luxury carmakers including Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, could put up with losses on electrified vehicles if it enables them to keep selling their biggest earners, upscale SUVs and large sedans. That would leave mid-market competitors such as PSA and Renault, which can ill afford to sell large volumes of electric cars below cost, in a tougher bind. “In electromobility you have to be a cost leader,” BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich told Reuters. “If you are not a cost leader you will not survive.” ($1 = 0.7675 pounds) Reporting by Laurence Frost

2018-10-01,"* Canadian dollar hits four-month high, Mexican peso gains * European stocks follow Japanese higher on trade relief * Italian budget worries hits bonds, euro * Chinese manufacturing surveys tempers optimism * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds turnaround in Italian stocks, adds U.S. stock futures) By Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Optimism about a reconstituted free trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico and what it could mean for trade relations elsewhere helped world markets kick off the fourth quarter of the year in a positive vein. The United States and Canada salvaged NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century . Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent to a 27-year high, followed by gains in European stocks markets, with Italian shares in particular clawing back some of last week’s losses and U.S. stock futures indicating a sharply higher open on Wall Street. The Canadian dollar was up 0.85 percent against the dollar to a four-month high and the Mexican peso hit its highest in over seven weeks, up nearly a percent on the day. “The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board, especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in London. A pan-European index of shares was up 0.3 percent, led by Italian stocks, which were up as much as 1.2 percent on the day, bouncing off a two-week low hit last week. On Friday, Italian stocks, bonds and the euro had all sold off on worries over a budget proposal from Italy’s new anti-establishment government, particularly after a report said the European Union was set to reject the plan. But such were the scale of the losses that some analysts believed the market had gone too far. “The math just does not justify the price action we saw on Friday. Not even close!” Unicredit economist Erik Nielsen wrote in a note on Sunday. It wasn’t unalloyed optimism on Italy, however, with short-dated bonds selling off with two- and five-year yields higher 7-9 basis points, though there was some demand for longer-dated debt. The closely watched spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields was at 268 basis points, about 30 bps wider than this time last week, but comfortably below Friday’s high of 278 bps. “It is quite clear that the European Commission will not like (the budget proposal),” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “Brussels will give its opinion, which we think won’t be positive and ... the ratings agencies will opt for a similar stance. A downgrade is our base case.” The euro was also intially hit by worries about a rise in Italy’s fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark, but it recovered as the session progressed to trade slightly higher at $1.1612. Also casting a shadow on markets were two surveys on Sunday that showed growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in September as domestic and export demand softened. As a result, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.25 percent. China’s financial markets were closed for a holiday, as was Hong Kong’s stock exchange. “The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers’ sentiment as reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,” economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.

2018-10-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC delivered only a limited increase in oil production in September, a Reuters survey has found, as a cut in Iranian shipments due to U.S. sanctions offset higher output in Libya, Saudi Arabia and Angola.  The 15-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.85 million barrels per day in September, the survey on Monday found, up 90,000 bpd from August’s revised level and the highest this year. But the 12 OPEC members bound by a supply-limiting agreement actually cut output by 70,000 bpd because of declines in Iran and Venezuela, boosting compliance with supply targets to 128 percent from a revised 122 percent in August, the survey found. Oil prices have extended a rally this year on expectations the sanctions on Iran will test OPEC’s ability to replace the shortfall, despite the group agreeing in June to pump more after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Oil LCOc1 on Monday reached $83.32 a barrel, the highest since 2014. “The supply situation looks fragile indeed, as any additional shortfall such as a deterioration of the situation in Venezuela would tighten oil supplies,” said Norbert Rücker at Julius Baer. OPEC’s June agreement involved OPEC, Russia and other non-members returning to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela and elsewhere pushed adherence above 160 percent. While Saudi Arabia has now almost fully reversed its pledged supply cut of 486,000 bpd, this has not fully offset losses in Iran and declining output in Venezuela and Angola. The biggest increase last month came from Libya where production averaged above 1 million bpd, the survey found. Libyan output remains volatile due to unrest, raising questions about the stability of current OPEC output. Angola, where natural declines at oilfields have been curbing production in recent years, boosted supply in September due to supply from a new field, Gindungo. Output is still far below its OPEC target. Saudi Arabia, after opening the taps in June and then scaling back its plans to pump more, supplied 10.53 million bpd in September, up 50,000 bpd, the survey found. The recent figure was still lower than June’s 10.60 million bpd. Supply in Nigeria, which like Libya is exempt from the OPEC supply cut pact because its output is often curbed by unplanned outages due to unrest and conflict, rose by 50,000 bpd.  Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, after raising output in July following the OPEC deal, kept supply little changed in September, the survey found. Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop of 100,000 bpd was in Iran. Exports fell as returning U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying the country’s oil. Production also slipped further in Venezuela, where a lack of funds for the oil industry because of the economic crisis is cutting refinery operations and crude exports.  Iraq’s output edged lower as exports from the south of the country did not hold at record levels for the whole month. This still left Iraq as OPEC’s least compliant member in September, according to the survey. Despite these decreases, OPEC output in September has risen to the highest since September 2017 according to Reuters surveys. This partly reflects the addition of Congo Republic to OPEC in June, not just increases by existing members.  Before Congo joined, OPEC had an implied production target for 2018 of 32.78 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output.  According to the survey, OPEC excluding Congo pumped about 230,000 bpd below this implied target in September. The survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-10-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers are increasingly betting Saudi Arabia and its allies cannot or will not replace all the crude lost from the market when U.S. sanctions on Iran go into effect fully from November. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their combined net long position in the six major petroleum contracts by another 50 million barrels in the week to Sept. 25. Portfolio managers have raised their combined net long position by a total of 196 million barrels over the last five weeks, according to exchange and regulatory data. Bullish long positions now outnumber bearish short ones by a ratio of more than 12:1, and the imbalance is rapidly closing in on the record 14:1 back in April. But the new wave of hedge fund bullishness is concentrated almost entirely in Brent rather than WTI or refined fuels. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OvBJTE) Fund managers have raised their net in Brent by 172 million barrels since Aug. 21 compared with an increase of just 5 million in WTI. Fund managers now hold a net long position of almost 500 million barrels in Brent betting prices will increase even further from their current four-year high. Hedge fund long positions outnumber short ones in Brent by more than 19:1, up from a ratio of just 8:1 at the start of August, and closing in on the record 21:1 set in April. Traders foresee a shortage of seaborne crudes linked to Brent as U.S. sanctions on Iran go into effect on Nov. 4, despite reassurances from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States supplies will remain adequate. Concern about feedstock shortages linked to sanctions explains why position-building has been overwhelmingly concentrated in Brent rather than WTI or refined fuels. The inland U.S. crude market remains well-supplied and refined fuel markets appear balanced as an international freight slowdown and higher prices take their toll on consumption. But Brent spot prices have climbed by more than $12 per barrel (17 percent) since mid-August while the six-month calendar spread has risen almost $2.60 and swung from contango into a pronounced backwardation. Saudi Arabia and Russia have both pledged to increase production to make up for the loss of crude oil exports from Iran. U.S. officials have been working with refiners in Asia to find replacements or Iranian oil. None of that has assuaged fears about shortfalls in crude availability as sanctions go into effect. Some analysts question whether Saudi Arabia has enough spare capacity to replace all the barrels lost as a result of sanctions while maintaining enough in reserve to meet any further shortfalls. Others question whether the kingdom is willing to increase production enough to act as a cap on prices or bring them back down below $80, despite political pressure from the United States. The enormous concentration of hedge fund long positions in Brent creates a significant risk of a short-term price reversal if and when fund managers attempt to realise some of their profits following the rally. For the time being, however, with doubts swirling around the outlook for oil supplies, the message from hedge fund managers is simple: show me the barrels. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-10-01,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European carmakers’ lobby on Monday warned that excessively steep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions limits on cars and vans could harm the industry and cost jobs ahead of a vote by the European Parliament on the new targets. EU lawmakers will vote on Wednesday on imposing a stricter CO2 limit of 45 percent by 2030 than the EU executive’s initial proposals of 30 percent - setting the stage for tough talks with national governments this year on the final law. “The more aggressive the CO2 reduction targets are, the more disruptive the socio-economic impacts will be,” Erik Jonnaert, the head of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), said in a statement. Weighing in on a clash between concerns about industry competitiveness and climate goals, ACEA said that tougher limits could slow growth in a sector which it said employs over six percent of EU workers.  “The stakes of Wednesday’s vote are extremely high for the entire sector,” Jonnaert said. He added that while carmakers are investing in electric vehicles, sales are still low, and governments should invest more in charging infrastructure and buy-side incentives. Environment campaigners, however, say that ambitious targets for the transport sector - the only one where greenhouse gas emissions are still rising - are needed to meet the bloc’s overall climate goal of reducing pollution by 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.  “It will be a big battle to maintain minus 45 (percent) on the table,” said EU lawmaker Bas Eickhout, a member of the Green group, which has pushed for the higher targets in European Parliament.

Worries on Italian politics and Chinese manufacturing tempered the optimism, but the last-gasp deal to save NAFTA was enough to put world stocks in the black. The United States and Canada salvaged NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century . Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent to a 27-year high and European stocks were up overall despite losses on Italian markets on political concerns. The Canadian dollar was up 0.65 percent against the dollar to a four-month high and the Mexican peso hit its highest in over seven weeks. “The trade deal is helping risk appetite across the board, especially the Canadian dollar, and that will likely lift appetite for emerging-market currencies across the board,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in London. A pan-European index of shares was up 0.25 percent, though gains were curbed by concern over how the Italian government’s spending plans would affect relations with the European Union. Italian bond yields extended last week’s rise and stocks fell on a report that the EU is set to reject Italy’s budget plans in November and open a procedure against the country’s public accounts. The closely watched spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields was at 270 basis points, over 30 bps wider than this time last week. “It is quite clear that the European Commission will not like (the budget proposal),” said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. “Brussels will give its opinion, which we think won’t be positive and ... the ratings agencies will opt for a similar stance. A downgrade is our base case.” The euro was also hit by worries about a rise in Italy’s fiscal deficit, dropping below the $1.16 mark having lost 1.2 percent last week and off three-month high of $1.18155 touched a week ago. Also casting a shadow were two surveys on Sunday that showed growth in Chinese manufacturing sputtered in September as domestic and export demand softened.

While analysts delved into the details of the pact, which is to be called United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), most investors reacted favourably, believing that getting a deal is better than no deal. “Investors will likely view the latest agreement positively, a sign that trade disputes are easing outside China-U.S. talks,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Most European shares are expected open higher, with financial spread-betters looking for 0.4 percent gains for France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX. In Britain, the FTSE was seen slipping 0.1 percent.

As U.S.-China trade conflict intensifies, we expect China’s policymakers to step up monetary and fiscal easing to soften the blow from higher tariffs,” they added. In Japan, the Bank of Japan’s tankan survey showed business confidence among Japan’s big manufacturers has worsened in the September for three quarters in a row - for the first time since 2008-2009. The world’s share markets had rallied in September on hopes that China and the United States will eventually work out a deal on trade, but plans for talks around the end of the month collapsed after the two sides launched more tit-for-tat tariffs.

2018-10-01,"(Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO) said on Sunday it has made an unsolicited bid to acquire rival MEG Energy Corp (MEG.TO) in a deal valued at C$6.4 billion ($5 billion) including debt. The combined company would have total production of more than 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and refining and upgrading capacity of about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), Husky said in a statement.  The offer comes as many Canadian oil producers have struggled with transportation bottlenecks as output has surged, pushing Canadian heavy crude to near-historic discounts to U.S. light crude. Husky Chief Executive Rob Peabody told Reuters that the combination of MEG’s top-quality assets and staff with its own production and downstream network would allow MEG to circumvent some of the effects from the Canadian crude discount, and provide benefits for both sets of shareholders. The Husky offer comes less than two months into the tenure of Derek Evans, an industry veteran who took over as chief executive of MEG in August. MEG Energy’s board will consider and evaluate the Husky’s unsolicited offer and the related takeover bid circular, if and when received, MEG said in a statement. MEG said it has formed a special committee of independent directors and has retained financial and legal advisers. “No formal offer has been made,” MEG said. “MEG shareholders are advised to take no action with respect to any Husky offer until the Board of Directors has had an opportunity to fully review the offer, when received, and to make a recommendation as to its merits.” Under the terms of the proposal, MEG shareholders will have the option to choose to receive consideration of C$11 in cash or 0.485 of a Husky share for every share held. That offer is subject to a maximum aggregate cash consideration of C$1 billion and a maximum aggregate number of Husky shares issued of about 107 million.  “The MEG Board of Directors has refused to engage in a discussion on the merits of a transaction, giving us no option but to bring this offer directly to MEG shareholders,” Peabody said in the statement. Husky’s offer delivers a 44 percent premium to the 10-day volume-weighted average MEG share price of C$7.62 as of Friday, and a 37 percent premium to MEG’s Friday close of C$8.03.  Goldman Sachs Canada Inc is acting as financial adviser and Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP is acting as lead legal adviser to Husky. The proposal, which has been unanimously approved by Husky’s board of directors, is expected to result in C$200 million per year in near-term, realizable synergies.

2018-10-01,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Talk about inconvenient timing. Just as Saudi Arabia is about to switch the way it prices its oil exports, the new benchmark throws a spanner in the works by surging inexplicably. Oman crude futures traded on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) rushed to their highest level in four years last week, trading as high as $90.90 a barrel on Sept. 26. While the sharp rise in prices isn’t without precedent, especially given market concern over the imminent loss of much of Iran’s exports, what was unusual was that Oman swept past Brent futures, the global benchmark. This has happened only on a handful of occasions in the past decade, most recently in September last year, and then only for a day and at a relatively modest premium of 54 cents a barrel, according to calculations by S&P Global Platts. Oman and Brent futures have different daily settlement times, but when the DME contract finished on Sept. 26 it was at $88.96 a barrel, while at that time Brent was at $82.14. Oman normally trades below Brent as it is a medium-sour crude, which is typically more costly for refiners to process and doesn’t yield as much of the high-value products such as gasoline as does Brent, which is a light, sweet oil. For Oman to romp to such a large premium to Brent, and maintain it for four sessions, is unusual and will no doubt be of concern to both the DME and Saudi Arabia, as well as the refiners who buy Saudi crude. Traders appear largely to have been caught by surprise by last week’s spike in Oman, if comments at the annual industry gathering in Singapore were anything to go by. But the likelihood is that the increase in Oman will be unwound in coming days, given that it seems to have been largely driven by buying by Chinese refiners. The bulk of delivered Oman heads to China and it appears that refiners in the world’s largest crude importer, especially smaller independent operators, were keen to stock up before the end of the year to use up their import allocations. Chinese buying may also have been boosted by the fact that this week is a holiday for the country’s National Day, meaning most crude trading businesses will be closed. There is also likely a smaller element of buying boosting the Oman contract, and that is the potential looming shortage of heavier and sour grades of crude as renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran ramp up to include all of the Islamic Republic’s crude exports from November. Many Asian refiners prefer heavier crudes, having invested in units that can process these grades into higher value products, especially middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel. While it’s likely that Oman’s premium to Brent will be unwound in coming days, the timing couldn’t have been worse for Saudi Aramco, the state-owned producer that is the world’s largest exporter of crude. From October, Aramco was changing the benchmarks used in calculating its official selling prices (OSPs), for the first time since the mid-1980s. The Saudis used to use the average of Oman and Dubai prices, as assessed by S&P Global Platts in calculating the OSPs. From this month it will use the average monthly price of DME Oman futures as well as the Platts average for physical Dubai quotes. The change has been a long time coming and is perhaps a reflection of the success the DME has had in building Oman futures into a viable benchmark for Middle East medium heavy and sour crude. The Platts assessments are also long-standing and well-respected in the market, but were perhaps more vulnerable to price spikes given the relatively small amount of physical crude underpinning the pricing. This happened in 2015 when the trading arms of China’s state-controlled refiners bought up large amounts of the oil available through the Platts pricing mechanism in a matter of days, leaving the pricing subject to volatility and spikes. The switch to using DME futures as one-half of the Saudi benchmark was supposed to make the pricing more transparent and robust, given the Oman contract has more physical volumes behind it and the backing of a cleared exchange. But last week’s surge has shown that the Oman contract can also shift dramatically in a short space of time, if the demand for crude is there. The Saudi OSPs tend to set the pattern for crude pricing from Iran, Iraq and Kuwait, meaning some 12 million barrels per day of exports are impacted. Asian refiners will now be worried that last week’s price action will result in higher than anticipated OSPs, with the Saudis likely to announce their prices at the end of this week. This isn’t the start the DME and Aramco would have wanted for the new pricing system, but the chances are it is merely a blip, rather than the harbinger of sustained volatility and uncertainty.

2018-10-01,"* Asian shares soft, trading seen slow with China on holiday * Caixin/Markit China manufacturing PMI hits lowest since May 2017 * Canadian dollar up on NAFTA hopes ahead of 0400 GMT deadline By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso rose on Monday on hopes of progress in negotiations over a renewed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal, but Asian shares got off to a slow start amid further signs of weakness in China. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent in early trade, led by fall in Australia, though activity is likely to be slow due to holidays in China including Hong Kong. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.25 percent though the Topix , broader and better gauge of the market, was down 0.2 percent. Casting a shadow in Asia, two surveys showed on Sunday that growth in China’s manufacturing sector sputtered in September as domestic and export demand softened.. The private Caixin/Markit factory Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 50.0, the lowest reading since May 2017, in a stark reminder that the trade disputes are starting to have real consequences on the economy. “The escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China recently has likely weighed on purchasing managers’ sentiment as reflected by softer readings in trade-related sub-indices,” wrote economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Deterioration of PMI in September is in line with our expectation that coincident growth indicators will get worse before getting better. As U.S.-China trade conflict intensifies, we expect China’s policymakers to step up monetary and fiscal easing to soften the blow from higher tariffs,” they added. The world’s share markets had rallied in September on hopes that China and the United States will eventually work out a deal on trade, but talks proposed for around the end of the month collapsed after the two sides launched more tit-for-tat tariffs. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s shares covering 47 markets rose for the third straight month in September. In the currency market, the Canadian dollar rose about 0.5 percent to a four-month high of C$1.2838 to the U.S. dollar . Canadian and U.S. negotiators “made lots of progress” on Sunday on a renewed NAFTA, but had still not settled tough issues such as American tariffs and access to Canada’s dairy market, an official and sources said. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said Canada must sign on to the text of the updated North American Free Trade Agreement by midnight on Sunday (0400 GMT Monday) or face exclusion from the pact. Canadian media said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will hold a cabinet meeting at 0200 GMT. The yen softened to 113.85 per dollar, its lowest since mid-November last year. On the other hand, the euro was hit by worries about rise in Italy’s fiscal deficit after the Italian government agreed to set a higher than expected budget deficit target that could put Rome on a collision course with Brussels. The common currency traded at $1.1608, having lost 1.2 percent last week and off three-month high of $1.18155 touched a week ago. Oil prices stayed near recent peaks, with international benchmark Brent trading near a four-year high, as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key exporters increased production. Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent to as high as $83.07 per barrel, the strongest level since November 2014.

2018-10-01,"KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Benjamin Jacob stops his new scooter at traffic lights in Malaysia’s capital, fellow drivers sometimes flash their lights or honk their horns at him, though he has done nothing wrong. With his silent electric motorcycle, other users of Kuala Lumpur’s congested roads wrongfully assume the 29-year-old has turned off his engine or fallen asleep at the wheel. But the delivery driver is always alert - especially since he was picked to take part in a new electric-vehicle pilot project run by logistics giant DHL eCommerce. When drivers beep at him or wind down their windows, Jacob lets them know he rides an electric bike that makes no sound. Parcel delivery firm DHL eCommerce is testing electric vehicles in Malaysia and Vietnam for a year as it works towards a goal of cutting its logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. As well as helping companies boost their green credentials, electric vehicles ease air pollution and can reduce a country’s costly oil imports. If the electricity that powers them is from renewable sources, they can also help meet the emissions reduction targets submitted by governments for the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change. Cities in the Asia-Pacific region have seen unprecedented growth over the last two decades. Many face air pollution crises, crippling congestion and other challenges related to mobility and infrastructure. Tackling noise pollution is also becoming increasingly important to improve the wellbeing of residents. The DHL project is rare in Asia, which experts say lags other regions in creating the right incentives, regulatory frameworks and infrastructure needed to make electric vehicles more attractive to both drivers and businesses. At first, DHL wanted to pilot the project in three countries, but regulatory issues and limited availability of e-bikes in Thailand prevented it from launching there, it said. Globally, the group hopes to replace 70 percent of all the vehicles it uses for “first and last-mile” delivery services with cleaner energy versions by 2025. “After one year, we will see which bike does the best and how practical it is to scale up and look at more fleet joining us,” Anil Gautam, managing director for DHL eCommerce Malaysia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Around the world, electric and plug-in hybrid cars topped 3 million in 2017, a 54 percent jump from 2016, according to a 2018 report by the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA). China was the largest electric car market, accounting for half sold last year - about 580,000 cars. Facing public health risks from increasingly polluted cities, the Chinese government has put in place clear targets for electric vehicle sales, said Nick Twork, general manager for innovation and technology communications at the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance in Paris. China has also invested in technology and mass production to bring down costs and make electric vehicles more affordable, he added. The United States had the second-highest number of plug-in vehicles, with about 280,000 cars sold last year, although Nordic countries lead on market share, the IEA said. Norway was in the top slot, with electric cars making up 39 percent of new car sales. China and Japan aside, experts said Asian governments should consult more with industry and consumers to improve policies on electric vehicles, especially as the economic advantages of switching to electric from fossil fuel vehicles are slim. There is a need to expand infrastructure for electric vehicle charging beyond homes and work places - a key barrier to take-up of electric vehicles in the region, said Dominic Patella, a transport specialist with the World Bank in Brussels. Governments can also provide incentives or subsidies for electric vehicle buyers - including low-cost registration - and tax breaks for sellers, experts said. “Where this generally works is when you have close cooperation between industry and government, and there are economic incentives for both infrastructure and the purchase of vehicles,” said Twork of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi. Preferential parking and lane access are other options for cities, many of which already ban diesel vehicles from the centre at busy times of day or have late-night curfews to reduce noise pollution. Governments, meanwhile, can make it easier to import electric vehicles, and play a role in persuading public and private transport providers to go electric. “Sometimes it takes government intervention to enable the uptake of electric mobility - and that’s where you need good policy, good programmes, good investments to enable good things to take place in the transport sector,” said Patella. SEA-CHANGE Businesses like parcel delivery and taxi companies have an easier route to switching to electric fleets because they can track routes and busy times, and recharge during quiet periods. Charging time for the DHL scooters is between 60 to 90 minutes for a range of about 140 km (87 miles), but this differs depending on the make of motorcycle tested, weight of the load and driver, battery age and the type of charger used. Most privately owned electric vehicles take hours to charge up, a process usually done overnight, but experts said the cost of batteries and charge times are falling fast. Between 2016 and 2022, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi aims to cut the cost of its batteries by 30 percent, with a 15-minute charge time and an overall range of 600 km. While electrified delivery fleets are expected to take off in other parts of the world first, Asia is a “fast follower”, given the rise in parcel delivery and freight across the region, especially from China, said Andrew Campbell, who provides technical support for the Philippines’ e-Trike Project. The government-backed programme aims to electrify and replace all the country’s rickshaw-style tuk tuks, and has rolled out about 3,000 e-trikes so far. ""Somewhere between the five and 10-year mark, we are going to see a sea-change,"" said Wellington-based Campbell. (Reporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-10-01,"* Brent crude above $83 ahead of November Iran sanctions * Stagnant U.S. rig count supports U.S. crude prices * High prices, trade disputes threaten demand growth * Brent crude in different currencies: tmsnrt.rs/2N67zl9 By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices opened firmly on Monday, with Brent hovering close its highest in nearly four years ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran that kick in next month. Brent crude oil futures were trading at $83.04 per barrel at 0057 GMT, up 31 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close and near the $83.07 level reached during the last session - the highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 23 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $73.48 a barrel. WTI prices were supported by a stagnant rig count, which points to a slowdown in U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA. Brent was pushed up by the looming sanctions against Iran, which will start targeting its oil sector from Nov. 4. There had been expectations China would ignore U.S. sanctions. However, China’s Sinopec is halving loadings of crude oil from Iran this month, in a sign that pressure from Washington is having an effect. “If Chinese refiners do comply with U.S. sanctions more fully than expected, then the market balance is likely to tighten even more aggressively,” Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank wrote in a note published on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Saturday, discussing ways to maintain sufficient supply once Iran’s exports are hit by sanctions. “Until sizable supply is offered up by OPEC, ultimately traders will continue to push the envelope even more,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. “Even if they (Saudi Arabia) wanted to bend to President Trump’s wishes, how much spare capacity does the Kingdom have?” asked Innes. “We’re going to find out very soon as approximately 1.5 million barrels (per day) of Iranian oil is effectively going offline on Nov. 4. If the market senses that Saudi Arabia capacity is tapped out at 10.5 million bpd ... oil prices will rocket higher with the flashy $100 per barrel price tag indeed a reasonable sounding target,” Innes said. With oil prices soaring, there are concerns over their inflationary effect on demand growth, especially in Asia’s emerging markets where weakening currencies are further adding to high fuel import costs. Add the trade disputes between the United States and other major powers, especially China, and economic growth into 2019 could be eroded. Growth in China’s manufacturing sector already sputtered in September as both external and domestic demand weakened, two surveys showed on Sunday. In Japan, business confidence among big manufacturers worsened in the last quarter to hit its lowest level in nearly a year, as firms felt the pinch from rising raw material costs and as global trade conditions worsened.

Import-reliant economies are already aching under oil prices that have risen above $80 per barrel this week, the most since late 2014. Analysts warn the inflationary combination of higher oil costs and weakening currencies, including India’s rupee, Indonesia’s rupiah and the Philippine peso, could cause a global economic slowdown that would also crimp oil demand in those countries. The rumblings of falling demand undermines the current market narrative that projects rising crude prices, in some cases to $100 a barrel, amid the loss of Iranian supply as the United States is set impose new sanctions on the country on Nov. 4. “The currency exchange for those emerging economies is leading to expensive prices at the pump... We expect this will lead to lower demand growth in the region,” said Keisuke Sadamori, director of energy markets and security at the International Energy Agency (IEA) this week. Edward Morse, the global head of commodities at Citi Research, said the emerging market woes could shave 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) off oil demand growth in 2019. The IEA currently expects global oil demand growth for 2018 and 2019 at 1.4 million bpd and 1.5 million bpd, respectively. At $80 per barrel, Asia’s oil import bill would breach $1 trillion a year, and few traders or analysts expect crude prices to ease. For the lower income countries of emerging Asia, fuel prices are too expensive at those levels. “We have already heard anecdotes from around the world that customers try to economise at the pump by downgrading their fuel consumption from high quality fuel to lower quality fuel to save the extra few bucks,” said Janet Kong, chief executive of Integrated Supply and Trading Eastern Hemisphere at BP. Global oil consumption is set to increase by 1.4 percent in 2018, according to the IEA. But that number may fall as Asian governments and consumers try to cut their oil costs. In India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer, refiners are considering the risky move of cutting back crude imports, hoping to use up stocks until prices fall back. The currency’s plunge has meant oil prices have risen nearly 50 percent in rupee terms this year. Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest country and economy, increased its subsidy of diesel sold in fuel stations and its imports of lower quality gasoline. The Philippines, another major Asian emerging economy, is allowing the sale of lower quality fuels to consumers to combat inflation, according to two trade sources. When oil prices declined in 2014, many governments including India and Indonesia, increased fuel taxes or removed subsidies leading to record high retail fuel prices as crude prices rose. The IEA’s Sadamori said there is increasing pressure on some countries to re-introduce fossil fuel subsidies. “That’s something we are really concerned about,” he added.

2018-10-01,"(Repeats story from Sept. 28 for wider readership with no change to text) * Refiners brace for plunge in HSFO demand, diesel boom in 2020 * Some to stay flexible as HSFO demand may rebound on scrubbers * Fuel upgrade projects take time, require govt approval and money * Refiners may process more low-sulphur crude By Florence Tan, Osamu Tsukimori and Julia Payne SINGAPORE/TOKYO/LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - High-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), essentially the leftovers of an oil refiner’s output, will still flow from refineries around the world even after new rules start up in 2020 curtailing its use in the global shipping fleet, a Reuters survey showed. Sixty percent of the 33 refineries contacted by Reuters in a global survey will still produce HSFO in 2020 although the supply will tighten as 70 percent of these refiners plan to reduce their output. Starting that year, ships will have to use marine fuel, which primarily consists of residual fuel oil, with a maximum sulphur content of 0.5 percent under International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules to reduce air pollution. Currently, the global shipping fleet, which includes oil and chemical tankers as well as container ships, uses as much as 3.3 million barrels per day of HSFO with a maximum of 3.5 percent sulphur. Refiners will have little incentive to produce HSFO after the regulations though some demand will remain as a small but growing number of vessels are fitted with smokestack scrubbers that remove the sulphur from the exhaust fumes and power plants will continue to consume the fuel. “Although HSFO demand for ships is expected to decline substantially in 2020, the oil’s demand for power generation and general users will remain,” Japan’s second-largest refiner Idemitsu Kosan told Reuters in the survey. “In future, demand for scrubber-equipped ships is projected to recover, so we expect HSFO output to continue.” (Reuters survey of refiners on IMO 2020: tmsnrt.rs/2OG8iv3) When asked how they plan to reduce HSFO output, just over half of the refiners said they will upgrade their plants to further process their fuel oil to produce more higher value products such as gasoline and diesel. Two-thirds of the 16 refiners who responded to a question about how much investment they plan to pump into their plants to produce more ultra-low and low-sulphur fuel oil, said they plan to spend less than $100 million. Five of them are investing between $500 million and more than $1 billion in such projects. Polish refiner Grupa LOTOS will spend more than $600 million to convert its heavy residue to middle distillates and coke by the end of 2019 while Kuwait has a $6.25 billion clean fuels project. Fuel oil, or residue fuel, is the remaining product from crude oil processed through crude distillation units at a refinery. To extract more value from residue, it is further processed at secondary refining units such as residue fluid catalytic crackers, hydrocrackers and cokers to produce gasoline and diesel. However, secondary units are costly and require years to build while expansion projects in some countries have to overcome tough environment regulations. “We will need (the Environment Protection Agency’s) approval if we want to expand the coker and that is tough in Taiwan now,” Formosa Petrochemical Corp spokesman KY Lin said. Formosa has adjusted its coker unit, which uses heat and pressure to break down the residue fuel into other products, to run at 95 percent utilization from 90 percent to reduce its HSFO output, Lin said. Refiners will want to cut their HSFO output as much as possible to offset the expected drop in value. By January 2020, 380-centistoke HSFO in Singapore will be worth $16.70 a barrel less than Middle East benchmark Dubai crude, down from a discount of $5 for October 2018, according to swap values. Besides upgrading, a handful of refiners said they would also process more lower sulphur crude oil to reduce the sulphur content in their products output. Refiners may also cut their overall CDU runs to reduce their residue output if low fuel oil margins drag down overall profits, according to the survey. “Forward prices are scary,” Formosa’s Lin said. Other refiners will look at alternative markets for their HSFO. “If fuel oil demand falls, we will switch our configuration to produce bitumen which is in high demand in India due to its road-building programme,” said an official from Indian Oil Corp . Some refiners prefer to stay flexible by being able to switch their output between low- and high-sulphur fuel oil according to market demand. India’s Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd said it will be able to produce either fuel oil or switch to other products depending on demand after 2022. “We will not reduce fuel oil output to zero completely as we need our refineries to be flexible,” a BPCL official said. The official declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Italy’s Eni said it “will produce the minimum amount of HSFO just to satisfy the market demand of the ships that will have installed the scrubbers.” An official from India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd said the company will be producing some fuel oil but the output will be “very, very low beyond 2022”. A third of the respondents said they are either already not producing any HSFO or will stop producing in 2020. Polish refiner PKN Orlen said it will produce fuel oil with 1 percent sulphur content from 2020 while a spokeswoman from Italy’s SARAS refinery said, “We are already ready to face IMO-2020 and we already produce basically no HSFO.” Canada’s Husky Energy Spokesman Mel Duvall said the company expects to benefit from the new IMO rule since it will boost diesel demand. “It is expected that there will be an increase in global demand for diesel fuel as ship operators switch from high-sulphur fuel oil,” he said.
