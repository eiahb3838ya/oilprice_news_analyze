2018-10-25,"(Adds comments from Nadeau, background) By Stephanie Kelly NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The United States is looking for a “pragmatic” approach to the implementation of new marine fuel emission rules that go into effect in 2020, a U.S. Coast Guard official said on Thursday. The United States will seek to develop a proposal or proposals with like-minded countries for a May 2019 meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) environmental body, Rear Admiral John Nadeau, assistant commandant for prevention policy for the Coast Guard, said on the sidelines of a conference in New York. The IMO has set new rules that will ban ships from using fuels with a sulfur content above 0.5 percent from Jan. 1, 2020, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with scrubbers to clean sulfur emissions. Last week, the United States said it supported a phase-in of the 2020 rules to protect consumers from any price spikes in heating and trucking fuels, although it did not seek to delay the regulations. Some shipping associations together with the Bahamas, Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands this week proposed an “experience-building phase,” which gained support from Washington. But Wednesday’s meeting of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in London pushed back on the idea, calling it vague, confusing and said it would require more definition. The proposal’s backers were told they could submit further concrete proposals for the next MEPC in May. That will leave little time for deliberations before the regulations kick in. Nadeau said that to his knowledge there was no discussion this week of delaying implementation of the rules. Conversations have focused around problems that might arise from the 2020 start date, including issues surrounding fuel oil quality, he told Reuters at a conference held by the North American Marine Environment Protection Association. “We welcome and invite the opportunity to go back to MEPC 74 in May with proposals that we’ve developed working with like-minded countries to help make sure we have a pragmatic compliance regime in place as we go forward,” he said.

2018-10-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed back on Thursday after a massive sell-off the day previous, with strong earnings encouraging investors to venture into risky bets again, while the dollar gained on the euro. Oil prices were bolstered by the rebound in equities markets and as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister signaled major producers may need to intervene in crude markets to support prices. The euro fell to a two month low after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi reaffirmed that the bank’s 2.6-trillion euro ($2.97 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, even though the economic outlook has darkened and political turmoil looms in Italy. While equity investors were reassured by positive earnings from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and strong advertising revenues from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) they also voiced some caution about whether the broader pullback was over. “You can’t look at it blindly and say earnings are turning the market around and we’re all clear. A lot of people are skeptical of any kind of action in the market right now, especially to the upside. That’s why volume is light today,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist, senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Even the most optimistic investors were cautious. “Quarterly reports are providing better-than-expected earnings, revenue and guidance. That triple play is instilling confidence in investors,” said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny’s Commentary LLC. But, he added, “We need other drivers to provide stability to the market after this meaningful sell-off we’ve seen in the last five weeks.” Investors are looking for further strong results for the remaining two thirds of S&P 500 companies that are yet to report, as well as a resumption of share buybacks by companies that have already reported.  They are also awaiting third-quarter U.S. GDP data that is due out on Friday. If the reading is lower than expectations investors will worry about economic growth but if it is much higher they will fear a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes, Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 401.13 points, or 1.63 percent, to 24,984.55, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 49.47 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,705.57 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 209.94 points, or 2.95 percent, to 7,318.34. [.N] In the previous day’s session the indexes had plunged, confirming a correction for the Nasdaq as disappointing forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data had fueled jitters about economic and profit growth. During its trading day, the pan-European STOXX 600  had darted in and out of positive territory before closing up 0.51 percent, while the MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.75 percent. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.17 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.17 percent to $1.1372. Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and Rome would come to a compromise over Italy’s budget plans, but the euro had reversed earlier gains after he said the monetary union remained fragile. Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc CHF= and Japanese yen JPY= safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds held their ground. The Japanese yen weakened 0.15 percent versus the greenback at 112.43 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2816, down 0.50 percent on the day. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.24 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 3.72 percent. U.S. Treasury yields rose from three-week lows as equities gained, though anxiety about ongoing stock volatility continued to give some support to safe-haven U.S. government debt prices. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries US10YT=RR last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.1262 percent, from 3.124 percent late on Wednesday.  U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.25 percent to $66.99 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $76.63, up 0.6 percent on the day. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.1 percent to $1,231.82 an ounce due to the strong dollar and the equities rebound.

2018-10-25,"* Europe tumbles after Wall St suffers worst fall since 2011 * Losses for world stocks since Jan close to $7 trillion * MSCI ex-Japan down over 18 pct this year, Nikkei at 6-month lows * ECB faces tough questions on stimulus withdrawal, Italy woes * Turkey central bank expected to risk pausing rate hikes * Yen and Swiss franc * Chip stocks hammered amid earnings, economic worries By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Europe attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia put global stocks firmly on course for their worst month since the financial crisis. It wasn’t a sunny picture by any means. Germany’s Dax hit a near two-year low and London’s FTSE and Paris’ CAC 40 both brushed 1-1/2 year lows early on, but a semblance of stability was emerging. The pan-European STOXX 600 was almost back at level pegging having opened down almost 1 percent and after Japan’s Nikkei had slumped 3.5 percent overnight. Currency dealers were also cautiously reversing out of Swiss franc and Japanese yen safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds made ground as traders waited to see what message the European Central Bank delivers at its meeting later. “The markets have been acting like classic flight-to-safety markets,” said London & Capital’s head of fixed income Sanjay Joshi, pointing to the slump in stocks and rally in safer bonds and currencies. “The worst thing the ECB could do would be to come out with a hawkish statement considering the situation we have at the moment.” Most economists expect ECB President Mario Draghi to say the bank will stick to plans to end stimulus this year. But it will be the signal he sends about market volatility and concerns around Italy, his homeland, that could be most crucial. Heavyweight investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock prices, faster rate hikes in the United States and an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth. Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI’s global equity index are now in so-called ‘bear market’ territory — down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks. More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific shares skidded more than 2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low. The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in the black having dropped as much as 2.5 percent at one point , as fresh government support measures failed to ease worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the U.S. “If you’re a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,” said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. Europe’s stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank UBS and engineering giant ABB which helped take the edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning from U.S. digger behemoth Caterpillar. The ECB was looming too. Weak euro zone economic data this week have added to angst over world growth, as has a surprise slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing. It wasn’t just the ECB that was being closely watched either. Turkey, which has been stabilising in recent weeks having been at the centre of emerging market troubles was also holding a central bank meeting. The consensus is that having almost doubled its interest rates already this year to 24 percent, it might be brave enough to hold still this month. In foreign exchange markets, the euro clawed its way back up to $1.14, having breached a long standing bulwark of $1.1430. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a nine-week peak to 96.296 and for the first time in days it was barely budged against the safety first Japanese yen at 112.25 yen. Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887 , having dropped 0.8 percent overnight and oil prices began to gain having been dragged down by the concerns over global growth. Brent crude was last at $76 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $66.63 . Gold was a tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce. “Expect spirited rallies,” said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and

Wohlrabe said it would be difficult for Germany to meet a growth forecast of 0.6 percent for the fourth quarter which the institute had given in its autumn report but the institute was sticking to a full year growth forecast of 1.7 percent. He said exports expectations fell significantly in October which hurt the German business climate. “The golden autumn for the German economy is not materialising,” Wohlrabe said, adding that pessimism was spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell significantly, burdened by the WLTP emissions tests.

The bodies of the two workers trapped in the mine in the eastern province of Shandong since Saturday were found early on Thursday, Xinhua reported, citing the rescue operations.     A rock burst destroyed part of a water drainage tunnel in the mine, owned by Shandong Energy Group Co Ltd, initially killing two and trapping 20 workers.  The progress of rescue teams has been slow due to difficulty in clearing debris to get to the trapped workers. Two workers were rescued on Sunday, but state media said one of them later died.  Provincial authorities on Monday ordered 41 coal mines to halt production for security checks, though the cause of the accident remains unclear. The state television reported a gas explosion in a coal mine in the southwestern province of Sichuan on Thursday killed four workers and injured two.

2018-10-25,"PULAU INDAH, Malaysia (Reuters) - Hundreds of sacks filled with plastic waste from the United States, Britain, South Korea and Spain spill onto the streets of an industrial zone in Pulau Indah, an island town just an hour’s drive from Kuala Lumpur and home to Malaysia’s biggest port.  The stench of burning plastic and fumes from nearly a dozen recycling factories wafts through the neighbourhood, even as more container-loads of plastic waste are unloaded.  Pulau Indah - ironically, the name means “beautiful island” in Malay - is one of many towns in Malaysia where illegal plastic recycling factories have popped up in recent months as the Southeast Asian nation became the top choice for plastic waste exporters from around the world.  The trigger for this dumping deluge was a Chinese ban on waste imports from the beginning of this year, which disrupted the flow of more than 7 million tonnes of plastic scrap a year.  Malaysia quickly became the leading alternative destination, importing nearly half a million tonnes of plastic waste between January and July from just its top 10 source-countries. Dozens of factories have opened up in Malaysia to handle that waste, many without an operating licence, using low-end technology and environmentally harmful methods of disposal.  “The situation is getting worse, especially with more and more illegal plastic recycling factories,” Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia’s minister of energy, technology, science, climate change and environment, told parliament last week.  Used plastic is recycled into pellets, which are then used to manufacture other plastic products, but the process comes with pollution risks. Plastic unsuitable for recycling is burnt, which releases toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. Or it ends up in landfill, potentially contaminating soil and water sources. Yeo said she does not want Malaysia to be the “trash can” for developed nations, but Housing Minister Zuraida Kamaruddin, who oversees the waste management department, told Reuters that the government also does not want to miss out on a business that could be worth billions. Both ministers are members of a government committee studying its options for dealing with the growing pile of plastic waste. In the Pulau Indah industrial zone, Reuters reporters saw nearly a dozen recycling plants, many of them without signboards or company names, though government data shows only two factories in that area have a licence to import plastic waste. One of the bigger ones, Jingye Manufacturing Sdn Bhd, was shut down in August for not having a licence, according to an official notice seen by Reuters. But workers in the factory and others nearby say it reopened within weeks, and when Reuters reporters visited earlier this month, it was operating. Plastic waste was stacked up within the premises and all along the road.  The factory supervisor declined to comment. Company records show Jingye was set up in Malaysia in October 2017, three months after China said it would ban imports of foreign waste from 2018. Reuters could not reach the owners of the factory and no contact details were listed in records. One worker in the industrial zone, who did not want to be identified, said there were as many as eight illegal factories in the zone and many openly burned plastic that cannot be recycled.  “Every night they burn. I see black smoke at night, so I go over and ask him ‘why are you trying to kill me?’ They ignore me,” he said. In the nearby district of Kuala Langat, authorities found 41 factories operating illegally, many of them run by Chinese companies, according to Housing Minister Zuraida. Around 30 were shut down by authorities in the last three months after residents complained of open burning of plastic and health complications.  It is unclear how the illegal factories are sourcing plastic waste. Zuraida said some of the 95 companies that have a permit to import and recycle such waste are subcontracting to illegal factories as they lack the capacity to handle such volumes.    Malaysia’s imports of plastic waste from its 10 biggest source-countries jumped to 456,000 tonnes between January and July, versus 316,600 tonnes purchased in all of 2017 and 168,500 tonnes in 2016. The United States, the world’s top exporter of plastic waste, sent 178,238 tonnes of such waste to Malaysia between January and July, nearly twice as much as it sent to second top destination, Thailand, according to the United Nations’ trade database and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries.   Britain, another big plastic waste exporter, sends a quarter of its waste to Malaysia, also more than any other country. Environment Minister Yeo estimated that the plastic recycling industry would earn Malaysia 3.5 billion ringgit (649.89 million pounds) this year. Zuraida said she planned to introduce new rules soon that will make it harder for factories to qualify for an import licence.  “I understand plastic recycling is quite lucrative. So I am also thinking should we miss this economic opportunity? This is something the committee will study,” Zuraida told Reuters. If such an option is pursued, Malaysia would do so on strict terms, require high-end, green technology and allow factories to operate only in heavy industrial areas, she said. The factories are currently located haphazardly, including near or within residential areas. In Kuala Langat, southwest of Kuala Lumpur, a massive recycling factory nestled between palm plantations was shut down three months ago. But 10-foot (3 metre) tall towers of plastic waste - mostly consumer packaging material from the United States, Britain, France, Netherlands, Germany and Australia - were still piled in the front yard. A large plot of land next to the factory has been turned into a dumping site for scrap. (Click tmsnrt.rs/2OKAfWJ for an interactive graphic) Reporting by A.

2018-10-25,"(Reuters) - Shares in EQT Corp, the biggest producer of natural gas in the United States, fell to an eight-year low on Thursday after the company reported third quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents, which missed the 42 cents per share estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. EQT shares dropped by more than $6, or 16 percent, to around $34 in midday trade, their lowest since 2010. By mid-afternoon, they were down 13.7 percent. Also on Thursday, the Pittsburgh-based driller announced the appointment of new directors on the completion of the separation of its upstream and midstream businesses. EQT said its earnings in the quarter were hurt by higher operating costs, including a charge related to the sale of some assets, and higher interest expense. The company also reduced guidance for the amount of gas it expects to sell in 2018 because some wells will enter service later than planned in the fourth quarter. The company said it now expects to produce 1,460-1,480 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe) in 2018, down from 1,520-1,550 bcfe projected in its first quarter earnings release. EQT boosted its estimated well development capital expenditures for 2018 by $300 million to $2.5 billion due to inefficiencies resulting from higher activity levels, the learning curve on ultra-long laterals and service cost increases. In addition, the company boosted its hedging for 2019 and 2020 far above the amount it hedged for 2018 and 2019 at this time last year. Just looking at swaps on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) - where EQT did most of its hedging - the company said total volume hedged was 600 billion cubic feet (bcf) at an average price of $2.99 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2019 and 393 bcf at $2.98 in 2020. In the third quarter of 2017, EQT said total volume hedged using NYMEX swaps was 189 bcf at $3.18 for 2018 and just 19 bcf at $3.12 for 2019.

2018-10-25,"(Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc on Thursday will unveil an urban delivery test in Seattle that uses electric bicycles geared to carry packages in large preloaded boxes to save time and cut pollution, the company said. The new project from UPS, which started in Seattle in 1907 as a bicycle messenger company, comes as deliveries of online purchases surge. UPS and its rivals - including FedEx Corp - are also searching for ways to slash delivery costs and vehicle emissions.     UPS partnered with Silver Eagle Manufacturing and Truck Trikes to design the cargo eBike, which has a battery-powered electric motor, for the test, which begins on Nov. 5, UPS said.  The bike hauls replaceable, 95 cubic-foot boxes that carry packages weighing up to 400 lbs, UPS said, adding that the trailer and replaceable container configuration of the bike is a U.S. first. The rider will pick up pre-loaded containers from a designated city parking spot and return them empty.   Using pre-loaded cargo boxes “wipes out” the double handling of packages and helps to shrink delivery costs, Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters.  UPS, the world’s biggest package delivery company, already has walking and bicycle delivery projects in more than 30 cities, including Dublin, Rome, London and Pittsburgh. The company is also testing 9,300 low-emission vehicles around the world.   UPS, FedEx and Deutsche Post AG unit DHL face pressure from regulators around the world to lessen the environmental impact of their fleets.

2018-10-25,"* Wall St, Europe indexes bounce back after Asia falters * U.S. Treasury prices dip as stocks come back in fashion * Euro falls as ECB says to go ahead with stimulus withdrawal * Safe-haven Yen eases gains as market panic subsides (Updates to mid morning U.S. trade, adds commentary, changes byline, previous dateline LONDON) By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks followed Europe higher on Thursday after investors ventured into risky bets again with encouragement from some strong earnings and the dollar rose against the euro after remarks from Europe’s Central Bank chief fueled fears about the monetary union. Oil prices stabilized after an early sell-off as investors returned their focus to the fundamentals of supply and demand as equity markets regained some lost ground. The greenback rose against the euro after the ECB’s Mario Draghi reaffirmed that its 2.6-trillion euro ($2.97 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer even though the economic outlook has darkened and political turmoil looms in Italy. While equity investors sought bargains and some were reassured by positive earnings and stronger technology stocks, they also voiced caution. “There’s a sense of nervousness and caution because a lot of people were caught off guard by the drop yesterday,” Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida said. “At this point it’s all about sentiment. People are looking for things to settle down and I think we need to see more concrete evidence of that.” Wall Street was helped by reassuring results from Microsoft Corp and strong advertising revenues from Twitter Inc . Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon.com were among the top boosters of the S&P ahead of their results later. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 375.12 points, or 1.53 percent, to 24,958.54, the S&P 500 gained 47.06 points, or 1.77 percent, to 2,703.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 196.21 points, or 2.76 percent, to 7,304.61. The pan-European STOXX 600 was darting in and out of positive territory. It rose 0.51 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.70 percent. Draghi said he was confident the European Commission and Rome would come to a compromise over Rome’s budget plans, but the euro reversed earlier gains after he said the monetary union remained fragile. The dollar index rose 0.18 percent, with the euro down 0.15 percent to $1.1374. Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc and Japanese yen safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds held their ground as Draghi reiterated the European Central Bank’s plans to carefully remove its stimulus. The Japanese yen weakened 0.28 percent versus the greenback at 112.61 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2823, down 0.44 percent on the day. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.22 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 3.72 percent. But in China, the Shanghai SE Composite index managed to eke out a tiny gain after dropping as much as 2.8 percent at one point. Investors were also eyeing mixed U.S. economic data. New applications for U.S. unemployment aid rose last week, but the number of Americans receiving benefits fell to more than a 45-year low, pointing to tightening labor market conditions. But new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell for a second straight month in September and the goods trade deficit increased further amid rising imports, suggesting economic growth moderated in the third quarter. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.1375 percent, from 3.124 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. crude rose 1.03 percent to $67.51 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.82, up 0.85 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Amy Caren Daniel in Bengaluru, Kate

2018-10-25,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Diversified miner Teck Resources Ltd, the world’s second-biggest exporter of steel-making coal, reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Thursday, hit by declining commodity prices and higher costs.  A number of one-time events also weighed on the quarter, including delayed zinc sales and higher costs at the Trail smelter due to forest fire smoke, adding up to C$58 million  ($44.39 million), TD Securities analyst Greg Barnes said in a note. Strong steel-making coal sales in the quarter would have “significantly” exceeded Teck’s forecast of 6.8 million tonnes, the company said, but logistics issues at Westshore Terminals delayed delivery of approximately 250,000 tonnes of the material, worth some C$55 million in revenue. The Vancouver-based company now expects 2018 steel-making coal output in the low end of a range between 26 million and 27 million tonnes, while full-year costs are seen at C$60-C$63 a ton, up from C$56-C$60 previously. Teck shares fell as much as 6 percent after the results were announced before edging up to C$25.99, a 3.4 percent decline. That was partly offset by improved guidance for Teck’s copper and zinc units, said Clarkson Platou analyst Jeremy Sussman in a note. Teck now expects 2018 copper output of 285,000-295,000 tonnes, up from 280,000-290,000 tonnes, with costs at $1.25-$1.30 per pound, down from US$1.30-$1.40. Zinc output in 2018 is now estimated at 660,000-675,000 tonnes, up from 655,000-670,000 tonnes. Teck, which also produces copper, zinc, gold and bitumen, said it expects fourth-quarter steel-making coal sales will be flat from 6.7 million tonnes in the third quarter. The average realized price of steel-making coal rose 10 percent in the third quarter to US$172 a ton, it said. Teck also said it may face charges under the Canadian Fisheries Act, for discharges of selenium and calcide from its Elk Valley coal mines. Penalties could include fines or operations orders and be material, but it is too early to asses, the company said. The company still expects to announce a development partner for its Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project in the fourth quarter. In April, Teck said a partner could contribute about $2 billion for a 30 percent to 40 percent share. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Teck said its adjusted profit fell to C$466 million ($357.6 million), or C0.81 per share, from C$605 million, or C$1.05 per share. Analysts expected earnings of 94 Canadian cents a share, according to Refinitiv. Revenue rose 4.4 percent to C$3.21 billion.

2018-10-25,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s investment forum was designed to showcase the kingdom’s new future away from oil, but it was black gold and old allies that rescued this week’s event from the furor over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Riyadh inked multi-billion dollar agreements, mainly energy deals, despite a boycott of the event by dozens of high-level Western politicians, bankers and top executives scheduled to speak at the three-day gathering that ended on Thursday. Yet the event paled in comparison to the 2017 inaugural investment conference, when robots roamed the venue as the kingdom turned its focus to the promise of new technology and announced plans to build a $500 billion mega city of the future. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, told Bloomberg earlier this month that Riyadh would announce an “amazing deal” at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) forum this year, vowing “big numbers” in a sector “far away from oil”. But when the final session ended, no such announcement had been made. “It’s going back to old economy while the FII was supposed to be about the future. Old economy coming to the rescue of the new economy,” said one participant at the investment conference. Saudi Arabia signed 25 agreements on Tuesday worth more than $55 billion in the energy, petrochemicals, infrastructure and transportation sectors. Out of the total, state oil giant Saudi Aramco alone signed memoranda of understanding worth $34 billion with some of its key longtime partners such as France’s Total (TOTF.PA), and international service companies Schlumberger, Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes (BHGE.N). Asked by reporters about the impact of the Khashoggi killing on Aramco, chief executive Amin Nasser answered with a question of his own: “How much did we sign today?... How much was signed by Aramco? 34 billion dollars.” Another conference attendee said that the lack of high-tech investments was “palpable”.  “It was like ‘Aramco to the rescue’. They pulled out old deals... put (Energy Minister Khalid) al-Falih, Nasser and Total up on stage, and had them sign stuff that those who know energy already knew.” Total signed deals for engineering studies to build a petrochemical complex in Jubail, where it already has a refinery venture with Aramco on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. It also signed an agreement for a possible investment of a retail service station network with Aramco. Both announcements are not new and have been in the works for months.  The French oil major’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné issued a statement in support of Saudi Arabia, which is facing one of its toughest political crises in decades, before he flew to Riyadh to take part in the event as a panelist. “Some business leaders have decided that the circumstances do not allow them to visit Riyadh. I respect their choice. Total has never been in favor of sanctions and isolation - for example, against Russia, Iran or Qatar - and nor do we support boycotts,” Pouyanné said. “Total has partnered with Saudi Aramco for 40 years.” Several Western countries including key ally the United States were discussing the prospect of sanctions against the world’s top oil exporter. Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country has been cooperating closely with the kingdom on oil markets, said he could not justify ruining relations with Riyadh. Russia sent a delegation of more than 30 entrepreneurs and leaders of major Russian companies to the FII. Riyadh and Moscow are leading the so-called OPEC+ alliance in managing the oil market and the two major producers coordinate on output policies closely. African and Arab leaders, including close ally King Abdullah of Jordan, also rallied around Riyadh. Leaders from Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon walked beside Prince Mohammed as he entered the main hall on Wednesday. The prime minister of Pakistan, the presidents of Gabon and Senegal and the deputy prime minister of Ethiopia spoke onstage. In sectors like banking and consulting, where Western companies have a deep presence in the kingdom, senior executives canceled their engagements at the conference but still sent regional representatives for appearances and meetings. Credit Suisse, HSBC, Mastercard and Siemens remained “strategic partners” for the event, while consulting firms Deloitte, EY, McKinsey, Oliver Wyman, PwC, Strategy& and the Boston Consulting Group stayed on as “knowledge partners.” Global investment banks, which according to Refinitiv data earned $2.7 billion in fees in Saudi Arabia since 2000, all sent delegations, even if their top bosses stayed away.     HSBC, which has a 40 percent stake in a Saudi bank and has played an active role in the kingdom in recent years, had one of the largest teams with around 10 people, including Samir Assaf, the head of its investment bank.      An executive from a Chinese financial firm said some Western executives there were keeping lower profiles because of the Khashoggi affair: “A lot of the movers and shakers are represented here, you just don’t see them.” On the first day, Saudi officials thanked friends who came. “Let me first express my appreciation and gratitude for the many friends and partners who are with us today as we all know these are difficult days for us in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” said Falih. “We are going through a crisis of sorts.” On Wednesday, Prince Mohammed broke his silence about the killing of Khashoggi, one of his prominent critics, vowing to bring those responsible to justice. Striking a defiant tone, he took the stage for a panel discussion, touting Saudi Arabia’s reform drive and highlighting the promise of Middle East economies, even Qatar’s with which the kingdom is in a protracted dispute. “Any success for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is very contagious to the region,” said Bahrain Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa.   In a remark that played well in the main conference chamber, where Saudis formed a larger proportion than in 2017, Prince Mohammed added: “I think that the new Europe is the Middle East.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal with additional reporting by David Gaffen in New York, Marwa Rashad, Stephen Kalin and Andrew Torchia in Riyadh, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-investment-forum/back-to-the-future-saudi-investor-forum-saved-by-old-mainstay-oil-idUKL8N1X378J,25 Oct 2018,"Saudi Arabia's investment forum

2018-10-25,"LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - OPEC signaled on Thursday it may have to return to oil production cuts as global inventories rise, in a statement that may further sour relations with U.S. President Donald Trump. The president has repeatedly lashed out at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, saying it is not supplying enough oil. OPEC, plus Russia and other allied non-OPEC producers agreed to pump more in June. An OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial panel concluded that supply is “very comfortable” compared to demand and warned producers may need a change of tack because of rising inventories and economic uncertainties. “The committee, however, expressed concerns about rising inventories in recent weeks and also noted looming macroeconomic uncertainties which may require changing course,” a statement issued by OPEC said. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, has lost about $10 a barrel since hitting a four-year high of $86.74 on Oct. 3, on signs of ample supply even as U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at cutting the OPEC member’s oil exports loom. For now, producers are making progress in increasing production in line with the June agreement. OPEC and its partners agreed in June to lift oil supplies so that compliance with output curbs in place since January 2017 falls to 100 percent, from closer to 150 percent because of declining production in some countries.   Countries complied with 111 percent of pledged supply curbs in September, the statement said, meaning production increased from August when adherence was 129 percent. The panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, can make recommendations but does not set policy. OPEC and its allies hold their next policy meeting in December. Forecasters, including the International Energy Agency, expect slower growth in global oil demand next year and rising supplies from outside OPEC, which could further increase inventories if OPEC keeps output at the same level.    The ministerial panel asked its technical group, called the Joint Technical Committee, to “continue to study the 2019 outlook and present options on 2019 production levels to prevent re-emergence of a market imbalance.” Earlier on Thursday, top exporter Saudi Arabia said the oil market could be oversupplied in the fourth quarter of the year as stocks rise and demand slows. It said it will “mirror” such changes in its production. “We are of the view that the market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks,” Saudi OPEC governor Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters. The OPEC governor is typically one of the most senior posts in a country’s OPEC delegation after the energy minister.

2018-10-25,"* Losses for world stocks since January close to $7 trillion * MSCI ex-Japan down over 18 pct for year * Nikkei at six-month low * ECB faces tough questions on stimulus withdrawal, Italy * Yen, Swiss franc, gold all ease back as panic subsides By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - European and U.S. markets attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia gave global stocks another boot towards their worst month since the financial crisis. It was far from plain sailing. Germany’s DAX  had hit a near two-year low and London’s FTSE and Paris’s CAC 40 both brushed 1 1/2-year lows early on after Japan had plummeted overnight, but a semblance of stability was emerging. The pan-European STOXX 600 was darting in and out of positive territory, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones both climbed 0.7 and the tech heavy Nasdaq bounced 1.5 percent, having lost 8 to 9 percent this month. Currency dealers were also unwinding Swiss franc and Japanese yen safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds held their ground as Mario Draghi reiterated the European Central Bank’s plans to carefully remove its stimulus. “Uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent,” Draghi said at the ECB’s post-meeting news conference. “Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed,” he said. But there was also an important summary. “Is this (turbulence) enough to change our baseline scenario? No”, adding that he expected an agreement between Italy and Brussels on Rome’s disputed budget plans. Investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock prices, faster interest rate hikes in the United States, Italy and a Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth. Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI’s global equity index are now in bear-market territory — down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks. There has also been growing concerns about overspending by Italy’s new populist coalition. More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific shares skidded more than 2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low. The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in the black after dropping as much as 2.5 percent at one point. Fresh government support measures had failed to ease worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the United States. “If you’re a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget, there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,” said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. Europe’s stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank UBS and engineering giant ABB which helped take the edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning from the U.S. behemoth Caterpillar. Wall Street snapped its six-day losing streak as reassuring results from Microsoft and strong advertising revenues from Twitter. brought some timely cheer to tech stocks. Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon were both up more than 2.2 percent ahead of their results later too, while wider economy watchers were reassured as the number of Americans receiving benefits fell to a more than 45-year low. The ECB’s “steady as she goes” message came after weak euro zone economic data this week added to angst over world growth, and a surprising slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing. It was not just the ECB in action, either. Turkey, which has stabilised in recent weeks after having been at the centre of emerging market troubles, halted its recent rate hikes in a move that, for once, did not unsettle markets. In fact, the lira gained. The bank has almost doubled its rates already this year to 24 percent after a 40 percent slump in the Turkish currency pushed Ankara to the brink of a full-blown currency crisis. In the main foreign exchange markets, the euro recovered to $1.1410, having breached a long-standing bulwark of $1.1430. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a nine-week peak to 96.339. For the first time in days it was barely budged against the safety-first Japanese yen at 112.28 yen. Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887 , having dropped 0.8 percent overnight, and oil prices began to tick up again, having been dragged down in recent sessions by the concerns over global growth. Brent crude was last at $76.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $66.63 . Safe-haven gold was a tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce. “Expect spirited rallies,” said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil.

2018-10-25,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday the oil market could be shifting towards oversupply in the fourth quarter of the year as oil inventories rise and demand slows, and the top oil exporter will “mirror” such changes in its production. “We are of the view that the market in the fourth quarter could be shifting towards an oversupply situation as evidenced by rising inventories over the past few weeks,” Saudi OPEC governor Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters on Thursday.  “So we want to be watchful not to over-correct and cause a substantial inventory build,” Al-Aama, who heads a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee which monitors compliance and market fundamentals, said after a recent meeting of the panel, known as the JTC, in Vienna. OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers agreed in June to relax their oil cuts, but the group said on Thursday they may need to change course because of rising inventories and economic uncertainties. Asked about concerns of slowing economic growth in countries such as China, a major oil consumer, Al-Aama said: “Growth risks are a concern particularly in emerging countries ... we are aware that oil demand responds to global macroeconomic factors and will be responding with our partners proactively”. He added Saudi Arabia does not push oil to the market but responds to its customers’ needs and said the increase in the kingdom’s oil production over the past months was in response to rising demand. “Saudi Arabia produces only what its customers ask for, not more. We saw strong demand for our crudes in the third quarter and we have increased our production accordingly,” he said.  Saudi Energy Minster Khalid al-Falih said on Oct. 22 the kingdom would soon raise output to 11 million barrels per day (bpd) from the current 10.7 million. [nL8N1X20K2]  “As we - and other producers - raise production, spare capacity will tighten by the same amount,” Al-Aama said.  “However, in the case of Saudi Arabia, while the remaining spare capacity will tighten further in November, it will definitely not be tapped until there is market demand for it,” he added. He said oil demand was expected to seasonally fall towards the end of the year. “We have the flexibility to adjust our production to mirror it,” he added.

2018-10-25," (This version of the Sept. 10 story corrects description of Nick Barnes in paragraph 2, also corrects names of founders to Taylor, Eoghan Flanagan and Rory Landman in paragraph 18) By Maiya Keidan LONDON (Reuters) - British investor Martin Taylor, who closed his $1.5 billion hedge fund Nevsky Capital and retired at 46, plans to get back in the market with a fresh perspective and a new firm. In December 2015, Taylor and Nick Barnes, who he considers a co-founder of Nevsky, told investors it was not likely they could reproduce past gains and gave clients their money back. It was a rare move in the industry and it came after a volatile year in financial markets with falls in oil, commodities and emerging markets. In a colourful letter to investors, Taylor said Nevsky’s future returns would be hampered by distorted macroeconomic data, the rise of highly unpredictable nationalist governments and algorithmic funds exacerbating volatility in stocks. But, after nearly three years out, he is launching London-based global long-short equities hedge fund Crake Asset Management in October 2019 to bet on shares and trade underlying commodities. The strategy mirrors that of Nevsky. “I did retire and I did say I was never going to come back and I absolutely did mean it at the time, but obviously I’ve now changed my mind,” said Taylor, 49, who has spent the past two years teaching and trading his own money. “With hindsight, what I realised is I was exhausted. I’d been running a hedge fund manager for more than 15 years,” he told Reuters. “Now, I’ve had a two-and-a-half-year sabbatical, it’s left me refreshed and I want to do this for another 15 years.” Two investors who declined to be identified told Reuters they welcomed the move.     The rise of algorithmic trading during his break meant that by the time he returns markets may be closer to a tipping point at which it will become easier for a fund like his to make money, he said. “The increasing dominance of passive investors will eventually make underlying markets more inefficient because there will be fewer and fewer genuinely active managers in the market,” he said. At his new firm, Taylor will be joined by co-founders Yuri Maslov, a former partner at Nevsky, and Richard Walker, who has previously worked at Societe Generale, according to filings with Britain’s Companies House. Taylor will be the fund’s chief investment officer and manager while Maslov will be head of research and Walker chief operating officer and co-manager. Crake will also be adding four to five analysts over the next several months, and aims to have the team in place in April. It will begin accepting outside money from Oct. 1. 2019. “Having had 2.5 years off, I’m very keen to get back to my first love but I want to do it properly. That is why it won’t be another year until I take money from clients,” he said. “I need to build and train my team first.” Nevsky Fund Plc’s assets peaked at $3.6 billion and it returned 18.4 percent annually net of fees over 15 years. Its average peer returned 2.5 percent over the same time period, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed. Nevsky was launched in 2000 by Taylor, Eoghan Flanagan and Rory Landman, who left the business in 2005 and is now senior bursar at Trinity College, Cambridge. Taylor is a fan of West Ham United soccer club and he opposed Britain’s departure from the European Union. He donated around 745,000 pounds to Britain’s Labour party between 2012 and 2017, according to Electoral Commission data. “I’m absolutely going to remain in Britain regardless of what happens with Brexit,” he said.

2018-10-25,"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no changes to text) By Taro Fuse and Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp is considering liquidating its British  nuclear unit NuGen, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday, leaving Britain to seek alternatives for a project that was meant to provide 7 percent of the country’s electricity. The move comes as Toshiba believes talks to sell the unit have dragged on too long, the sources told Reuters. “Toshiba is eager to shut off potential risks associated with NuGen soon,” one of them said. Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are private. Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace aging coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants, especially nuclear have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices. The NuGen project in Moorside, northwest England, faced setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) was initially the preferred bidder, but lost that status in July. Toshiba then negotiated with Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc, but the talks fell through, one of the sources said. The Japanese conglomerate is still in discussions with KEPCO, but as prospects for the talks are unclear Toshiba has decided to consider liquidating NuGen, one of the sources said. When contacted by Reuters, Toshiba said in a statement it “continues to consider additional options including sale of its shares in NuGen to KEPCO.” “We are carefully monitoring the situation, in consultation with stakeholders including the UK government,” it added. A KEPCO spokesman said the company is not aware of Toshiba’s plan to liquidate NuGen. Toshiba has already written down the value of NuGen’s assets, but has been constantly injecting cash in order to keep the project running. Operations at the project have already been scaled down, and the headcount at the project was slashed last month to fewer than 40 people. A spokesman for NuGen said: “There is a limited window of time, and the wind-up of NuGen, and the Moorside Project remains a very real prospect with Toshiba indicating clearly its intention to withdraw from the project by the end of the financial year.” “Everything is being done by the teams at NuGen and Toshiba to minimise that prospect, to enable Toshiba to achieve a clean exit, and to enable NuGen and the Moorside Project to continue,” the spokesman said.

2018-10-25,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - European Union lawmakers voted on Thursday to press EU countries and the European Commission to harden their stance on environmental action ahead of United Nations climate talks in Katowice, Poland in December. The bloc’s environment ministers earlier this month agreed a common position that the EU was ready to “communicate or update” its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the target reduction of greenhouse gases by each country, by 2020.  EU lawmakers, in a non-binding resolution, called for concrete targets, recommending countries set an NDC of at least 55 percent by 2030 to help limit the Earth’s long-term temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  “It is very important because this is the position of the parliament toward Katowice,” said Bas Eickhout, a Green lawmaker who shepherded the resolution through the legislature. “It is a very important signal.” Raising the NDC would require the approval of all 28 EU nations.  Earlier this month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned the world would have to make “unprecedented” changes to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Meeting this target, rather than the two-degree goal agreed at global climate talks in Paris in 2015, would have “clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems”, the IPCC said on the release of its report. The resolution passed in parliament on Thursday also called on the EU to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The vote came two days after the EU’s auditor reported the bloc’s funding programs for the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) had failed. CCS traps, transports and buries underground carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. The EU launched two CCS programs in 2009. Only one project was completed, despite 424 million euros ($484 million) in grants.

2018-10-25,"(Repeats item published earlier with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Iran's seaborne crude exports: tmsnrt.rs/2Osb61V By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The crude oil market is still uncertain over the likely impact of the renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, but two things seem to be becoming clearer: Iran is struggling to keep buyers, and much of the crude it is shipping is being stored. While not quite a death knell for Iranian exports, news that China’s two biggest state refiners, Sinopec Group and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), have decided not to take any November-loading cargoes from Tehran is a serious blow. China is the biggest buyer of Iranian crude and largely stood with the Islamic republic during the previous round of sanctions against its exports. Sinopec and CNPC, though, are now skipping bookings for November because of uncertainty over whether they can secure U.S. waivers that allow their purchases to continue, Reuters reported on Wednesday. From Nov. 4, the United States will re-impose sanctions against Iranian crude exports as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to force Tehran to accede to a more restrictive deal on limiting its nuclear and missile programmes. While crude oil market participants don’t expect that U.S. sanctions will shut down Iran’s exports completely, there is still debate over how much oil is likely to be lost, and for how long the situation will persist. What China does is key in this regard, given that it imported about 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude in the first nine months of the year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. Iran’s crude exports have been in the region of about 2 million bpd in recent months, and it appears to be on track to record shipments around that level in October. Iranian tankers are routinely turning off their tracking transponders, presumably to disguise their destinations, making it challenging to monitor the true state of the nation’s exports. Even taking that into account, it’s worth noting that of the nine cargoes shown as arriving at their destinations in November, six are heading to China, one each to India and Greece, and one to an as yet undetermined Asian port. There are also questions over what exactly is happening to the Iranian crude arriving in China. Much of the crude is heading to the northern port of Dalian, where it is likely to end up in bonded storage. That would mean it would be in China, but wouldn’t have cleared customs, and therefore unavailable to domestic refiners. This raises the possibility that some of Iran’s crude exports are in or are headed into storage tanks and are effectively lost to the market. This leads to a couple of points to consider, firstly that the market is adjusting quite well already to the loss of Iranian barrels, and secondly that the oil in storage at some point will come to market, which may depress demand from other suppliers when this happens. Iran’s other key customer is India, which took about 568,000 bpd in the first nine months of the year, according to the Refinitiv vessel-tracking data. This has yet to decline, with October on track for about 558,000 bpd, but there are indications this may be the high-water mark for a while. Reliance Industries, which owns the world’s largest refining complex, said on Oct. 17 that it has halted imports of Iranian crude and would buy from other Middle Eastern producers and the United States instead. Other Indian refiners are still aiming to secure U.S. waivers for Iranian imports, but questions over insurance coverage may also force them to limit those shipments. Overall, it appears both China and India are cutting back on buying crude from Iran, but by how much and for how long still has to be determined. It also appears that much of Iran’s crude is headed into storage and not really available to the market. While this will put pressure on Iranian government revenues, it raises the possibility, too, of a crude glut once the  U.S. sanctions are finally eased.

2018-10-25,"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Injury rates have more than doubled at five West Virginia coal mines acquired by Murray Energy Corp. in 2013, according to a Reuters review of federal data, as the firm sharply increased the amount of coal produced per manhour. Although injuries and productivity rates rose over the same period, the causes of the increase in injuries remain unknown and could include a host of factors in the complex business of underground coal mining. Murray - the nation’s largest underground coal mining company with about 6,000 employees producing more than 60 million tonnes of coal annually - bought the mines from rival CONSOL Energy. Those mines now account for more than half the firm’s production. The injury rate at the five mines averaged 6.35 per 200,000 work hours last year, up from 2.79 in 2013, the last year CONSOL operated them, according to data from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration. That’s the highest injury rate for the group in a decade and 70 percent above the national average for underground mines, the data show. At the same time, coal output per manhour at the five mines rose nearly 50 percent since 2013 to 5.7 tons in 2017, according to MSHA figures. By comparison, the industry average in 2015 - the last year for which industry-wide data is available - was 3.4 tons per manhour. Murray spokesman Cody Nett said that productivity has no correlation to injury rates. Strategies that Murray has used to increase output at the mines - such as continuing production through the overnight maintenance shift and keeping machinery and vehicles running during shift changes - are “standard practices widely utilized throughout the industry,” Nett said. Nett said the injury rate at the former CONSOL mines was inflated by false claims from workers who took time off for other reasons. He also attributed the doubling of injury rates since Murray acquired the mines to under-reporting by the previous owner during the preceding years - an assertion disputed by the Department of Labor and its Mines Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), which collects the data. Regulators did cite CONSOL for under-reporting in a 2013 audit. But MSHA later revised the company’s data to include injuries that CONSOL initially failed to properly report, said MSHA spokeswoman Amy Louviere. Asked about the agency’s adjustments, Nett said it was “flat out incorrect” that the mine safety agency had corrected CONSOL’s data. CONSOL spokesman Zach Smith declined to comment on the company’s 2013 reporting violations. The injury rate at the five mines translated to about 200 injuries requiring days off work in 2017. Workers at the five sites have suffered 159 injuries so far in 2018, according to the MSHA data. Murray controls six other mines - in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, and Utah - and each has an injury rate below the national average, according to the data. The company has won numerous safety awards in recent years, including from the U.S. government’s National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in 2015. Davitt McAteer, a mine safety expert in West Virginia who had directed MSHA under former President Bill Clinton, said that many factors could have played into the increased injury rates at the Murray mines in West Virginia. “Those particular mines are decades old, meaning miners are having to work deeper, more complicated coal seams, with aging equipment and infrastructure,” he said, adding that such conditions are more dangerous for workers. The company’s CEO, Robert Murray, is among the coal sector’s most vocal advocates for rollbacks of environmental and safety oversight, frequently arguing that government regulation is unnecessarily onerous and costly for companies. Murray Energy has also sued the government to invalidate an Obama-era rule called the Pattern of Violations rule, intended to beef up enforcement of safety standards against repeat offenders. That case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, is now in settlement negotiations with the Trump administration.

2018-10-25,"(Adds details, compares with estimates) Oct 25 (Reuters) - Independent U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp’s quarterly profit beat Wall Street estimates on Thursday due to lower expenses and as it processed more crude. The San Antonio, Texas-based company said refinery throughput capacity utilization was 99 percent, with volumes averaging 3.1 million barrels per day in the quarter while administrative expenses fell 7 percent to $209 million. Refiners have been benefiting from a discount on crude prices in Midland Texas, which reached a near five-week high in August, as production surged in the U.S. and pipelines operated at full capacity due to transportation bottlenecks.

2018-10-25,"(Reuters) - Shell (RDSa.L) African licensee Vivo Energy (VVO.L) reported a slight fall in third-quarter gross cash profit on Thursday, hit by a slowdown in retail volume which it blamed on short-term supply disruptions in Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast. The company, which distributes and markets Shell-branded fuels and lubricants across 15 African markets, said gross cash profit fell to $167 million (130 million pounds)in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $171 million a year earlier. It gave no detail on the nature of the supply disruptions, saying only that they were largely resolved.  Vivo, which listed in London in May, said total retail volumes grew just 1 percent in the quarter. Overall Q3 volumes grew to 2,323 million litres, up 2 percent from the last year.  It said it expected growth of 4 percent for the full year. Created in 2011 by a partnership between energy trader Vitol Group and UK-based private equity firm Helios Investment, Vivo has been looking to expand and develop its network of 1,800 filling stations.

2018-10-25,"SINGAPORE, Oct 25 (Reuters) - A crude oil tanker owned by Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot has completed its first voyage across the Baltic and North Seas operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), the company said on Wednesday. The Aframax tanker Gagarin Prospect delivered a cargo of 104,815 tonnes of crude oil from Primorsk to Rotterdam, the company said in a statement. The vessel carried the first export cargo of Russian crude under a long-term time-charter contract between Sovcomflot and Royal Dutch Shell. Sovcomflot added that the ship is the world’s first Aframax crude oil tanker designed to operate on LNG as its primary fuel. “Switching to cleaner-burning LNG fuel allows Sovcomflot to significantly reduce its impact on the natural environment,” the company said. “This is particularly important for ships in high-traffic areas such as the Baltic and North Seas where these ‘Green Funnel’ tankers will primarily operate.” Sovcomflot is gradually switching its conventional tanker fleet from traditional heavy fuel oil to LNG ahead of the 2020 introduction of new rules on marine fuels that will limit the sulphur content. There is already a sulphur emission control area for the Baltic Sea that went into effect in 2005. The company expects to have six such LNG-fuelled Aframax tankers in operation by the beginning of second quarter of next year. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Christian

2018-10-25,"(Adds executive comments, analyst, details) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Equinor will reduce its capital expenditure as a result of significant cost cuts in recent years, the company said on Thursday as it reported a slightly smaller than expected increase in third-quarter profit. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose to $4.8 billion in the quarter, a four-year high, from $2.35 billion during the same quarter in 2017, and compared with $4.9 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. “As a result of capital discipline and efficient project execution, we are able to reduce our organic capex guiding for 2018 to around $10 billion,” the Norwegian oil and gas firm, previously known as Statoil, said in a statement. The previous guidance had been for capex of $11 billion for the year. Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Sparebank 1 Markets said he expected consensus for 2018 free cash flow estimates to increase to around $8 billion from about $7.4 billion due to updated capex guidance, with the market focused on a potential dividend rise in future quarters. Equinor’s Chief Financial Officer Lars Christian Bacher, however, told Reuters the company continued to prioritise reduction of its net debt ratio and assets acquisition, with no immediate plans to increase dividends or launch share buybacks. The company maintained its guidance for exploration spending in 2018 at $1.5 billion and annual production growth at 1-2 percent, and has decided to keep a dividend of $0.23 per share as expected. Equinor’s total equity production stood at 2.1 million barrels of oil per day (boed) in the third quarter, a one-percent increase from a year ago. Its international production hit another record high of 0.831 million boed in the quarter, accounting for 40 percent of its total output. The increase was primarily driven by new fields in Brazil and offshore North America, and new onshore wells in the United States, the company added. Equinor’s Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said he expected U.S. production to keep growing. “The U.S. is a strong position and we will continue to work on the opportunities in the U.S Gulf of Mexico,” Saetre told Reuters when asked whether company could divest its non-operated U.S. offshore assets. Saetre also said the company was on track to start its giant Johan Sverdrup field off Norway in November 2019. However, Equinor said the startup of its Mariner oilfield off Britain would be delayed until the first half of 2019 from end-2018 due to bad weather preventing the project’s completion. Equinor shares traded 0.75 percent higher by 0940 GMT, while the overall European oil and gas index was broadly flat.

It wasn’t a sunny picture by any means. Germany’s Dax hit a near two-year low and London’s FTSE and Paris’ CAC 40 both brushed 1-1/2 year lows early on, but a semblance of stability was emerging. The pan-European STOXX 600 was almost back at level pegging having opened down almost 1 percent and after Japan’s Nikkei had slumped 3.5 percent overnight. Currency dealers were also cautiously reversing out of Swiss franc and Japanese yen safety trades and Italian and Spanish bonds made ground as traders waited to see what message the European Central Bank delivers at its meeting later. “The markets have been acting like classic flight-to-safety markets,” said London & Capital’s head of fixed income Sanjay Joshi, pointing to the slump in stocks and rally in safer bonds and currencies. “The worst thing the ECB could do would be to come out with a hawkish statement considering the situation we have at the moment.” Most economists expect ECB President Mario Draghi to say the bank will stick to plans to end stimulus this year. But it will be the signal he sends about market volatility and concerns around Italy, his homeland, that could be most crucial. Heavyweight investors have become increasingly nervous about lofty stock prices, faster rate hikes in the United States and an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war that threatens to hurt world growth. Almost 60 percent of the 2,767 stocks in MSCI’s global equity index are now in so-called ‘bear market’ territory — down 20 percent or more from their most recent peaks. More woes in Asia overnight had seen the global wipeout on the MSCI World since January near $7 trillion. Pan Asia-Pacific shares skidded more than 2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei tumbled as much as 4 percent to a six-month low. The one relief was that Chinese shares managed to close in the black having dropped as much as 2.5 percent at one point , as fresh government support measures failed to ease worries about high leverage and the tariff war with the U.S. “If you’re a company and you’re in charge of a capex budget there is so much uncertainty about the next few years in terms of a trade war, in terms of Brexit,” said Jim McCafferty, head of Equity Research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. Europe’s stabilisation was aided by results from Swiss bank UBS and engineering giant ABB which helped take the edge off jitters caused this week by a gloomy tariffs warning from U.S. digger behemoth Caterpillar. The ECB was looming too. Weak euro zone economic data this week have added to angst over world growth, as has a surprise slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing. It wasn’t just the ECB that was being closely watched either. Turkey, which has been stabilising in recent weeks having been at the centre of emerging market troubles was also holding a central bank meeting. The consensus is that having almost doubled its interest rates already this year to 24 percent, it might be brave enough to hold still this month. In foreign exchange markets, the euro clawed its way back up to $1.14, having breached a long standing bulwark of $1.1430. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a nine-week peak to 96.296 and for the first time in days it was barely budged against the safety first Japanese yen at 112.25 yen. Sterling also inched off a seven-week trough to $1.2887 , having dropped 0.8 percent overnight and oil prices began to gain having been dragged down by the concerns over global growth. Brent crude was last at $76 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $66.63 . Gold was a tad weaker at $1,236.76 an ounce. “Expect spirited rallies,” said Robin Bieber, technical analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and

Wohlrabe said it would be difficult for Germany to meet a growth forecast of 0.6 percent for the fourth quarter which the institute had given in its autumn report but the institute was sticking to a full year growth forecast of 1.7 percent. He said exports expectations fell significantly in October which hurt the German business climate. “The golden autumn for the German economy is not materialising,” Wohlrabe said, adding that pessimism was spreading in the auto industry where business expectations fell significantly, burdened by the WLTP emissions tests.

2018-10-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Two more Chinese workers trapped in a coal mine have died, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday, taking the death toll from the accident to five with 16 workers still missing. The bodies of the two workers trapped in the mine in the eastern province of Shandong since Saturday were found early on Thursday, Xinhua reported, citing the rescue operations.     A rock burst destroyed part of a water drainage tunnel in the mine, owned by Shandong Energy Group Co Ltd, initially killing two and trapping 20 workers.  The progress of rescue teams has been slow due to difficulty in clearing debris to get to the trapped workers. Two workers were rescued on Sunday, but state media said one of them later died.  Provincial authorities on Monday ordered 41 coal mines to halt production for security checks, though the cause of the accident remains unclear. The state television reported a gas explosion in a coal mine in the southwestern province of Sichuan on Thursday killed four workers and injured two. China’s thousands of coal mines are notorious for poor safety and the latest incidents raise fresh questions about whether producers have followed strict rules on exploration as they ramp up output.

2018-10-25,"* Q1 revenue surges 6.3 pct to A$4.4 bln * Value of forward bookings up 8 pct year on year * Annual fuel bill forecast to rise 27 pct (Recasts with details on fuel bill and capacity) By Jamie Freed Oct 25 (Reuters) - Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd on Thursday reported record revenue for a first quarter, as higher airfares and its strategy of keeping a lid on capacity helped offset a climb in oil prices. The results put the country’s flagship carrier on track to deliver relatively strong annual earnings despite headwinds from oil prices that have buffeted Asian rivals which are continuing to add more flights. Revenue increased 6.3 percent to A$4.4 billion ($3.1 billion) and the value of forward bookings grew 8 percent from the same period a year earlier. “Our record passenger revenue performance for the first quarter meant that we were able to substantially recover higher fuel prices,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement. “Market demand for travel remains fundamentally strong and we’re seeing some wind-back of competitor capacity growth.” Qantas, while hedged on 76 percent of its fuel for the year ending June 30, lifted its expected fuel bill on higher oil prices and a weaker Australian dollar. It predicts a 27 percent rise to A$4.09 billion, compared with an earlier estimate of a 21 percent increase. The airline, which controls nearly two-thirds of the country’s domestic capacity, trimmed its first-half capacity forecasts. It now expects domestic capacity to be flat to down 1 percent and international capacity to be flat. By contrast, airlines globally grew capacity by 5.5 percent in the month of August, including a 7.3 percent rise in the Asia Pacific region, according to the International Air Transport Association. Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd has also benefited from reining in capacity. On Monday it forecast it would report a first-half underlying profit before tax of at least A$100 million after revenue rose 9.7 percent in the first quarter. Qantas did not provide an earnings estimate for the first half. The airline said the majority of a forecast A$400 million in benefits from a transformation programme designed to cut costs and boost revenue would materialise in the second half. A consensus estimate from nine analysts put its annual underlying pretax profit at A$1.42 billion, an 11 percent decline from the year earlier, according to Refinitiv data. Qantas shares, which had rallied on Virgin Australia’s results this week, were trading 4.5 percent lower on Thursday, while the broader Australian market was down 2.1 percent.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan skidded about 2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei tumbled 3.5 percent to a six-month trough while Australian shares hit a more than one-year low. Tokyo’s Topix index tumbled 3 percent, evaporating more than $155 billion in market value. Chinese shares opened in the red too with the blue-chip SSE Composite index plummeting 2.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 2.2 percent. The dive in formerly high-flying U.S. tech stocks sent investors scampering to the safety of sovereign bonds, with yields in 10-year Treasuries falling the most since May to 3.11 percent. “Weak U.S. housing data, mixed corporate earnings results, trade war fears and concerns regarding a slowing global economy all contributed to the sell off,” Sydney-based Rivkin Securities said in a note to clients. “Investor sentiment remains cautious as we anticipate the reports of over 100 S&P 500 companies including Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast.” Weak readings on manufacturing in Europe added to angst over world growth, as did a surprise slump in U.S. home sales, which suggested rising mortgage rates were sapping demand for housing. Adding to the air of tension, police intercepted suspected bombs mailed to former U.S. President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other high-profile Democrats, as well as to CNN, in what New York officials branded an act of terrorism. The growing international pressure on Saudi Arabia over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi also weighed on investor sentiment. On Wall Street, disappointing forecasts from chipmakers hammered the tech sector. They followed weaker-than-expected forecasts on Tuesday from industrial giants Caterpillar and 3M. The Nasdaq closed down 12.4 percent from its Aug. 29 record closing high, falling 4.4 percent for the day in its biggest one-day percentage decline since Aug. 18, 2011. In dollar terms, the Nasdaq vaporised $524 billion in market capitalisation overnight. The Dow <.DJI > fell 2.41 percent and the S&P 500 lost 3.09 percent. According to data analysed by Reuters, the proportion of stocks, regions and sectors that are technically in a bear market has shot up since the start of January, prompting some analysts to conclude the bull run may already be over. Citi has lowered its global growth forecast for both 2019 and 2020 by 0.1 percentage point each to 3.2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, it said in a note Thursday, citing policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve. “Over the next year, bouts of financial market turbulence are likely to worsen,” Citi economist Catherine Mann said, “as gaps between market expectations of policy rate hikes and the median dot plot close.” In foreign exchange markets, client participation on both spot and options was fairly light, Citi noted in a separate note. Funds flowed to the U.S. dollar and Treasuries and out of the euro and the British pound. The euro shed 0.7 percent to $1.1397 and breached a major chart bulwark at $1.1430. It was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1407. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased from near a nine-week peak to 96.267. Sterling hit a seven-week trough $1.2865, having dropped 0.8 percent overnight. It was last a shade higher at $1.2892. The yen got the usual safe-haven bid, with the euro skidding to a two-month low at 127.68 yen. Even the high-flying dollar eased to 112 yen. Oil prices slipped amid concerns over global growth. Brent crude fell 69 cents to $75.48 a barrel, while U.S. crude dropped 54 cents to $66.28. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,236.52 an ounce.

Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $75.42 a barrel at 0043 GMT, 75 cents, or 1 percent, below their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.23 a barrel, 59 cents, or 0.9 percent, below their last settlement. “Oil prices fell under extreme selling pressure ... as the steep selloff across stock markets fuelled fears over a possible drop in oil demand growth,” said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM. Markets have been hit hard this month by a range of worries, including the Sino-U.S. trade war, a rout in emerging market currencies, rising borrowing costs and bond yields, as well as economic concerns in Italy. In oil, WTI has fallen nearly 10 percent so far this month, while Brent is down nearly 9 percent. Still, oil markets remain nervous ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports, which kick in from Nov. 4. Bowing to pressure from Washington, China’s oil-majors Sinopec and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) have not ordered any oil from Iran for November because of concerns that violating sanctions could impact their global operations. China is Iran’s biggest oil customer. Halting oil Iranian imports means its many refiners will have to seek alternative supplies elsewhere. Some relief could come from the United States, where crude production and storage levels are high. U.S. commercial crude oil stockpiles C-STK-T-EIA rose for a fifth consecutive week last week, increasing by 6.3 million barrels to 422.79 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Output C-OUT-T-EIA remained unchanged at 10.9 million barrels per day (bpd), slightly below a record 11.2 million bpd reached at the start of October.

2018-10-25,"(Adds details about current chairman stepping down, background) WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday President Donald Trump has appointed Neil Chatterjee, an avid supporter of subsidizing aging coal and nuclear power plants, as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Chatterjee, a Republican from coal-producing Kentucky, who was a FERC commissioner, had been a backer last year of a directive by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, that the commission ultimately rejected, to bail out coal and nuclear plants. FERC, an independent office of the Department of Energy, makes decisions on electricity transmission and interstate natural gas pipelines and facilities. Chatterjee served as FERC’s acting head for several months last year before Kevin McIntyre was sworn in as the chairman of the agency in December. McIntyre, who underwent surgery last year for brain cancer, will step down to become a commissioner on the five-member panel, he said in a letter posted on FERC’s website on Wednesday. McIntyre, also a Republican, sat out FERC’s monthly open meeting last week and the previous one in September. “I very recently experienced a more serious health setback, leaving me currently unable to perform the duties of Chairman with the level of focus that the position demands,” McIntyre said in the letter. Perry had issued FERC a directive in 2017 to bail out aging nuclear and coal plants that are suffering competition from plants that burn abundant and cheap natural gas. FERC rejected the plan in January. But in coming months it could consider similar plans by the administration to support the plants for national security reasons. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump nominated the Republican Bernard McNamee, another prominent supporter of subsidizing aging coal and nuclear plants, to a vacant seat on the panel. Critics said if the Senate approves McNamee it could make FERC more politicized because he helped roll out Perry’s bailout plan while head of the Energy Department’s policy office.

The State Power Investment Corp (SPIC) said in a notice posted on its website that the first unit of the Haiyang nuclear reactor project in Shandong province completed a 168-hour full-load test late on Monday evening. The reactor unit began construction in 2009 and was finally connected to the grid in August. China gave the go-ahead to build four Westinghouse-designed AP1000 reactors in 2007. The first unit at Sanmen in Zhejiang province was originally scheduled to go into full operation in 2014, but the unproven “third-generation” technology has been beset by years of delays as a result of safety concerns and unanticipated design problems. Unit 1 at Sanmen was finally declared ready to go into full commercial operation last month, making it the world’s first AP1000 reactor to be completed. Westinghouse, which was acquired by Brookfield Business Partners from Japan’s Toshiba in August, hoped China would serve as a shop window for its AP1000 design, which boasts enhanced “passive” safety features as well as higher levels of generation capacity. Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy last year after its nuclear projects in the United States were also hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns. China also hoped that AP1000 technology would be at the centre of its own ambitious nuclear power plans after signing a technology transfer agreement in 2006. But after a root-and-branch industrial safety review in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011, China’s nuclear programme has slowed considerably, and it is now unlikely to meet its 2020 capacity targets.

2018-10-25,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - New York’s attorney general sued Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Wednesday, alleging that the world’s largest oil company for years misled investors about the risks of climate change regulations on its business. The suit, filed in New York Supreme Court, New York County, seeks undisclosed damages, a court order for a review of the company’s representations, and that the company corrects “numerous misrepresentations” to investors.  It alleges Exxon assured investors it had properly evaluated the impact of climate regulations on its business using a “proxy cost” for the likely effects of future events on its business. However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, the suit claims.  The company also failed to properly account for such costs in determining its volume of oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets, a metric important to investors, the suit claims.  “The company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,” Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.”  Exxon “looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement.   He further described the suit as the “product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general’s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.” The suit was brought under the Martin Act, a civil statute that has been used by New York prosecutors to pursue fraud claims against investment and other financial companies.  “In bringing this case, the state is yet again using the Martin Act as a political weapon,” said Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, calling the case “nothing more than a contortion of the securities litigation system.”  Exxon unsuccessfully fought to halt the New York investigation and a similar probe by the state of Massachusetts that claims Exxon misled consumers with its statements on climate change.  “This is a very significant lawsuit,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The New York state attorney general has gotten a lot of documents and we should assume they filed the suit based on the information received during that process.”   Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.

2018-10-25,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s new Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi was sworn in on Wednesday with only a partial Cabinet after lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on key postings including interior and defence. A rowdy parliament session to approve Abdul Mahdi’s government list created more uncertainty for Iraq, months after an inconclusive election, with parties and blocs wrangling over appointments. The new premier faces the daunting task of rebuilding much of the country after a devastating war against Islamic State, as well as solving acute economic problems and power and water shortages. Eight ministries have yet to be decided, ahead of a Nov. 2 deadline. Among the 14 ministers who were sworn in, Thamer Ghadhban became Oil Minister and veteran Kurdish politician Fuad Hussein Finance Minister. Ghadhban replaced Jabar al-Luaibi, who was recently made head of the new National Oil Company. Ghadhban helped resuscitate a flagging oil industry after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. He was interim oil minister from 2004-5 and a former energy advisor to outgoing premier Haider al-Abadi. Abdul Mahdi was initially expected to nominate a full 22-member cabinet, including the defence and interior ministers.  But lawmakers from Moqtada al-Sadr’s bloc Saeroon, Abadi’s Nasr Alliance, Vice President Ayad Allawi’s Wataniya, and Sunni Muslim blocs left the room before voting on the remaining eight posts could take place. “We decided to withdraw from the session, because we are not satisfied with the rest of the cabinet candidates,” said Nasr lawmaker Ali Sined. “It’s enough to approve 14 ministers.” Parliament will reconvene on Nov. 6 to vote on the remaining ministers, Speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said.  The unruly parliamentary session underscored the difficulties faced by Abdul Mahdi as he seeks consensus over his cabinet.  A May general election saw Saeroon come first after campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. After uncertainty over the results, lawmakers eventually voted in President Barham Salih, the first time in modern Iraqi politics they picked a president, premier or parliament speaker without a backroom deal. On Wednesday, however, some lawmakers accused proposed ministers of being former Saddam stalwarts, or corrupt. The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent sacking of all of Saddam’s Baath party officials stoked sectarian tensions, which then exploded into civil war. Under a de facto power sharing agreement, Iraq’s presidency is now traditionally held by a Kurd, the premiership by a Shi’ite and the parliament speaker is a Sunni. Earlier in the day, a Sunni Arab parliamentary bloc pulled out of talks on forming the government.

2018-10-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car output fell by 16.8 percent last month, hit by new emissions regulations, model changes, trade tensions and uncertainty over diesel policy and Brexit, an industry body said on Thursday.  Production stood at 127,051 units following a 19 percent drop in domestic demand and a 16.2 percent slump in exports, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. Stricter emissions rules known as the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) became mandatory on Sept. 1, forcing certain carmakers across Europe to halt deliveries of some models that had yet to be re-certified.  Britain’s car industry is also worried that when the country leaves the European Union next year customs checks and tariffs could be imposed if London and Brussels fail to strike a Brexit deal, adding more costs and red tape.  “It has been a turbulent year and the industry needs stability, something which appears elusive given the lack of resolution to Brexit negotiations,” said SMMT CEO Mike Hawes. The sector has also suffered due to nosediving demand for diesel and was angered by a British government announcement ahead of next week’s budget statement that subsidies offered to those buying plug-in hybrid vehicles will be cut.  “The ... budget next week is the perfect opportunity to stimulate the market, sending consumers and businesses the right signals to encourage the purchase of new cars, which would help bolster economic performance as well as delivering environmental goals,” said Hawes.
