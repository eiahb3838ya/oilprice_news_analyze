2018-08-05,"(Corrects spelling of central bank governor’s name in paragraphs 8, 9) * U.S. sanctions likely to return this week * Rial halved in value since Trump shunned nuclear deal * Ban on unofficial forex rate trade to be eased * Iranians to be encouraged to open dollar accounts * Former central bank deputy governor arrested By Parisa Hafezi ANKARA, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday, in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency that has lost half its value since April due to fears about U.S. sanctions likely to be imposed this week. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an agreement to lift sanctions in return for Iran limiting its nuclear programme caused a run on the rial as companies and savers bought hard currency to protect themselves from the economic sanctions that could be imposed from Monday. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The central bank has blamed “enemies” for the fall of the currency, and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. On Sunday the judiciary said it had arrested a further seven people, including a former deputy central bank governor and five foreign exchange dealers. A state body led by President Hassan Rouhani and including the heads of the judiciary and parliament on Sunday partially lifted a ban on the sale of foreign currency at floating rates, allowing exchange bureaux to sell at unofficial market rates for purposes such as overseas travel. That reverses the decision in April to ban trading currency outside the rate of about 42,000 rials to the dollar Ahead of the announcement of the new measures, the rial gained slightly on the unofficial market, trading at 98,500 to the dollar, compared with 103,000 on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Boncast.com. Central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the plan reflected Iran’s self-confidence in the face of the looming U.S. sanctions. “This shows our power. The same day you (Americans) impose sanctions we open our economy. We have no problems, so why should our people worry?,” Hemmati said in a live televised interview. To encourage Iranians to return their hard cash to the economy, the plan allows the central bank to set up dollar savings accounts for ordinary people, state television said. Non-oil exporters will be allowed to sell hard currency to importers, and there will be no limit on bringing currency or gold into the country. Hard currency will be made available at a subsidised rate for purchases of basic goods and medicine, state television quoted a government statement about the plan as saying. In July, Iran opened a secondary foreign-exchange market for importers of non-essential goods that are not eligible to receive the preferential rate from the central bank. Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. The United States has told third countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures.

Investors are increasingly using their financial muscle to reward those at the forefront of that transition. Swiss Re (SRENH.S), world number two by share value, said in July it would not reinsure any company for which thermal coal represents more than 30 percent of its business, following French peer Scor (SCOR.PA).

2018-08-05,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed on Sunday it had held war games in the Gulf over the past several days, saying they were aimed at “confronting possible threats” by enemies, the state news state news agency IRNA reported. U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday that the United States believed Iran had started carrying out naval exercises in the Gulf, apparently moving up the timing of annual drills amid heightened tensions with Washington. “This exercise was conducted with the aim of controlling and safeguarding the safety of the international waterway and within the framework of the programme of the Guards’ annual military exercises,” Guards spokesman Ramezan Sharif said, according to IRNA. The U.S. military’s Central Command on Wednesday confirmed it has seen increased Iranian naval activity. The activity extended to the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic waterway for oil shipments the Revolutionary Guards have threatened to block. Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari “expressed satisfaction over the successful conduct of the Guards naval exercise, emphasising the need to maintain and enhance defence readiness and the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz and to confront threats and potential adventurous acts of enemies,” IRNA quoted Sharif as saying. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said possibly more than 100 vessels were involved in the drills, including small boats. U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the drills appeared designed to send a message to Washington, which is intensifying its economic and diplomatic pressure on Tehran but so far stopping short of using the U.S. military to more aggressively counter Iran and its proxies. Iran has been furious over U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme and re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Senior Iranian officials have warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed U.S. campaign to strangle Iran’s vital oil exports. But Iran did not appear interested in drawing attention to the drills. Iranian authorities had not commented on them earlier and several officials contacted by Reuters this week had declined to comment. Last month, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei backed President Hassan Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran may block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped. Rouhani’s apparent threat earlier in July to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries came in reaction to the looming U.S. sanctions and efforts by Washington to force all countries to stop buying Iranian oil.

2018-08-05,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s eastern Shandong province has unveiled new targets to cut steel and coal production capacity, eliminate outdated aluminum smelters and change to cleaner energy as part of a broader nationwide anti-pollution push. In a three-year action plan released on Friday, Shandong’s Environmental Protection Bureau said it would cut pig iron production capacity by 600,000 tonnes and crude steel by 3.55 million tonnes by the end of this year.  Coal production capacity would be cut from 156 million tonnes to 140 million tonnes by 2020, it said. The bureau said more than 70 percent of heating provided in the winter months to rural areas would be derived from clean energy sources by 2020. As part of efforts to transition away from coal in energy production, the bureau said it would increase imports of natural gas from other provinces and liquefied natural gas (LNG), boosting the provision of natural gas to 15.8 billion cubic meters by 2020. It said it would target the proportion of LNG consumption to reach around 8 percent by 2020. Transportation of coal from the provincial ports of Qingdao, Yantai and Rizhao would be switched to rail or waterways by the end of this year, while iron ore, coke and other heavy commodities would be mainly transported via rail before the summer of 2020. The bureau also said it would accelerate plans for major aluminum smelters including Shandong Weiqiao, a unit of China Hongqiao Group, the world’s top producer of the metal, and Xinfa Group to complete the construction of its exclusive use railway lines for their freight. The plan also targets a reduction in the use of fertilisers by 6 percent and pesticides by 10 percent by 2020 compared to 2015 levels. Shandong’s environmental action plan comes after China’s State Council last month announced a three-year plan to cut coal consumption, boost electric vehicle sales and further shut outdated steel and coke capacity. China is in the fifth year of a “war on pollution” aimed at reversing the damage done to the country’s environment since the economy opened up in 1978, with President Xi Jinping promising to use the full might of the Chinese Communist Party to meet the country’s goals.
