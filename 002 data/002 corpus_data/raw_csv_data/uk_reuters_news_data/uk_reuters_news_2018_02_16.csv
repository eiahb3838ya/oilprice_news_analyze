2018-02-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose and stocks around the globe rallied for a sixth straight session on Friday to post their best week in more than two years, but a U.S. indictment over alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election cooled gains on Wall Street. The 37-page indictment of a Russian internet agency filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller described a conspiracy with the aim of supporting Donald Trump and sowing discord in the U.S. political system. Wall Street turned south on news of the indictment but soon rebounded as the fundamental story has not changed, said Ben Phillips, chief investment officer of EventShares, referring to a strong corporate earnings outlook and robust economy. Analysts continue to underestimate the pace of global growth, which has led more companies to meet or beat analysts’ earnings expectations than in any quarter in 20 years, according to calculations earlier this week by Credit Suisse. Fourth-quarter results for European companies in the STOXX 600 index  are expected to increase 14.6 percent from a year ago, while the blended earnings growth estimate for the S&P 500 is 15 percent, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data show. Since a market rout was sparked two weeks ago on fears of rising inflation and its impact on interest rates, a tug of war has ensued between investors seeking safety in bonds or betting a nine-year bull market in stocks is still alive. Investors also are concerned about how the Federal Reserve will deal with still-low inflation without killing an economy and inflate asset bubbles, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “That’s a very difficult spot. The market recognises that challenge and is wondering how the Fed will address it,” he said. But investors are getting comfortable with the idea that growth is sufficient enough to withstand the expected rate increases the Fed has projected this year as well as signs of rising inflation, Arone said. MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.26 percent to gain 4.3 percent for the week, the best weekly performance since December 2011.  Stocks were poised for their best week in six years until news of the special counsel indictment pared some gains. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares rose 1.11 percent to 1,491.71. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed up 19.01 points, or 0.08 percent, to 25,219.38. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.02 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,732.22 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 16.97 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,239.47. Investors are trying to determine whether the market is in an overdue correction or the beginning of something worse, Arone said.  “It looks like this week they’re comfortable about uncertainty and the risks that are associated with it, and stocks are moving higher based on fundamentals,” he said. U.S. Treasury prices rose as investors bought back bonds after a sell-off earlier in the week as investor jitters over rising inflation raised the possibility the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates at a faster pace than expected this year. Borrowing costs across the euro area fell, though the prospect of higher inflation and a move toward tighter monetary policy from major central banks weighed on sentiment across world bond markets. Short-dated bond yields in Germany DE2YT=RR, the euro zone’s benchmark bond issuer, have risen by about 7 basis points this week and are set for their biggest weekly rise in eight weeks.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose 6/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8713 percent. The dollar rose on the day but remained on track to post its biggest weekly loss in nine months as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback had from higher Treasury yields. The dollar index .DXY, tracking a basket of major currencies, rose 0.58 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.81 percent to $1.2404. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.18 percent versus the greenback at 106.33 per dollar.

2018-02-16,"WASHINGTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday said it would offer the largest oil and gas offshore auction in U.S. history on March 21 for areas in federal waters off the Gulf Coast, less than a year after a similar sale yielded little corporate interest. The Interior Department said it would offer 77.3 million acres (31.3 mln hectares) offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for oil and gas development, an auction that includes all available unleased areas in the Gulf of Mexico. The blocks are from 3 to 231 miles (5 to 372 km) offshore and in waters 9 to 11,115 feet (3 to 3,390 meters) deep. The department announced the auction in October, without an exact date. The sale is in support of President Donald Trump’s so-called America First Offshore Energy Strategy, which aims to reduce energy imports and boost jobs in the industry. But offshore drilling is expensive in a time of relatively low oil prices held in check partially by plentiful supplies of onshore petroleum, which is cheaper to produce. A lease sale in August last year got a tepid response from oil companies. The offer of 73 million acres received $121.14 million in high bids for 90 tracts covering 508,096 acres (205,619 hectares). Bureau of Ocean Energy Management spokesman John Filostrat has said that Interior hopes for “a healthy number of bids, more so than we did in August.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner

2018-02-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s foreign minister will travel to Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia in March, a Mexican official said on Thursday,  as part of efforts to erode Venezuela’s oil-based influence in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Cuban diplomats will visit Mexico in March to discuss the regional impact of the crisis in Venezuela, the official said. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City said the trip was not yet confirmed but that the two countries have regular bilateral meetings. Still, there are no signs that Cuba, a steadfast ally of Caracas, is ready to turn its back on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.   Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray’s planned trip follows a visit to Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this month by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against Venezuela could be mitigated in the Caribbean.   The Mexican foreign minister’s trip represents the latest development in U.S.-led pressure on Maduro, who retains loyalty from some Caribbean nations that have long benefited from Caracas’ oil largess and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts.  “The message is: Venezuela is not the only country that can help (Caribbean nations), that if there’s a crisis in Venezuela, they have more friends,” said the Mexican official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the as-yet undisclosed trip. In a statement, Mexico’s foreign ministry said Videgaray was planning trips to the Caribbean. “The foreign ministry is eager for those trips to be arranged, and so possible dates are being sought,” it said, adding that several Caribbean countries had invited the minister for work visits since last year. The foreign ministries of Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia could not be reached for comment.   Videgaray has led Mexico’s efforts to try and improve cooperation with its top trade partner on security, immigration, and foreign policy, hoping to convince the United States to take a softer stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that underpins the majority of Mexican exports. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to quit the pact if it cannot be improved to benefit U.S. workers. On his way to Jamaica, Tillerson said the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil, adding that Canada, Mexico and the United States were studying how to mitigate the impact of such a move. Restrictions on Venezuela’s oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member, which is gripped by severe shortages of food and medicine. Such sanctions could also hurt U.S. refineries that process Venezuelan oil. Sanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro’s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. In a June meeting in Cancun, foreign ministers from the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing Venezuela, with only 20 countries backing the proposal, shy of the 23-nation threshold. Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica voted against the resolution, while Grenada, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua and Barbuda abstained.  Jamaica and Saint Lucia backed the proposal. Officials from other Caribbean nations will be present at Videgaray’s Jamaican stop, the Mexican official said, adding that the Caribbean trip represents an attempt to end the stalemate in the June OAS meeting. “It’s a result of Cancun,” the official said. “There was a bloc in the Caribbean that wasn’t pulling in the same direction as the OAS.”  Reuters reported last year that Mexico was looking at the possibility of replacing Venezuela’s Petrocaribe programme that provided cheap loans for oil to Caribbean nations - and has helped Maduro retain diplomatic support in the region. However, the Mexican official said it was still not clear how Mexico could furnish Caribbean nations with cheap energy, given the country’s struggling domestic fuel production, and that Mexico relies on oil income for about a fifth of the government budget.  The energy ministry remains unconvinced by the oil diplomacy plan, led by Videgaray, but there are signs it is becoming more flexible, the official said.

2018-02-16,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Urgent efforts are needed to jumpstart the peace process in eastern Ukraine, the head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe said on Friday, warning that continued daily ceasefire violations could spiral out of control. Thomas Greminger, who took over as secretary general of the OSCE in July, told Reuters he hoped a planned meeting by top officials from Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference could help end a “political impasse” on the crisis. A Russia-backed separatist insurgency led to fighting that has killed 10,000 people since 2014.  While full-scale combat mostly ended in 2015 after France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine sponsored a ceasefire agreement in the Belarus capital Minsk, casualties are still reported on a near daily basis in incidents along the front line. The OSCE, a European security body tasked with monitoring the agreement, still sees an average of 1,000 ceasefire violations a day, Greminger told Reuters in an interview at the annual Munich Security Conference. “This has to stop,” Greminger said. “What we desperately need is another political impulse,” he said, adding that it should come from the four countries that sponsored Minsk. Officials from the four countries cancelled a meeting that had been due to take place Friday evening in Munich, citing scheduling conflicts, but said they were trying to find another time to meet before the annual security event ends. “I would look forward to seeing Germany again assuming a leadership role, ideally together with France, and then I think we have a fair chance that the Russian Federation and Ukraine could come along,” Greminger said. The parties have failed to withdraw heavy military equipment from the lines of conflict as agreed in the ceasefire agreement, he said. There was also a big risk that shelling could inadvertently result in a catastrophic chemical spill at a water filtration plant near the front, he said. “The risk is growing that one day you will have an incident that gets out of control,” he said. Greminger said he worried about a general increase in tensions between Russia and the West in the region, at a time when both have staged snap military exercises. Later, in a fiery speech to the conference, Ukraine’s President Pedro Poroshenko urged delegates to push for United Nations peacekeepers to be deployed across the entire region controlled by pro-Russian separatists. “There is a chance for Moscow to show the sense of compromise and agree to U.N. peacekeepers throughout the whole territory of Donbass including the uncontrolled part of Ukraine on the Russian border,” he said. Greminger said discussions about a U.N. peacekeeping force could represent a first step toward a “face-saving move” to end the fighting in the Donbass region. He said one option might be a joint OSCE-UN peacekeeping force. The OSCE, set up during the Cold War as a forum that would include both sides, is still one of the few bodies which regularly brings Russia together with the United States and its Western allies. It has initiated a dialogue aimed at lowering military and political risks, which Greminger said could lead to some confidence-building measures in 12-18 months, with an eye to working on conventional arms reduction in 3-5 years. But the prerequisite was rebuilding trust among the parties, Greminger said. “We need some political leadership ... and we need to do that now because we are on the brink of major conflict,” he said. Greminger said he hoped Ukraine could agree to some concessions on a dispute over visas that prompted Russian military officers to withdraw from a Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire control group in December.

2018-02-16,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa will face “tough decisions” as it works to repair its economy after years of stagnation, new President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a sober address on Friday that sought to draw a line under the turbulent rule of his predecessor Jacob Zuma. Hailing a “new dawn” a day after his inauguration, he promised to fight corruption, which had weakened the state-owned enterprises in Africa’s most industrialized economy, and to trim a bloated cabinet.      Ramaphosa said his government was committed to “policy certainty and consistency”, in contrast to Zuma, who was criticised for policy shifts and unpredictable cabinet changes that rocked domestic financial markets and confounded investors. The 65-year-old was sworn in as head of state on Thursday after Zuma reluctantly resigned on orders of the ANC. “This is the year in which we will turn the tide of corruption in our public institutions,” Ramaphosa said in his first State of the Nation address. “We are determined to build a society defined by decency and integrity, that does not tolerate the plunder of public resources, nor the theft by corporate criminals of the hard-earned savings of ordinary people,” he added. Ramaphosa’s election as president, which was unopposed in the parliament, has prompted a wave of optimism among South Africans hungry for change after nine years of economic stagnation and corruption scandals. Zuma denies all wrongdoing. “Tough decisions have to be made to close our fiscal gap, stabilise our debt and restore our state-owned enterprises to health,” Ramaphosa said. He promised to make job creation a priority in 2018. South Africa's rand ZAR=D3 rallied soon after Ramaphosa started his address, trading near its three-year best.  Financial markets have rallied since Ramaphosa took over from Zuma as ANC leader in December, as investors warmed to his pledges to woo overseas investment.  He thanked Zuma for the way he had approached recent events. Facing waning electoral support for his party, Ramaphosa needs to avoid alienating ANC members still loyal to the 75-year-old former president.   For a graphic on South African markets rallying on Ramaphosa becoming President, click: reut.rs/2BxsBXO In a direct appeal to poorer black voters - the core of the ANC’s support - Ramaphosa said he would aim to speed up the transfer of land to black people. Two decades after the end of apartheid, the ANC is under pressure to redress racial disparities in land ownership where whites own most of the land. Ramaphosa said he pursue a policy of “radical economic transformation” that will speed up expropriation of land without compensation, but said this should be done in a way that increases agricultural production and improves food security. Ramaphosa said mining had potential for growth and jobs.  “We need to see mining as a sunrise industry,” he said. South Africa’s mining industry has been a major employer and contributed 7.7 percent to gross domestic product in 2016. The sector also accounts for 25 percent of exports in Africa’s most industrialized economy. South Africa’s GDP is estimated to grow by around 1 percent this year. For a graphic on the South African economy, click: tmsnrt.rs/2E8nCfL Africa’s most developed economy needs faster economic growth if it is to reduce high unemployment - currently at 27 percent - and alleviate widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white minority rule in 1994. The leader of the opposition, and head of the Democratic Alliance party, Mmusi Maimane, said the president was reading from an old script. “We could have gotten more bolder action today, but I heard more of the same stuff,” Maimane said. The leader of the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party (EFF), Julius Malema, said he welcomed the commitments to shrink the cabinet and take back land. “He (Ramaphosa) has a lot of ideas but no plan of how to go about it, but let’s give the benefit of doubt,” Malema said. Ramaphosa, a former union leader who played an important role in talks to end apartheid, is expected to announce major cabinet changes in the coming days to replace Zuma acolytes in key portfolios who have been accused of mismanagement and implicated in corruption. Ramaphosa, who will see out the remainder of Zuma’s presidential term until elections next year, faces an uphill battle to win public and investor support. He ended his speech by quoting trumpeter and singer Hugh Masekela, known as the “father of South African jazz” who used his music in the fight against apartheid. “In his song, “Thuma Mina”, he anticipated a day of renewal, of new beginnings. He sang: “I wanna be there when the people start to turn it around”,” Ramaphosa said. Most of the lawmakers there broke into song and danced.

2018-02-16,"TIRANA, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Albania plans to launch a power exchange next January and the government will choose partners to run it alongside the state-owned Transmission System Operator, a government official said on Friday. Albania’s parliament passed legislation on Thursday paving the way for the government to move ahead with its plans for the exchange and meet a 2018 deadline set under a cooperation agreement with other Balkan countries - known as the Western Balkans Six. “We are optimistic we’ll have the exchange by January. This is a difficult process,” Entela Cipa, an energy specialist and adviser to the energy minister, told Reuters. Dependant entirely on hydropower, Albania has been a net power importer since it dumped communism 25 years ago, except for 2016, when it exported for the first time. Launching the plans for the exchange became possible after state-owned power generation, transmission and distribution monopolies invested more than 300 million euros ($373.05 million) to upgrade their networks and cut losses. The Albanian Power Exchange will be able to take on as shareholders international energy operators, other transmission operators and also international financial institutions. Cipa said the exchange will trade day-ahead and intraday products. Nord Pool Consulting is advising on the project. Albania and neighbouring Kosovo decided last November their transmission operators would own an equal share of the exchange, she said. “We are open to partnerships because international ones provide guarantees since the bourse of a small country like ours might find it hard to draw high trade volumes,” she added. Albania is also talking about possible partnerships with Montenegro and Serbia. Initially, the exchange will work with industrial consumers, which pay unregulated prices and which represent around 10 percent of the power consumed in the country. Albania usually imports 2 to 2.5 TW of power each year. Its state-owned monopoly KESh produces from 4.5 to 7 TW in a good year, while private producers generate a total of 1 to 1.3 TW. Norway’s Statkraft has a power plant in Albania which now produce 75 MW a year and will produce 250 MW when its second plant comes online soon.

2018-02-16,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah on Friday urged Lebanon to stand firm in its offshore energy dispute with Israel and warned it could act against Israeli oil facilities if necessary, as the U.S. mediates between the two countries. In a televised address, the leader of the heavily-armed, Iran-backed movement, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, described the issue as a “battle for all of Lebanon”. “If Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council were to decide that (Israeli) offshore oil and gas plants...should be forbidden from working, I promise they would stop working within hours,” he told a rally. U.S. diplomats have been mediating between Lebanon and Israel after a spike in tensions that also involved a dispute over a border wall which Israel is building, and Hezbollah’s growing arsenal.  Nasrallah said Lebanon’s territorial waters, and efforts to explore for oil and gas in a block that lies along the contested marine border with Israel has become the most pressing issue.  Lebanon signed its first exploration and production agreements last week with a consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek. Nasrallah’s speech came after Lebanon’s senior leaders met with a U.S. envoy on Friday to discuss the dispute. A top Lebanese official told the diplomat that current U.S. proposals for a resolution to the energy issue were not acceptable.  The powerful Shi’ite Hezbollah is part of Lebanon’s coalition government, which includes almost all the country’s main political parties.  Israel sees Hezbollah as the biggest security threat on its borders and the United States regards it as a terrorist group. But Washington also supports the Lebanese military, funding its forces partly as a counterweight to Hezbollah.  Nasrallah said Lebanese officials should not fear Israeli military might, but should warn U.S. officials of Hezbollah’s own strength. He also said the United States was not an honest broker, and that Lebanese officials should not be fooled by their mediation. “If the Americans come and say you must be responsive so that I restrain Israel from you, tell the Americans: they must accept (Lebanon’s) demands so that we hold Hezbollah back from Israel,” he said. “The oil wealth is for all the Lebanese.”  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Lebanon on Thursday and said the United States was engaging with Lebanon and Israel to ensure their frontier remained calm.  After his visit, the acting assistant secretary of state, David Satterfield, met senior Lebanese officials on Friday.  But Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri reiterated the state’s rejection of current U.S. proposals as “unacceptable”. This was an apparent reference to a maritime demarcation line proposed by U.S. diplomat Frederic Hof in 2012. The line would give Lebanon around two thirds and Israel around one third of a disputed triangular area of sea of around 860 sq km (330 square miles). Berri, whose position is the second-most powerful in government, insisted during his meeting with Satterfield that the maritime border should be drawn up through a committee that stemmed from a 1996 ceasefire, state news agency NNA said.  He said he wanted to see a similar process as produced the U.N.-demarcated Blue Line border, which marks Israel’s military withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. Lebanon has hoped to explore for energy in its waters since other countries started finding gas in the area in 2009, but its plans were put on hold by political paralysis in Beirut.  It restarted a stalled tender process for five of its 10 offshore blocks, including three along the disputed border with Israel, last year after a political deal that led to the formation of a new government.  Lebanon has one of the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world and its economic growth is very weak.  One of the blocks signed last week, Block 9, lies partly in waters disputed by Israel. An Israeli minister has described the decision to explore there as “very provocative”.   Lebanon’s energy minister has said the dispute with Israel would not stop Lebanon benefiting from potential undersea reserves in Block 9. Consortium operator Total said it would not drill the block’s first well near the disputed zone.

2018-02-16,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Stocks continue week’s big rally * Euro zone, Treasury bond yields fall * Crude rises on equity rally and weak dollar By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose on Friday and were set for their best week in six years as strong corporate earnings offset concerns about rising inflation and interest rates, while the U.S. dollar edged higher from a three-year low against major currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose as investors bought back bonds after a sell-off earlier in the week as investor jitters over rising inflation raised the possibility the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates at a faster pace than expected this year. Analysts continued to underestimate the pace of global growth, which has led more companies to meet or beat analysts’ result expectations than in any quarter in 20 years, according to calculations by Credit Suisse. Fourth-quarter earnings for European companies in the STOXX 600 index are expected to increase 14.6 percent from a year ago, while the blended earnings growth estimate for the S&P 500 is 15 percent, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data show. “Investors are getting comfortable with the idea that growth is sufficient enough to withstand the expected rate increases that we’re going to get as well the increases in inflation that we’ve seen,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe gained 0.54 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 1.11 percent to a preliminary close of 1,491.90. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 140.69 points, or 0.56 percent, to 25,341.06. The S&P 500 gained 13.44 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,744.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.82 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,281.25. Both the S&P 500 and Dow indexes have gained 4.8 percent in the past four sessions, putting the S&P on track for its best week since January 2013 and the Dow’s best since November 2016. The Nasdaq’s 6 percent gain since Monday has set it on course for its strongest week since December 2011. Investors are trying to determine whether the market is in an overdue correction or the beginning of something worse, Arone said. “It looks like this week they’re comfortable about uncertainty and the risks that are associated with it and stocks are moving higher based on fundamentals,” he said. Borrowing costs across the euro area fell, though the prospect of higher inflation and a move toward tighter monetary policy from major central banks weighed on sentiment across world bond markets. Short-dated bond yields in Germany, the euro zone’s benchmark bond issuer, have risen by about 7 basis points this week and are set for their biggest weekly rise in eight weeks. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 9/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8604 percent. The dollar rose on the day but remained on track to record its biggest weekly loss in nine months, as negative sentiment offset any support the greenback could take from higher Treasury yields. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.36 percent, with the euro down 0.5 percent to $1.2442. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.04 percent versus the greenback at 106.09 per dollar. Oil prices rose slightly, as the rebound in the global equities market and the dollar’s recent weakness supported their recovery from last week’s slide. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery rose 47 cents at $61.81 a barrel. Brent rose 75 cents to $65.08.

2018-02-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Germany and Russia poses no threat to Europe’s energy security, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday, publicly disagreeing with her Polish counterpart. Poland, Ukraine and Baltic states fear the pipeline to be laid under the Baltic Sea would increase Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and could cut off Ukraine - still fighting a conflict with Russian-backed separatists - from gas transit fees.  “We had different views on the Nord Stream issue,” Merkel told reporters at a joint press conference with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Berlin. “We think this is an economic project. We are also for energy diversification. We also want Ukraine to continue to have transit gas traffic, but we believe Nord Stream poses no danger to diversification,” she said. Morawiecki stressed the shared interests of Poland and its main trade partner Germany, but disagreed with Merkel that Nord Stream 2 would diversify gas supplies. “This is gas from the same source, but via a different route. We indicate the risks related to cutting Ukraine from transit,” he said, adding however that Merkel’s comments on assuring Ukraine’s gas traffic fees were important. Morawiecki has called for the United States to impose sanctions on the planned pipeline, which U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month the U.S government sees as a threat to Europe’s energy security. “Once Nord Stream 2 is going to be built (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can do with Ukraine whatever he wants,” Morawiecki told reporters later on Friday. “And then we have potentially his army on the eastern border of the EU.” More than 10,000 people have been killed since 2014 in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Poland, a member of the European Union and NATO, shares a 535-km (330-mile) land border with Ukraine. While the Kremlin has denied providing military support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, the United States has sanctioned Russian firms over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine conflict and foreign companies helping Russian energy exploration. Separately, Nordic nations have voiced security concerns over the pipeline being laid near their shores under the Baltic. Germany and Austria have focussed more on the commercial benefits of having more cheap gas, arguing there could be little harm from an additional pipeline. German energy groups Uniper and Wintershall, Austria’s OMV, Anglo-Dutch group Shell and France’s Engie have invested in the 1,225 km (760-mile) pipeline.

2018-02-16,"(Refiles to add dropped word and fix typo in first paragraph) ATHENS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Greece has received two binding bids for a 66 percent stake in its gas grid operator DESFA, the Greek privatisation agency (HRADF) said on Friday, a sale that is a key condition of the country’s international bailout. The agency said bids were submitted by a consortium of Italy’s Snam, Spain’s Enagas Internacional and Belgium’s Fluxys, and a consortium of Spain’s Regasificadora del Noroeste (Reganosa), Romania’s Transgaz and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Friday’s deadline for binding bids comes ahead of a euro zone finance ministers’ meeting in Brussels on Monday which will assess Greece’s bailout progress and decide on disbursing more bailout loans. A share purchase agreement and a shareholders’ agreement for DESFA are due to be signed by April for the sale to conclude by June, before Greece exits its third bailout in August. HRADF said it would begin evaluating the bids immediately together with its advisers. DESFA, which owns and operates Greece’s natural gas network and a liquefied natural gas terminal on an islet off Athens, is considered a valuable asset as gas consumption in Greece rises and the country seeks to boost its presence in the regional energy market. DESFA transports gas from the Greek-Bulgarian and Greek-Turkish borders to Greek consumers via a 1,459-km (907-mile) pipeline. Greece relaunched the sale last year after a previous 400 million euro ($448 million) deal with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR fell through in 2016. Under the deal, Hellenic Petroleum is selling its 35 percent stake in DESFA and Greece is divesting another 31 percent from its holding.

2018-02-16,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A little-noticed addition to the U.S. budget deal approved last week will help Occidental Petroleum Corp and other oil producers by more than tripling a tax credit for injecting carbon dioxide back into the earth to increase crude output. The tax-credit expansion, although supported by environmentalists and energy producers, had failed to move out of Congress during the 2016 presidential election. Its passage now likely will further boost already surging U.S. oil output in a year that production is forecast to hit 11 million barrels per day.  The injection process, used for more than 40 years to prolong output from traditional oil wells, also is being tested by Oxy and others as a way to speed more oil production from shale wells. President Donald Trump last week signed the spending plan into law. It boosts for 12 years an existing tax credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide injected underground, up from $10 per ton. “This will be an economic driver for our nation,” said  North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who had pushed for the credit’s expansion with a bipartisan group of senators. “It will hopefully push a lot of innovative technologies across a range of industries, not just in coal or oil.” Oxy, Denbury Resources Inc and others inject more than 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into traditional oil wells, many of which came online more than 75 years ago.   The method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from electric-power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That helps drive more oil to the surface.     The technique, one of several enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies that can prolong the productive life of oilfields, underpins more than five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International. EOR can help firms extract between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That’s far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “This legislation helps to ensure domestic energy security,” Vicki Hollub, Oxy’s chief executive, said in a statement. EOR increases a producer’s costs, but because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value over time can exceed shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off. Oxy has not published anticipated financial benefits from the tax credit’s expansion, and Wall Street analysts who track the company have not offered any estimates. But partly because of its carbon operations, Oxy was able to raise its dividend during the oil price downturn from 2014 to 2016. Oxy this week swung to a fourth-quarter profit that met Wall Street’s expectations.

2018-02-16,"(Adds details on overhauls, plans, Vancouver project) HOUSTON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Independent refiner Andeavor said on Friday it plans to run its 10 U.S. refineries up to 96 percent of their combined capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2018. The company also said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts that its refineries ran at 97 percent of their combined crude oil throughput capacity in the fourth quarter of 2017. For all of 2017, the refineries operated at 95 percent of combined throughput. Andeavor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Goff said the company has a heavy overhaul schedule for 2018. “We are in the final stages of completing a turnaround at Los Angeles that we started some time ago, and we are doing a turnaround at Martinez,” Goff said. “So we have a very heavy turnaround year but everything is going well.” Andeavor is integrating refineries into a single plant in Carson and Wilmington, California, adjacent industrial suburbs of Los Angeles. The 269,200 bpd Carson refinery and the 94,900 bpd Wilmington refinery adjoin each other. Andeavor Chief Financial Officer Steven Sterin said the heavy schedule for refinery maintenance would continue into 2019, in part to prepare for a change in marine fuel formulation to lower sulfur content from 3.5 percent to 0.5 percent. “We are managing our turnarounds to have very, very little turnarounds in 2020,” Sterin said. “So our ‘18 and ‘19 plans include preparation for being able to supply the needs of the market in 2020 for the diesel fuel that we expect to produce.” Goff said Andeavor sees no alternative to its stymied proposal to build a rail-to-marine crude oil terminal that would transfer 11 million barrels of oil a month from trains to tankers at the Port of Vancouver, Washington. Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, on Jan. 31 approved a state board’s recommendation denying Andeavor a permit to build the Vancouver Energy Center. “We continue to scour all ideas and all that but we don’t have any immediate plans to do anything differently,” Goff said. “The Vancouver Energy project was very attractive primarily because it allows you to take crude produced in the United States with a lower carbon intensity of other crudes that are run by the industry on the West Coast and run those crudes and basically improve the environmental footprint of the fuels that we supply on the West Coast,” he said. In December, Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council unanimously recommended denying Andeavor and partner Savage Cos a permit to build the $210 million center, citing risk of injury to workers and damage to the environment if the center went into operation. Andeavor took a $40 million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter related to the project.

2018-02-16,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s Hezbollah said on Friday the United States must accept the Lebanese government’s demands over border disputes with Israel and vowed it was ready to act against Israel if necessary. U.S. diplomats have been mediating between the two countries after a surge in tensions over a border wall which Israel is building and Lebanon’s decision to explore for offshore energy near disputed waters. Earlier on Friday, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri told a U.S. envoy that Lebanon rejects current U.S. proposals over the marine border with Israel.   “The state must have a strong and firm position,” said Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed political and military movement, in a televised speech at a rally.  “If the Americans come and say you must be responsive so that I restrain Israel from you: tell the Americans they must accept (Lebanon’s) demands so that we hold Hezbollah back from Israel,” he added. Nasrallah said the main issue currently at stake was Lebanon’s maritime borders.  “In the oil and gas battle, the only power (the Lebanese) have is the resistance,” he said, in a reference to the heavily armed, Shi’ite Muslim Hezbollah. The Lebanese army could not stop Israel in this matter, he said, because the United States - Israel’s key ally and also a key supporter of Lebanon’s military - would stand in its way.  “If Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council were to decide that (Israeli) offshore oil and gas plants...should be forbidden from working, I promise they would stop working within hours,” he said. Nasrallah spoke in a televised address at a rally commemorating senior commanders, including former military leader Imad Moughniyah who was killed in a bomb blast in Damascus in 2008. Hezbollah was formed in the 1980s as a resistance movement against Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon and the two remain bitter enemies. There has been no major conflict between them since a month-long war in 2006.  In recent years, Israeli jets have repeatedly struck Hezbollah arms stores and convoys in neighbouring Syria, where the group fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s army.

2018-02-16,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Senator John Cornyn’s plan to overhaul U.S. biofuels policy faces resistance from the oil and ethanol sectors, reducing chances of a reboot to the controversial regulations, sources familiar with the matter said. The plan, which the sources said could be released as draft legislation in coming weeks, represents nearly two years of negotiations with the rival industries to end their ongoing clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard. The decade-old law requires refiners to cover the costs of mixing increasing volumes of biofuels, like corn-based ethanol, into the nation’s fuel supply by acquiring blending credits called RINs that  can be purchased or earned. While the regulation has created a lucrative new market for corn growers and fuel blenders, the many refiners in Cornyn’s home state of Texas complain the system has cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, as volumes mandates grow and credit prices trend higher. The centerpiece of the Cornyn plan includes the creation of a new type of ethanol RIN credit - called a D8 RIN - that the Republican lawmaker believes would lower the price of the existing ethanol blending credits, the sources said.     A D8 RIN would be generated when a gallon of gasoline containing more than 10 percent ethanol is produced. The existing D6 RIN pool would then cover only gasoline with a percentage of ethanol below 10 percent - representing the vast majority of the fuel sold in the country. By separating the two types of fuel, Cornyn believes generic D6 RIN prices would tumble, saving refiners money. The higher-blend D8 credits would cover a smaller portion of the market but theoretically sell at a premium, preserving the incentive for companies to invest in more ethanol blending infrastructure, the sources said.     Refining company Marathon Petroleum Corp. has been an advocate of the idea. But segments of the refining industry are opposed to sweeping changes because they profit from the status quo. The downstream committee of the American Petroleum Institute (API) recently decided against voting on whether it supported the D8 RIN proposal, the sources said, because of opposition to the plan within the group. API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang declined to comment on the idea. “It is not fair or appropriate to comment until there is a legislative package released that we can review and comment on,” she said. But she added the group generally supported Cornyn’s efforts to seek a legislative overhaul of the RFS.  Members of the biofuel industry have their concerns about the D8 credit as well. “Biofuel and agricultural voices do not support the D8 RIN,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. Cornyn’s proposal would impact the market for niche biofuels by dragging down their prices and reducing the attractiveness of investing in the industry’s development, Coleman said. A Cornyn spokesman, Drew Brandewie, said the senator “is working hard to unify all stakeholders.” He said the legislation is still being drafted and the major industry trade groups have not seen it. He did not comment on the details of the plan.  Cornyn’s plan would also lift a ban on sales of higher-ethanol blends during the hot, summer months - something now restricted due to anti-smog rules.  The sources said the proposal was included as a concession to the ethanol industry - which has long opposed the ban - to support the broader RFS overhaul. But plan faces resistance from the corn industry for another reason: It would let the renewable fuel program expire in 2022, the sources said, effectively replacing its biofuels volume quotas with a mandate for higher octane content in gasoline instead. Higher octane can increase fuel efficiency. It and can be achieved by blending ethanol or other additives into fuel. Bob Dinneen, head of the Renewable Fuels Association, said that idea endangered the ethanol industry’s future. “Any effort to reform or repeal the RFS that is founded on the premise of demand destruction is a non-starter,” he said on the sidelines of an industry event this week in San Antonio.

2018-02-16,"ABUJA (Reuters) - At least 18 people and possibly many more have been killed in a clash between bandits and villagers in northwest Nigeria, police said on Friday, and President Muhammadu Buhari ordered security forces to track down those responsible. Communal clashes have plagued swathes of Nigeria’s hinterland despite pledges by Buhari since he took power in 2015 to improve security, especially in the northeast, which also faces an insurgency by the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. A police statement said the final death toll from Thursday’s attack in the village of Birani could well exceed the 18 confirmed deaths. Three villagers who witnessed the attack said more than 40 people had been killed. The attackers came on motorcycles and opened fire on the villagers, Birani residents Hussaini Abdu, Salmanu Zurmi and Sani Musa told Reuters. They said the gunmen had also set fire to a vehicle with people inside. “They slit the throat of the driver and then opened fire on the vehicle killing every one on board and then set it ablaze,” said Abdu, the village head. Buhari has directed security agencies “to immediately mobilise and deploy their members to the vulnerable areas of the state, and to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to face the full wrath of the law”, a presidency spokesman said. He also sent his defence minister to the area to investigate the incident. Nigeria has already deployed army troops to more than 30 of the west African nation’s 36 states to help tackle insecurity. Last month, Amnesty International said Nigeria’s air force had killed at least 35 people in air raids on villages that were used as a “law enforcement method”.

2018-02-16,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil company Eni (ENI.MI) on Friday held out the promise of stronger returns for shareholders after its profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter and production hit a record high. Like rivals in the oil industry, state-controlled Eni cut spending and costs after oil prices collapsed in 2014 and is now in a stronger position to reap the rewards of firmer oil prices and growing output. Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said the group saw excellent growth prospects for all of its businesses. “Should conditions be more favourable, (Eni) will be in a position to create a substantial surplus value for shareholders,” he said.  After years of austerity, the world’s biggest oil companies are all trying to woo investors with promises of growth and greater rewards. Higher oil prices, production and cost savings allowed France’s Total (TOTF.PA), for example, to raise dividends and announce plans to buy back shares. Asked by analysts if there was room for fatter returns, Descalzi said the issue would be addressed in the company’s business plan due out in March. Mediobanca oil analyst Alessandro Pozzi said: “Cash flow is solid, breakeven is probably less than the $57 a barrel they gave so I think there’s potentially room for better returns.” Eni said its adjusted net profit in the last three months of 2017 was 0.98 billion euros, well above an analyst consensus provided by the company of 0.57 billion euros. Production at the company hit an all time high in December with 1.92 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and Eni said it expected output to rise 3 percent this year, lifted by its operations in Egypt, Angola, and Indonesia. Production at its Zohr field in Egypt — the biggest ever gas discovery in the Mediterranean — began late last year and should add 70,000 boe/d for Eni this year, Descalzi said. Eni is also looking this year to sell down its stakes in fields in Mexico and Indonesia, CFO Massimo Monduzzi said. Eni, the world’s most successful explorer in recent years after its super giant finds in Egypt and Mozambique, said it planned to spend 8 billion euros this year in line with 2017.

The union said employers had offered to raise salaries by 2.1 percent over 18 months at the latest round of talks last month, but chief negotiator Holger Nieden said that did not take the good economic situation into account. “The offer is completely insufficient. It’s time to increase the pressure,” he said. Trade union Verdi, which is also negotiating for energy workers, is calling for a 6 percent wage increase. It said the next round of talks was scheduled for Feb. 27. A spokesman for E.ON said the group was confident a fair and balanced wage deal could be reached that would adequately reflect employee interests, the company’s economic situation as well the competitive environment. Earlier this month, industrial workers in southwestern Germany struck a hard-fought deal with employers on pay and working hours, setting a benchmark for millions of workers across Europe’s largest economy. That agreement, between labour union IG Metall and the Suedwestmetall employers’ federation, foresees a 4.3 percent raise from April and other payments spread over 27 months.

2018-02-16,"BAKU (Reuters) - British oil major BP (BP.L), which operates a number of oil and gas fields in Azerbaijan, plans no maintenance shutdowns of platforms there this year and intends to advance with new projects, BP’s regional president told Reuters. “There aren’t any turnarounds planned for this year. I think there are some planned for 2019,” Gary Jones, BP’s head for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, said. He said the company would use different ways to conduct inspections, including the use of drones, to minimise the need for any shutdown. BP operates the giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields in Azerbaijan as well as the Shah Deniz gas fields. The company said on Friday ACG oil output in 2017 edged down to 588,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 630,000 bpd the year before. Natural gas production from the Shah Deniz offshore fields was 10.2 billion cubic metres (bcm) and condensate output came to 2.4 million tonnes, down from 10.7 bcm of gas and 2.5 million tonnes of condensate in 2016. Jones declined to specify oil and gas output projections for this year, but said BP was trying to reduce declines in oil production to a minimum. “Globally we are trying to keep (oil output) declines in a range of 2.5-5 percent per year.” BP and Azerbaijan last year extended to 2050 the agreement to develop the ACG, a deal dubbed “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994. The arrangement was initially due to run until 2024. Jones said the Southern Gas Corridor, a project of pipelines to bring gas from Azerbaijan to Europe, “was running ahead of schedule and ahead of budget”. He said BP would continue investment in ongoing projects as well as new ones. In 2018, the company plans to explore three prospective areas in shallow waters off the Absheron peninsula, as well as engineering investment for the Central-Eastern Azeri platform, and seismic work on block D-230. “We hope to sign a production-sharing agreement with SOCAR on D-230 block this year, very soon,” Jones said, referring to the Azeri state energy company. He added that drilling a first exploration well on the Shafag-Asiman block was planned for 2019.

2018-02-16,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Middle Eastern states should put their differences behind them and forge a security pact modelled on the European Union in order to pull the region back from the brink, Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said on Friday. He asked the international community to keep up diplomatic pressure on the countries concerned to achieve that, but offered few other details. “I believe that it is time for wider regional security in the Middle East. It is time for all nations of the region to forget the past, including us, and agree on basic security principles and rules of governance, and at least a minimum level of security to allow for peace and prosperity,” Sheikh Tamim told a security conference in Munich. “This should not be a pipe dream. Too much is at risk. The Middle East is at the brink. It’s time to bring it back.” Qatar, a tiny but rich Gulf Arab state, has been isolated over the past seven months by trade and travel sanctions imposed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt over accusations - denied by Doha - that it supports terrorism and regional rival Iran. Efforts by the United States and Kuwait to end the rift have failed to produce any results. In addition to the Gulf row, Sheikh Tamim referenced violent conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya which have sparked humanitarian catastrophes and one of the largest refugee crises ever with millions of people washing up in Europe in recent years. “We can mirror efforts of the European Union, its ability to find common ground to rebuild and prosper,” he added. “Shifting from feuds to cooperation will require that we each be held accountable.” Writing by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-security-qatar/qatar-calls-for-eu-style-security-pact-for-middle-east-idUKL8N1Q64PZ,16 Feb 2018,"Middle Eastern states should put

2018-02-16,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Audi (NSUG.DE) Chairman Matthias Mueller appealed to workers to ignore a media report that Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was about to be ousted, hoping to quell further unrest at the scandal-hit Volkswagen group. German tabloid Bild reported on its front page on Friday that Stadler would leave in April because of his handling of the diesel emissions affair, in which Audi played a prominent role. The report said Stadler would however be given a new role as VW group finance chief. In a message to Audi staff, Mueller, who is also CEO of parent company Volkswagen, said the luxury carmaker needed the full concentration of management and workers to overcome its current challenges under Stadler’s “proven leadership”. “Please pay no attention to the personnel speculation spread by the media, which lacks any foundation,” Mueller said in the message sent to Reuters by email. Volkswagen has repeatedly attempted to draw a line under a scandal that broke out in 2015 when it admitted cheating diesel-emission tests in the United States to conceal the amount of noxious gases emitted by some of its vehicles. Under Mueller, who took over when Martin Winterkorn quit days after the scandal broke, the leading German carmaker has settled the main U.S. legal case to result from the cheating and sought to turn the page with an electric-vehicle initiative. But the “Dieselgate” crisis refuses to die, reigniting conflicts between the powerful family, management, trade union and political interests who vie for the upper hand in the group. On Thursday, Volkswagen’s top labor representative said the company’s drive to improve accountability, seen by investors as a major plank in VW’s ability to regain trust, had made zero progress.  Sources have said that Mueller is growing frustrated by a lack of support for his reform efforts and by the lingering scandal. VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch said on Monday there was no reason to question Mueller’s position.     The revelation last month that German carmakers including Volkswagen had commissioned tests in which monkeys were exposed to toxic diesel fumes were a stark reminder that VW had not yet put its past behind it.  And last week, Audi’s headquarters were searched by German prosecutors widening their inquiry into the manipulation of diesel-emissions tests. Stadler ran finance at Audi for four years before becoming CEO in 2007. He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen’s controlling clan who was himself ousted in 2015. His position as CEO has been questioned before but so far Audi’s board has rallied around him. Bild said Stadler would be moved to take charge of VW group’s finance portfolio, currently run by Frank Witter, a former head of the carmaker’s financial services division. Witter is well regarded among investors and uncontroversial with VW’s powerful unions, a source close to VW said.  Sources close to Audi said there had been no discussion on the supervisory board about replacing Stadler. The controlling panels at Audi and parent VW are due to hold separate regular meetings next week. Porsche SE (PSHG_p.DE), the group through which the billionaire Porsche and Piech families control their majority stake in VW, declined comment. A senior source close to VW told Reuters last week that Stadler retained the backing of the Porsche-Piech clan. Bild said that ex-Skoda chief Winfried Vahland - who quit the VW group weeks after the scandal broke out in 2015, declining to take up his post as North America chief - was favorite to succeed Stadler. Should Vahland refuse the job, BMW (BMWG.DE) development chief Klaus Froehlich was a possible alternative, it said. But BMW said Froehlich was not a candidate to replace Stadler. Reuters could not immediately reach Vahland, who has kept a low profile after quitting Volkswagen.  Audi, VW’s main profit contributor, did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the United States until November 2015, two months after the scandal at parent VW was revealed. Audi developed the bigger 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models that in 2015 were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed U.S. emissions limits.

2018-02-16,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch energy company Eneco, valued at up to 4 billion euros ($5 billion), will be privatized after its municipal shareholders and management boards agreed on the terms under which it may be sold, ending months of feuding. In a joint statement, they said they would “now together take steps in the short term toward the privatization of Eneco Group.” Eneco is owned by 53 cities led by largest shareholder Rotterdam, which had pushed for a sale after the firm’s energy grid, Stedin, was split last year. That left Eneco as a small, profit-seeking company in the uneasy hands of the municipalities. Shareholders voted by a large majority to sell the company in October, but met resistance from the company’s boards, who preferred an IPO or partial sale that would ensure its continuity as a renewables-oriented firm. They entered mediation last month after Eneco’s Shareholders’ Commission threatened to take the board to court and have them removed. The statement said both sides have now “made clear commitments” on issues ranging from management’s pay to the timing and conditions for buyers — though those terms will not be made public. Rotterdam alderman Adriaan Visser, who chairs the Shareholders Commission, said in a statement he was happy with the outcome. “Now our job is to quickly start the sales process, in which the sustainable character of Eneco will remain protected,” he said.

2018-02-16,"(Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO)(ENB.N) does not see a need to sell more assets in 2018 than it has publicly targeted but will keep its options open, its chief executive officer said on Friday. Earlier Friday, Enbridge posted a quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimate after transporting a record number of barrels of liquids including crude oil. Citing sources, Reuters reported on Thursday that the Calgary, Alberta-based company plans to accelerate its divestment program by selling assets valued at about C$8 billion ($6.4 billion) in 2018, more than twice its initial sale target. CEO Al Monaco did not deny the report but told analysts on a conference call that they should treat it with caution “since it’s not from us.” In November, Enbridge forecast a C$3 billion target for non-core asset sales in 2018, and has identified C$10 billion in total of non-core assets to divest over time. The company is under pressure to reduce debt from investors and rating agencies, following a $28 billion merger last year with Spectra Energy Corp. “There is certainly nothing that indicates to us that additional asset sales would be required, but obviously as we always would, if there are ideas that come forward or offers put on the table that we can’t turn down, then we’ll probably have a look,” Monaco said on the call. Interest has been strong from potential buyers in renewable and gathering and processing assets, Monaco said. Enbridge could sell its Midcoast Gas Gathering and Processing business in the United States as a block or in parcels, he said. The company’s shares rose 0.6 percent in Toronto and 0.4 percent in New York. Enbridge, North America’s largest energy infrastructure company, transported 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States during the fourth quarter, up from 2.5 million bpd a year earlier. Net income fell to C$207 million ($166 million), or 13 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter, from C$365 million, or 39 Canadian cents, a year earlier.  Enbridge said it took a C$4.55 billion charge in the latest quarter to write down assets in the gas transmission and midstream business. Excluding items, the company earned 61 Canadian cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 5 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-02-16,"MUNICH, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Urgent efforts are needed to jumpstart the peace process in eastern Ukraine, the head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe said on Friday, warning that continued daily ceasefire violations could spiral out of control. Thomas Greminger, who took over as secretary general of the OSCE last July, told Reuters he hoped a meeting by top officials from Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine later on Friday could help end a “political impasse” on the crisis. A Russia-backed separatist insurgency led to fighting that has killed 10,000 people since 2014. While full-scale combat mostly ended in 2015 after France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine sponsored a ceasefire agreement in the Belarus capital Minsk, casulties are still reported on a near daily basis in incidents along the front line. The OSCE, a European security body tasked with monitoring the agreement, still sees an average of 1,000 ceasefire violations a day, Greminger told Reuters in an interview at the annual Munich Security Conference. “This has to stop,” Greminger said. “What we desperately need is another political impulse,” he said, adding that it should come from the four countries that sponsored Minsk. Efforts to push for implementation of the peace deal have stalled amid the ongoing struggle to form a government in Germany after September national elections. But officials from the four countries will meet on Thursday evening on the sidelines of the Munich conference. “I would look forward to seeing Germany again assuming a leadership role, ideally together with France, and then I think we have a fair chance that the Russian Federation and Ukraine could come along,” Greminger said. The parties have failed to withdraw heavy military equipment from the lines of conflict as agreed in the ceasefire agreement, he said. There was also a big risk that shelling could inadvertantly result in a catastrophic chemical spill at a water filtration plant near the front, he said. “The risk is growing that one day you will have an incident that gets out of control,” he said. Greminger said he worried about a general increase in tensions between Russia and the West in the region, at a time when both have staged snap military exercises. The OSCE, set up during the Cold War as a forum that would include both sides, is still one of the few bodies which regularly brings Russia together with the United States and its Western allies. It has initiated a dialogue aimed at lowering military and political risks, which Greminger said could lead to some confidence-building measures in 12-18 months, with an eye to working on conventional arms reduction in 3-5 years. But the prerequisite was rebuilding trust among the parties, Greminger said. “We need some political leadership ... and we need to do that now because we are on the brink of major conflict,” he said. Greminger said he hoped Ukraine could agree at Friday’s meeting to some concessions on a dispute over visas that prompted Russian military officers to withdraw from a Ukrainian-Russian ceasefire control group in December.

2018-02-16,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s oil-dependent economy could be hit in 2018 by cuts in crude production as part of the OPEC-led supply pact, with further economic pain after the mid-2020s, the central bank said on Friday. Oil is a key source of budget revenue for Russia, which pledged to cut output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the peak of 11.247 million bpd reached in October 2016. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with other large exporters including Russia, have agreed to maintain their restriction on crude supply for a second year to reduce stockpiles and support prices. “We assume that the OPEC+ deal ... along with weaker demand for natural gas from abroad will temporary curb growth in (Russian oil and gas) production, which may have a negative impact on economic growth in general,” it said. Russian gas company Gazprom’s (GAZP.MM) exports to countries outside the former Soviet Union fell by 10 percent year on year in January, caused by relatively warm weather in Europe.. More risks for the Russia’s energy revenue could also arise from the global influx of electric vehicles in the 2020s, the central bank said. Given improving fuel efficiency and growth in electric car market, it said that peak oil consumption is likely to be reached in the mid-2020s, leading to lower crude prices.

2018-02-16,"PARIS (Reuters) - EDF (EDF.PA) shares rose about 7 percent on a higher-than-expected dividend and expectations of a rebound in 2018, despite a slide in core 2017 earnings and a muted outlook for nuclear power production next year.  Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy said market conditions had been difficult in nearly all EDF’s business lines last year but he said 2018 would deliver a “rebound in our performance.” EDF expects nuclear output of at least 395 terawatthours (TWh) in 2018, after it fell to 379 TWh in 2017, which cut French generation income by 21 percent to 4.8 billion euros (4.26 billion pounds). With all reactors running, EDF can produce 420 TWh. EDF shares were among the top gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index . EDF booked a 1.4 billion euro gain on the sale of a 49.9 percent stake of its power grid unit RTE, boosting net profit 11.3 percent to 3.17 billion euros. Excluding non-recurring items, net profit was down 31 percent. EDF proposed a 0.46 euro a share dividend, corresponding to a 60 percent payout ratio and beating forecasts for 0.31 euro. “The outlook for 2018 is confirmed and the better than expected dividend should reassure the market,” Barclays wrote. For the third year in a row, EDF proposed a dividend in shares to preserve cash, a move approved by the government which has a 83.5 percent stake. EDF said last year’s capital increase and the 2015-2017 share dividends boosted its balance sheet by 9 billion euros. EDF will not offer a scrip dividend on 2018 earnings.  EDF’s head of nuclear power Dominique Miniere said he expected EDF to restart its Fessenheim 2 and Paluel 2 reactors in 2018 but was cautious about the longer term reactor outlook. EDF faced extended unplanned outages and long maintenance shutdowns last year at many of its 58 French reactors. The regulator ordered four reactors closed for months for safety reasons.  Despite forecasts for a pick up in nuclear output in 2018, Levy said 2019 output would fall, as Fessenheim nuclear plant would close permanently and the new Flamanville reactor would still be starting up. There would also be several major maintenance outages.  Heightened competition from Direct Energie DIREN.PA, Engie (ENGIE.PA) and new entrant Total (TOTF.PA) eroded EDF’s market share to 85.5 percent of consumption.  EDF lost nearly 1 million customers last year after losing 600,000 in 2016, but it said some clients had returned. At the end of 2016, EDF had 25.6 million residential customers, compared to 27.8 million five years ago.  EDF said it would cut its retail costs in response and will launch new price offers, notably for green power. EDF’s 2017 revenue fell 2.2 percent to 69.6 billion euros, core EBITDA earnings fell 16.3 percent to 13.7 billion euros. After booking a negative cash flow of 1.56 billion euros in 2016, its cash burn narrowed to 209 million. EDF targets slightly positive or close to balance 2018 cash flow, excluding investments in its Linky smart meters and asset disposals.

2018-02-16,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Germany’s Allianz (ALVG.DE) is considering whether to stop insuring new coal power plants but told environmental campaigners it would stay in the business for now. The 22 percent slide in fourth-quarter earnings reported by the insurer on Friday brought into sharp focus the debate raging within its Munich headquarters over how to balance the need to maximize profit with the desire to address environmental concerns.  The company has put together a working group to study the issue of insuring new coal plants, a spokeswoman said on Friday, with a decision expected in late April or early May. Allianz’s Chief Executive Oliver Baete was a leader in a drive to exit coal investments several years ago - a significant move by one of Europe’s largest investors. “It’s not a question of if, but rather a question of when and how to manage the transition from coal,” said a source familiar with Baete’s thinking.    Environmental campaign group Unfriend Coal last week published a scathing report that highlighted Allianz’s leadership of a consortium underwriting a large coal-fired power plant under construction in Poland.   Allianz, which got out of the business of investing in coal in 2015, said it would continue to offer insurance for the coal-powered energy industry for the time being. “The most important point for us is various countries have an energy need that needs to be fulfilled. They need to be insured,” said board member Guenther Thallinger.  “We believe that with dialogue with various companies over time we can hopefully work down to a much lower level of coal,” he said. Campaigners remain unhappy with Allianz’s stance.  “Allianz is still blind to the contradiction between its ambition to be a climate champion and its support for coal, and its new policies will do little to protect the climate,” Regine Richter, energy and finance campaigner at Urgewald, said on Friday. The company earlier posted a worse than expected fourth-quarter net profit of 1.43 billion euros ($1.79 billion), hit by a U.S. tax overhaul, a weak dollar and a spate of natural disasters. Analysts had forecast net profit of 1.587 billion euros in a Reuters poll. “2017 was an especially difficult year for our industry,” Baete said.  For the full year, Allianz posted operating profit of 11.1 billion euros, in line with analysts’ expectations of 11.04 billion and the company’s own target.  Allianz forecast that profit would be little changed in 2018. Last year insurers had to pay record claims of about $135 billion after a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America.     The series of natural disasters has rocked the insurance industry after years of muted losses, compounding pressure from low prices caused by fierce competition and low interest rates.  Allianz, which is sitting on a cash hoard and has been buying back shares, said it would increase its annual dividend to 8 euros per share, up from 7.60 in 2016.

2018-02-16,"ROTTERDAM (Reuters) - The Port of Rotterdam is bracing for a British exit from the European Union without any deal on customs, and looking at measures such as hiring 100 extra customs agents and dozens of fresh produce inspectors. CEO Allard Castelein said he had had two meetings in the past week with “policy makers, the cabinet, the government and supporting officials about the consequences” of a so-called “hard” Brexit, which would move Britain away from EU rules. “If you have 407 days left, then you don’t have time to embrace hypotheses that it will turn out pretty good in the end,” he told reporters. Britain is due to exit the EU on March 29, 2019. “Let the government negotiate for the best, we are preparing for the worst.”  Prime Minister Theresa May plans to take Britain out of the EU’s single market and customs union after an initial Brexit transition period. The EU says that will mean tariffs and other barriers for goods shipped across the English Channel. Depending on the trade rules adopted by Britain, Rotterdam - and other transit points - could need more customs officials to check produce, and more agricultural inspectors because animals and products such as meat could need separate approval before entering the EU.     Britain is the Netherlands’ second largest trading partner after Germany, with more than 60 billion euros worth of annual bilateral trade, according to government statistics. Much of that trade flows through Rotterdam, Europe’s largest port. The Dutch government’s Economic Policy Analysis agency forecasts that Brexit will cost the Netherlands 1.2 percent of GDP by 2030. While Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said he favours a negotiated exit deal, he has also underlined that he “fully supports” the EU’s single negotiator in talks with Britain, Frenchman Michel Barnier.  Castelein was speaking after the port reported 2017 results on Thursday that showed strong growth in shipping containers.  He said that tens of thousands of Dutch companies that trade with Britain via the port “have never known an import or export document” and would need education. Castelein said hiring extra staff in customs and agricultural inspection was a time-consuming process that needed to begin well in advance.  In addition, the port is looking at how to reorganise physical space “to prevent congestion” including creating new areas outside the terminals to load and unload.

2018-02-16,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World shares snap 2-wk losing streak * Dollar hits lowest since 2014 * VIX hovers below 20 * Oil nears one-week high By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - World shares were set for their best week of gains in six years on Friday after two consecutive weeks in the red, shrugging off a rise in global borrowing costs while the dollar hit its lowest since 2014. MSCI’s world index of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent after European bourses opened. After suffering its biggest weekly drop since August 2015 last week, the index is now on track for its best showing since early December 2011. Some investors have been puzzled at the quick rebound, which has coincided with a rise in bond yields on signs that inflation is starting to creep up globally. The argument commonly offered by economists has been that historically, it is not unusual for stocks and bond market borrowing costs to rise in tandem in a rapidly expanding economy. “For me it’s really a question of maybe. Markets are taking a look at the inflationary outlook and saying OK, maybe rates are going up and maybe the economy will compensate for that,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets. “That might change if we move to 3 percent on the 10-year (U.S. Treasury yield).” The global rise in borrowing costs has been led by that instrument, which hit a four-year high of 2.944 percent this week. It stood at 2.8877 percent on Friday. Yields across the euro area were mostly steady, although Germany’s benchmark Bund was within sight of 2-1/2-year highs and set for its biggest weekly rise in eight weeks. Investors were also watching for a sovereign debt rating update on Greece from Fitch, set for release later in the day. European shares were also set to chalk up healthy weekly gains, snapping a three-week losing streak as earnings updates continued to impress, and volatility and jitters over rising inflation eased. Among country benchmarks, the UK’s FTSE was up 0.6 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.5 percent, while Italy’s FTSE MIB was up 1 percent. The pan-European benchmark is up 3 percent so far this week, set for its best week since December 2016, but still down around 6 percent from the 2-1/2-year peak it hit in January. With many Asian markets closed on Friday for the Lunar new year, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.2 percent, with investors relieved to see the government appoint Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another term, suggesting the central bank will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus programme. Equity investors have drawn a degree of reassurance from a fall in the VIX index - a measure of implied volatility on the S&P 500 index, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”. The index dropped below 20 for the first time since it spiked to a 2-1/2-year high of 50.3 last week, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who bet equity markets would stay stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation. “While the ‘Goldilocks’ risk environment from January appears to be fading, we do not believe we are on the cusp of a protracted risk sell-off, because the global growth cycle remains strong in our view,” Credit Agricole strategists said in a note to clients. Extending the previous day’s losses, the dollar’s index against a group of six major currencies fell to 88.676, the lowest since December 2014. The index was on track to lose around 2 percent on the week in its largest decline since February 2016. Against the yen, the greenback fell to its lowest in over a year. There is no strong consensus yet on what is driving the dollar’s persistent weakness, especially in light of rising yields. Some say it simply reflects a return of risk appetite and a shift to higher-yielding currencies, including many emerging market ones. But others cite concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy as well as talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar. There are also worries President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and fiscal spending could stoke inflation and erode the currency’s value. “You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management Oil prices maintained this week’s gains, with U.S crude futures trading at $61.55 per barrel, up 4.1 percent so far this week. Brent crude traded at $64.77 Virtual currency bitcoin recovered the $10,000 mark for the first time in two weeks before easing to $9,844.82, down over 1 percent on the day.

2018-02-16,"(Repeats story that ran on Thursday with no change to headline or text) By Gabriel Stargardter MEXICO CITY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mexico’s foreign minister will travel to Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia in March, a Mexican official said on Thursday, as part of efforts to erode Venezuela’s oil-based influence in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Cuban diplomats will visit Mexico in March to discuss the regional impact of the crisis in Venezuela, the official said. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City said the trip was not yet confirmed but that the two countries have regular bilateral meetings. Still, there are no signs that Cuba, a steadfast ally of Caracas, is ready to turn its back on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray’s planned trip follows a visit to Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this month by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against Venezuela could be mitigated in the Caribbean. The Mexican foreign minister’s trip represents the latest development in U.S.-led pressure on Maduro, who retains loyalty from some Caribbean nations that have long benefited from Caracas’ oil largess and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts. “The message is: Venezuela is not the only country that can help (Caribbean nations), that if there’s a crisis in Venezuela, they have more friends,” said the Mexican official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the as-yet undisclosed trip. The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The foreign ministries of Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia could not be reached for comment. Videgaray has led Mexico’s efforts to try and improve cooperation with its top trade partner on security, immigration, and foreign policy, hoping to convince the United States to take a softer stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that underpins the majority of Mexican exports. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to quit the pact if it cannot be improved to benefit U.S. workers. On his way to Jamaica, Tillerson said the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil, adding that Canada, Mexico and the United States were studying how to mitigate the impact of such a move. Restrictions on Venezuela’s oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member, which is gripped by severe shortages of food and medicine. Such sanctions could also hurt U.S. refineries that process Venezuelan oil. Sanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro’s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. In a June meeting in Cancun, foreign ministers from the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing Venezuela, with only 20 countries backing the proposal, shy of the 23-nation threshold. Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica voted against the resolution, while Grenada, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua and Barbuda abstained. Jamaica and Saint Lucia backed the proposal. Officials from other Caribbean nations will be present at Videgaray’s Jamaican stop, the Mexican official said, adding that the Caribbean trip represents an attempt to end the stalemate in the June OAS meeting. “It’s a result of Cancun,” the official said. “There was a bloc in the Caribbean that wasn’t pulling in the same direction as the OAS.” Reuters reported last year that Mexico was looking at the possibility of replacing Venezuela’s Petrocaribe program that provided cheap loans for oil to Caribbean nations - and has helped Maduro retain diplomatic support in the region. However, the Mexican official said it was still not clear how Mexico could furnish Caribbean nations with cheap energy, given the country’s struggling domestic fuel production, and that Mexico relies on oil income for about a fifth of the government budget. The energy ministry remains unconvinced by the oil diplomacy plan, led by Videgaray, but there are signs it is becoming more flexible, the official said.

2018-02-16,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Daina Beth Solomon MEXICO CITY, Feb 16 (Reuters) - When a Mexican real estate investment trust bought four hotels along the country’s Gulf coast operating under the Marriott, Quality Inn and Fiesta Inn brands, it expected the government’s recent energy reform to attract droves of oil executives, engineers and technicians. Instead, FibraHotel’s properties in Ciudad del Carmen and Villahermosa and an earlier purchase in Coatzacoalcos, like many along the Gulf, are pinched for guests. President Enrique Pena Nieto’s 2013-14 legislative overhaul of the energy sector, which broke a 75-year monopoly by state oil firm Pemex, had been expected to jumpstart the economy and revive the declining oil industry. It coincided, however, with a global collapse in oil prices that muted investors’ interest. Prices are now rebounding, and the government forecasts that some of the world’s largest oil companies will ultimately invest about $150 billion in Mexico if they succeed in extraction efforts. But experts say the promised growth could still be several years coming. In the hardest-hit oil towns, hotel occupancy rates have fallen by as much as half, said real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle, with some in the region operating with barely a third of their rooms full. Hotels in Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz state registered 36 percent occupancy last year. The state’s main port, Veracruz, and the neighboring Boca del Rio area fared a little better with 43 percent, as did Villahermosa in neighboring Tabasco state. That is well below the booming rates seen last year in tourist hotspots such as Cancun and Riviera Maya, the tourism ministry says, and lower than automobile manufacturing hubs such as Guadalajara and Leon. “It’s been weaker than in past years,” said Guillermo Bravo, head of FibraHotel’s corporate development. He declined to give occupancy figures for the Gulf Coast properties the company bought in 2012 and 2015. But he said they are below the average for the rest of its portfolio, which stretches across more than two dozen Mexican states. Now, the company says its best option is to wait. “It wouldn’t be a good moment to sell,” Bravo said. Hotels typically need 40 percent occupancy to break even, according to Christian Lega, a director of tourism at real estate services firm CBRE Hotels. While hotel owners and operators on the Gulf were reluctant to provide specific figures, several acknowledged the falling occupancy. A source familiar with Hyatt Place in Ciudad del Carmen, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the property is about a third full and recently closed some of its rooms. Hyatt declined to provide current data, but said Ciudad del Carmen hotels had 80 percent occupancy in 2014. That is in line with other cities in the area in the years before oil prices plummeted. Hoteles City Express, which says 13 percent of its Mexico portfolio is largely reliant on the energy industry, has seen its Gulf Coast occupancy rates slip since 2015. Spokeswoman Blanca Herrera said the company is targeting other business sectors and leisure travelers in the area. Hotels are faced with slashing costs to break even and, in the most dire cases, could risk losing partnerships with prestigious brands such as Hyatt, Marriott and Holiday Inn, Lega said. Hotel brands typically agree to emblazon their names on properties if they expect 60 percent occupancy, Lega said. Lower levels can pose a risk to their reputations. Hotels in major oil towns are operating well below that level, according to tourism ministry data compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle. “They thought the energy reform would generate investment much sooner,” Lega said. FibraHotel recently changed one of its Ciudad del Carmen sites from a Courtyard Marriott to a Fiesta Inn, matching the brand of its other nearby properties. “Running both hotels under one operator gave us more synergies and economies of scale,” Bravo said, adding that it was not Marriott’s decision. A spokesperson for Marriott International Inc did not respond to a request for comment. Although many in the sector are hopeful that hotels will again fill with oil workers as firms that won contracts in Mexico’s early auctions begin deploying staff, Gulf Coast hoteliers worry travelers will be deterred by the country’s worst ever surge in violent crime. “There’s the perception that we’re always in fear,” said Esteban Enriquez Espana, president of the Coatzacoalcos hotel and motel association in Veracruz, the state with the fifth highest number of murders in Mexico last year. “It’s a problem that’s gotten out of control,” he said.

There are also worries President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and fiscal spending could stoke inflation and erode the value of the dollar. “His protectionist policies could also fan inflation. Markets appear to have calmed down for now but fundamentally it is different from last year,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything,” he added. Oil prices maintained this week’s gains, with U.S crude futures trading at $61.74 per barrel, up 4.1 percent so far this week. Brent crude traded at $64.77 Elsewhere, virtual currency bitcoin recovered the $10,000 mark for the first time in two weeks, gaining more than 70 percent from its near three-month low of $5,920.7.

2018-02-16,"ABUJA, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The World Bank has approved a $486 million credit facility to Nigeria for electricity grid improvements, the lender said on Friday. “The investments under the Nigeria Electricity Transmission Project will increase the power transfer capacity of the transmission network and enable distribution companies to supply consumers with additional power,” the World Bank said. Nigeria’s dilapidated power sector is often criticised by economists for holding back the country’s economic growth. Businesses and households are subject to frequent blackouts, and many depend on their own generators that are expensive to run.

2018-02-16,"BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Worries about Air France-KLM’s ability to reduce costs sent the group’s shares down on Friday, after the company slightly missed profit and cost-cutting targets in 2017. Air France-KLM has lagged European rivals on cost-cutting efforts, especially at the Air France side of the business. With fuel prices set to rise this year, there is more pressure on airlines to keep a lid on spending. The Franco-Dutch group had set an initial target early last year to reduce unit costs by 1-1.5 percent, but tempered that late last year.  On Friday, it said unit costs were flat in 2017 as it reported an operating result of 1.488 billion euros (£1.32 billion). That was up 42 percent on 2016 but slightly missed the average analyst forecast for 1.53 billion euros in a company compiled consensus. It also reported a net loss of 274 million euros for 2017 due to a 1.4 billion-euro charge linked to a new pension deal for KLM pilots and cabin crew.  Air France-KLM said it was aiming for a reduction of 1-1.5 percent this year, excluding the impact of currency, fuel and pension charges. “Clearly, the similar target for 2017 was not achieved, and the headwinds in 2017 seem likely to persist in 2018,” Liberum analyst Gerald Khoo wrote in a note.  Air France-KLM shares started higher, but then turned negative. The stock was down 6 percent in early session trading, touching its lowest level in more than eight months, as concern about costs overshadowed the company’s positive comments on first-quarter ticket prices.  Bernstein analysts said the guidance was mixed and the cost reduction target was not enough to materially change the group’s cost base.  Adding to pressure on staff expenses, 10 Air France unions representing pilots, cabin crew and ground staff have called for a strike on Feb. 22 to support demands for a 6 percent pay rise. By comparison, easyJet and Ryanair both reduced unit costs excluding fuel by 1 percent in the quarter to the end of December, while Air France-KLM’s rose 1.7 percent in the same period. Like other major European airlines, Air France-KLM is benefiting from strong travel demand, while the collapse of Monarch and Air Berlin has removed some competition from the market, helping to ease pressure on ticket prices. Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said unit revenues were expected to be positive in the first quarter compared to last year and the group planned to increase the number of seats it offered on its main passenger networks this year.  “We will continue to grow network by network where there is demand, we will probably be more cautious on short-haul,” he told reporters, citing competition from high-speed trains in France.  Traditional rivals IAG and Lufthansa are due to report in the next few weeks.

2018-02-16,"NEW DELHI, Feb 16 (Reuters) - India needs to do more to attract foreign investment in technologies that can cut emissions from burning coal, a global coal trade association said on Friday, given that the fuel will be a main source of electricity in the country for decades. India, the world’s second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has set ambitious targets to raise the contribution of solar and wind power to its energy mix, though it has also said coal will maintain its dominance for at least the next 30 years due to its abundance and cost advantage. “India needs to step up and say we need support here,” Benjamin Sporton, chief executive at World Coal Association, told reporters in New Delhi. “We would like to see the government potentially say, ‘Look coal is going to be an important part of the economy for decades, and we need support to be reasonably self sufficient but also to get support for low emission coal technology that we need to use,’” Sporton said. India has already sought foreign funds to move towards ""clean coal"" - which can cut greenhouse gases emitted from burning coal by up to 30 percent - and Sporton said given India's resurgent demand for coal imports after two years of decline it needs to ask for financial support. (reut.rs/2EMFfo2) Earlier this week, the chief coal analyst at Noble Resources, a unit of commodities trader Noble Group, said global thermal coal demand will outpace supply in 2018, leading to a strong market driven by rising consumption from top buyers India and China. Coal India, the world’s largest coal miner, plans to increase its production to about one billion tonnes by 2022, but it has fallen short of its annual targets leading to higher imports by the country. Sporton said it was unclear whether the government’s push for solar energy would result in sustainable projects given sharp falls in power tariffs. “It’s now getting to the point where it’s quite difficult to make money out of investing in solar,” Sporton said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government aims to raise solar power generation capacity nearly 30 times to 100 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. India will need at least $125 billion to fund its plan to increase the share of renewable power supply in the energy mix, which is proving to be challenging. A coal ministry spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

2018-02-16,"* Core earnings excluding exceptional items at 763 mln euros * Fourth quarter net profit far ahead of market consensus * Firms sees 2018 influenced by less favourable oil market (Adds share jump, net profit figure) By Anthony Deutsch AMSTERDAM, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Vopak on Friday said core earnings excluding exceptional items fell 7 percent in 2017 to 763 million euros ($957 million), but the Dutch oil and chemical storage company still beat forecasts and its shares rose sharply. Analysts polled for Reuters had on average expected earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), including joint ventures, to fall 9 percent to 746 million euros. The full-year results were lifted by a stronger-than-anticipated fourth quarter, which benefited from favourable currency movements and terminal performance, said Chief Financial Officer Gerard Paulides. Fourth-quarter net profit attributable to shareholders rose 7 percent to 76 million, beating market consensus for an 18 percent fall to 58.6 million. Vopak’s shares jumped more than 15 percent to the highest level since Aug. 17. Vopak did not provide the usual EBITDA guidance, but said it expected its 2018 results to be influenced by “the currently less favourable oil market structure, impacting occupancy rates and price levels in the hub locations.” The company is in the process of adjusting its terminal portfolio, divesting some assets, while adding 3.1 million cubic meters of new capacity, which is expected to lift results from 2019. “We have confidence towards 2019, and 2018 will play out as it plays out,” Paulides said in an interview. For 2017, Vopak booked exceptional losses before financing costs and taxation of 68 million euros, compared with a one-off gain of 201 million euros in 2016. The loss was mainly caused by impairments at two joint- venture terminals in Estonia and China, which was slightly offset by a gain on the sale of the Vopak Terminal Eemshaven. $1 = 0.7973 euros

2018-02-16,"* State of nation address due at 1700 GMT * Eyes on new team and programme, especially on economy * Markets have rallied since Ramaphosa became ANC leader By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 16 (Reuters) - South Africa’s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to give more details about how he plans to tackle corruption and boost economic growth on Friday, when he delivers his first state of the nation address. Ramaphosa was sworn in as head of state on Thursday after his scandal-plagued predecessor, Jacob Zuma, reluctantly resigned on orders of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). His election as president, which was unopposed in the parliament, has prompted a wave of optimism among South Africans hungry for change after nine years of economic stagnation and corruption scandals under Zuma. Zuma denies all wrongdoing. “It’s all systems go. We are expecting our political programme to be delivered by the new president,” parliamentary speaker Baleka Mbete told state broadcaster SABC from Cape Town, where the state of the nation address will be made from around 1700 GMT. Ramaphosa, who will see out the remainder of Zuma’s presidential term until elections next year, faces an uphill battle to win public and investor support. Africa’s most developed economy needs faster economic growth if it is to reduce high unemployment - currently at 27 percent - and alleviate widespread poverty that has persisted since the end of white minority rule in 1994. The economy slipped into recession last year for the first time since 2009 and has also declined in indices that measure corruption and the ease of doing business. Financial markets have rallied since Ramaphosa took over from Zuma as ANC leader in December, as investors warmed to his pledges to straighten out the country’s struggling state-owned enterprises and woo overseas investment. South Africa’s rand extended recent gains early on Friday. Ramaphosa, a former union leader who played an important role in talks to end apartheid, is expected to announce major cabinet changes in the coming days to replace Zuma acolytes in key portfolios who have been accused of mismanagement and implicated in corruption. Ordinary South Africans are hopeful that he will deliver on promises to create more jobs.

2018-02-16,"* Long French nuclear outages weigh on core earnings * 2018 rebound seen but 2019 nuclear output seen lower again * One million customers lost in 2018 to sharp competition * EDF shares climb more than 5 percent (Adds quotes, detail, market opening) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - EDF’s 2017 core earnings fell 16.3 percent as the French utility struggled with nuclear reactor outages and lost a million customers, but its chief executive said he expected a rebound this year. Last year, EDF suffered extended unplanned outages as well as longer-than-expected maintenance outages at several of its 58 nuclear reactors in France, while the nuclear regulator ordered its four reactors in Tricastin, southern France, shut down for months for safety reasons. The outages led to a 21 percent drop in French electricity generation income to 4.8 billion euros, as nuclear power generation fell to 379 terawatthours (TWh), well below its initial target of 390-400 TWh. When all its reactors are up an running, EDF can produce up to 420 TWH per year. For this year, EDF forecasts output of at least 395 TWH. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said market conditions had been difficult in nearly all the firm’s business lines, but forecast improvement this year. “2018 will be the year of the rebound,” he said on an earnings call on Friday. Levy’s comments helped lift EDF shares more than 5 percent in early trading before easing back slightly. However, Levy warned that nuclear output would be lower again in 2019, when its Fessenheim nuclear plant will be permanently closed and its new reactor in Flamanville will still be ramping up to full production. Next year will also see several large-scale maintenance outages, he added. French 2017 hydropower output was down 12 percent to 37 TWh. Heightened competition from companies like Direct Energie , Engie  and new market entrant Total further eroded EDF’s market share to 85.5 percent of consumption and put margins under pressure. EDF said it will cut its retail costs in response and will launch new price offers, notably for green power. EDF said its 2017 revenue fell 2.2 percent to 69.6 billion euros, core EBITDA earnings fell 16.3 percent to 13.7 billion euros ($17.18 billion), while net profit rose 11.3 percent to 3.17 billion euros thanks to capital gains on asset disposals, notably the sale of part of its grid unit RTE. Core earnings in the United Kingdom fell 33 percent to 1.03 billion euros due to lower nuclear power sales prices. Only EDF’s Italian unit Edison saw earnings rise strongly, up 42 percent to 910 million due to higher power prices and a better performance of its gas-fired generation fleet. $1 = 0.7973 euros

2018-02-16,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gas giant Gazprom is demanding big discounts from Russian pipeline suppliers for its major projects, industry sources told Reuters, following the emergence of a producer charging significantly lower prices. In a move likely to shake up the pipe and metals sectors, the Kremlin-controlled Gazprom is seeking the discounts - put by the sources at 20 percent - as it tries to limit investment spending that is due to peak in the next two years. Gazprom is involved in three international gas pipeline projects. It is already building TurkStream to Turkey and Power of Siberia to supply China, and is preparing for the Nord Stream 2 link to Europe. Its average annual investments to 2035 are planned at 1 trillion roubles (£12.25 billion), reaching their highest point between 2018 and 2020. Trying to stand up to Gazprom, a major client which has a de facto monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, appears hopeless, sources at the producers said. “You can’t say no to Gazprom,” one told Reuters. Gazprom’s demands for discounts concern large diameter pipes (LDP), a market which is currently oversupplied, one source at a pipe producer and a Gazprom source said.  “We looked at the market and decided that we were paying above the market price. We wanted to discuss this with the pipemakers,” the Gazprom source said. LDP pipes - those with a diameter of 53 centimetres or more -   constitute over 90 percent of Gazprom’s pipe purchases. According to Gazprom’s report for the first half of 2017, it bought them almost entirely from four Russian firms - steelmakers OMK and Severstal, plus specialist pipemakers ChelPipe and TMK which buy in steel. Talks are still underway between Gazprom and the LDP producers, another source at a pipe maker and the Gazprom source said, on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to talk to the press.  The press departments of TMK, OMK and ChelPipe declined requests for comment. Gazprom did not respond.  Severstal, which supplied a quarter of Gazprom’s LDP needs in the first half of last year, said it was continuing to make and deliver pipes from its factory in St Petersburg following negotiations with Gazprom. “We held talks and agreed the main parameters of our cooperation. We have contractual obligations, which meant production at our Izhora plant did not stop,” a company spokeswoman said.   Gazprom’s hand appears to have been further strengthened by the fact that it has already bought many of the pipes needed for Power of Siberia and TurkStream, with the bulk of investment spending channelled into other project costs. Its insistence on a different deal for the pipes it still requires for the Russian domestic link to Nord Stream 2, follows the arrival on the scene of a newcomer, ZTZ, industry sources said.  ZTZ, which produced its first pipe only two years ago, says it has offered prices between 13 percent and 30 percent lower than its competitors. “Our colleagues need to justify their artificially high prices to their client,” a company spokesman said, adding that it was buying steel “at a more optimal price”. ZTZ is ramping up production at its plant near Moscow just as domestic demand for LDP is falling. Last year it dropped 19 percent to 1.7 million tonnes, according to the Foundation for Development of the Tube Industry, a lobby group. In 2017 ZTZ injected 146,000 tonnes of LDP into the market, while the quartet of established producers had to run their factories at less than half capacity. Demand is expected to fall a further 2 percent this year, the lobby group said, as a number of major projects such as the Southern Corridor - a 2,500 km (1,500 mile) domestic link to TurkStream - were wrapped up in 2017. Meanwhile, ZTZ said it expects to raise production to 550,000 tonnes this year. ZTZ is a private company whose shareholders are not disclosed. It is headed by Denis Safin, 37. “This is a buyers’ market. If the buyer can push down prices by 20 percent... companies will have to survive with a very low level of profitability,” Boris Krasnojenov, head of metals and mining research at Alfa Bank, said.  Apart from the large investment programme, Gazprom’s costs could be further under pressure from external factors, particularly with the Nord Stream 2 which is due to run under the Baltic to Germany. Denmark has passed a law that could allow it to ban the pipeline from its waters and a new U.S. law imposing more sanctions on Russia could also complicate the $11 billion project.  Russian steelmakers ramped up production in 2017, making the most of rising prices and demand after a two-year downturn, expecting a further increase in the domestic consumption this year helped by an economic recovery.  If the discounts with Gazprom are finalised, the pipe producers will try to reduce costs to protect their margins, analysts say, with the specialists likely to seek discounts in turn from their steel suppliers.  For TMK, for example, Russia business makes up around 15 to 20 percent of its core earnings (EBITDA), Nikolay Sosnovskiy, director of metals and mining at Prosperity Capital, said. TMK also has operations in the United States, Europe and Middle East.  “Obviously such sharp fluctuations in the price are a big deal, especially if the company doesn’t change its cost structure. They’re unlikely to just accept the discount as it is,” Sosnovskiy said.   One of the sources at a pipe company said that his firm had already started negotiations with its steel suppliers over a discount, following Gazprom’s demands. Another source confirmed that pipe producers have turned to their steel suppliers to find a way to pass the discount down the supply chain.  “Pipemakers are profitable, so this is not a tragedy for them,” a leading figure in the pipe industry said. “But when you are squeezed, hard... everything will come down to individuals’ talent for business. Overall, it will have a positive effect on the industry. It’s a signal - time to start sweating.

U.S. debt yields rose near multi-year highs. Two-year note yields hit a 9 1/2-year high as bond prices fell on Federal Reserve officials’ signalling that recent volatility in U.S. stocks would not stop them raising interest rates in March. European shares are expected to rise 0.3 to 0.4 percent at the opening, according to spread-betters. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, though many Asian markets were closed on Friday for the Lunar New year. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.2 percent, with investors relieved to see the government appoint Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for another term, suggesting the central bank will be in no rush to dial back its massive stimulus programme. Measured by the MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stocks covering 47 markets, global shares have now reclaimed more than half of the 10.7 percent plunge from a record intraday high on Jan. 29 to a four-month intraday low a week ago. Investors have been reassured by a fall in the Wall Street Vix index, the “fear gauge” that measures the one-month implied volatility of U.S. stocks. The index dropped below 20 for the first time since its spike to 2 1/2-year high of 50.3 last week, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who bet equity markets would be stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation. The Vix futures  fell back to more normal patterns, from the past several days of so-called backwardation, in which the front-month contract becomes the most expensive. The return of a more usual curve suggested that the loss-cutting and position unwinding of  “volatility short” strategies had run its course for now, easing investors’ nerves. “I’ve said markets will be unstable until February, and that February will offer a good buying opportunity,” said Eiji Kinouchi, chief technical analyst at Daiwa Securities, noting that U.S investors were likely to book profits in January to take advantage of lower tax on capital gains. The selling appears to have run its course and the fall in volatilities, both implied and actual, is likely to prompt investors to return to stocks, he said. The U.S. dollar, on the other hand, slipped below its January low against a basket of major currencies to reach its lowest since late 2014. The dollar index fell to as low as 88.37, and was on course to lose over 2 percent for the week, its biggest such loss in two years. There is no strong consensus yet on what is driving the dollar’s persistent weakness, especially in light of rising yields. Some say it simply reflects a return of risk appetite and a shift to higher-yielding currencies, including many emerging market ones. But others cite concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy as well as talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar. There are also worries President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and fiscal spending could stoke inflation and erode the value of the dollar. “His protectionist policies could also fan inflation. Markets appear to have calmed down for now but fundamentally it is different from last year,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything,” he added. The euro rose to $1.2556, its highest since December 2014. Having risen 2.37 percent so far this week, it could post its biggest weekly gain in nine months. The dollar dropped to 105.545 yen, its lowest level since November 2016 and down 2.8 percent for the week, which would be the biggest in a year and a half. The South African rand hit a three-year high of 11.6025 to the dollar on Thursday on hopes the resignation of President Jacob Zuma had paved the way for new leaders to speed up economic growth. The dollar’s fall came even as U.S. bond yields remained near a multi-year high. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a four-year peak of 2.944 percent on Thursday and last stood at 2.910 percent. Shorter-dated yields also rose as investors grew convinced that the correction in stock prices in recent weeks would not prevent the Fed from raising interest rates in March and twice more this year. Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester said on Tuesday the recent stock market sell-off and jump in volatility will not damage the economy’s overall strong prospects. Mester is being considered a leading candidate for the Fed’s Vice Chair. The two-year yield rose to as high as 2.213 percent, its highest since Sept 2008, on Thursday and last stood at 2.210 percent. Oil prices maintained this week’s gains, with U.S crude futures trading at $61.65 per barrel, up 4.1 percent so far this week. Elsewhere, virtual currency bitcoin recovered the $10,000 mark for the first time in two weeks, gaining more than 70 percent from its near three-month low of $5,920.7, before easing back a tad to $9,925.

2018-02-16,"PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - French utility EDF said its 2017 core earnings fell 16.3 percent to 13.7 billion euros ($17.18 billion), from 16.4 billion euros in 2016, due to lower-than expected nuclear production caused by reactor outages. Revenue was down 2.2 percent to 69.6 billion euros while net profit rose 11.3 percent to 3.17 billion euros thanks to capital gains on asset disposals, notably the sale of part of its grid unit RTE. A Reuters poll of 14 analysts had forecast median earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 13.8 billion euros and revenue of 68.3 billion euros. EDF CEO Jean-Bernard Levy said on a call that 2018 would be the year of the rebound for EDF. EDF forecast French nuclear output of at least 395 terawatt-hours in 2018, compared to 379.1 TWh in 2017. Levy said 2019 output will be lower again because the closure of its Fessenheim nuclear plant will not be fully compensated by its new Flamanville plant, which will be ramping up in 2019.

2018-02-16,"BERLIN/PARIS, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Air France-KLM expects ticket prices to be positive in the first quarter of this year and will offer more seats on routes to Asia and Latin America to meet demand, although competition from high-speed trains was biting in France. The Franco-Dutch airline reported on Friday an operating result of 1.488 billion euros ($1.87 billion), up 42 percent but slightly missing the average analyst forecast for 1.53 billion euros in a company compiled consensus. The group reported a net loss of 274 million euros for 2017 due to a 1.4 billion euro charge linked to a new pension deal for KLM pilots and cabin crew. Like other major European airlines, the Franco-Dutch carrier benefited from low oil prices and strong travel demand last year, while the collapse of Monarch and Air Berlin has removed some competition from the market. Air France-KLM is also benefiting from a return of travellers from Asia and Latin America. It plans to increase capacity by 3-4 percent overall on its main passenger network this year. “We have been helped by the good environment,” Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said, adding Air France-KLM’s increase in profit was also helped by stable unit costs. The group had set an initial target early last year to reduce unit costs by 1-1.5 percent, but added caveats to that at its third-quarter results. It said it was aiming for a reduction of 1-1.5 percent this year, excluding the impact of currency, fuel and pension charges. Gagey said forward-bookings on long-haul flights were up 1 percentage point in February, up 4 percentage points in March, down 1 percentage point in April because of Easter, and up 2 percent for May. Analysts expect Air France-KLM to come under pressure from rising fuel costs this year, and expansion of low-cost rivals in Paris and Amsterdam. It will also have to negotiate increased pressure on labour costs, with unions having called for a strike on Feb 22 to support demands for a 6 percent pay increase. Gagey said unit revenues in the domestic market in France had come under pressure from new high-speed train routes to Bordeaux and that the group was closely watching the development of new low-cost players. “But it seems that launching low-cost long-haul flights without connecting services is challenging,” Gagey said, pointing to Norwegian Air Shuttle, which on Thursday reported a bigger than expected loss for the last quarter of 2017. Traditional rivals IAG and Lufthansa are due to report over the next few weeks. $1 = 0.7972 euros

2018-02-16,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When a Mexican real estate investment trust bought four hotels along the country’s Gulf coast operating under the Marriott, Quality Inn and Fiesta Inn brands, it expected the government’s recent energy reform to attract droves of oil executives, engineers and technicians. Instead, FibraHotel’s properties in Ciudad del Carmen and Villahermosa and an earlier purchase in Coatzacoalcos, like many along the Gulf, are pinched for guests. President Enrique Pena Nieto’s 2013-14 legislative overhaul of the energy sector, which broke a 75-year monopoly by state oil firm Pemex, had been expected to jumpstart the economy and revive the declining oil industry. It coincided, however, with a global collapse in oil prices that muted investors’ interest. Prices are now rebounding, and the government forecasts that some of the world’s largest oil companies will ultimately invest about $150 billion in Mexico if they succeed in extraction efforts. But experts say the promised growth could still be several years coming. In the hardest-hit oil towns, hotel occupancy rates have fallen by as much as half, said real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle, with some in the region operating with barely a third of their rooms full.  Hotels in Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz state registered 36 percent occupancy last year. The state’s main port, Veracruz, and the neighboring Boca del Rio area fared a little better with 43 percent, as did Villahermosa in neighboring Tabasco state.   That is well below the booming rates seen last year in tourist hotspots such as Cancun and Riviera Maya, the tourism ministry says, and lower than automobile manufacturing hubs such as Guadalajara and Leon. “It’s been weaker than in past years,” said Guillermo Bravo, head of FibraHotel’s corporate development. He declined to give occupancy figures for the Gulf Coast properties the company bought in 2012 and 2015. But he said they are below the average for the rest of its portfolio, which stretches across more than two dozen Mexican states. Now, the company says its best option is to wait.  “It wouldn’t be a good moment to sell,” Bravo said. Hotels typically need 40 percent occupancy to break even, according to Christian Lega, a director of tourism at real estate services firm CBRE Hotels. While hotel owners and operators on the Gulf were reluctant to provide specific figures, several acknowledged the falling occupancy.  A source familiar with Hyatt Place in Ciudad del Carmen, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the property is about a third full and recently closed some of its rooms. Hyatt declined to provide current data, but said Ciudad del Carmen hotels had 80 percent occupancy in 2014. That is in line with other cities in the area in the years before oil prices plummeted. Hoteles City Express, which says 13 percent of its Mexico portfolio is largely reliant on the energy industry, has seen its Gulf Coast occupancy rates slip since 2015. Spokeswoman Blanca Herrera said the company is targeting other business sectors and leisure travelers in the area. Hotels are faced with slashing costs to break even and, in the most dire cases, could risk losing partnerships with prestigious brands such as Hyatt, Marriott and Holiday Inn, Lega said. Hotel brands typically agree to emblazon their names on properties if they expect 60 percent occupancy, Lega said. Lower levels can pose a risk to their reputations. Hotels in major oil towns are operating well below that level, according to tourism ministry data compiled by Jones Lang LaSalle. “They thought the energy reform would generate investment much sooner,” Lega said.  FibraHotel recently changed one of its Ciudad del Carmen sites from a Courtyard Marriott to a Fiesta Inn, matching the brand of its other nearby properties. “Running both hotels under one operator gave us more synergies and economies of scale,” Bravo said, adding that it was not Marriott’s decision.      A spokesperson for Marriott International Inc did not respond to a request for comment.  Although many in the sector are hopeful that hotels will again fill with oil workers as firms that won contracts in Mexico’s early auctions begin deploying staff, Gulf Coast hoteliers worry travelers will be deterred by the country’s worst ever surge in violent crime.  “There’s the perception that we’re always in fear,” said Esteban Enriquez Espana, president of the Coatzacoalcos hotel and motel association in Veracruz, the state with the fifth highest number of murders in Mexico last year.      “It’s a problem that’s gotten out of control,” he said.

U.S. debt yields stood near multi-year highs. Two-year note yields hit a 9 1/2-year high as bond prices fell on Federal Reserve officials’ signalling that recent volatility in U.S. stocks would not stop them raising interest rates in March.

NYMEX crude for March delivery was up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $61.50 a barrel by 0200 GMT, after settling up 74 cents on Thursday. For the week, the contract has risen nearly 4 percent after losing nearly 10 percent last week. London Brent crude was up 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $64.59 after settling down 3 cents. Brent is up nearly 3 percent for the week after falling more than 8 percent last week. “Oil is getting support from a rebound in global stock markets and a weak dollar, but the upside is limited due to a projection for rising U.S. production,” said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. “The market is quiet due to a slew of holidays in Asia.” The dollar languished near a three-year low against a basket of currencies on Friday, headed for its biggest weekly loss in two years. A weaker dollar often boosts prices for oil and other dollar-denominated commodities. Asian shares extended their recovery from two-month lows into a fifth day on Friday as Wall Street’s market volatility gauge fell, although Chinese and most Southeast Asian financial markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia aim to draft an agreement on a long-term alliance by the end of this year, United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail al-Mazroui said on Thursday. OPEC and non-OPEC producers including Russia have been restraining production by a total 1.8 million barrels per day in a bid to prop up prices under a deal that is to expire at the end of 2018. The move comes at a time when Asian demand is on the rise. India imported a record 4.93 million bpd in January to feed its expanded refining capacity and meet rising demand, data showed. Oil won support earlier in the week after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC hopes to keep limiting crude output to leave the market tight. However, surging U.S. production is offsetting OPEC’s efforts to curb supplies. U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia.

2018-02-16,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - An EU decision to curb palm oil imports was the last thing Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak needed ahead of a coming election, with rural voters already aggrieved over financial scandals at state-owned palm oil agency Felda. Around 10 percent of Malaysia’s 30 million people belong to families who own smallholdings dedicated to harvesting palm oil, and they account for the majority of voters in nearly a quarter of the national assembly’s 222 seats. Girding for a general election due by August, Najib was given a taste of the discontent rife in the countryside when hundreds of farmers flocked to Kuala Lumpur last month to protest a pending EU move to phase out the use of palm oil in biofuel. “I will not support the government if they don’t resolve this issue,” said Abdul Rahman, a farmer who runs a smallholding in Negeri Sembilan, a state an hour’s drive south of the capital.  “The failure and inexperience of the government led to the EU’s boycott of our palm oil,” hen told Reuters.  Najib can ill-afford to lose votes from Malays in rural areas that have hitherto been a rock-solid votebank for the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the party that has led every multi-ethnic coalition since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule in 1957.  Aged 92, and having stood down in 2003 as Malaysia’s longest serving premier, Mahathir Mohamad has come out of retirement to lead the campaign against his one-time protege Najib, having forged an unlikely alliance with jailed opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. Malays’ loyalty to UMNO has been tested by the steady flow of stories over the past three years about 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), a state investment firm whose funds, critics say, were used by Najib to boost his campaign for the 2013 election, which he narrowly won  while losing the popular vote to an opposition bloc led by Anwar.      Najib, who chaired 1MDB’s advisory board until it was dissolved in 2016, has consistently denied any wrongdoing over the billions of dollars lost by the fund, but an ongoing kleptocracy investigation into 1MDB in the United States - the biggest mounted by Department of Justice - has kept on the frontburner. To cement authority and protect himself, analysts say Najib needs to lead UMNO to a convincing victory. The 1MDB controversy has damaged Najib’s standing more among urban Malays, but over the past year rural Malays have found their own reasons to be upset.  Malaysia’s 650,000 smallholders, who cultivate 40 percent of acreage dedicated to palm, fear they will bear the brunt of the EU ban, which William Simadiputra, an analyst at DBS Vickers, reckons could cost Malaysia about $500 million annually in export revenue. Malaysia’s plantations minister Mah Siew Keong told Reuters the government is working on expanding export markets to other non-traditonal palm buyers like Iran, Vietnam and Japan in a bid to shore up demand.  But the government’s threat of retaliatory trade measures against the EU has been scorned by critics, who say it will lead to further loss of palm oil business to competitors. “By saying you will ban EU imports you are just pushing away the palm oil business to Indonesia,” said Wong Chen, a lawmaker with the opposition Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) party. Malaysia hasn’t given up trying to persuade the EU to think again, raising its objections with a visiting French defence minister last month. France is hoping to sell Malaysia fighter jets worth about $2 billion. Smallholders have seen monthly incomes drop as low as 1,000-2,000 ringgit ($256.81-$513.61) when palm prices were low, forcing many into debt over the years. And when allegations of corruption surfaced last year at the Federal Land Development Authority (Felda), a state plantation agency founded to alleviate rural poverty, the government came under fire in the small towns and villages that make up the Malay heartland. Many of Felda’s 112,000 settlers took loans to invest in Felda Global Ventures, a listed unit of Felda that raised $3 bln when it was launched in 2012 and has since seen its share price plunge by 60 percent. FGV’s chairman was forced to quit last year, and its chief executive was suspended for four months during a government probe into suspicious transactions at a subsidiary. He later resumed his role.  Najib moved to appease Felda settlers last July with cash handouts, subsidies and debt waivers totalling nearly 1.5 billion ringgit ($383 million).  “The game is to constantly keep the palm planters happy,” said PKR’s Wong Chen.     But they are far from happy. The controversies at FGV have barely abated. Critics say it overpaid buying assets, notably the $505 million purchase of a 37 percent stake in an Indonesian palm oil firm. Questions have also been raised last month over a Felda land deal in Kuala Lumpur, which allegedly points to criminal fraud. Felda did not reply to a request for comment.  But, on this most recent land deal scandal, Najib said in a blog post that the government would “ensure the interests of Felda and the settlers are not compromised”.  However, this core constituency’s patience with the government may have run out. “These issues have raised anger among the settlers,” said  Mazlan Aliman, president of the National Felda Settlers’ Children Society (ANAK). “They see the government is not serious in addressing these issues, but instead try to cover up.” “The damage that has been done is too big. It will influence the mood of voters in the upcoming elections, especially in Felda areas,” said Mazlan.

2018-02-16,"* Shares extend recovery as volatility gauges drop * Fall in Vix futures suggest position unwinding over for now * Dollar broadly weak as Trump’s policy seen stoking inflation By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Asian shares extended their recovery from two-month lows into a  fifth day on Friday as the Wall Street market volatility gauge fell, while the U.S. dollar was undermined by various worries including rising inflation. U.S. debt yields stood near multi-year highs. Two-year note yields hit a 9 1/2-year high as bond prices fell on Federal Reserve officials’ signalling that recent volatility in U.S. stocks would not stop them raising interest rates in March. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, though many Asian markets will be closed on Friday for the Lunar New year. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent. Measured by the MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stocks covering 47 markets, global shares have reclaimed more than half of the 10.7 percent losses incurred in their slump from a record intraday high on Jan 29 to their four-month intraday low hit a week ago. Investors were reassured by a fall in the Wall Street Vix index, the “fear gauge” that measures the one-month implied volatility of U.S. stocks. The index dropped below 20 for the first time since its spike to 2 1/2-year high of 50.3 last week, a jump that caused massive losses among investors who bet equity markets would be stable on a combination of solid economic growth and moderate inflation. Vix futures prices fell back to more normal patterns, suggesting that the loss-cutting and position unwinding of “volatility short” strategies had run its course for now, easing investors’ nerves. The U.S. dollar, on the other hand was fragile, with its index against a basket of major currencies on the verge of sliding to the lowest since late 2014. The dollar index stood at 88.58, just above its three-year low of 88.429 set on Jan. 25. While there is no strong consensus yet on what is driving the dollar’s weakness, many point to worries President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and fiscal spending could stoke future inflation and erode the value of the dollar. “His protectionist policies could also fan inflation. Markets appear to have calmed down for now but fundamentally it is different from last year,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “You could say that right now, rather than stocks rising around the world, it is the dollar falling against almost everything,” he added. The euro fetched $1.2496, just shy of a 3-year high of $1.2538 hit on Jan. 25. The dollar changed hands at 106.11 yen, after having fallen to as low as 106.03 on Feb 15, its lowest level since November 2016. The South African rand hit a three-year high of 11.6025 to the dollar on Thursday on hopes the resignation of President Jacob Zuma had paved the way for new leaders to speed up economic growth.

2018-02-16,"MEXICO CITY, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Mexico’s foreign minister will travel to Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia in March, a Mexican official said on Thursday, as part of efforts to erode Venezuela’s oil-based influence in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, Cuban diplomats will visit Mexico in March to discuss the regional impact of the crisis in Venezuela, the official said. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City said the trip was not yet confirmed but that the two countries have regular bilateral meetings. Still, there are no signs that Cuba, a steadfast ally of Caracas, is ready to turn its back on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray’s planned trip follows a visit to Latin America and the Caribbean earlier this month by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who announced plans to study how possible oil sanctions against Venezuela could be mitigated in the Caribbean. The Mexican foreign minister’s trip represents the latest development in U.S.-led pressure on Maduro, who retains loyalty from some Caribbean nations that have long benefited from Caracas’ oil largess and have been unwilling to shun the country in regional diplomatic efforts. “The message is: Venezuela is not the only country that can help (Caribbean nations), that if there’s a crisis in Venezuela, they have more friends,” said the Mexican official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the as-yet undisclosed trip. The Mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The foreign ministries of Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Lucia could not be reached for comment. Videgaray has led Mexico’s efforts to try and improve cooperation with its top trade partner on security, immigration, and foreign policy, hoping to convince the United States to take a softer stance on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that underpins the majority of Mexican exports. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to quit the pact if it cannot be improved to benefit U.S. workers. On his way to Jamaica, Tillerson said the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil, adding that Canada, Mexico and the United States were studying how to mitigate the impact of such a move. Restrictions on Venezuela’s oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member, which is gripped by severe shortages of food and medicine. Such sanctions could also hurt U.S. refineries that process Venezuelan oil. Sanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro’s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. In a June meeting in Cancun, foreign ministers from the 34-nation Organization of American States (OAS) failed to reach agreement on a resolution criticizing Venezuela, with only 20 countries backing the proposal, shy of the 23-nation threshold. Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica voted against the resolution, while Grenada, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua and Barbuda abstained. Jamaica and Saint Lucia backed the proposal. Officials from other Caribbean nations will be present at Videgaray’s Jamaican stop, the Mexican official said, adding that the Caribbean trip represents an attempt to end the stalemate in the June OAS meeting. “It’s a result of Cancun,” the official said. “There was a bloc in the Caribbean that wasn’t pulling in the same direction as the OAS.” Reuters reported last year that Mexico was looking at the possibility of replacing Venezuela’s Petrocaribe program that provided cheap loans for oil to Caribbean nations - and has helped Maduro retain diplomatic support in the region. However, the Mexican official said it was still not clear how Mexico could furnish Caribbean nations with cheap energy, given the country’s struggling domestic fuel production, and that Mexico relies on oil income for about a fifth of the government budget. The energy ministry remains unconvinced by the oil diplomacy plan, led by Videgaray, but there are signs it is becoming more flexible, the official said.

2018-02-16,"TOKYO, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Friday as the dollar languished near a three-year low, with Asian trade likely to be subdued as many markets are closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. NYMEX crude for March delivery was up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $61.45 a barrel by 0101 GMT, after settling up 74 cents on Thursday. For the week, the contract has risen nearly 4 percent after losing nearly 10 percent last week. London Brent crude was up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $64.57 after settling down 3 cents. Brent is up nearly 3 percent for the week after falling more than 8 percent last week. Oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia aim to draft an agreement on a long-term alliance by the end of this year, United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail al-Mazroui said. OPEC and non-OPEC producers are restraining production by a total 1.8 million barrels per day to prop up prices under a deal that is to expire at the end of 2018. The move comes at a time when Asian demand is on the rise. India imported a record 4.93 million bpd in January to feed its expanded refining capacity and meet rising demand, data showed.
