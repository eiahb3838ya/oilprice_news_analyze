2018-05-31,"NEW YORK/LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Global oil markets have been roiled by a surprising divergence between the world’s major benchmarks, Brent crude and its U.S. counterpart, which in recent days have traded at odds with one another, wrongfooting investors betting on the exact opposite. Traders worldwide have been struggling to make sense of where oil prices are headed, juggling countervailing signals from major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia on the path for future OPEC supply, against renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela’s ongoing economic crisis. The market expected OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, to add to global supplies as sanctions reduce Iranian exports in coming months. But instead of bringing Brent closer in line with U.S. crude, the opposite has happened, roiling both futures trading and key physical grades. On Thursday, U.S. crude futures traded as much as $11 below Brent, the deepest discount since early 2015. Traders say the tide of light sweet crude from the United States is threatening to swamp the global market. That whipsawed traders in the last several days, as hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude in the week ended May 22 - while cutting long bets on Brent, the opposite of what has ended up happening. “The market doesn’t know where the price of oil is going to be and probably doesn’t know where it should be, and so it’s open to some major price fluctuations,” said Richard Hastings, an independent analyst in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S. exports reached record highs of over 2.6 million barrels a day this month, as cargoes of light, sweet shale have muscled into refineries around the world, from China to northwest Europe. Around the Atlantic Basin, Angolan and Nigerian crudes, both staples for Chinese and Indian refineries, are now selling slowly, undercut by U.S.-linked grades, traders said. A swathe of maintenance at some of Asia’s large refineries means big buyers are not pushed to take cargoes of crude right now and can afford to be choosy, when so much is on offer. Independent Chinese refineries, known as teapots, have even started reselling cargoes of West African crude to buy cheaper Brazilian or U.S. oil, according to traders. U.S. crude futures are being pulled down, in part, by the oil glut in the Permian shale basin, which currently produces more than 3 million barrels a day - nearly one-third of U.S. crude production, which hit a new record of 10.5 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Department data released on Thursday. “This was inevitable. There was way too much production growth for infrastructure to handle,” said Vikas Dwivedi, global oil and gas strategist at Macquarie in Houston. Physical prices for these trapped crude grades such as WTI at Midland WTC-WTM are now at their weakest levels in three-and-a-half years, trading as much as $13 below benchmark U.S. futures. That translates to a $23 to $25 discount to Brent. But coastal U.S. grades are trading at multi-year highs, illustrating the demand globally for U.S. barrels. Coastal sour Mars WTC-MRS traded at its strongest differential in more than three years on Thursday, while prices for coastal benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet WTC-LLS were at their strongest differential in more than three years on Thursday. LLS traded on Thursday at $9 more than U.S. futures - making it nearly comparable to Brent crude. The European market has seen a sudden increase in the amount of crude stored on ships, often a sign of an oversupplied market, and that has pushed the North Sea grades that underpin the Brent price to multi-month lows, another reason the Brent futures price should have aligned itself more closely with U.S. crude.

2018-05-31,"RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil showed signs of returning to normal on Thursday as an oil workers union ended a strike ahead of schedule and an 11-day trucker protest wound down, a welcome breather for a government suffering from rock-bottom approval levels. Oil workers union FUP unexpectedly recommended on Thursday that members suspend a 72-hour strike they began on Wednesday after a court said the organisation would be fined if it continued. Meanwhile, the truckers protest, which has strangled much of Brazil’s economy for 11 days, petered out. Brazil’s minister of institutional security, Sergio Etchegoyen, said all roadblocks had been removed, though isolated groups of truckers were still causing problems. The end of the strike is some rare good news for President Michel Temer, Brazil’s least popular president since its return to democracy in the 1980s. The protests - which were widely supported by Brazilians - had seen calls among some strikers and fringe groups for a military coup. Temer said this week that there was “zero chance” of such an intervention. It also provides some relief for state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, as it is commonly known.  Petrobras has been caught between workers and some politicians that want the company to roll back recent market-focused policies, and investors, who are fleeing on fears that it may undo those changes. Its shares have tumbled around 30 percent in the past two weeks. Petrobras chief executive Pedro Parente, who workers want to resign, is set to meet Temer on Friday morning. Petrobras said on Thursday that there was no impact on production due to the strike as its contingency plans were successful. Laborers were back on the job at 95 percent of the company’s units, the company added. Gasoline supplies, which had become short in recent weeks as transport routes were blocked, returned to normal at 70 percent of locations, Aurelio Amaral, a director of Brazil’s ANP oil regulator, told Reuters.  Santos, Latin America’s largest port, was now functioning, Admiral Ademir Sobrinho said in broadcast comments. But a representative from shipping firm Maersk Line Ltd said the port was still far from operating normally. “We have seen some critical imports being released from terminals in the Santos complex. Still, we expect Brazilian export volumes will continue to be seriously impacted for the next few weeks,” said Antonio Dominguez, managing director for the company’s East Coast South America cluster. At gas stations in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, lines remained long. Produce at supermarkets cost more than usual in some locations, even as supplies were returning to normal. Companies in the machinery industry were crafting plans with  workers for collective vacations, while others were planning layoffs, the head of the industry’s trade group, Jose Velloso, told Reuters late on Wednesday, as an inability to obtain supplies or deliver products hit virtually all firms in the sector. To win over the blockading truckers, who were primarily protesting high fuel prices, the government agreed to lower the average cost of fuel by 46 centavos ($0.12) per litre. To pay for the cuts, the government announced on Wednesday that it would slash a subsidy for exporters and reduce benefits for beverage makers operating in the Zona Franca low tax zone, which will hit companies such as Coca-Cola Femsa SAB de CV and Ambev SA. Beverage industry group ABIR criticised the move, although the rival Afrebras group, which tends to represent smaller-scale producers - many of them outside the Zona Franca - called the change long overdue. Those measures, along with other cost saving moves, will boost government coffers by 2.27 billion reais (458.74 million pounds), authorities said.

2018-05-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor concerns over U.S. trade policy overshadowed worries about political instability in Italy, driving equity prices  lower on Thursday.   Equity indexes around the world fell after the United States said it would impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union and Washington’s allies took steps to retaliate against U.S. goods. That helped deflate and, in many cases, erase earlier gains in financial markets from Chicago to Milan. The trade rift rippled through commodities, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 251.94 points, or 1.02 percent, to 24,415.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 18.74 points, or 0.69 percent, to 2,705.27 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 20.34 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,442.12. [.N] MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.24 percent after earlier gains. “We’re on a trajectory that could easily escalate to trade war,” said Angus Sippe, portfolio manager at Schroders plc (SDR.L). Aluminum MALTRC0 rose 1 percent to $2,292 a tonne after the United States said it was moving ahead with a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico. Soybean futures SN8 closed 0.4 percent lower at $10.18-1/2 per bushel amid worries that Mexico could target imports of the crop next if trade tensions escalate. Traders also worried about possible retaliation from China, the world’s biggest soy importer. China lashed out at renewed threats from the White House on trade and warned it was ready to fight back, days ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. And Mexico’s retaliatory tariffs on pork legs rattled livestock traders, sending U.S. lean hog futures LHN8 down 2.6 percent to 78.05 cents per pound. Mexico is the top export destination for U.S. pork by volume and bought 203,656 tonnes valued at $371.3 million from January to March, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation, an industry group. Markets had been wrestling this week with the implications of an Italian governing crisis, which sent its government bonds spiraling down earlier this week and hit the euro and other risk assets. But Italy’s two anti-establishment parties revived their coalition plans on Thursday, promising to end three months of political turmoil. That helped the euro, which climbed 0.25 percent to $1.169 after its biggest jump since early January on Wednesday EUR=. In oil markets, Brent crude LCOc1 prices hit their biggest premium to U.S. futures CLc1 in over three years as a lack of pipeline capacity in the United States has trapped output inland. Brent crude futures for August LCOv1 ended down 14 cents to $77.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate July crude CLc1 settled $1.17, or 1.7 percent, lower at $67.04 a barrel. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.851 percent.

2018-05-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday, despite a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories, while global benchmark Brent was little changed, pushing the spread between the two to its widest in more than three years. U.S. crude stockpiles fell 3.6 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, exceeding expectations for a decline of 525,000 barrels. Gasoline and diesel stocks rose, but the crude drawdown was a salve for recent losses in U.S. futures. [EIA/S] Brent crude losses were more limited, as the prospect that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will bring its supply-cut deal to a close by the end of the year has had a greater effect on the U.S. benchmark due to ongoing worries about U.S. infrastructure constraints.  “The market is concerned that in the longer term increases in oil production combined with refining problems and limited outbound pipeline capacity,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. U.S. crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year. In March, it jumped 215,000 bpd to 10.47 million bpd, a new monthly record, the EIA said on Thursday. Brent crude futures for August LCOv1 ended down 14 cents to $77.56 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate July crude CLc1 settled $1.17, or 1.7 percent, lower at $67.04 a barrel. At one point, the premium for Brent over WTI WTCLc1-LCOc1 surpassed $11 a barrel, the largest spread since March 2015. That spread has doubled in less than a month, as a lack of pipeline capacity in the United States has trapped a lot of output inland. “The Brent/WTI is blowing out. I think there must be what looks like some capitulation going on in the spread between those two contracts,” Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said. The wider premium makes U.S. crude exports more competitive than those linked to the Brent price, such as North Sea or West African grades of oil. Brent had hit a three-week low below $75 a barrel on Monday after OPEC and its allies, including Russia, indicated they could adjust their deal to curb supplies and increase production. OPEC and non-OPEC producers have committed to cut output by 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018 but are ready to make gradual supply adjustments to deal with shortages, a Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters late on Wednesday.  That news helped boost Brent as it suggests a slightly less committal approach to adding barrels to the market. Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia, the effective leader of OPEC, and Russia were discussing boosting output by about 1 million bpd to compensate for losses in supply from Venezuela and to address concerns about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian output. “The fact that we saw the Saudi/Russia announcement last week could have attracted some interest in narrowing the spread, given that we were looking for some of the geopolitical risk (in Brent) to be removed, but that’s been overtaken by the domestic widening in crude prices in the U.S.,” Hansen said. Prices for physical barrels of U.S. light sweet crude delivered at Midland are at their largest discount to the benchmark U.S. futures price in almost four years. Concerns about U.S. bottlenecks are contributing to the decline in U.S. futures as well.

2018-05-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automakers would no longer have to boost fuel economy for their U.S. fleets after 2020, and California would not be able to set stricter standards than the federal government under a proposal submitted to the White House by the Transportation Department, two sources said on Thursday. Sources confirmed details of a document posted on a government website confirming the department submitted the proposal to the Office of Management and Budget for review. Sources briefed on the matter said the proposal could be unveiled as early as next week. The rules, negotiated with automakers by former President Barack Obama’s administration in 2011, aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles per gallon by 2025 and included significant annual increases in automaker requirements. Automakers now want changes, citing lower gasoline prices and a shift in consumer preferences to larger vehicles. The sources said the proposed rule, to be made available for public comment, will include a series of alternatives but the preferred alternative will be to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. Advocates of stricter standards, designed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, criticized the Transportation Department proposal. U.S. Senator Tom Carper said a draft shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards. The lengthy proposal will assert that a 1975 federal law preempts states from imposing emissions rules. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Jahan Wilcox said the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly developed the rule and sent it to OMB. He declined further comment ahead of the review. The final proposal could be changed during the inter-agency review process. This month, California and 16 other states backing tougher rules filed suit to challenge the Trump administration’s April decision to announce plans to revise the rules.  Automakers at a May 11 meeting with President Donald Trump urged him to try to reach agreement with California. The following week, California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols met with administration officials. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said this week regulators “owe it to the American people to work with California and save the fuel economy standards.” After the Trump meeting, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra held a new round of meetings this month with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Honeywell International Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk also met earlier this month with Chao, the company confirmed. He discussed “next generation technologies, specifically mobile air conditioning refrigerants, that were innovated and are manufactured in the U.S. to help American automakers meet auto emission standards.” A person briefed on the NHTSA proposal said it will address impacts of fuel efficiency increases on the economy, auto industry, environment and safety and is expected to assert that the rollback will have significant economic benefits.

2018-05-31,"PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal have warned the United States that its decision to withdraw from the pact jeopardises Russian and Chinese efforts to limit Iran’s ability to develop atomic weapons, Western diplomats told Reuters. In pulling out of the 2015 deal, U.S. President Donald Trump triggered the revival of sanctions against the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), which oversees the Arak heavy water research reactor and the Fordow fuel enrichment plant. Under the deal, the Arak reactor was to be redesigned to render it unable to make bomb-grade plutonium under normal operation, while the Fordow plant was to stop enriching uranium and be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. The restoration of U.S. sanctions on AEOI would expose non-U.S. companies to the risk of punishment by the United States for dealing with it, including Chinese state-owned China National Nuclear Corp. and Russia’s Rosatom, which are doing nonproliferation work respectively at Arak and Fordow. Neither company responded to requests for comment. At a meeting in Vienna last Friday, the non-U.S. parties to the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran - discussed the subject extensively, with Beijing and Moscow stressing their concerns, three European diplomats said. One senior European diplomat called the situation “crazy” and said the U.S. withdrawal risked triggering a proliferation problem because its sanctions may halt work on Arak and Fordow. “It may force the interruption of the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear sites. It’s completely absurd,” the diplomat said. Iranian officials were not immediately available for comment. Asked how Washington planned to address the concerns about AEOI being sanctioned and how it would serve U.S. interests not to carry out the nonproliferation work at Arak and Fordow, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Ford said the U.S. was aware of the other parties’ positions regarding AEOI. “These questions are all under active consideration by the U.S. government,” he said in a statement relayed by a spokeswoman. “Our posture towards Iran will be geared towards obtaining enduring nonproliferation benefits and constraining the full range of its malign activities.” The 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers lifted international sanctions on Tehran. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities, increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so. Trump abandoned the agreement on May 8, arguing that he wanted a bigger deal that not only limited Iran’s atomic work but also reined in its support for proxies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon and that curbed its ballistic missile program. The remaining parties are trying to keep the deal alive. “Everyone is focused on preserving the economic side of the agreement,” said an EU diplomat. “But if the (remaining parties) fail on the nuclear side of implementation, while Iran is trying to comply, it would really be an irony.” The deal bars the production of enriched uranium at Fordow and says Russia will work with Iran there on producing stable isotopes, which do not pose a proliferation risk. On Arak, the deal specifies that the new design will aim to minimise the production of plutonium and to prevent the production of weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation. It also specifies the fuel Arak must use and says its spent fuel for the reactor’s lifetime must be shipped out of Iran.  Sanctions that would prevent companies from dealing with AEOI are due to be reimposed no later than Nov. 5.  The three European diplomats said Russia and China had been especially vocal at the Vienna meeting, with one saying that the two nations indicated they were determined to carry out the nuclear projects but stressed their worries on U.S. sanctions. Two other Western officials also confirmed that the subject was discussed at the meeting.  The U.S., which initially led a working group to redesign the Arak reactor with China, did not attend the Vienna talks. Beijing’s envoy to the talks told reporters on Friday that the parties needed to find a co-chair for Arak to move forward. Richard Nephew, a former administration official under then-U.S. President Barack Obama, said it was unlikely the U.S. would sanction state-owned Chinese or Russian companies for doing non-proliferation work with Iran, although it was a possibility. “The real problem is does this stop these countries and the companies from their work to render the Arak and Fordow facilities safer?” he said. “If it causes them to stop that work and gives Iran an excuse to restart Fordow or to rebuild Arak as a plutonium-production reactor, then we will have done real damage to our nonproliferation objectives.” Additional reporting by Alissa De Carbonnel in Brussels, Francois Murphy in Vienna, Christian Lowe in Moscow and David Stanway in Beijing; Writing by Arshad Mohammed and John Irish; Editing by Nick Tattersall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear/u-s-withdrawal-may-halt-nuclear-nonproliferation-work-in-iran-diplomats-idUKL5N1T17QN,31 May 2018,"* Sanctions on Iran agency could suspend work at Arak,

2018-05-31,"HAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Hamburg will uphold a city-center ban on older diesel cars until air quality improves or Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government enforces retrofits of emission-reducing technology, a senior local official said on Thursday. The ban only affects 580 meters of Hamburg’s Max-Brauer-Allee and 1.6 km of Stresemann Street but is significant because it is the first such move in Germany and because it could raise pressure on car makers to undertake costly retrofits. Jens Kerstan, senator for the environment in Hamburg, Germany’s second-largest city with a population of some 1.8 million, said the bans affecting diesel models that fail to meet the latest Euro-6 emissions standards will be maintained until the government gets automakers to install new exhaust-cleaning systems in diesel cars. “It’s our goal and our responsibility to protect the citizens against harmful exhaust gases,” Kerstan, a member of the Green Party, said at a press briefing.    Of Hamburg’s 4,000 kilometer road network, only 2.2 kilometers are affected by the ban, Kerstan said.  Such anti-pollution measures could be proliferating in Germany, where the country’s top administrative court ruled in February that Stuttgart, home to Daimler and Porsche (VOWG_p.DE), and Duesseldorf should consider such a ban. Merkel’s Social Democrat coalition partners have repeatedly called for hardware fixes as a means to help tackle diesel pollution, but Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer of the Christian Social Union, sister party of Merkel’s Christian Democrats, opposes such action. “There are legal, financial and technical reservations against hardware retrofits that must not be overlooked,” Scheuer told the RND group of newspapers, adding that prospects for hardware fixes would cause panic among car owners.     The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said hardware retrofits were complicated and needed years of development, suggesting software solutions made more sense. “Manufacturers are equipping millions of diesel cars with new engine software. This will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 25 to 30 percent on average,” a VDA spokesman said. An expert report reviewed by Scheuer’s department earlier this month concluded that the federal government cannot force automakers to carry out component changes on diesel cars unless excessive pollution is caused by deliberate fraud. The study backed the Berlin government’s current stance of relying on carmakers’ voluntary upgrades of emissions-control software to bring exhaust levels into line with EU limits. Environmentalists called the Hamburg restrictions a small but important step in the right direction, noting that cities would no longer have legal excuses to shun bans to reach air-quality targets. But some environmental groups said the restrictions would shift toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions to adjacent streets as drivers of older diesel cars find other routes, while policing the bans will be hard if the cars are not labeled in some way. “Hamburg environmental authorities acknowledge that there are similarly high levels of pollution elsewhere (in the city), but there are no measuring stations there,” Juergen Resch, director of environmental group DUH, told Deutschlandfunk on Thursday, adding the bans reflected political posturing.  While some road users including residents, trash collectors and cab drivers are exempt from the restrictions, some business groups voiced concern about the implications. “Driving bans are a declaration of bankruptcy of the transportation policy and a dangerously wrong path with great risks for vital inner cities and on-site retail,” Josef Sanktjohanser, head of the Association of German Retailers representing about 100,000 companies, said. Germany and five other European states face possible fines for violating air quality standards after the European Commission said this month it would take them to the region’s highest court over the matter.

The sources said the proposed rule, to be made available for public comment, will include a series of alternatives but the preferred alternative will be to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. Advocates of stricter standards, designed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, were quick to criticize the Transportation Department proposal. U.S. Senator Tom Carper said a draft shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards. The lengthy proposal will assert that a 1975 federal law preempts states from imposing emissions rules. Automakers have sought changes to the Obama-era standards to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger vehicles. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Jahan Wilcox said the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have jointly developed the rule and sent it to OMB for review. He declined further comment ahead of the review’s completion. The final proposal could still be changed during the inter-agency review process. Reuters and other media outlets reported in April that the administration was likely to back freezing the standards, which would spark a fight with California and other states backing tougher rules. This month, California and 16 other states filed suit to challenge the Trump administration’s April decision to announce plans to revise the rules. Automakers at a May 11 meeting with President Donald Trump urged him to try to reach agreement with California. The following week, California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols met with administration officials. Also last week, General Motors chief executive Mary Barra held a new round of meetings with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. A person briefed on the NHTSA proposal said it will address impacts of fuel efficiency increases on the economy, auto industry, environment and safety.

2018-05-31,"(Adds details, crude prices, quotes) May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell more than expected last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories posted surprise builds as refiners ramped up their activity to the highest since January ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. Crude inventories fell 3.6 million barrels in the week to May 25, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 525,000 barrels. The drawdown assuaged some worries from U.S. traders who have watched the West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) benchmark weaken due to high production levels and signals that OPEC will let its supply-cut pact come to a close. “The report was supportive due to the large drop in crude oil inventories which was a function of a trifecta of bullish elements: strong demand from refiners, a sizeable drop in crude oil imports, and rebound in exports,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. Refinery crude runs rose 527,000 barrels per day to 17.2 million bpd as utilization rates jumped 2.1 percentage points to 93.9 percent of total capacity, both the highest runs and rates since January, EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose by 534,000 barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.4 million-barrel drop. Demand for the motor fuel over the past four weeks rose 0.8 percent year-on-year ahead of the Memorial day weekend which marks the official start to the summer driving season in the United States. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, grew by 634,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.3 million-barrel draw, the EIA data showed. After the report, U.S. crude futures were down 57 cents to $67.62 a barrel as of 11:22 a.m. EDT (1522 GMT), while Brent crude August futures gained 61 cents to $78.33. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 959,000 bpd as exports jumped 431,000 bpd to 2.2 million bpd. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI fell 556,000 barrels, EIA said. Crude production continued to set a weekly record high, edging up to 10.8 million bpd, though the weekly U.S. figures are subject to revisions; monthly data for March will be released later on Thursday.

2018-05-31,"* Schlumberger leaves project over problems with financing * Golar, Ophir say new equity partners may be needed * Fortuna is not dead, says Golar CEO (Adds Golar CEO, analyst comment, industry background) By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - A pioneering liquefied natural gas project in Equatorial Guinea, bogged down by delayed financing, ran into further trouble after U.S. oil services company Schlumberger pulled out of the venture, two other operators said on Thursday. Ophir Energy, the London-based company heading the Fortuna development, and Golar LNG, which operates floating LNG facilities, said Schlumberger had decided to withdraw due to problems with the project’s financing. Schlumberger was not immediately available for comment. The Fortuna development would be west Africa’s first deepwater LNG project and includes a floating terminal that liquefies gas offshore, not onshore as usual. Reuters reported earlier this month the growing frustration of Equatorial Guinea’s government at the delays and its ultimatum to take the project off Ophir or scrap it altogether. Golar LNG participated in Fortuna as part of the OneLNG joint venture it had established with Schlumberger. On Thursday it said Schlumberger withdrew from OneLNG due to the financing problems and its own priorities for spending its resources. Golar Chief Executive Iain Ross said funds would take time to find and may come from new equity partners that would replace Schlumberger. “I don’t believe it’s dead at all,” Ross said of the project. “We’d like to keep the project going and we’re also in discussion with other potential partners to replace Schlumberger on the project ... We believe in the project,” he told investors on a conference call. Ophir, which confirmed Schlumberger’s departure from Fortuna, also hinted at finding new equity partners. “Ophir has already held informal discussions with other, well-capitalised, potential partners for our Fortuna project. Following (Golar’s) announcement ... we have now formalised discussions and are actively moving forward with them,” it said. Fortuna is a so-called FLNG project, a pioneering design that shrinks complex infrastructure typically spread over hundreds of acres onto a single vessel. Golar operates an FLNG in Cameroon which became the world’s first converted FLNG project and boosted hopes for the Fortuna development. Like FSRUs, vessels which regasify LNG offshore, FLNGs are expected to inject flexibility and liquidity into the global LNG market because once they become accepted technologies they will reduce the time and costs of developing and exporting gas. But Ophir, an independent oil and gas company with little experience in complex LNG projects and a small balance sheet, has had problems concluding the $1.2 billion in financing and was told by the government it may lose the project. Overlooked by Western banks due to Fortuna’s design, Ophir wooed Asian lenders instead but were left scrambling after talks with Chinese players collapsed last year. “While it is ‘in talks’ with others including Temasek, the loss of the CEO and the threat by Equatorial Guinea to give others its production licences if it doesn’t close financing this year all seems to add up to problems for that project,” Trevor Sikorski, analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, said. “It does seem as if that project now is hanging by a thread.” Ophir replaced its chief executive, Nicholas Cooper, this month in a bid to get its strategy back on track. Its shares were down almost 10 percent at 56.9 pounds each at 1345 GMT while Golar’s shares fell 18 percent to $28.35.

2018-05-31,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Idemitsu Kosan (5019.T) does not expect to close any domestic oil refineries as part of its long-delayed merger with smaller rival Showa Shell Sekiyu (5002.T) even as local demand for oil continues to fall. That comes as Idemitsu, Japan’s No.2 oil refiner by sales, battles to overcome entrenched opposition to the touted merger from its founding family at a time when the country’s refining market is going through the biggest shake-up in its history. The two refiners have struck a business alliance ahead of the possible merger, integrating the so-called loading programs they use to buy crude and working to jointly operate their seven group refineries. “Idemitsu has already reduced refineries by half to three and will not close any more,” CEO Shunichi Kito told Reuters in an interview last month. JXTG Holdings (5020.T), the dominant player in a country where a falling population is using ever more efficient vehicles, was formed last year out of the merger of JX and TonenGeneral. It has been considering closing at least one of its 11 domestic refineries. “Seven refineries for Idemitsu and Showa Shell would balance domestic demand. (Integration or elimination) would be unlikely to happen to us,” he said. Kito said he could not give a timeline for the proposed merger with Showa Shell as there has been little progress in its talks to win approval from the founding family. Meanwhile, he also said Idemitsu was considering a minor upgrade to a secondary refining unit in response to the International Maritime Organization’s move to ban use of high sulphur fuel. He added that the firm planned to raise its overseas oil sales to roughly match domestic levels by 2020/21, pushing to compensate for a projected 30-40 percent decline in local gasoline demand by 2030. Idemitsu currently operates two filling stations in Vietnam, where it participates in the 200,000 barrels-per-day Nghi Son oil refinery project, and wants to increase that to 10 as it mulls the best way to expand in the country. Kito said it would also consider how to enter the gas stand business in nearby nations such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. “I expect acquisition, capital participation or a tie-up will be an effective way rather than building it from scratch,” he said.

2018-05-31,"(Reuters) - Faced with shops full of food and other goods swathed in plastic, families across the world are trying to reduce its use and recycle wherever possible to cut down its impact on the environment. Reuters photographers met people from Athens to Singapore trying to play their part as the war on plastics becomes a hot political topic and governments work to outlaw single-use items such as drinking straws and cotton buds.  For the photo essay: reut.rs/2H1PuSo Eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, the United Nations Environment Program said in December.     The impact hit home for Eri Sato, 32, when she lived in Canada and volunteered to clear up debris swept across the ocean from Japan, where she now lives in Yokohama, after the devastating earthquake and tsunami there in March 2011. “It was the first time I realized how plastic waste pollutes the oceans and beaches all over the world. I think there’s no escaping the plastic waste,” she said.  How to cut down and eventually eradicate it is the question. “Since plastic is dominating our daily life, it would be very difficult to stop using it. But, if someone somehow makes it like a habit, we think we could stop buying altogether,” said Alexandra Patrikiou, 39, in the Greek capital Athens, who works hard to recycle paper and glass and buy recycled products. Her comments were echoed by Brandy Wilbur in Wenham, Massachusetts. “When shopping, I do try to buy products with minimal packaging, but that is challenging too, everything is packaged,” the 44-year-old said.  While governments and retailers started clamping down on plastic bags through bans and small fees more than a decade ago, the focus has now increasingly turned to eradicating throwaway items such as straws and take-out food and drink packaging. “It is really the small, single-use plastics that stick around for a long time and leach into everything,” Audrey Gan, 31, said in Singapore. “If we are really craving for a drink of bubble tea, we bring our own containers to avoid the plastic cup and straw they come in.” Like other families Reuters spoke to, the Joshi family in the Indian city of Mumbai has already started taking measures such as using bamboo toothbrushes, unpackaged shampoo bars rather than bottles and taking containers to restaurants to bring home any left-overs. “I carry my own spoon, fork and stainless steel straw to avoid single use plastic cutlery,” Mugdha Tanmay Joshi, 32, said. For some, it is a personal battle, overcoming the preconceptions of others as they try to do their bit. “They say ‘are you part of this green movement’, ... They don’t understand it. Also not using plastic bags for vegetables is considered disgusting, they hate it .. but I still do it,” said Tatiana Schnittke, 39, in Jaffa, Israel.

2018-05-31,"(Adds comment, updates throughout) By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, May 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A year after President Donald Trump vowed to pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change, experts lamented the move but welcomed efforts by cities and states to fill the gap. Trump’s announcement of June 1 last year to ditch the deal agreed upon by nearly 200 countries came over opposition by U.S. businesses and the powerful nation’s allies. Trump said leaving the deal signed by his predecessor Barack Obama would boost domestic energy production and speed economic growth. But it raised fears among supporters of the agreement that other nations would follow suit. “That was a dark day,” said Vicki Arroyo, executive director of Georgetown University’s Climate Center. “A domino effect could have happened.” Instead two more countries - Syria and Nicaragua - signed on after Trump’s announcement. But Trump’s decision means some U.S.-based businesses now have less incentive to move toward clean energy, said Christiana Figueres, the U.N. climate chief when the 2015 Paris Agreement was signed. That will put them at a competitive disadvantage as global competitors shift away from polluting fossil fuels faster, she said. Promoting the use of coal over renewable energy sources “is like prohibiting people from using cell phones and asking them to go back to landlines”, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview on Thursday. “That’s a pretty sad position to be advocating.” But growing public concerns about the health risks of air pollution from coal and other fossil fuels are also driving broader interest in curbing climate change, she said. For a long time, people tended to think climate change was happening far away, to others, or would only affect future generations, she said. Now more understand that “this is happening right now and we can do something about it”, she added. The 2015 Paris deal committed nations to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping the global hike in temperatures “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. In December, countries will meet in Poland to set rules for the accord’s implementation, including how to monitor emissions. Experts say momentum is compromised in the absence of the United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China. “We need the U.S. back at the table,” said Selwin Hart, the ambassador of Barbados, at a panel in Washington organized by the World Resources Institute (WRI). Andrew Norton, director of the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, said Trump’s decision to stop further U.S. payments into a major fund to help poorer countries adopt clean energy and adapt to climate threats also threatened climate action around the world. “Without the money and support crucial to delivering the Paris Agreement, the global effort to address climate change may be fatally undermined,” he warned in a statement. Nevertheless, a deluge of state- and city-level policies adopted over the last 12 months in the United States, from emissions reductions targets to a push for electric cars, is a silver lining, said experts on the WRI panel. The planned U.S. departure from the Paris pact “gave us a galvanizing point”, said Angela Navarro, Virginia’s deputy secretary of commerce and trade. Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe last year ordered a push for a cap-and-trade system to cut emissions from power plants, citing the federal government’s retreat from the climate debate. California Gov. Jerry Brown is planning a global climate summit in September. States, cities and businesses representing more than half the U.S. economy and population have adopted targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to WRI. However, piecemeal regulation cannot match the policy reach of the federal government, Arroyo said. ""I don't think that anyone would argue that we're in a better position,"" she said. ""The task definitely got harder."" (Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo in New York and Laurie Goering in London, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and Megan Rowling.

2018-05-31,"* Compliance by 12 nations with output targets slips to 163 pct * Nigeria, Venezuela post OPEC’s biggest production drops * Overall OPEC output falls by 70,000 bpd * For output by country and compliance details, see By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal LONDON/DUBAI, May 31 (Reuters) - OPEC oil output fell to a 13-month low in May due to declining Venezuelan production, Nigerian outages and strong compliance with a supply-cutting deal, a Reuters survey found. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.00 million barrels per day in May, the survey found, down 70,000 bpd from April’s revised figure. The May total is the lowest since April 2017, according to Reuters surveys. OPEC is reducing output by about 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to get rid of excess supply. The deal began in January 2017 and, in theory, runs until the end of 2018. With the supply glut largely cleared and oil topping $80 a barrel this month for the first time since 2014, OPEC and Russia are now shifting policy and discussing pumping more, although analysts expect any boost to be cautious. “OPEC’s bias to err on the side of tightening remains intact,” said Konstantinos Venetis, senior economist at TS Lombard. “Easing the restrictions just means that its ‘line in the sand’ moves slightly back.” For now though, adherence by producers in the deal to agreed levels remains strong. Compliance slipped to 163 percent of agreed cuts in May from 166 percent in April, the survey found, meaning they are still cutting far more than agreed. The biggest decrease in supply came from Nigeria due to unplanned outages. Royal Dutch Shell’s Nigerian venture declared force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports, while loadings of another crude, Forcados, are facing delays. The second-biggest decline came from Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds because of economic crisis. Output dropped to 1.45 million bpd in May, the survey found, a new long-term low. Production in Libya, which remains unstable due to unrest, edged lower because AGOCO, an eastern Libyan producer, had to curb output as unusually hot weather led to power problems. Iranian output, expected to decline as the U.S. re-imposition of sanctions discourages companies from buying the country’s oil, edged lower in May but there was no evidence yet of a sizeable drop, sources in the survey said. OPEC’s two largest producers, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, both pumped slightly more in May but not enough to offset the declines elsewhere. Saudi Arabia’s output edged up due to more crude being used in domestic power plants, sources in the survey said, but remained below the kingdom’s OPEC target. Iraq, the second-largest, pumped more because of an increase in exports from the south, the outlet for most of the country’s crude, following a decline in April. Output in the country holding the OPEC presidency this year, the United Arab Emirates, was steady in May as it continues to show higher compliance than in 2017, sources close to the matter said. Kuwait also maintained full compliance. Nigeria and Libya were originally exempt from cutting supply because their output had been curbed by conflict and unrest. For 2018, both told OPEC that output would not exceed 2017 levels. OPEC has an implied production target for 2018 of 32.73 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and taking into account changes of membership since, plus Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output. According to the survey, OPEC pumped about 730,000 bpd below this implied target in May, not least because of the decline in Venezuela and a similar involuntary drop in Angola, where the survey found output was flat in May. The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-05-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Thursday announced the start of production at the Kaikias field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, around one year ahead of schedule. Production from the subsea deep water development, which will reach 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, comes after Shell reduced its costs by around 30 percent to allow it to generate profit at less than $30 a barrel, the company said.  “We believe Kaikias is the most competitive subsea development in the Gulf of Mexico and a prime example of the deep-water opportunities we’re able to advance with our technical expertise and capital discipline,” said Andy Brown, Shell’s Upstream Director.  Following the collapse in oil prices in 2014, companies have sharply reduced costs for developing fields by slashing the cost of services, simplifying engineering plans and increasing the use of technology.     Kaikias is located some 130 miles (210 kilometres) off the coast of Louisiana in the Mars-Ursa basin. Shell holds an 80 percent stake in the project while Japan’s Mitsui (8031.T) holds the remaining 20 percent. The field is under around 4,500 feet (1,372 metres) of water and its four wells are connected to the Shell-operated Ursa hub, from where the oil flows to the shore via the Mars pipeline.

2018-05-31,"(Adds reaction, detail) By Gwladys Fouche OSLO, May 31 (Reuters) - Norway’s parliament should discuss next year whether the country’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund should be able to invest in unlisted renewable projects such as solar parks and wind farms, parliament’s finance committee said on Thursday. Norwegian politicians have been debating whether the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund should invest in a new asset class on top of the stocks, bonds and real estate it holds. While there had been broad support to allow the fund to invest in renewable infrastructure, the minority government said in March it was too early to present a bill to parliament on the subject, and did not provide a precise timeline. On Thursday, a united finance committee instructed the government to present a bill next year on the topic so parliament could debate and vote on the question, a key lawmaker told Reuters. “We want to have a better balance between the fund’s return and risk,” said Svein Roald Hansen, the lawmaker who led the committee’s work on the government’s white paper. Green groups welcomed the news as it will likely be voted through next year. The ruling Conservatives, the opposition Labour Party and at least five smaller parties are in favour. “This is an important contribution to achieve climate targets,” said Baard Vegar Solhjell, head of the WWF conservation group in Norway. The government said in March it was concerned about the political risk of the fund being stuck in a problematic investment it cannot get out of as easily as if it were a listed company. The fund is managed by a unit of the central bank called Norges Bank Investment Management. Parliament decides the fund’s mandate. The committee shares that view and wants to progress “carefully” when it comes to allowing the fund to invest in unlisted infrastructure projects that are not renewables, such as bridges or roads. “Other types of unlisted infrastructure are more complicated. They can break with the principles of openness and transparency of the fund,” parliament’s Hansen said. The government has also said that were the fund to be allowed to go into unlisted renewables projects, it should be limited to the fund’s current green investment mandate, which amounted to 75 billion Norwegian crowns ($9.18 billion) at end-2017. Green groups say this is too low, and the finance committee said on Thursday it should be “significantly higher”, without giving a sum. $1 = 8.1680 Norwegian crowns

2018-05-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Integrated energy group Sembcorp Industries (SCIL.SI) has agreed to buy UK Power Reserve, Britain’s largest flexible power generator, for an equity value of 216 million pounds. The Singapore-listed company said on Thursday it was buying UK Power Reserve, which was founded in 2010 to meet growing demand for flexible reserve power capacity, from investment firm Equistone Partners Europe and Inflexion Private Equity. Following the acquisition of shares, Sembcorp will consolidate all the assets and liabilities of UK Power Reserve, including its net debt. In Britain, demand for more flexible power generation capacity has grown due to the closure of ageing thermal plants, the rise of variable renewable energy and electric vehicles. UK Power Reserve has 32 rapid-response power stations with a total capacity of 533 megawatts (MW) in operation, enough to power 375,000 homes. A further 480 MW of capacity, included 120 MW of battery storage assets, is under construction and development and expected to come online by 2019. Sembcorp Industries has an energy portfolio of more than 12 gigawatts (GW) worldwide, including thermal power plants and renewable energy assets. Sembcorp UK, which has 210 MW of combined heat and power, steam power and renewable generation capacity at its Wilton International industrial site in Teesside, northeast England, is also seeking planning approval to develop two combined-cycle gas turbine units of up to 1.7 GW at that site.

2018-05-31,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 31 (Reuters) - South Korea’s imposition of a strict sulphur cap on its imported coal is likely to cause ripples across Asia’s markets for the polluting fuel, both in the short and longer terms. From July, South Korean utilities will be restricted to burning coal with an average sulphur content of 0.4 percent over the course of the year, part of government measures to combat air pollution. Such a low sulphur limit effectively knocks out much of the thermal coal from Australia, which generally produces coal with a high energy value, but also higher sulphur content than rivals such as Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. Australia is the second-largest supplier of coal to South Korea, behind Indonesia, and has already been losing market share so far this year. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts show a total of 17.4 million tonnes of Australian coal being discharged in South Korea in the first five months of this year, down 7.4 percent from the same period in 2017. While coal imports from Australia held up well in the first four months, they have fallen sharply in May, to 2.5 million tonnes, according to the data. This is a drop of 40 percent from May of last year, showing that South Korean utilities are already attempting to source coal from low-sulphur producers. Customs data for the first four months of 2018 shows that South Korea imported 14.1 million tonnes from Australia, down from 14.3 million for the same period in 2017. From Indonesia, imports dropped to 11.3 million tonnes from 12.2 million, while those from Russia jumped to 8.2 million from 6.8 million and South African shipments rose to 3.7 million from 3.5 million. What this suggests is that South Korean utilities are cutting back on high-sulphur imports from Australia, but aren’t switching to Indonesia, rather preferring to buy more from Russia and South Africa. This means that the utilities are still seeking higher energy coal, but with a lower sulphur content, such as that produced in Russia and South Africa. Indonesia’s coal tends to be low sulphur, but also of low calorific value, meaning more has to be burned to produce the same amount of energy. The question for the seaborne coal market is how much impact will South Korea’s switch to low-sulphur coal have, given that it is the world’s fourth-largest importer behind China, India and Japan. In theory, prices for Australian coal should decline, while those for South African and Russian supplies should advance, but the reality may be more nuanced than that. About 45 million tonnes of Australia’s annual thermal coal exports meet the new South Korean specification, according to consultants Wood Mackenzie. That’s less than a quarter of the country’s total annual thermal coal exports, but is still sufficiently large to enable South Korean utilities to switch to buying only low-sulphur cargoes. What this may mean in practical terms is that Australian low-sulphur coal starts to enjoy a rising premium over fuel with a higher sulphur content, even if the calorific values are the same. This may benefit buyers in countries such as Japan and China, who may be able to buy higher sulphur Australian coal and would be happy to take it at a discount to what they are currently paying. Chinese utilities are known to buy low-energy, but low-sulphur  Indonesian coal for blending with higher energy coal. The price for South African coal may also move higher, if South Korea starts to boost demand, and there is some evidence in the pricing that this is occurring. The price of coal at South Africa’s main export port of Richards Bay, as assessed by Argus Media, ended last week at $103.64 a tonne, while the price of similar grade coal at Australia’s Newcastle port was at $105. This means the Australian coal was at a $1.36 a tonne premium to the South African fuel, which is down from the $8.33 at the end of last year. There are, of course, other reasons for South African coal to outperform Australian, including rising demand from South Asian countries such as Pakistan. However, Russian coal in the Pacific market also seems to have outperformed Australian slightly in recent months, with the price at the port of Vostochny in Nakhodka COAL-NAKHOD-RU ending last week at $101, $4 below the Newcastle equivalent, narrowing from the $7 a tonne that prevailed in mid-January. While the seaborne market is likely to adjust to the new South Korean rules by shifting around who buys what from whom, it’s unlikely that this will signal a dramatic shift in prices. However, the market should also consider the question as to whether South Korea is the harbinger of more restrictions on sulphur, which would have more serious consequences for Australia, and for the operating costs of Asian utilities.

2018-05-31,"ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - Russia would be able to raise its oil output back to pre-cut levels within months if there is a decision to unwind the price-protection deal with OPEC and other producers, a Russian energy ministry official said. Moscow agreed to cut Russian output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a 30-year high of 11.247 million bpd in October 2016 as part of a deal to tighten the market and lift prices from less than $30 a barrel, their lowest in more than a decade. This global deal is valid until the end of 2018 and is due to be reviewed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC countries in June 22-23 in Vienna. Russia and OPEC leader Saudi Arabia have talked of a gradual increase in output as the goal of removing excessive oil stockpiles has been achieved and the market is broadly balanced after producers last year began withholding 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to tighten the market and prop up prices. “Speaking about potential in the short run, growth potential (in Russia) is at least 300,000 bpd, which were cut voluntarily by the companies as part of the OPEC agreement,” Pavel Sorokin, a Russian Deputy Energy Minister, told Reuters in an interview. “Within a few months we surely will be able to restore that level if such a decision is taken,” Sorokin added. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, said on Saturday that returning to the oil production levels of October 2016 is one of the options for the future of the deal. Rising output in the United States has been a headache for other oil producers as it has been a major contributor to the downward pressure on prices. Sorokin, a former oil and gas analyst at Morgan Stanley, said U.S. shale oil output, the key driver behind the stellar growth in the country’s oil production, will increase by 1.3-1.4 million bpd this year, lower than some estimates. “There is not enough infrastructure, there are certain bottlenecks with the staff availability, equipment, while lifting costs have started to creep up,” he said.

The moves meant Milan’s bourse was 0.7 percent higher, Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC added 0.2-0.4 percent though Germany’s DAX stalled after a report that President Donald Trump aims to push German carmakers out of the United States. Wall Street looked set for a flat start New York meaning it was the euro and the bloc’s bond markets that continued to make the most significant moves. Italy’s 2-year government bond yield, which has been the focus of a selloff, was down as much as 95 basis points at just over 1 percent, while the euro climbed to $1.1690 after its biggest jump since early January on Wednesday. Rome’s benchmark 10-year bond yield was down 33 bps at 2.68 percent too and the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 248 bps, as much as 22 bps tighter than the previous day’s close. “It seems at least the 5-Star movement is making an effort to form a government. Apparently they have been given a day to try,” said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet. “The market is just rallying hoping that new elections may avoided.” Asia’s mood overnight had been lifted by data showing growth by China’s vast manufacturing sector accelerated strongly and well above forecasts in May to an eight-month high. It gave bluechip Chinese shares their best day since August 2016 with gains of just over 2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose over 1 percent too and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan made 0.8 percent as it clambered off near two-month lows. “We have about 25 percent in Asia,” said Jake Robbins, a global equities fund manager at Premier Asset Management. “China is the second biggest economy in the world and it is growing very, very quickly.” Tokyo’s Nikkei meanwhile added 0.8 percent, helped by a settling of the yen which has been drawing in buyers during the recent rise in Italian and euro zone uncertainty. The euro’s rise came as two polls in Italy showed 60-72 percent of respondents wanted the country to remain part of the euro. The prospect that populist parties there could push to leave the currency is the big concern for financial markets. French inflation data also rose to its highest level since August 2012 coming a day after Germany’s figure had also past the European Central Bank’s target of just under 2 percent after hitting its highest in more than a year. U.S. markets were gearing up for a blizzard of data, including the Federal Reserve’s favoured gauge of inflation - core personal consumption expenditures. The Fed holds its next meeting in mid-June and is expected to edge up rates again. The dollar index which measures it against a basket of six other major world currencies dipped 0.3 percent to 93.830 having surged to a near seven-month peak of 95.025 on Tuesday amid the Italy troubles. U.S. Treasury yields moved up from April lows hit this week to 2.87 percent, though there were a number of geopolitical events to navigate. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol will hold a second day of meetings in New York later as they try to set the stage for an historic summit between their two leaders next month. China meanwhile had lashed out on Wednesday at renewed threats from the White House on trade, warning that it was ready to fight back if Washington was looking for a trade war, days ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. In commodity markets, copper did not get its normal lift from the upbeat China data while crude oil prices also eased after rallying overnight. U.S. crude futures fell 0.3 percent to $68 a barrel after gaining 2.2 percent on Wednesday when Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply. Prices had fallen to a six-week low of $65.80 a barrel on Tuesday amid concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia might increase their output. Brent crude lost 0.35 percent to $77.23 a barrel after jumping 2.8 percent on Wednesday, while gold climbed above $1,300 an ounce with a 0.4 percent rise. Turkey’s lira and Argentina’s peso were being buffeted again. Both have been slammed this month by a mix problematic politics, high deficits and higher inflation. The peso has plunged over 17 percent while the lira has slumped almost 10 percent. Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Chopra and Alison

2018-05-31,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s state-owned oil and gas company Petroliam Nasional Bhd [PETR.UL] said on Thursday it is buying a 25 percent stake in a Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, nearly a year after cancelling its own planned terminal.  The company, known as Petronas, scrapped plans to build a $36 billion ($28 billion) LNG export terminal in British Columbia last year over concerns of a glut in the market that led to depressed fuel prices. But surprisingly strong demand from China, South Korea and India has erased those concerns, and market sentiment has recovered. Petronas said in a statement that it would buy an equity stake in LNG Canada, an export project led by Royal Dutch Shell located in Kitimat, British Columbia. The purchase is expected to close in the next few months, the company said.  Petronas did not give a value for the acquisition.  “We believe this to be a positive development for Petronas,” said Prasanth Kakaraparthi senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “We expect the global LNG market to tighten post 2022 and this bodes well for the project,” he added.  The C$40 billion LNG Canada project will consist of two LNG production facilities, known as trains, that are expected to export a combined 13 million tonnes per year of LNG. Petronas is joining as Shell and its partners prepare for a final decision to go ahead with the project, which would be the first large-scale LNG plant constructed in several years.  Shell will continue to be the biggest owner in LNG Canada, holding a 40 percent stake. Other partners include PetroChina, Mitsubishi’s Diamond LNG and Korea Gas. Since scrapping earlier plans, Petronas had been looking for ways to generate revenue from its assets in that region. Petronas’ North Montney assets in British Columbia are rich in natural gas. Petronas’ and its North Montney joint venture partners are one of the largest natural gas resource owners in Canada with over 52 Tcf of reserves and contingent resources, it said.  An equity stake in LNG Canada will enhance the company’s aims to develop natural gas resource in the North Montney through its subsidiary, Progress Energy Canada Ltd. “Petronas is in Canada for the long-term and we are exploring a number of business opportunities that will allow us to increase our production and accelerate the monetisation of our world-class resources in the North Montney,” President and Group Chief Executive Officer Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said in the statement. “LNG is just one of those opportunities,” he said. In March, Petronas said it was one of the producers involved in TransCanada’s proposal to expand a pipeline system that would open up more markets for its gas produced in Western Canada.

2018-05-31,"CALGARY, Alberta/VANCOUVER, May 31 (Reuters) - Years of low oil prices and high costs spurred a stampede by multinational majors out of Canada’s oil sands last year, leaving the remaining crude producers struggling to weather painful drops in profit. Environmentalists derided the “tar sands” as too dirty for investment, and analysts said the region’s high production costs made little sense in a world of $50-a-barrel oil. But this month, global benchmark prices rebounded to $80 per barrel, cheering oil executives in the Canadian energy capital of Calgary, Alberta, who are shifting from survival mode to cautious expansion to capitalize on healthier cash flow expected this year. Although most producers remain hesitant to commit substantial new capital, a few are restarting mothballed wells and many are pencilling out tentative plans for their extra cash as investors brighten their outlooks for the sector. Plunging output from heavy-crude competitor Venezuela - amid a sprawling crisis in its socialist government’s state-run oil firm, PDVSA - adds further opportunity for sales of Canadian crude to U.S. Gulf of Mexico refiners. “It hurts on the downside, but boy is there opportunity on the way up,” said Ed LaFehr, chief executive of Baytex Energy Corp, which drills in Western Canada and Texas. The improved prospects are already translating into job creation in an economy where the oil sands’ fortunes are so critical that the nation’s currency rises and falls in step with oil futures prices. Matt Munro, Canada market manager for UK-based recruiter Petroplan, said the sector’s job postings have more than doubled so far this year compared with 2017 and salaries are up, particularly in oilfield services. One company, for example, has boosted base salaries, before bonuses, from C$80,000 to C$110,000 in the past 18 months, Munro said. Average weekly salaries for oil and gas extraction workers in Alberta jumped 13.8 percent from February 2017 to February 2018, according to the most recent available data from Statistics Canada. The number of people employed by Alberta resource companies, meanwhile, jumped 6.8 percent to nearly 106,000 in the same period, the data showed, though that is still well below the August 2014 peak of about 135,000 people. (For a graphic on oil-and-gas employment and pay in Alberta, see: tmsnrt.rs/2s222V0 ) Baytex delayed starting production on three wells in the first quarter but now plans to launch the wells this spring, LaFehr said. The company’s hedging strategy could prevent it from reaping the full upside of higher prices this year. But if prices hold it may see an extra C$200 million ($155.27 million) in free cash flow in 2019, which it could use to expand output and repay debt, LaFehr said. Heavy oil producer BlackPearl Resources Inc shut down 10 wells in the first quarter that were not worth the expense of maintenance work at lower oil prices. Now it’s restarting them to capture profits from the rebound. With U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude prices up 13 percent so far this year, BlackPearl CEO John Festival is mulling further expansion further next year. “Higher prices certainly help the mood,” he said. At current prices, BlackPearl might move more quickly to boost production at its Onion Lake, Saskatchewan project, which it had expected to expand by 6,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, he said. Beyond those tentative steps, Festival will hold back on more substantial investments to see if market dynamics can sustain higher prices. “One month of good prices is not enough to cause us to commit,” Festival said. The recent upturn by no means solves the structural problems in Canada’s sector that were exposed when global prices crashed starting in 2014 from a height of more than $100 a barrel. Oil sands drilling costs remain high, and Western Canada is still producing far more oil than its congested pipelines can deliver. The oil-transport crisis is so severe, in fact, that many companies are shipping their oil one truckload at a time - at steep costs - for a lack of cheaper pipeline and rail options. On Tuesday, the Canadian government announced it would take the drastic step of purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd in a bid to rescue an expansion project facing fierce opposition in British Columbia. High transportation costs translate into deep discounts on Western Canadian oil, relative to the U.S. benchmark, with the gap reaching $30 a barrel in January, the biggest in four years. That has since narrowed to as little as $13, but the reduction is mainly due to oil producers taking more maintenance downtime earlier in the year than planned, reducing the strain on pipelines. Even so, big Canadian producers that snapped up stakes from the retreating foreign owners during the downturn are well-positioned for any sustained rebound. Rising prices have sparked “dramatic shift” in the cash-flow expectations for oil sands producers this year, equity analysts at Eight Capital said in a May report. The analysts raised share price targets of Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy and Suncor Energy. Suncor and Canadian Natural may fare particularly well because they have secured enough pipe capacity for their current operations, both firms said last month. Suncor also has space lined up for output from its stake in Fort Hills, the oil sands’ newest mine. For every $1 per barrel prices climb, Suncor’s cash flows rise by about $225 million. Investors have noticed the reversal of fortune in the oil patch. The TSX Energy Index has gained 24 percent since its 2018 low in early February. Higher oil prices make more regions, like the oil sands, considerations again for wary investors, said Trip Rodgers, portfolio manager at BP Capital Fund Advisors, which currently focuses upstream investments on U.S. shale producers. “You’re able to look at names that may not be as low-cost.” Higher prices are whetting appetites for more mergers and acquisitions, said Andrew Botterill, national oil and gas leader at Deloitte, which advises producers. Even so, he said Canadian oil companies are more “mature” than they were before prices collapsed in recent years, and are likely to take a measured path to growth, he said. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that Canada’s total capital spending in 2018 will drop 10 percent year-over-year as better prices take time to revive the industry, compared with a 15 percent spending increase in the United States.

2018-05-31,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s parliament should discuss next year whether the country’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund should be able to invest in unlisted renewable projects such as solar parks and wind farms, parliament’s finance committee said on Thursday. Norwegian politicians have been debating whether the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund should invest in a new asset class on top of the stocks, bonds and real estate it holds. While there had been broad support to allow the fund to invest in renewable infrastructure, the minority government  said in March it was too early to present a bill to parliament on the subject, and did not provide a precise timeline. On Thursday, a united finance committee instructed the government to present a bill next year on the topic so parliament could debate and vote on the question, a key lawmaker told Reuters. “We want to have a better balance between the fund’s return and risk,” said Svein Roald Hansen, the lawmaker who led the committee’s work on the government’s white paper.  Green groups welcomed the news as it will likely be voted through next year. The ruling Conservatives, the opposition Labour Party and at least five smaller parties are in favour.  “This is an important contribution to achieve climate targets,” said Baard Vegar Solhjell, head of the WWF conservation group in Norway. The government said in March it was concerned about the political risk of the fund being stuck in a problematic investment it cannot get out of as easily as if it were a listed company.  The fund is managed by a unit of the central bank called Norges Bank Investment Management. Parliament decides the fund’s mandate. The committee shares that view and wants to progress “carefully” when it comes to allowing the fund to invest in unlisted infrastructure projects that are not renewables, such as bridges or roads.  “Other types of unlisted infrastructure are more complicated. They can break with the principles of openness and transparency of the fund,” parliament’s Hansen said.  The government has also said that were the fund to be allowed to go into unlisted renewables projects, it should be limited to the fund’s current green investment mandate, which amounted to 75 billion Norwegian crowns ($9.18 billion) at end-2017. Green groups say this is too low, and the finance committee said on Thursday it should be “significantly higher”, without giving a sum.

2018-05-31,"(Reuters) - Oil will stay above $70 a barrel this year because strong demand and possible supply disruptions in Iran and Venezuela will put pressure on global inventories, even though OPEC and Russia are considering raising output, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday. A survey of 36 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 to average $71.68 per barrel in 2018, about $4 higher than $67.40 forecast in last month’s poll and just above the $70 average so far this year. “Oil fundamentals have been increasingly positive for oil prices of late. Geopolitical events surrounding Iran and Venezuela augur further oil supply loss, adding to that already generated by OPEC and allied non-OPEC producer restraint,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity market strategy at BNP Paribas. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers agreed to cut output from January 2017 by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to cut a global surplus. This has led to a rapid decline in inventories.  The drawdown, along with concerns about further supply disruptions from Venezuela and renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, fuelled a recent rally in prices, driving benchmark Brent above $80 a barrel in May, to its highest since November 2014. To compensate for the drop in supply, Saudi Arabia and Russia have been in talks ahead of a key OPEC meeting in Vienna in June to raise oil production by 1 million bpd. As a result, the oil price has dropped by about 7 percent from this month’s peak.  “Any increase in output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will be a bearish price signal, especially when the U.S. output is also climbing,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. However, some analysts say higher output from Saudi Arabia and Russia will not fully compensate for losses from Venezuela and Iran and will only keep prices capped in the near term. “We expect that the production ramp-up will be gradual ... a ramp up of 180,000 bpd every month until year-end. This is probably not enough to bring the market back into surplus,” said Jan Edelmann, commodities analyst at HSH Nordbank AG. The survey forecast U.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 will average $66.47 a barrel this year, around 7 percent lower than the forecast for Brent.  “Cheap U.S. oil relative to international benchmarks will lead to rising demand for U.S. crude,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. Production in United States is forecast to hit a record high in June, widening the premium of Brent to U.S. light crude CL-LCO1=R to its biggest since March 2015, at about $9 a barrel. U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has surged by more than 27 percent in the past two years to 10.73 million bpd and analysts forecast it to grow by about 1.3 million to 1.5 million bpd this year.

2018-05-31,"* European stocks open slightly higher * Euro pulls back from 10-month lows * Italy bonds rebound for a second day * Forecast-beating factory growth index boosts China stocks * Crude dips after rallying on ebb in supply concerns By Marc Jones LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - World stocks, the euro and Italian bonds all made a second day of gains on Thursday, after renewed efforts from politicians in Rome to form a government and data from China pointed to its giant economy performing well. The moves meant Milan’s bourse was 0.9 percent higher, Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC added 0.2-0.4 percent though Germany’s DAX stalled after a report Donald Trump aimed to push German carmakers out of the United States. It was the euro and the bloc’s bond markets that continued to make the most significant moves though. Italy’s 2-year government bond yield, which has been the focus of a recent selloff, was down as much as 50 basis points at 1.45 percent, while the euro climbed to $1.1690 after making its biggest jump since early January on Wednesday. Rome’s benchmark 10-year bond yield was down 20 bps at 2.85 percent too and the closely watched Italy/Germany 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 248 bps, as much as 22 bps tighter than the previous days close. “It seems at least the 5-Star movement is making an effort to form a government. Apparently they have been given a day to try,” said ING strategist Martin Van Vliet. “The market is just rallying hoping that new elections may avoided.” Asia’s mood overnight had been lifted by data showing growth by China’s vast manufacturing sector accelerated strongly and well above forecasts in May to an eight-month high. It gave bluechip Chinese shares their best day since August 2016 with gains of just over 2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose over 1 percent too and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan made 0.8 percent as it clambered off near two-month lows. “We have about 25 percent in Asia,” said Jake Robbins a global equities fund manager at Premier Asset Management. “China is the second biggest economy in the world and it is growing very, very quickly.” Tokyo’s Nikkei meanwhile added 0.8 percent, helped by a settling of the yen which has been drawing in buyers during the recent rise in Italian and euro zone uncertainty. The euro’s rise came as two polls in Italy showed 60-72 percent of respondents wanted the country to remain part of the euro. The prospect that populist parties there could push to leave the currency is the big concern for financial markets. French inflation data also rose to its highest level since August 2012 coming a day after Germany’s figure had also past the European Central Bank’s target of just under 2 percent after hitting its highest in more than a year. The dollar index which measures it against a basket of six other major world currencies dipped 0.3 percent to 93.830 after surging to a near seven-month peak of 95.025 on Tuesday. There was some support for the greenback as U.S. Treasury yields nudged up from April lows hit this week to 2.849 though there were a number of geopolitical events to navigate. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol will hold a second day of meetings in New York later as they try to set the stage for an historic summit between their two leaders. China had lashed out on Wednesday at renewed threats from the White House on trade, warning that it was ready to fight back if Washington was looking for a trade war, days ahead of a planned visit by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. In commodity markets, crude oil prices eased after rallying overnight. U.S. crude futures fell 0.3 percent to $68 a barrel after gaining 2.2 percent on Wednesday when Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply. Prices had fallen to a six-week low of $65.80 a barrel on Tuesday amid concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia might increase their output. Brent crude lost 0.35 percent to $77.23 a barrel after jumping 2.8 percent on Wednesday, while gold climbed above 1,300 an ounce with a 0.4 percent rise.

2018-05-31,"DONGYING, China (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp’s global oil marketing team stormed into China this week hoping to elbow aside rivals and gain access to the nation’s “teapot” refining market, executives told Reuters. The push by Exxon, the world’s biggest oil and gas company by market value, to court the independent refiners, known as teapots, illustrates the clout they are exerting on the global oil market since winning crude import licenses from the government in 2015. The refiners are big foreign crude buyers in a country that is now the world’s largest oil importer.  To make up for a late arrival, Exxon this week sent a dozen traders and marketers, including global crude marketing manager Thomas Martenak, to an oil trade show in Dongying, a hub for the independent refiners in the eastern province of Shandong. The team included crude oil traders, products marketers and finance staff from Houston, Singapore, Thailand and Shanghai. At a booth at the center of Dongying’s downtown exhibit hall, staff handed out gift bags containing backpacks emblazoned with the ExxonMobil logo, flanked by stands from Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional and France’s Total and about 20 local refiners. On Monday evening, Exxon’s team wined and dined prospective customers and traders at a dinner attended by around 200 guests, according to multiple people who attended. Goodie bags at the party contained flasks for travel use, they said.  The marketing blitz is a departure from Exxon’s traditional methods of peddling their crude such as one-on-one meetings.  “I have never seen ExxonMobil ever do this kind of thing in my whole career,” said Lau Kay Hoe, a delegate who retired recently after more than three decades working in shipping and trading at the company. Exxon produces 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas that mainly supplies its own refining system. The company push occurs amid a looming trade war between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. The two sides agreed in talks earlier this month that U.S. energy sales were crucial to offsetting the $335 billion trade deficit the U.S. has with China, its top trading partner. [nL3N1SS1VH] Martenak, who flew in from Houston for the event, said the firm was drawn by the growing importance of China’s independent refiners in the regional market, rather than politics. This was the first publicity push by the oil sales and supply team in the eight years since he took over the reins as the global marketing chief, he said. “We probably are not as fast as some of the traders ... We want to make it up quickly so we can become a major supplier in the region,” he told a seminar on Tuesday. Martenak’s team has also met with potential teapot clients in private meetings this week, but their main purpose was to act as Exxon’s “ambassador” rather than cutting deals, he told Reuters at its booth. New rules from the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to use low-sulphur fuel starting in 2020 will also likely boost China’s need for U.S. sweet, or low-sulphur, crude, he said. Exxon’s charm offensive is starting in Dongying, an oil town built in the 1960s on China’s second-largest oilfield. The city is now the country’s biggest refining center with more 32 refineries and total annual refining capacity of 69 million tonnes, or about 1.38 million bpd.  China has nearly 40 independent refiners and since winning their import quotas three years ago they now buy one-fifth of China’s crude oil imports of 9.6 million bpd.  Most of China’s teapots are in Shandong, sucking in crude from West Africa, Russia, Oman and Brazil. Exxon’s late arrival means they face competition from global peers such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell.  Additionally, global traders, Vitol, Trafigura and Mercuria were among the early movers to the teapot market. Their China-based traders make monthly visits to Shandong, which often involve entertaining over drinks before discussing deals. reut.rs/2J25zgH BP’s China marketing team in Beijing and Shanghai is the largest among the international oil majors, followed by Shell.   “ExxonMobil, like Chevron, are late comers in the Shandong market,” said an independent refining executive at a plant in Dongying. “They are very strong in global supply sources, but compared to traders like Mercuria, Trafigura and Vitol, their knowledge of the local market is not as deep.”   Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng; Editing by Josephine Mason and Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-exxonmobil-oil-independents/exclusive-late-to-teapot-party-exxonmobil-breaks-with-tradition-in-wooing-chinas-oil-market-idUKL3N1T028T,31 May 2018,"* U.S. oil sales could play role to reduce U.S.-China trade

2018-05-31," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - South Korea’s imposition of a strict sulphur cap on its imported coal is likely to cause ripples across Asia’s markets for the polluting fuel, both in the short and longer terms. From July, South Korean utilities will be restricted to burning coal with an average sulphur content of 0.4 percent over the course of the year, part of government measures to combat air pollution. Such a low sulphur limit effectively knocks out much of the thermal coal from Australia, which generally produces coal with a high energy value, but also higher sulphur content than rivals such as Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. Australia is the second-largest supplier of coal to South Korea, behind Indonesia, and has already been losing market share so far this year. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts show a total of 17.4 million tonnes of Australian coal being discharged in South Korea in the first five months of this year, down 7.4 percent from the same period in 2017. While coal imports from Australia held up well in the first four months, they have fallen sharply in May, to 2.5 million tonnes, according to the data. This is a drop of 40 percent from May of last year, showing that South Korean utilities are already attempting to source coal from low-sulphur producers. Customs data for the first four months of 2018 shows that South Korea imported 14.1 million tonnes from Australia, down from 14.3 million for the same period in 2017. From Indonesia, imports dropped to 11.3 million tonnes from 12.2 million, while those from Russia jumped to 8.2 million from 6.8 million and South African shipments rose to 3.7 million from 3.5 million. What this suggests is that South Korean utilities are cutting back on high-sulphur imports from Australia, but aren’t switching to Indonesia, rather preferring to buy more from Russia and South Africa. This means that the utilities are still seeking higher energy coal, but with a lower sulphur content, such as that produced in Russia and South Africa. Indonesia’s coal tends to be low sulphur, but also of low calorific value, meaning more has to be burned to produce the same amount of energy. The question for the seaborne coal market is how much impact will South Korea’s switch to low-sulphur coal have, given that it is the world’s fourth-largest importer behind China, India and Japan. In theory, prices for Australian coal should decline, while those for South African and Russian supplies should advance, but the reality may be more nuanced than that. About 45 million tonnes of Australia’s annual thermal coal exports meet the new South Korean specification, according to consultants Wood Mackenzie. That’s less than a quarter of the country’s total annual thermal coal exports, but is still sufficiently large to enable South Korean utilities to switch to buying only low-sulphur cargoes. What this may mean in practical terms is that Australian low-sulphur coal starts to enjoy a rising premium over fuel with a higher sulphur content, even if the calorific values are the same. This may benefit buyers in countries such as Japan and China, who may be able to buy higher sulphur Australian coal and would be happy to take it at a discount to what they are currently paying. Chinese utilities are known to buy low-energy, but low-sulphur Indonesian coal for blending with higher energy coal. The price for South African coal may also move higher, if South Korea starts to boost demand, and there is some evidence in the pricing that this is occurring. The price of coal at South Africa’s main export port of Richards Bay, as assessed by Argus Media, ended last week at $103.64 a tonne, while the price of similar grade coal at Australia’s Newcastle port was at $105. This means the Australian coal was at a $1.36 a tonne premium to the South African fuel, which is down from the $8.33 at the end of last year. There are, of course, other reasons for South African coal to outperform Australian, including rising demand from South Asian countries such as Pakistan. However, Russian coal in the Pacific market also seems to have outperformed Australian slightly in recent months, with the price at the port of Vostochny in Nakhodka ending last week at $101, $4 below the Newcastle equivalent, narrowing from the $7 a tonne that prevailed in mid-January.

2018-05-31,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Profits in the airline industry are unlikely to reach the record levels forecast in December due to a jump in fuel costs, the head of the world’s leading air transport group said on Thursday. International Air Transport Association (IATA) Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac said his organization will issue fresh forecasts next week, and that airline profits were still likely to be robust. The December projections were based on oil at $60 per barrel, Juniac said. Brent crude LCOc1 is currently over $77 per barrel, having risen roughly 15 percent so far this year. “We are probably at the peak of the (profit) cycle. Next year we don’t know yet but probably less positive,” Juniac said at a media event ahead of the organization’s annual meeting starting on Sunday. Airline operators such as Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIAL.SI) and Malaysia’s AirAsia Group Bhd (AIRA.KL) posted strong profits in the latest quarter ended March amid a tourism boom in the region.  In December, IATA predicted a record $38.4 billion net profit for the airline industry in 2018, with $27.9 billion coming from U.S. and European airlines. IATA represents some 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic. Juniac said higher fuel prices had not yet been passed on in fares and that infrastructure and labor costs as well as taxes were rising.

2018-05-31,"(Reuters) - Australia’s Sino Gas & Energy Holdings Ltd SEH.AX agreed on Wednesday to a A$530 million ($401 million) takeover offer from U.S. private equity firm Lone Star, saying the risks the company faces in China justified putting the bid to a vote. Lone Star is betting on two large gas projects in China, where gas demand is soaring, and where, after many years of work, Sino Gas & Energy only recently won the first of several approvals needed to develop its projects. Sino Gas said its shareholders will receive A$0.25 per share, a 19 percent premium to its close on Tuesday on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Lone Star declined to comment on the offer. The cash offer provides shareholders with “cash certain value now versus the future risks and uncertainties associated with the business,” Sino Gas Managing Director Glenn Corrie told analysts and investors on a teleconference. Brokers with price targets on Sino Gas at least 20 percent above the offer price were surprised the board had unanimously recommended Lone Star’s offer.  “We have previously highlighted the potential upside as Sino Gas de-risks and moves to being cash flow positive by 2020, thus we can only conclude there are greater risks the board is aware of than we have modeled,” Macquarie analysts said in a note. Small investors who have backed the company for years and just saw it secure some long-awaited agreements, like a recent production sharing contract with Chinese oil giant CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), were unimpressed with the offer. “Private equity doesn’t invest unless they expect to get outsized returns. Why should we be giving that away?” Craig Lindner, a private investor, told Corrie on the teleconference, adding he would be voting against the offer.  Sino Gas shares rose as much as 21 percent before easing to trade up 14 percent at A$0.24, suggesting investors don’t expect a higher bid to emerge. Its shares have strongly outperformed a flat ASX energy index .AXEJ this year, surging 35 percent to Wednesday’s close. Shareholders are expected to vote on the offer, which needs approval from 75 percent of votes cast to proceed, in late August or September. Lone Star made an unsuccessful $311 million bid two years ago for Australian gas producer AWE Ltd AWE.AX, which was taken over earlier this year by Japan’s Mitsui & Co for $470 million.

2018-05-31,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Molten rock from several lava-spewing fissures opened by Kilauea Volcano crept toward clusters of homes and vacation rentals on the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island on Wednesday, prompting authorities to usher residents out of the area as a precaution. Evacuation of the Vacationland development and adjacent Kapoho community, rebuilt after a destructive eruption of Kilauea in 1960, came on the 28th day of what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The Hawaii County Civil Defense agency issued the advisory as lava flows picked up speed late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday and threatened to cut off a key traffic route into the seaside area on the far eastern flank of the volcano. “Residents in the Kapoho area, including Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland, are advised to evacuate,” the agency said in a morning bulletin. “You are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of Beach Road.” On Tuesday, a lava stream crossed a larger east-west route, Highway 132, as it advanced toward the greater Kapoho area. A separate flow of red-hot molten rock was headed in the direction of the Vacationland community to the south.  Civil defense officials also pointed to severe communication outages in the area due to downed power and phone lines, reinforcing the decision to proceed with evacuation plans immediately rather than wait for a potential emergency. Residents were urged to stay tuned to local radio stations for further updates. The number of people affected by Wednesday’s evacuations was not precisely known, but Kapoho and Vacationland together encompass about 500 homes, mostly vacation rentals, according to Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno. An estimated 2,500 residents in all have been displaced since the eruption began nearly four weeks ago, Magno said. The bulk of evacuees were forced from their homes at the outset, in and around the Leilani Estates community farther west, where concentrations of noxious volcanic gases remain high. Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim on Wednesday renewed an emergency proclamation for 60 more days, allowing construction of temporary shelters and other relief projects to proceed on an expedited basis, without reviews and permits normally required. At least 128 structures on the island have already been destroyed, cut off or otherwise left uninhabitable by lava flows, Kim said. Magno said 75 homes have been demolished. Kilauea’s main crater at the volcano’s summit has continued to periodically belch ash high up into the sky. But National Weather Service meteorologist Tom Birchard told reporters during a conference call that most of the ash was blowing out to sea on the prevailing trade winds, then dissipating quickly. Nevertheless, some ash and fumes have been spouted high enough into the atmosphere to be carried far over the Pacific Ocean, with observers in the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Guam detecting traces of vog - a hazy mix of sulphur dioxide, aerosols, moisture and fine particles, Birchard said. Kilauea rumbled back to life on May 3 as it began extruding lava and toxic gases through a series of cracks in the ground on its eastern flank, marking the latest phase of an eruption cycle that has continued nearly nonstop for 35 years. The occurrence of new lava vents, or fissures, now numbering about two dozen, have been accompanied by flurries of earthquakes and intermittent eruptions from the summit crater, including a magnitude 5.3 tremor measured on Wednesday.

2018-05-31,"(Repeats item issued late Wednesday) * Decision expected to take effect from October or November * Companies with links to U.S. financial system risk penalties * Reliance resumed purchases of Iranian oil in 2016 By Nidhi Verma and Alex Lawler NEW DELHI/LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. Reliance’s move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply. Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others. Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said. A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal. This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November. Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran. In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said. The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. In 2017, Reliance’s oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd. Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union. Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Italy’s Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran. Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants. Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude. After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme. During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit. Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions. Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The company’s global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

2018-05-31,"(Adds details about investment, executive quote, share movement) May 31, (Reuters) - Partners in the Gladstone liquefied natural gas (GLNG) plant will invest more than A$400 million ($303 million) in the Arcadia gas project to help boost GLNG’s gas supply, Australia’s Santos Ltd said on Thursday. The investment in the resource rich Bowen Basin in Queensland state is in addition to A$900 million that GLNG has already earmarked for gas developments in the state in 2018, it said. The deal marks Santos’ first big investment approval since it rejected a $10.8 billion takeover bid by U.S.-based Harbour Energy. The initial phase of the Arcadia development will at its peak deliver in excess of 75 terajoules of gas a day to the GLNG project, Santos said in a statement. GLNG is looking to trim its supply and transportation costs by developing projects in close proximity to each other. “If you want to put downward pressure on gas prices, reducing the cost of supply is a good place to start,” Santos Chief Executive Officer Kevin Gallagher said. Santos operates GLNG. Its partners are France’s Total SA , Malaysia’s Petronas and Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS).

2018-05-31,"SEOUL, May 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped on Thursday, weighed down by a surprise rise in U.S. crude inventories and by expectations that OPEC and other producers could increase output at a meeting in June. Brent crude was down 20 cents at $77.30 per barrel at 0041 GMT, after settling the last session up 2.8 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 20 cents at $68.01 a barrel. In the previous session, it settled up $1.48, or 2.2 percent, at $68.21 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1 million barrels in the week to May 25 to 434.9 million barrels, according to data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute, although analysts had expected a decrease of 525,000 barrels. Data from the Energy Information Administration is due at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) on Thursday, a day later than usual due to a public holiday on Monday. A possible production increase by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members including Russia has been in focus, especially after Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the oil cartel, and Russia have discussed boosting output by some 1 million barrels per day. OPEC and some non-OPEC members have committed to curb their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of 2018, and they will meet in Vienna on June 22 whether or not their commitment should remain unchanged. “With the OPEC meeting still another three weeks away, oil prices are likely to remain sensitive to headlines,” ANZ bank said in a note.

Kilauea rumbled back to life on May 3 as it began extruding lava and toxic gases through a series of cracks in the ground on its eastern flank, marking the latest phase of an eruption cycle that has continued nearly nonstop for 35 years. The occurrence of new lava vents, or fissures, now numbering about two dozen, have been accompanied by flurries of earthquakes and intermittent eruptions from the summit crater. More than 40 homes and other structures have been consumed by lava flows since then.

2018-05-31,"RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A 72-hour strike by Brazilian oil workers halted refineries and rigs on Wednesday, union leaders said, a new blow to President Michel Temer on the heels of a trucker protest that has strangled Latin America’s largest economy for over a week.  The strike by workers demanding changes at state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA is the latest challenge for the company known as Petrobras, whose shares have tumbled nearly 30 percent in two weeks over fears that political interference would unwind recent investor-focused policies. The economic and political storm has shaken the lame duck Temer government ahead of October elections and rattled nerves about the path forward for Petrobras, Latin America’s biggest oil producer. It has also raised the spectre of protests spreading to more sectors as Brazilians vent frustration with the unpopular government and an uneven economic recovery. With truckers protesting over high diesel prices, government sources told Reuters on Tuesday that Temer had been considering scrapping a market-based fuel pricing policy at Petrobras. But by Wednesday morning the president’s office issued a statement saying he would preserve the policy. The oil sector strike included workers on at least 25 of the 46 oil rigs Petrobras operates in the lucrative Campos basin, responsible for nearly half of Brazil’s petroleum production. FUP, Brazil’s largest oil workers’ union, said that seven of those rigs were paralysed. Petrobras did not respond to requests for confirmation. Petrobras said before the strike that the disruptions would not have an immediate major impact on its output or overall operations. Brazil produces about 2.1 million barrels of oil per day. According to a source close to the company, Petrobras has a significant stock of fuel on hand, especially as the 10-day trucker protest prevented significant amounts of fuel from leaving refineries. The truckers’ roadblocks and resulting fuel shortages have halted major industries and hammered exports of everything from beef and soybeans to coffee and cars. Steelmaker Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA, Brazil’s second-largest iron ore exporter, declared force majeure for its mining products due to disrupted supplies of diesel, explosives and food to it mines. The 10-day trucker protest left major cities running short on food, gasoline and medical supplies, and officials warned it would take days to restore supply lines. The automakers industry lobby Anfavea said car assembly plants halted since Friday will start up again on Monday. Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann said the numbers of roadblocks that exceeded 1,000 at the height of the strike had fallen to under 200 by Wednesday night.  “Brazil is returning to normal,” he said at a news conference where he accused owners of transport companies of taking part in what he called a “lockout.” The companies have been slapped with 272 million reais (55.01 million pounds) in fines. Moody’s Investor Service warned that it will take weeks for operations to return to normal in sectors from meatpackers and automakers to airlines and retail.     FUP union said workers did not show up to work on Wednesday at 10 refineries stretching from Manaus in the Amazon to Rio de Janeiro in the southeast. They also walked off the job at plants handling lubricants, nitrogen and shale gas, as well as in the ports of Suape and Paranagua. The oil strike was declared illegal by Brazil’s top labour court late Tuesday, after Petrobras argued it was about politics rather than labour issues. FUP leader Jose Maria Rangel said by phone that the union “will not be intimidated” by judicial decisions, and called the three-day strike a “warning.”  “Our members have already approved us declaring a strike without a fixed end date,” the union said, without providing details on when any longer stoppage may take place.      Unions representing oil workers said they were demanding the resignation of Petrobras’ chief executive, Pedro Parente. They also want the end of the market-based fuel pricing policy and other changes made at Petrobras since Temer took power in 2016. Petrobras said on Wednesday that board member José Alberto de Paula Torres Lima had resigned, citing “personal reasons.” He was one of three board members recruited by an outside agency and added to the board in April in an effort to establish its independence. Petrobras did not respond to questions about his departure.    Parente, on a Tuesday conference call with analysts, said Petrobras was taking action so that any strike would have  minimal or no impact on production and operations.  The company flexed its muscles a bit by announcing on Wednesday that it would raise gasoline prices at refineries by 0.7 percent starting Thursday.

2018-05-31,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel flew to Caracas on Wednesday for his first foreign trip as head of state, a show of solidarity for Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro, whose controversial re-election this month has drawn condemnation in the West. “I pledge to you that no matter how big the challenges, you can count on Cuba today and forever,” Diaz-Canel said after meeting Maduro in the Miraflores presidential palace. “Venezuela now needs our solidarity,” he earlier told Venezuela’s Constituent Assembly, a pro-government legislative superbody.  The United States, the European Union and major Latin American countries have condemned Maduro’s May 20 re-election, saying it did not meet democratic standards.  Two of his rivals were barred from standing and the election board is run by loyalists. The U.S. government imposed new sanctions on the crisis-stricken oil exporter. But China and Russia have warned against meddling in the Socialist-run country, and fellow leftist governments in the region from Cuba to Bolivia have offered their support.  “Your words express the best of the Cuban people and we are forever grateful for the support you have given us,” said Delcy Rodriguez, a senior Maduro ally who heads the Assembly, which critics say has undermined the opposition-controlled legislature, the National Assembly. Maduro was the first foreign leader to meet with Diaz-Canel last month after he succeeded Raul Castro to become president of the Communist-run island. Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest oil reserves, exchanges crude for Cuban medical and other technical services, though deliveries have dropped in recent years during an economic implosion in the country of 30 million people.  “We felt (Maduro’s) victory as our own,” Diaz-Canel said. “Venezuela has supported Cuba in many ways throughout its history. We have a debt of gratitude.” Venezuelan opposition politicians say bilateral relations with Cuba are deeply unfavourable.  “Maduro did not sell the country, he handed it over. NATIONAL SHAME!” tweeted opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido, posting a picture of Diaz-Canel wearing a sash with the yellow blue and red Venezuelan colours on Wednesday. Diaz-Canel flew to Venezuela with his wife Liz Cuesta as first lady, in a break with custom during the nearly 60 years’ rule by the Castro brothers Fidel and Raul who generally travelled without their spouses. Diaz-Canel’s visit came as Cuban authorities faced the chaos of flooding in the wake of Subtropical Storm Alberto that has killed already four people and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands.
