2018-05-09,"(Reuters) - Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) will sell a U.S. gas pipelines business and part of its renewable energy portfolio for a combined $2.5 billion, the Canadian pipeline operator said on Wednesday, achieving the first step in its debt reduction plan. The Calgary-based company is continuing to shop its Canadian midstream assets and has received initial bids valuing the portfolio as high as C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Enbridge Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco told reporters on Wednesday that the company has not received any formal bids for the Canadian midstream assets and declined to comment on indications of interest. Enbridge has been under pressure to sell non-core assets since its $28 billion takeover of U.S.-based Spectra Energy last year. Its long-term debt pile of $60.87 billion as of Dec. 31 has also caused alarm at credit rating agencies. [bit.ly/2EwyF5O] The company said in November it expected to raise upwards of C$3 billion from divestments in 2018, the first sales from a pool of non-core assets worth C$10 billion. The deals announced on Wednesday brought Enbridge close to that goal. The company said it had sealed a C$1.75 billion deal with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) for a 49 percent stake in wind and solar power assets in North America and Germany. The company will also sell Midcoast Operating LP, its U.S. gas pipelines unit, to an affiliate of private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC for $1.12 billion. Midcoast operates facilities to process and treat natural gas and natural gas liquids. “This transaction, in addition to our other funding actions taken, accelerates funding for our secured capital program and gives us increased financial flexibility,” Monaco said in a statement announcing the CPPIB deal. Enbridge said it may yet monetize or sell the remaining renewable stake. Banking sources suggested that Enbridge had offered all its renewables assets for sale to begin with, asking potential buyers to propose the best deal. The company separately said Wednesday that it had filed a formal response to a Minnesota judge’s recommendation that its Line 3 pipeline replacement go ahead but follow the existing right-of-way through the state instead of Enbridge’s preferred route. Enbridge said that if it were to follow the recommended route, the existing pipeline would need to be shut down for nine to 12 months, “negatively impacting Minnesota’s energy supply.” The C$8.2 billion Line 3 replacement would double capacity on the pipeline, which extends from Alberta to Wisconsin,  providing much needed relief to Canada’s oil producers who are struggling with a lack of transportation capacity to get their crude to market. In an interview with Reuters, Bruce Hogg, head of power and renewables at CPPIB, said its longstanding history with Enbridge and the fund’s desire to grow its renewables exposure led to the agreement. “We were having conversations about a broader arrangement and the ability to grow value over time, which was a much more sellable package (to Enbridge) than they initially envisaged,” he said. The pension fund will also provide C$500 million of capital to help finance outstanding construction related to the German offshore wind scheme, and it signed a 50-50 joint venture with Enbridge to invest in future European offshore wind projects. CPPIB also purchased U.S. utility NextEra Energy Partners’ (NEP.N) wind and solar assets in Ontario last month for about $582 million. CIBC Capital Markets and law firm Dentons advised Enbridge on the renewables deal, the statement said. RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup advised CPPIB, sources familiar with the matter said. Citi, along with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, worked with Enbridge on the U.S. midstream sale. Enbridge’s Toronto shares closed up 2.65 percent at C$41.48.

2018-05-09,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Builders in California will be required to fit solar panels on most new homes from 2020 under new building standards adopted on Wednesday, a move that is the first in the United States and could provide a big boost to the solar industry. The decision, adopted unanimously by the five-member California Energy Commission, is part of the state’s effort to fight global climate change. It came despite estimates it would raise the up-front cost of a new home by nearly $10,000 in one of the most expensive parts of the country. The Commission estimated the standards will add about $40 to monthly mortgage payments but will compensate for that by saving residents $80 a month on energy bills. “We cannot let Californians be in homes that are essentially the residential equivalent of gas guzzlers,” Commissioner David Hochschild said ahead of the vote.     The new building codes include updates to building ventilation and lighting standards. They are collectively  expected to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 700,000 metric tons over three years, a level equal to taking 115,000 cars off the road, according to state officials.  The vote was a major win for the solar installation industry, which already counts California as its biggest market. Demand for solar equipment in California could rise by 10 percent to 15 percent because of the new standards, the Energy Commission forecast in a study earlier this year. Solar companies cheered the move, saying they hoped such requirements would one day be adopted in other states, too. “We think it’s another example of California policy preceding what will happen in other markets,” Tom Werner, chief executive of San Jose-based solar company SunPower, said in an interview ahead of the decision. California has one of the most ambitious renewable energy mandates in the country, with a goal of sourcing half of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030. At the end of 2017, it had reached about 30 percent, according to the CEC. Because of such policies, the most populous U.S. state has frequently been at odds with President Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of policies to combat climate change. Governor Jerry Brown is planning a global climate summit this September.     Just 9 percent of single-family detached homes in the state of 39.5 million people currently have solar panels, according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy report the Energy Commission cited.     Buildings that are shaded or have a roof that is too small to accommodate panels will be among those exempt, California Energy Commission spokeswoman Amber Pasricha Beck said.

2018-05-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose more than 3 percent on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from a nuclear accord with Iran, a move that helped lift equity markets as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other oil majors rallied. Contracts for Brent, the global crude benchmark, and its U.S. counterpart climbed to highs last seen in November 2014 after Trump on Tuesday abandoned the deal and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against Iran. Trump’s action raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casts uncertainty over oil supplies in an already tight market. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose $2.08 to settle at $71.14 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled up $2.36 at $77.21. The energy sector in equity markets rallied, helping lift European stocks, a gauge of world equity performance and the broad U.S. market.   “It’s the clear leader today. It’s overwhelming almost all the other sectors in terms of its impact on today’s market action,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) closed up 2.36 percent, Chevron (CVX.N) gained 1.70 percent, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSb.L) added 3.38 percent and BP (BP.L) advanced 3.92 percent. While crude oil prices have rallied over the past 12 months, energy stocks have basically gone nowhere, which helped their gains on Wednesday, Arone said.  U.S. crude since the end of March 2017 surged 46 percent, while the S&P energy sector .SPNY rose 9.2 percent over that period. So far this quarter the energy index is up 12.5 percent. “Now we’re starting to see that gap close, so this could be a bit of a short-term rally for the energy sector,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of equity performance in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.61 percent. Exxon and BP were the second- and third-largest contributors earlier in the session. Technology stars Alphabet (GOOGL.O)  and Facebook (FB.O) later led stocks higher. Energy added the most points to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of regional stocks, which closed up 0.74 percent, led by Royal Dutch Shell and BP. Total (TOTF.PA) was the fifth-largest gainer. On Wall Street the technology sector led stocks higher, but the S&P energy sector .SPNY was the biggest percentage gainer at 2.03 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 182.33 points, or 0.75 percent, to 24,542.54. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 25.87 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,697.79 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 73.00 points, or 1 percent, to 7,339.91. Equities have recently traded in a range on concerns about U.S.-China trade negotiations, differing views between the Federal Reserve and investors over inflation and the economy, and the notion that earnings and growth have peaked, Arone said. “Those things certainly have the market in a bit of a sideways pattern,” he said. The dollar fell from its strongest levels in 2018 against a basket of currencies because of mild profit-taking, but the greenback was expected to resume its rise as a result of solid U.S. economic growth and further monetary tightening by the Fed. A bounce in the euro, which dropped to a low for the year in early trading, helped weaken the dollar. “There’s a little exhaustion with the long-dollar trade, but I don’t think we’ve reached the end of it yet,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, FX and global macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The dollar index .DXY was little changed, with the euro EUR= up 0.1 percent to $1.1850. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.54 percent versus the greenback to 109.70 per dollar. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR rose back above 3 percent, pushing prices down 10/32.  In Europe, the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs hit its widest in nearly six weeks on the possibility a coalition of Italian anti-establishment parties could come to power. The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread widened five basis points immediately after news that 5-Star and the League had said they were holding last-minute talks to try to clinch a coalition deal.  The spread widened to 132.7 basis points, its most since March 29. IT10YT=RR DE10YT=RR Gold prices slid as safe-haven buying failed to kick in after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 for June delivery settled down 70 cents at $1,313 per ounce.  “The fact that the cat is out of the bag and we have the announcement (on Iran) - that has removed some of the geopolitical support for gold,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.

2018-05-09,"(Adds companies that received incentives) By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Oil firms, including Norway’s Statoil, U.S.’ Anadarko Petroleum Corp, China’s CNOOC and Malaysia’s Petronas, have shown interest in Argentina’s auction this year of offshore blocks for exploration and production, the country’s energy minister said on Wednesday. Argentina is still defining the blocks to be included in its auction, expected to receive bids in late November. The South American nation is also giving incentives for oil companies exploring at its large Vaca Muerta shale play to move from pilot to full development phase. Argentina faces growing regional competition as countries with large oil reserves, including Brazil and Mexico, are offering this year a record number of areas while starting a new wave of energy reforms to attract foreign investment. “It’s an unexplored area... We are expecting (to have) some companies already working in Argentina and new companies as well,” Minister Juan Jose Aranguren said on the sidelines of an energy conference. The country last year started creating a new framework for firms to move their projects to the production stage, which is boosting the unconventional gas output. The terms include lower labor costs, reduced taxes on imported drilling equipment and a fixed purchase price for the gas produced. In recent months, six projects in Vaca Muerta operated by France’s Total and Argentina’s Tecpetrol, CGC Combustibles and YPF have been granted access to the incentives for starting the production stage. The government expects 13 more concessions operated by Pan American Energy, YPF, Pluspetrol, Tecpetrol and Capex to adopt the incentive program in the coming months. A $500 million railway project to move raw material and equipment to Vaca Muerta - infrastructure needed by 2021 - is expected to be tendered by the end of May, Aranguren said. As the country’s unconventional gas production increases, Argentina is also in talks with its neighbors Chile and Bolivia to solve its seasonal gas deficit by increasing winter imports from Bolivia while selling its surplus to Chile in the summer. “This is quite a constraint. I’m prepared to pay more (to Bolivia) during the summer if we can adjust the volumes,” the minister said. Argentina under President Mauricio Macri has been pushing to reverse the nation’s oil and gas production decline while re-regulating the retail fuel market. But as global oil prices continue rising, refiners in the country are struggling to avoid transferring the hike to consumers. The minister said he will call oil producers to participate in a program recently agreed with refiners Royal Dutch Shell , Pan American and YPF to defer fuel price increases planned for May and June to the second half the year. “I think they could try to make sale terms easier for refining companies,” Aranguren said.

2018-05-09,"* Trump pulls U.S. out of Iran nuclear deal * Europeans failed to persuade Trump to stay in * Saudi Arabia, Israel hail Trump’s decision * Saudi and Israeli leaders had visited U.S. * GRAPHIC-Iran's nuclear facilities tmsnrt.rs/2K9tVRX By John Irish, Rania El Gamal and Steve Holland PARIS/DUBAI/WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - When Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince visited France in April, he oozed confidence that President Donald Trump would pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal which Riyadh has long opposed. Answering reporters’ questions in Paris, two weeks after talks with Trump in Washington, Prince Mohammed bin Salman compared the deal to the 1938 Munich Agreement which was meant by European powers to appease Nazi Germany but ended in war. Where French, German and British diplomatic efforts failed with Trump, Saudi Arabia’s appear to have succeeded. A source close to Saudi policymakers said Washington and Riyadh, Iran’s main regional rival, had been discussing the 2015 nuclear deal “for some time” before Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States was pulling out of it. The source said it was “obvious” from the Crown Prince’s talks with Trump in the White House on March 20 and a visit to Riyadh a month later by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that there had been a “coordination” of positions. “We were for it and we worked on it,” another Saudi source said of Riyadh’s diplomacy. Also celebrating is Israel, another of Iran’s enemies. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he said was evidence of a secret Iranian nuclear weapons programme on April 30. Most of the purported evidence Netanyahu presented dated to the period before the 2015 accord was signed, although he said Iran had also kept important files on nuclear technology since then, and continued adding to its “nuclear weapons knowledge”. Tehran dismissed Netanyahu as “the boy who cried wolf”, and called his presentation propaganda. Although Israeli officials said they did not know whether Trump had been swayed by the information, the president referred to it in his announcement on Tuesday. Netanyahu had talks with Trump in the White House in March and Israeli diplomats worked hard behind the scenes to get their country’s views across on the deal, intended to prevent Tehran obtaining a nuclear bomb but seen by opponents as flawed. Asked how much of the Israeli ambassador to Washington’s time had been spent arguing the case against the deal, Deputy Minister for Diplomacy Michael Oren told Reuters: “Ball-park guess? Something in the vicinity of 90-plus (percent) ... This issue is, for Netanyahu, paramount.” Trump’s announcement was a blow to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Both tried to change Trump’s mind on Iran during visits to the White House in April, and both failed. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also made a last-minute dash to Washington but did not get to see the president. He put Britain’s case at talks with Pompeo and in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on cable channel Fox News, which Trump regularly watches. Despite their efforts, European leaders knew by mid-April that the chances of persuading Trump to stay in the nuclear deal were fading, European diplomats said. “Macron’s visit was the last resort,” a European official told Reuters in Brussels, referring to the French leader’s talks with Trump in the White House on April 24. Describing the last month of diplomacy as “disastrous”, the official said: “For weeks all the indications from the White House and State Department were: ‘He’s out (of the deal)’.” On Wednesday, the European allies were seeking to salvage the nuclear deal and preserve their business with Iran. Trump’s message to the Europeans in the run-up to his announcement was that they must come up with a way to toughen the nuclear deal if the United States was to remain in it, said sources familiar with the discussions. He pressed for a separate deal to go alongside the nuclear agreement that would address other U.S. concerns about Iran such as its ballistic missile program, which was not covered in the 2015 accord, they said. Progress was made in the negotiations, but not enough to sway Trump. The sources familiar with the debate said Trump wanted a separate agreement with the other main signatories of the original deal — France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia. But Berlin said the agreement would have to be submitted to a European Union body for approval, and this appeared to stall the effort, they said. Pompeo told the German and British foreign ministers and a senior French official by telephone last Friday that Washington would no longer pursue the process with Europe. The European and U.S. positions were too far apart on the so-called sunset clauses allowing for some restriction on Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme to be lifted. By midway through last week, European diplomats “felt like we were going through the motions,” a European official said. Some European diplomats believed any chance of persuading Trump to stay in the deal had gone even before Macron visited Washington. They saw Pompeo’s appointment in March as a deadly blow, and it was quickly followed by the arrival in the White House of John Bolton, another Iran hawk, as national security adviser. Rex Tillerson, the previous secretary of state, had seen value in staying in the deal, as did Defense Secretary James Mattis. The president reluctantly agreed to give the deal more time in April 2017 when an initial renewal deadline approached. But by the next deadline, last July, Trump was furious at aides for trying to persuade him to stay in the deal, a source familiar with the debate said. “You mean you had three months, and you didn’t do anything?” he told them, the source said. In October, Trump announced he would not permit U.S. certification of Iranian compliance with the deal, setting the United States on the path that it reached on Tuesday. A White House official said that in the days leading up to the president’s announcement, top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk Trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up. By then, European officials were despondent, a European diplomat said. “We realised we have to buy time. On the eve of the Trump decision, all we could do is to tell the Iranians: don’t do anything rash,” the diplomat said. Writing by Steve Holland and Timothy Heritage; Additional

2018-05-09,"(Adds Iran nuclear deal comment) By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers will not boost output to offset any global oil squeeze after President Donald Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, one of the industry’s most prominent executives said on Wednesday. The withdrawal, alongside Trump’s decision to impose the “highest level” of sanctions on Iran, sent Brent and U.S. benchmark oil prices up more than 3 percent on Wednesday. Iran, the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumps 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd). U.S. shale producers, which in the past year have increased output by nearly 2 million bpd, to about 7 million bpd, are not likely to act to fill that void should Iranian exports slip, said Mark Papa, chief executive of Centennial Resource Development Inc. “I don’t think it’s going to change what U.S. producers do at all,” Papa told Reuters in Houston after a meeting with the board of directors of national oil company Saudi Aramco, which is holding a regularly scheduled gathering this week in Houston. Many U.S. shale producers have set their 2018 spending budgets and are wary of boosting spending to pump more as their shareholders call for higher dividends and share buybacks. For example, Occidental Petroleum Corp, the largest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, said on Wednesday it would allocate cash from rising oil prices to shareholder returns, and has no plans to add to capital expenses. Iran’s oil production fell by around 1 million bpd during the last round of sanctions, but the country re-emerged as a major oil exporter to Asia after sanctions were lifted in January 2016. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, is studying Trump’s decision but will not act alone to fill any supply gap, a source told Reuters. Papa, who declined to comment on the Aramco meeting, was joined by Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources Inc, the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale. The pair left the meeting with Saudi Aramco gift bags. Papa and Hamm are set to speak next month at an OPEC seminar ahead of an oil ministers’ meeting in Vienna. “I’m going to go talk about what the expectations are for U.S. shale oil production,” Papa said in a brief interview.

2018-05-09,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES May 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - B uilders in California will be required to fit solar panels on most new homes from 2020 under a new rule adopted on Wednesday, the first of its kind in the United States. The far-reaching standards, adopted unanimously by the five-member California Energy Commission, require that new residential buildings in the state be equipped with the panels. “We cannot let Californians be in homes that are essentially the residential equivalent of gas guzzlers,” Energy Commissioner David Hochschild said ahead of the vote. Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the University of California at Berkeley’s School of Law, said the new rule would lower the price of solar panels nationwide as manufacturers tapped into California’s huge consumer base. “This is pretty landmark,” he said by phone. “It helps basically provide a market for solar.” The United States’ most populous state has frequently been at odds with President Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of policies to combat climate change. Governor Jerry Brown is planning a global climate summit this September. Nine percent of single-family detached homes in the state of 39.5 million people currently have solar panels, according to a 2017 U.S. Department of Energy report the Energy Commission cited. The renewable energy push is expected to cut California’s household emissions, which stood at 12 percent of the state’s total emissions in 2015. Most stem from natural gas-generated electricity, a process that emits heat-trapping carbon dioxide. Constructing a home in accordance with the new rules will add about $9,500 in immediate costs, according to estimates by the Energy Commission. It will save homeowners about $19,000 in energy and maintenance costs over 30 years, Energy Commission spokeswoman Amber Pasricha Beck told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Buildings that are shaded or have a roof that is too small to accommodate panels will be among those exempt, Pasricha Beck said.

The spread widened to 132.7 basis points, its most since March 29. Gold prices slid as safe-haven buying failed to kick in after the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down 70 cents at $1,313 per ounce. “The fact that the cat is out of the bag and we have the announcement (on Iran) - that has removed some of the geopolitical support for gold,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.

2018-05-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 3 percent on Wednesday and hit fresh 3-1/2 year highs after a bigger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. oil inventories extended gains from the United States’ decision to quit a nuclear deal with Iran.      Ignoring pleas by allies, U.S. President Trump on Tuesday pulled out of a 2015 international deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member, making investors nervous about rising risks of conflict in the Middle East and about oil supplies in a tight market. News of the deal prompted a volatile trading session on Tuesday in the heaviest volumes for front-month U.S. crude futures since Nov. 30, 2016. The United States will likely re-impose sanctions against Iran after 180 days, unless some other agreement is reached. Brent crude futures rose $2.36, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $77.21 a barrel. The global benchmark hit a session high of $77.43, the highest since November 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $2.08 to settle at $71.14 a barrel, a 3-percent gain. Both contracts notched their biggest daily percentage gain in a month.  Prices extended gains after U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed domestic crude inventories fell 2.2 million barrels in the latest week, far exceeding forecasts for a decrease of 719,000 barrels. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 955,000 barrels per day to 5.4 million bpd, the lowest since mid-February, the EIA data showed. U.S. gasoline futures hit a high of $2.1701 a gallon, the highest since Hurricane Harvey sent prices surging in August. U.S. heating oil futures surged to $2.2258 a gallon, the highest since February 2015.  “A whopping drop in imports has resulted in a moderate draw to crude stocks, while a drop in both gasoline and distillates inventories round out a broadly supportive report,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait said their countries will work closely with major OPEC and non-OPEC producers to lessen the impact of any supply shortages after U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in 2016 after international sanctions against it were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program. The country, the third-biggest producer of crude within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, exported about 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in April. Analysts’ estimates of the possible reduction in Iranian crude supplies as a result of any new U.S. sanctions range from 200,000 bpd to 1 million bpd. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a note that Trump’s announcement brought upside risks to its forecast that Brent crude will hit $82.50 a barrel by the summer. Several refiners in Asia said they were seeking alternatives to Iranian supplies. A number of countries have already cut reliance on Iranian oil, as well as other “traditional” sources of supply, due to a surge in cheaper U.S. crude exports. Volumes jumped for all key crude oil futures contracts as investors took new positions and refiners hedged to protect themselves from higher feedstock prices.

Trump said on Tuesday that the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for measures restricting its nuclear programme, did not go far enough in removing the threat posed by Tehran to the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East. Luaibi said the matter was political and that he hoped it would not affect oil supplies from the Gulf. “We hope the region will remain stable and I personally think this matter will not affect oil supplies from the Gulf,” he said.

2018-05-09,"PARIS (Reuters) - Electric power utility EDF (EDF.PA) said improved availability of its French nuclear power stations and higher tariffs boosted first-quarter sales by 3.7 percent to 20.45 billion euros. Chief financial officer Xavier Girre told analysts that EDF expects the French State Council to decide on regulated power tariffs in coming weeks, after an adviser to the Council last week recommended scrapping the tariffs, under which EDF sells power to most of its clients. He declined to comment on the possible impact for EDF.  A decade after the French power market was opened to competition, EDF still sells about 85 percent of all electricity in France, with competitors such as Direct Energie DIREN.PA (TOTF.PA) trying to woo clients with market-based offers.  The long-delayed scrapping of regulated tariffs could speed up the client exodus at EDF, which lost nearly 1 million customers last year.  EDF said first-quarter nuclear electricity production in France rose 4.1 percent to 113 terawatt-hour (TWH) - in line with its forecast for nuclear output greater than 395 TWh in 2018 - as nearly all its reactors are now back on line following a series of safety-related outages last year. The company also confirmed its 2018 earnings guidance for core earnings of 14.6 to 15.3 billion euros and cash flow that is slightly positive or close to balance, excluding investments in its Linky smart meters and asset disposals. Sales from French generation and supply were up 0.2 percent to 7.9 billion euros, sales from regulated activities up 6.7 percent to 5.2 billion euros, UK sales up 0.4 percent to 2.6 billion euros and sales in Italy were up 4.8 percent to 2.6 billion euros.  EDF also for the first time detailed the revenues of its Dalkia energy services unit and its EDF Energies Nouvelles unit, which had first-quarter revenues of 1.2 billion euros and 379 million euros respectively.  While overall first-quarter sales were up 3.7 percent from a restated 19.7 billion euros in Q1 2017, they were down 3.2 percent compared to the 21.13 billion euro first-quarter revenue published a year ago.  Girre said new accounting rules no longer allow EDF to recognise the delivery component of energy supply contracts and some market trading activities as revenue. The revenue reduction is offset by a similar reduction in fuel and energy purchases and will have no impact on core earnings, he added.

2018-05-09,"(Adds hydropower and generation details) May 9 (Reuters) - California’s electric grid operator has forecast power supplies will be tight this summer due to below average hydropower production and reduced generation, according to an assessment released on Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator (ISO), the grid operator, said the system’s capacity to serve consumers will be tight in high-load periods in the summer months, especially during the evenings of hot days when solar power dissipates. But it forecast only “an extremely low probability it will be forced to initiate rotating power outages” this summer. The ISO, which forecast peak demand during the summer would be about the same as last year, said hydropower production is expected to be down 1,300 megawatts (MW) by late summer compared with 2017’s above-normal hydropower output. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. In addition, the ISO said natural gas-powered generation will see a drop of about 800 MW due to plant retirements. The ISO assessment came a few days after a group of state regulators and regional power firms, including the ISO, released a technical report warning of a “moderate threat” to gas and electric reliability this summer and a “more serious threat” next winter because the Southern California Gas (SoCalGas) system is operating at less than full capacity. SoCalGas cautioned that pipeline outages and restrictions on its giant Aliso Canyon gas storage facility in Los Angeles, which suffered a devastating leak between October 2015 and February 2016, could reduce its ability to deliver gas to fuel power generation facilities in Southern California this summer and winter. SoCalGas is a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy. The ISO projected there will be 51,947 MW of generation available to serve demand this summer with peak usage expected to reach 46,625 MW under normal conditions. If temperatures are warmer than normal, as they were last year, the ISO said supply margins will tighten significantly as consumers crank up their air conditioners. Last year, peak demand hit 50,116 MW in September. The California Department of Water Resources said water content of snowpack in the mountains was just 51 percent of average as of April 2. In addition, the ISO said 860 MW of generation retired since last summer, including 837 MW of gas-fired resources. Energy firms added 692 MW of new power sources since last year but 60 percent of that was solar, which will not supply much when supplies are tight in the evenings. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-05-09,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s newly elected Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Wednesday he would meet Russian President Vladimir Putin next week on the sidelines of a summit of the Russia-led economic union summit in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Opposition leader Pashinyan was elected prime minister by Armenia’s parliament on Tuesday, capping a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism. After being installed as prime minister, Pashinyan said he hoped to meet Putin for talks soon. The Kremlin said Putin had sent Pashinyan a telegram congratulating him on his appointment. “It’s confirmed now that I’ll meet Putin on May 14 in Sochi ... and we will continue discussions, which we’ve started during a telephone conversation,” Pashinyan said in a video posted on his Facebook page. The post was recorded in a helicopter on his way back to Yerevan from Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan, run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence from Baku during a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991. Moscow, which has a military base in Armenia, is wary of an uncontrolled change of power which would pull the country out of its orbit, but Pashinyan has offered assurances that he will not break with the Kremlin.

2018-05-09,"YEREVAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Armenia’s newly elected Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan signalled continuity on Wednesday in policy on the long-running issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, saying he was ready for more talks with Azerbaijan but wanted the separatists to take part too. Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan, is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence from Baku during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991. Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of conducting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the Azeri-Armenian border. “We are ready to continue peaceful talks,” Pashinyan told a news conference in the breakaway region’s capital, Stepanakert, after meeting its leader Bako Sahakyan. Pashinyan underlined the importance of Karabakh for Yerevan by travelling to the region just hours after being elected prime minister by Armenia’s parliament on Tuesday. This capped a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism in the ex-Soviet republic. “I’m ready to hold talks with Azerbaijan’s president on behalf of Armenia, but the leadership of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) should hold talks on behalf of Artsakh,” he said. Armenian ex-president Serzh Sarksyan, whose election as prime minister a month ago triggered the mass protests led by Pashinyan, has held several meetings with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev over Nagorno-Karabakh in the past. Sarksyan also sought the participation of the separatists in the negotiations, but Azerbaijan was opposed to this. Pashinyan said on Wednesday that “mutual concessions would be possible only after recognition of the right of the Nagorno-Karabakh people to self-determination.” Nagorno-Karabakh survives almost totally on budget support from Armenia and donations from the large Armenian diaspora. Skirmishes between majority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan have intensified in the past three years and at least 200 people were killed in a flare-up in April 2016, leaving bilateral relations at their worst in years. The conflict has worried Western and regional countries in part because it could cause instability in the South Caucasus, which serves as a corridor for pipelines transporting oil and gas to world markets.

2018-05-09,"* Riyadh can offset oil disruption after US quits Iran deal * Will not produce more oil “single-handedly” * Consulting with UAE, Russia over market situation * Too early to assess impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran oil (Adds Breakingviews link) By Rania El Gamal DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is monitoring the impact of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on oil supplies and is ready to offset any shortage but it will not act alone to fill the gap, an OPEC source familiar with the kingdom’s oil thinking said. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. The original agreement had lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. During the last round of sanctions, Iran’s oil supplies fell by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd), but the country re-emerged as a major oil exporter, especially to refiners in Asia, after sanctions were lifted in January 2016. “People shouldn’t take it for granted that Saudi Arabia will produce more oil single-handedly. We need to assess first the impact if there is any, in terms of disruption, in terms of a reduction of Iran’s production,” the OPEC source said on Wednesday. “We have managed to put together this new alliance between OPEC and non-OPEC. Saudi Arabia will not in any way act independently of its partners.” Riyadh is working closely with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which holds OPEC’s presidency in 2018 and non-OPEC producer Russia for “coordination and market consultations,” the OPEC source said. He said any action would be taken in coordination with all OPEC and non-OPEC partners, if needed. OPEC’s oil supply-cutting deal with non-OPEC producers such as Russia has helped to clear a global oil supply glut and boost prices. The agreement is due to expire at the end of 2018. OPEC officials from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia along with few other producers in the pact are due to meet in Saudi Arabia on May 22-23 as part of a monthly meeting for the Joint Technical Committee which monitors the oil market. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter and top OPEC producer, is concerned about any negative impact from the potential oil supply shortage for oil-consuming countries, the OPEC source said. But Saudi Arabia has enough oil production capacity - currently at 12 million barrels per day (bpd) — to maintain oil market stability, the OPEC source also said. Iran produces about 3.8 million bpd. Since the Iran nuclear deal went into effect, its exports have risen to about 2.5 million bpd, from less than 1 million bpd. A majority goes to Asia, with Europe receiving about 600,000 bpd. Analysts now expect Iran’s supplies to fall by between 200,000 bpd and 1 million bpd, depending on how many other countries fall in line with Washington. Expectations that new U.S. sanctions could hit Iranian crude exports and feed tensions in the Middle East had pushed oil prices higher in the past few weeks. Brent crude was trading about $77 at a 3-1/2 year high on Wednesday, raising concerns that prices were going too high too fast. Trump accused OPEC last month of “artificially” boosting oil prices in a message on Twitter, the first time he has mentioned OPEC on social media. His tweet was seen by OPEC sources as the U.S. president’s way to appease a domestic audience unhappy about a rise in gasoline prices. A key U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia welcomed Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran and to reimpose economic sanctions. Riyadh also said it would work with OPEC and non-OPEC to lessen the impact of oil shortages in a clear indication that the country has been coordinating with Washington ahead of time, sources familiar with the matter said. “You need to work with your partners in dealing with any potential effect on supply,” the OPEC source said. “But it should be done in a collective coordinated way and that can only happen when you start to be able to assess what would be the impact.” OPEC and non-OPEC meet next in June and they are widely expected to keep supply curbs in place until the end of 2018. But a drop in Iranian exports due to U.S. sanctions, plus supply disruptions in other OPEC members, such as Venezuela, could reduce supply more than planned, leading to a potential price spike. But the OPEC source said a rise in prices due to the market’s worries about supply should not be the parameter for OPEC to adjust output. The OPEC source said any decision in June to raise output “should be driven by a potential physical shortage or reduction in production from any oil supply source not only Iran.” “You only handle (output) when you have a semi-clear idea of what would be the potential impact. It is too early now to do that,” the source said. He also said Saudi Arabia does not expect any physical impact on the oil market from the U.S. Iran sanctions until the third or fourth quarter of this year. OPEC’s objective its still to reduce global oil inventories to an acceptable level and any adjustment in production targets should be done in a coordinated way, the OPEC source said. “This way you do not disrupt a mechanism that we have worked hard to put together and to sustain just to address a short-term issue,” the source said.

2018-05-09,"OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - Voters in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will elect their next provincial leader on June 7, with the right-of-center Conservatives leading opinion polls over the incumbent Liberals. The following are some key facts about the three major candidates: Wynne, 64, has served as the Ontario premier since 2013 when she won the party’s leadership race after the previous Liberal premier, Dalton McGuinty, resigned amid the fallout from a decision to cancel the construction of gas plants near Toronto. The decision to privatize a portion of the province’s electric utility, Hydro One, has been one of the hallmarks of Wynne’s time as premier. Some have blamed the move for driving up Ontarians’ electricity bills, which has hurt Wynne in opinion polls. Wynne has also raised the minimum wage, implemented a free prescription drug plan for those aged 24 and under, and has promised free childcare for preschoolers in 2020. Born in Toronto, Wynne studied linguistics and education, and was elected as a public school trustee in Toronto in 2000 before entering provincial politics in 2003. Wynne is both the first female premier and first openly gay premier the province has had. Businessman and former Toronto City Councillor Doug Ford was elected leader of the provincial Progressive Conservatives in March after the former party head resigned following accusations of sexual misconduct. Ford, 53, is the older brother of the late Rob Ford, Toronto’s former mayor who admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in office. Ford unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2014 when Rob withdrew after he was diagnosed with cancer. Ford, who has been compared to U.S. President Donald Trump, is known for speaking off the cuff and has campaigned on the slogan, “For the people.” Among Ford’s campaign promises, he has vowed to lower the province’s corporate tax rate and eliminate the carbon cap-and-trade system. Horwath has been the leader of the left-of-center New Democrats since 2009 and is the first woman to head the provincial party. Horwath served three terms as a city councillor in her hometown of Hamilton, southwest of Toronto, before being elected to the Ontario legislature in 2004. Horwath, 55, has campaigned on plans to create a province-wide drug and dental coverage plan, return Hydro One to public ownership and increase the corporate tax rate for large companies.

2018-05-09,"OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will hold an election on June 7, with the center-right Progressive Conservative Party headed by Doug Ford leading in opinion polls. While Ford has yet to reveal his entire platform, the following are some of the promises from the campaign trail so far: Ford said last month he would cut Ontario’s corporate tax rate to 10.5 percent from 11.5 percent to boost job growth and the economy. Ford said he would introduce an income tax credit so that low-income workers would not pay income tax. He plans to scrap the current provincial Liberal government’s planned minimum wage increase that would bring wages up to C$15 ($11.57) an hour from C$14 next year. The Conservatives also plan to introduce a new childcare rebate for parents with children under the age of 15 that will cover expenses of up to C$6,750 per child a year, with the benefit weighted toward low-income families. Ford plans to eliminate the province’s current carbon cap-and-trade system that puts limits on how much pollution companies can emit and allows them to trade credits in auctions. Ford has also vowed to fight the federal government’s planned nationwide tax on carbon emissions, expected to take effect next year for provinces that do not already have acceptable regimes in place. Ford has promised to cut spending by at least C$6 billion a year by finding efficiencies, but said he would not be able to balance Ontario’s budget in his first year in power. He has also said he would launch an independent inquiry into the Liberal government’s books. The Liberal government said in its March budget it will return to deficit in the current fiscal year before getting back to balance in 2024-25. Ford has suggested he is open to privatization when it comes to the sale of recreational marijuana, though he later appeared to back away from that, saying the province has to be careful in regulating the market.

2018-05-09,"MILAN (Reuters) - European shares were supported on Wednesday by strength in oil stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran’s nuclear agreement, boosting crude prices. While some well-received earnings updates also provided support, shares in companies with exposure to Iran fell, with plane maker Airbus <AIR .PA> and car makers Renault and PSA all trading down more than 1 percent. By 0823 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 had risen nearly 0.2 percent to fresh three-month highs, while higher crude prices helped the commodity-stocks-heavy FTSE index gain 0.4 percent. The oil and gas index was the biggest sectoral gainer, up 1.5 percent at a three-year high as crude rallied after Trump’s move on Iran raised the risk of conflict in the Middle East and cast uncertainty over global supplies. “Whilst other signatories remain onboard, Trump’s decision potentially turns the geopolitical instability dial up a notch, especially in the Middle East,” said Accendo Markets analysts in a note. Shares in oil majors Total, Royal Dutch Shell and Eni were all trading up between 1.1 and 2.3 percent. But higher oil prices weighed on travel stocks like airlines, whose sector index was also hit by a 1.8 drop in Europe’s largest travel and tourism group TUI Group, as its earnings update failed to inspire.    Elsewhere, Siemens rose 4.6 percent after the German industrial giant raised its full year profit guidance, offsetting worries over exposure to Iran. Analysts at Jefferies reiterated their buy rating on the stock, saying the quarterly performance of Siemens was strong apart from the results of its power and gas (PG) business.  “This was a very mixed picture from Siemens with PG taking the shine off what were actually very good results... with the core automation businesses doing especially well,” they wrote. In the consumer sector, AB Inbev gained 2.3 percent after a reassuring quarterly update from the world’s largest brewer, while Imperial Brands advanced 4.3 percent after the tobacco company posted results that were slightly ahead of estimates. Equities in Europe have recently outperformed Wall Street, supported by a weakening euro against a surging dollar, while the earnings season has also been supportive.  According to Thomson Reuters data, earnings beats on the MSCI EMU index outnumbered missed by nearly 6 to 3 so far, with first quarter growth seen at 3.2 percent in local currency.  In M&A news, Vodafone agreed to pay $21.8 billion to buy Liberty Global’s assets in Germany and a number of other countries to take on rivals with a broader offer of superfast cable TV, broadband and mobile. “We see the move (if completed) as positive strategically in terms of creating a stronger, converged operator,” said UBS analysts, adding that the absence of an equity issuance to fund the deal was a positive.

2018-05-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Algeria’s state energy firm Sonatrach plans to buy ExxonMobil’s (XOM.N) 175,000 barrel-per-day Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy, the companies said on Wednesday, as the North African oil producer seeks to cut its hefty fuel bills.  Algeria, which needs to meet surging domestic fuel demand, paid $800 million for fuel imports in 2016 but that more than tripled in 2017 to a record $2.5 billion, because of refining problems. Exxon’s Italian subsidiary said the deal included three fuel storage terminals and related pipelines in Augusta, Palermo and Naples, and the transaction was expected to close at the end of 2018. Financial terms were not disclosed.  The deal would be Sonatrach’s first overseas acquisition, reflecting a more flexible and open approach under CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour.  The Augusta refinery is able to process Sahara blend and residual fuel from Algeria’s Skikda plant, “and will be directly integrated into Sonatrach’s refinery system”, the Algerian company said in a statement. “It will also be able to process directly products that are surplus in Algeria in order to re-import products that are in deficit like diesel and petrol,” Sonatrach said. Ould Kaddour said Sicily made sense geographically and because of “possible synergies with Skikda refinery”.      “We are extremely proud to make our first investment in international refining in Italy,” Ould Kaddour said. Ould Kaddour also told French news outlet Les Echos that Sonatrach was about to sign a deal with French oil company Total (TOTF.PA) to build a petrochemical plant in Algeria. “It will be the first unit to produce propylene and polypropylene in Algeria ... most of it will be exported to Europe,” Ould Kaddour told Les Echos. A spokesman for Total declined to comment.  Algeria has struggled to attract foreign investment in recent years and has seen its oil and gas production stagnate.  Since Ould Kaddour took the helm of Sonatrach in March last year, he has been trying to make Sonatrach’s culture more business-friendly and resolve long-standing legal disputes with foreign companies. Sonatrach said in January it had signed a crude for refined products deal with the world’s largest oil trader Vitol to cut its fuel bills, the first deal of its kind in decades. It also said it was looking to invest in a foreign refinery.

The shutdown will come into effect at midnight on Friday. Security forces will also suspend travel between provinces and restrict the movement of vehicles on Saturday, before easing the measures “gradually” after polls close, a spokesman for the committee told a news conference. Islamic State militants have threatened to carry out attacks ahead of the elections and have warned Sunni Arabs not to participate. The group swept through a third of Iraqi territory in 2014, but all towns and villages were recaptured after more than three years of fighting by government and Kurdish forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition, and Shi’ite militias backed by Iran. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared nationwide victory over Islamic State in December, five months after his forces recaptured Iraq’s main northern city Mosul in a protracted battle with the jihadist militants. Islamic State, however, continues to carry out bombings, assassinations and ambushes, and remains active in neighbouring Syria where it has also lost most of its territory.

2018-05-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cracks in the core of a Scottish nuclear reactor could signal that most of Britain’s ageing plants will not be able to supply the country with much needed power for as long as predicted. Nuclear reactors generate just over 20 percent of Britain’s electricity and even before EDF Energy said last week it would need to shut down one of two reactors at the Hunterston B plant, almost half of that capacity was scheduled to go offline by 2025. “These reactors are over 40 years old. This is a generic defect which cannot be fixed so it would not surprise me if the older plants would all need to close within the next few years,” said John Large, an independent nuclear engineering consultant. Britain’s electricity generation is under scrutiny due to a plan to close coal-fired power plants by 2025 and weak economic conditions for investment in new gas plants. There are also doubts about the timetable for EDF’s Hinkley Point C nuclear plant which is not expected to come online until the end of 2025, and the proposed Sizewell C plant, which is not even being built yet. French utility EDF said the Hunterston B shutdown was due to new cracks developing faster than expected in graphite bricks in one reactor’s core. These bricks are used in all 14 advanced gas-cooled nuclear reactors (AGRs) in Britain which drive seven out of eight of the country’s plants. “We believe that most of the AGRs will have their life limited by the progression of cracking,” Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) says on its website, adding that this presents “unique challenges”. The bricks cannot be repaired or replaced and EDF says it will work with the ONR to show there would be no danger posed even in the event of an earthquake or other disruption. “The longer-term safety case will build on work already completed and EDF Energy expects that this will demonstrate that there are large safety margins both now and for the projected reactor lifetime,” EDF Energy said. EDF has not changed its lifetime forecasts for Hunterston B, which is due to be decommissioned in 2023, although it predicts the reactor will remain shut until mid-November. But experts such as Large, whose consultancy Large and Associates has worked for Britain’s Atomic Energy Authority and environmental group Greenpeace, says this is over optimistic.  The graphite bricks form channels which contain nuclear fuel and the reactor control rods, while allowing carbon dioxide coolant to remove heat from the reactor fuel and core. They crack with age, but cannot be replaced due to their location. Britain’s ONR says the properties of the bricks change over time due to interaction with radiation and the reactor coolant. There are around 3,000 graphite bricks in each reactor core which are bound by steel and contained in a concrete pressure vessel which is over three metres thick. Control rods are inserted through channels in the core to control the reaction and also used to shut down the reactor. Keyway root cracking, as found at Hunterston B, is caused by tension in the graphite at the outer surface of the bricks due to changes in their internal stress. This can then progressively crack many bricks across the core. John Loughhead, chief scientific adviser to the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said the micro-cracks have grown a little more quickly than projected and EDF Energy will now be working to understand how to make prediction of future growth more accurate. “These reactors are in the later stages of their life but it is too early to be getting worried that this is the beginning of the end,” he added.  Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B are Britain’s oldest nuclear plants - each with two reactors - commissioned in 1976.  One of Hinkley Point B’s two reactors is also offline - for a scheduled outage during which routine inspections of the graphite will also take place. Reactors at two of EDF Energy’s other plants in Britain - Heysham 1 and Hartlepool - were taken offline in 2014 after cracks on a boiler spine were found at one of them, caused by high operating temperatures. In France, EDF’s nuclear plants provide up to 75 percent of the country’s power needs but the fleet has been dogged by repeated shutdowns and inspections over the integrity of some components. Elsewhere in Europe, Belgium’s regulator ordered production to be stopped at two nuclear reactors - not operated by EDF - in 2012 after finding indications of tiny cracks in core tanks.  EDF Energy said the shutdown at the Hunterston B reactor  would result in a forecast reduction of 3 terrawatt hours in its total nuclear output for this year. Based on current UK baseload power prices, that could equate to a loss of around 120 million pounds. The firm also says it has spent more than 100 million pounds in the last five years on graphite research. “The thing which will close (these reactors) down in the end will be the cost of ensuring safety. It is possible to make a safety case for a significant amount of cracked bricks but it takes time and costs money,” said Barry Marsden, professor of nuclear graphite technology at the University of Manchester.

2018-05-09,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - In 1996, when the United States tried to penalise foreign companies trading with Cuba, the European Union forced Washington to back down by threatening retaliatory sanctions. Two decades later, the European Union is being driven to threaten such measures again, over Iran, and this time may follow through after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and world powers and reimposed an array of wide sanctions on the Islamic Republic. This left dismayed European allies scrambling to salvage the international nuclear pact as Tehran said Trump had made a mistake and proved Washington could not be trusted. The EU’s so-called blocking statute is the most powerful tool at its immediate disposal because it bans any EU company from complying with U.S. sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce American penalties. But it has never been used and is seen by European governments more as a political weapon than a regulation because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce, serving mainly as a warning to the United States. The international reach of the U.S. financial system and the U.S. presence of many European companies also raise questions about its effectiveness. “It is a technical tool that worked with (U.S. President Bill) Clinton because it was coupled with a political strategy,” said one senior EU source involved in Iran negotiations, referring to Clinton’s decision to waive extra-territorial sanctions on EU companies related to Cuba, Iran and Libya. EU officials say they are revamping the blocking statute to encompass Trump’s May 8 decision to revive Iran-related sanctions, after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s lifeblood oil sector and transactions with its central bank. “The blocking statute is one of the main options; it’s being updated to make it ready,” said a second senior EU official. European commissioners are expected to decide whether to go ahead next week in Brussels, setting the stage for EU government leaders to take a final decision at a summit in Sofia on May 17.   But diplomats say it will be difficult to gain the agreement of all 28 EU states. The blocking statute threat has less weight than in Clinton’s era because U.S. sanctions targeting financial transactions have become more robust and costly for EU firms. European companies with big operations in the United States, such as Shell (RDSa.L), are pressuring their governments instead to pursue waivers on a case-by-case basis. Europeans are most worried about how to sustain incentives for Iran to stick to the groundbreaking accord signed by world powers in July 2015, which lifted international sanctions on Iran in 2016 in return for Tehran shutting down its capacity, under strict surveillance by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, to stockpile enriched uranium for a possible atomic bomb. Trump denounced the accord, completed under his predecessor Barack Obama, as a “horrible, one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made” as it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme or its role in Middle East conflicts. The deal’s proponents say it is crucial to forestalling a nuclear Iran and preventing wider war in the Middle East. “The issue of incentives (to keep Iran in the deal) is completely absent from U.S. thinking. In meeting with U.S. diplomats, it’s all about confrontation and isolation (of Tehran),” another official said.  Without the carrot of economic benefits, the EU worries it will also lose influence over Iran. Once Iran’s top trading partner and its second-biggest oil customer, the EU has sought to pour hundreds of billions of euros into the Islamic Republic since the bloc, along with the United Nations and United States, lifted blanket economic sanctions in 2016 that had lamed the Iranian economy. Iran’s exports of mainly fuel and other energy products to the EU in 2016 jumped 344 percent to 5.5 billion euros ($6.58 billion) compared with the previous year, while investment in Iran jumped to more than 20 billion euros. European Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete will meet Iranian officials in Tehran during a three-day trip from May 18 to try to reassure Iran and strengthen energy relations.  Other EU measures to try to keep EU money flowing into Iran include coordinating and increasing EU governments’ export guarantee credits.  That could allow more euro-denominated loans, as well as free the European Investment Bank to invest in Iran for the first time. For its part, Italy has signed a framework credit agreement with Iran to fund investments worth up to 5 billion euros for projects carried out jointly by Italian and Iranian companies. France is considering a similar agreement.

2018-05-09,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON) * Oil at 3-1/2-year high as Trump move threatens global supply * World stocks rise, lifted by the energy sector * Dollar hits new 2018 high before edging lower By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices rose to 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran, a move that helped lift equity markets as Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other oil majors rallied. Contracts for Brent, the global crude benchmark, and for the U.S. benchmark jumped almost 3 percent to highs last seen in November 2014 after Trump on Tuesday abandoned the deal and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against Iran. Trump’s move raises the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casts uncertainty over oil supplies in an already tight market. U.S. crude rose $1.95 to $71.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.09, up $2.24. The energy sector in equity markets rallied, helping lift European stocks, a gauge of world equity performance and the broad U.S. market on Wall Street. “It’s the clear leader today. It’s overwhelming almost all the other sectors in terms of its impact on today’s market action,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. Exxon Mobil rose 1.65 percent, Chevron gained 1.36 percent, Royal Dutch Shell rose 3.38 percent and BP rose 3.92 percent. While crude oil prices have rallied over the past 12 months, energy stocks have basically gone nowhere, which is helping their gains on Wednesday, Arone said. “Now we’re starting to see that gap close, so this could be a bit of a short-term rally for the energy sector,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of equity performance in 47 countries gained 0.25 percent, with Exxon and BP the second- and third-largest contributors. Energy added the most points to the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of regional stocks, rising 0.65 percent with Royal Dutch Shell and BP leading shares higher. On Wall Street, stocks traded higher to mixed, but the S&P energy sector gained 2.1 percent, led by Exxon Mobil. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.19 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,370.4. the S&P 500 gained 6.71 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,678.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.72 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,273.62. Equities have traded in a range recently on concerns about U.S.-China trade negotiations, a disparate view by the Federal Reserve and investors over inflation and the economy, and the notion that earnings and growth have peaked, Arone said. “Those things certainly have the market in a bit of a sideways pattern,” he said. The dollar fell from its strongest levels in 2018 against a basket of currencies due to mild profit-taking, but the greenback was expected to resume its rise due to solid U.S. economic growth and further monetary tightening by the Fed. The weaker dollar stemmed from a bounce in the euro, which hit a fresh low for the year in early trading before paring gains. “There’s a little exhaustion with the long-dollar trade, but I don’t think we’ve reached the end of it yet,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, FX and global macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The dollar index fell 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.1859. The Japanese yen weakened 0.53 percent versus the greenback at 109.72 per dollar. U.S. government bond yields fell across maturities as demand for safe-haven assets increased after Trump’s Iran announcement. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 8/32 in price, pushing their yield up to 2.9986 percent. In Europe, the gap between Italian and German borrowing costs hit its widest in nearly six weeks on the possibility that a coalition of Italian anti-establishment parties would come to power. The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread widened five basis points immediately after news that 5-Star and the League had said they were holding last-minute talks to try to clinch a coalition deal. The spread widened to 132.7 basis points, its widest since March 29.

ONGC (ONGC.NS) is a majority shareholder in ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL), which operates India’s biggest petrochemical plant in western Gujarat state. “They (SABIC} want to have a significant stake in OPaL, around 50 percent,” said one of the sources. Previously, ONGC had held talks about selling a stake in the project with Saudi Aramco and Petrochemical Industries Co, a unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp, a second source said.  “SABIC is the latest entrant. Recently SABIC has held talks with ONGC officials about a stake purchase,” the second source said. ONGC and SABIC did not respond to Reuters’ requests for  comment. India and Saudi Arabia want to strengthen their trade ties. Saudi Aramco recently signed an initial deal with India to buy a 50 percent stake in a planned 1.2 million barrels per day west coast refinery and petrochemical project. To expand its footprint in the world’s third-biggest oil importer, Saudi Arabia is also scouting for a stake in existing major refineries, its energy minister Khalid al-Falih has said. The first source said OPaL made an operating profit for the first time in 2017/18, increasing its appeal to prospective investors. “There are enough green shoots in the company,” the source said.  India’s per capita consumption of synthetic polymers, used to make various grades of plastics, is just 10 kg (22 lbs) a year, compared with a global average of about 32 kg. The country’s per capita consumption of petrochemicals will rise with its expanding middle class, growing income levels and increasing urbanisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in March last year.

2018-05-09,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility Uniper (UN01.DE) launched a pilot scheme at its Falkenhagen site on Wednesday to produce methane gas from wind power as the country seeks wider uses for renewable energy. The Falkenhagen plant, set up five years ago in Germany’s wind-swept Brandenburg state, already produces green hydrogen by running wind power through water to split it into oxygen and hydrogen. Methane gas would provide a higher quality material with more diversified uses. “This is an important step for a successful energy transition,” Uniper said in a statement after the company opened a new facility at the site for the scheme. “Green methane, in contrast to green hydrogen, can be used in a wider variety of ways.” Germany is looking at new ways to use and store renewable energy at a number of power-to-gas sites as a boom in wind and solar power in the country has led to excess production. Billions of euros have also been spent building up a natural gas infrastructure, which the government wants to use to store carbon-free energy rather than retiring it once renewables largely replace coal, nuclear power and gas by the middle of the century under the government’s energy policy. While green hydrogen can be used as a transport fuel or fed into gas grids - which can technically absorb 10 percent hydrogen as a complementary fuel to natural gas - green methane would take renewable energy a step further. “It can be made available to a variety of markets, such as the manufacturing sector, the electricity and heating markets as well as the mobility sector,” Uniper said. Under the two-year pilot scheme, the company will set out to produce green methane by using carbon dioxide from a bio-ethanol plant and mixing it with the hydrogen, creating a gas-like substance. If Uniper engineers can show the technology is viable, they hope that Germany can lead the way in providing the renewables sector with an entirely new raw material. But it is early days. Uniper says the methanation plant’s initial hourly production of gas will be equivalent only to the heat consumed by a 50-square metre (538 square foot) apartment in a month, which is tiny. The material’s potential for industrial use longer term could be huge, however, and there is wide interest in the facility as companies including Uniper, Vattenfall, BASF (BASFn.DE), and EnBW (EBKG.DE) have all invested individually in power-to-gas research. Falkenhagen is part of a European energy project called STORE&GO, that is calling for regulatory and policy support, given efficiency rates are still well below marketability.

2018-05-09,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to outline what changes he wants in a 2015 global climate agreement as the price for dropping his plan to quit, the United Nations’ climate chief said on Wednesday. Patricia Espinosa said she had asked Washington for its demands after Trump announced last June that he planned to quit the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to cleaner energies. “There has not been a follow-up” from Washington, she told Reuters during negotiations in Bonn among almost 200 nations on a “rule book” for the 2015 agreement.  Espinosa, a former Mexican foreign minister who leads the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, said she had stressed that the pact was flexible, allowing all countries to set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. “I would not like to see the U.S. leaving. I certainly hope there is a reconsideration of this decision,” she said of Trump’s plan to pull out. Trump doubts the view of mainstream science that man-made greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures. The rules of the Paris Agreement mean that Trump cannot formally pull out before November 2020, around the time of the next U.S. presidential election.  In announcing the U.S. withdrawal, Trump said Paris was a bad deal that would harm the U.S. economy, but added: “We will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine.” Espinosa said that Trump’s plan to quit the Iran nuclear deal, announced on Tuesday and again demonstrating that he is willing to defy pleas from U.S. allies, did not dim her hopes that Washington might stay in the Paris accord. “I think these are completely separate ... spheres of foreign policy and decision making,” she said.  On climate change, she said Trump might be swayed by an accelerating shift among many U.S. states, cities and companies to cleaner energies from fossil fuels.  Asked if the United States would outline its demands at the Bonn talks, a U.S. State Department official said: “We do not have any new information to share at this time on decisions concerning the Paris Agreement.” The Bonn meeting, which ends on Thursday, is working on rules for the Paris Agreement due to be in place by the end of the year, such as how to measure and account for greenhouse gas emissions and climate finance for developing nations that is meant to reach $100 billion a year by 2020. “A good set of rules ... should be a way to give comfort and confidence to the concerns they (the United States) could have,” said Espinosa. Asked if she would be happy for the United States to stay, while watering down deep cuts in emissions promised by former President Barack Obama, Espinosa said: “I think we should not choose between those two scenarios.” Reporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-accord-un/interview-no-follow-up-from-trump-over-staying-in-climate-pact-un-idUKL8N1SG571,09 May 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump

2018-05-09,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The heavily armed Shi’ite movement Hezbollah together with groups and individuals that are politically aligned to it won at least 69 of parliament’s 128 seats in an election on Sunday. The result is a boost for the Iran-backed group, which declared it “a victory” for the “choice of the resistance”, a reference to its powerful arsenal that has been a major point of contention in Lebanon for years. Differences - and in some cases conflict - between some parties in the Hezbollah-aligned camp means it does not operate with unified goals in domestic politics, and Hezbollah does not see eye to eye with its allies on all issues. But for Hezbollah it has been politically vital to have their support for its possession of arms, which it says are needed to deter Israel and - in more recent years - to protect Lebanon from Islamist insurgents in Syria. Here is the breakdown: HEZBOLLAH - 12 SEATS Founded in 1982 by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and deemed a terrorist group by the United States, Hezbollah is the most powerful group in Lebanon thanks to a heavily armed militia that has fought several wars with Israel. It has grown militarily stronger since joining the war in neighbouring Syria in 2012 in support of President Bashar al-Assad. THE AMAL MOVEMENT - 13 SEATS The Shi’ite Amal Movement is led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and has been closely aligned with Hezbollah since the end of Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war. Amal has maintained very close ties to the Syrian government since it was founded in 1974. SMALL HEZBOLLAH ALIGNED PARTIES - 14 SEATS These include the Maronite Christian Marada party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party, the Baath Party, the Armenian Tashnag and the Druze Lebanese Democratic Party, which were all represented in the previous parliament. In addition, the heads of four Hezbollah-aligned parties that were not part of the last parliament won Sunni seats this time. They are Osama Saad, Abdulrahim Mrad, Adnan Trabulsi and Faisal Karami. INDEPENDENTS ALIGNED WITH HEZBOLLAH AND AMAL - 10 SEATS This group includes non-Shi’ites who are politically aligned with Hezbollah and Amal and ran on lists backed by the parties. Several prominent Hezbollah supporters running as independents have returned to public office for the first time since the withdrawal of Syrian forces in 2005. Among them is Jamil al-Sayyed, a retired Shi’ite general and close friend of Assad, who ran as independent and is a staunch supporter of Hezbollah and its regional allies. THE FREE PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT (FPM) - 20 SEATS  The FPM founded by Maronite Christian politician Michel Aoun  has been a political ally of Hezbollah since 2006. The alliance is particularly important to Hezbollah because the FPM is the biggest Christian force in parliament. Hezbollah’s backing for Aoun was vital to his bid to become head of state, a goal he finally realised in 2016 in a political deal that saw Saad al-Hariri become prime minister.  Aoun has said Hezbollah’s weapons are critical to the defence of Lebanon. In an interview last year, he said the U.S.-backed Lebanese army was not strong enough to confront Israel and so Hezbollah’s arms were a necessity.  Aoun said on Tuesday he intended to call a national dialogue to address issues including “a national defence strategy” - a phrase that implies discussion of Hezbollah’s arms - but without giving further details.  His son-in-law, FPM leader Gebran Bassil, came under fire in Lebanon last year for saying Lebanon did not have an ideological problem with Israel. But in his role as foreign minister, Bassil has acted in Hezbollah’s interests at the Arab League. Nasrallah said in April the FPM alliance remained strong but this did not mean the parties had become one. FUTURE MOVEMENT - 20 SEATS Led by Saad al-Hariri, Future lost more than a third of its seats, but it remains the biggest Sunni-led party. Hariri led a Saudi-backed alliance through years of political conflict with Hezbollah and its allies that spilled into a brief civil war in 2008 over the group’s arms. The “March 14” alliance won a majority in 2009, but began disintegrating after the election and suffered from waning Saudi support. Hariri still wants Hezbollah disarmed but says this is an issue that should be resolved by dialogue at the regional level. His focus is on reviving the stagnant economy and reforming the heavily indebted state. THE LEBANESE FORCES (LF) - 15 SEATS Led by Maronite Christian politician Samir Geagea, the Lebanese Forces is Hezbollah’s most significant Christian opponent. The LF, which emerged from a powerful civil war militia, has also been fiercely critical of Hezbollah’s role in the war in neighbouring Syria. It is one of the biggest winners in the election, almost doubling its seats. Geagea said the result showed “March 14” still enjoys popular support. THE KATAEB PARTY/OTHERS - 5 SEATS The Kataeb, also known as the Phalange Party, is led by Maronite Christian politician Sami Gemayel, who took over the leadership from his father, former President Amin Gemayel.  In addition, two other of the newly elected MPs are known to have positions opposed to Hezbollah. PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST PARTY (PSP) - 9 SEATS Led by Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, the PSP has wavered on the issue of Hezbollah’s arms over the years. It was a pillar of the March 14 alliance until the 2009 election, but repositioned itself in the political centre after that vote. Jumblatt said last year that Hezbollah itself should be the one to decide when its weapons are put up for discussion. OTHERS - 10 SEATS These include political independents such as former Prime Minister Najib Mikati, veteran Christian politician Michel al-Murr and others whose views on Hezbollah and its arms could not immediately be confirmed.

2018-05-09,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgian scientists have discovered the oldest ever fossil of the common mouse-eared bat, proving the species already existed more than 33 million years ago. The bones of the tiny mammal were found at a fossil site in the late 1990s, unearthed when a new high-speed train track was built east of Brussels, but researchers spent decades sifting through tonnes of soil to make the discovery. Eventually they encountered the bones of a tiny bat, from the myotis or mouse-eared bat genus, barely changed from those commonly found in Europe today. “This fossil bat is tiny, it is only made up of tiny isolated teeth, fragments of the jaw and some small bones,” said Thierry Smith, one of the researchers involved in the project at the Royal Institute of Natural Sciences. “Some species survive a few thousand years or one or two million years but not like here 33 million years,” he added. The Belgian discovery shows that the previous estimate of when such bats appeared for the first time was off by some seven million years. Smith said the long life of the bat species could be explained by the fact that bats are the only mammal capable of flying and as such did not need to compete with others for resources.

2018-05-09,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Surging oil prices mean the big Arab countries of the Gulf — especially Saudi Arabia — look set to gain financially as well as politically from U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. In 2014, Saudi Arabia was willing to see oil prices tumble during a supply glut partly, diplomats said, because cheaper oil cut the income of arch-rival Iran, limiting Tehran’s capacity to finance proxy wars against Saudi interests in the region.  It was a painful trade-off which also hurt the Saudi economy. Now, Riyadh faces an ideal situation: Trump’s decision appears likely to reduce Iran’s oil income while giving the Gulf Arab states room to boost their own energy exports. Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said Saudi Arabia’s ambitious reform program, which aims to create jobs and new industries while curbing a huge state budget deficit, could benefit. “Saudi Arabia may be able to start increasing oil production at a time when oil prices are already high. This gives them extra funds to support their investment program, while still showing a narrowing of the deficit.” A United Arab Emirates economic official agreed Trump’s decision could help Arab oil exporting economies. Higher oil income would improve liquidity in the UAE banking sector, aiding the whole financial industry despite any rise in geopolitical tensions related to Iran, he told Reuters. The impact on Iran’s oil exports will depend on how buyers in Asia and Europe react to U.S. sanctions, which may not be clear for months. But analysts estimate Iranian oil production could drop by between 300,000 and 1 million barrels per day from about 3.8 million bpd. Saudi Arabia is expected to fill much of that gap. On Wednesday, a Saudi energy official indicated Riyadh might raise output to offset any supply shortage. Malik estimated Saudi oil revenues, 440 billion riyals ($117.3 billion) in 2017, could be 7 to 9 percent higher this year than they would have been without Trump’s decision. That assumes Saudi oil output will average 10.20 million bpd this year instead of 9.94 million bpd, and that increased geopolitical tensions will lift this year’s average oil price $3 a barrel. In other, possibly smaller ways, Trump’s decision is bad news for some countries in the Gulf. European countries are trying to preserve the nuclear deal but it could collapse entirely, raising the danger of worse conflict in the region. “This will impact how the region is viewed by foreign investors. There will be more negativity, more highlighting of the risks,” said one UAE banker. Most regional stock markets fell on Wednesday with the Saudi index .TASI sinking 1.7 percent after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi forces said they fired ballistic missiles at Riyadh. Saudi authorities said they intercepted the missiles. Dubai, traditionally a center for Iranian business, may suffer as companies, already cautious about trading with Iran, become more so because they see a greater risk of U.S. legal action against them. The UAE’s exports to Iran are worth about 5 percent of its gross domestic product. Oman, which has been hoping Iranian investment will support industrial expansion plans, may suffer. Last year, Oman’s central bank signed a memorandum of understanding with its Iranian counterpart in order to boost trade. But much trade with Iran is expected to continue, possibly through barter deals, which flourished under sanctions that prevailed before the nuclear deal took effect in 2016.  And apart from Dubai and Oman, the wealthy Gulf oil exporting states have minimal trade and investment links with Iran, meaning they have little to lose. Shares in Saudi food producer Savola Group 2050.SE, one of the few Gulf firms with big manufacturing operations in Iran, fell only 2.3 percent on Wednesday and remained up 2.3 percent year-to-date, suggesting investors do not foresee disaster for its Iranian business. But a tumble of Iran’s rial to record lows against the dollar in the free currency market on Wednesday showed many Iranians expect tough economic times. Well before Trump’s decision, the economy was struggling with high unemployment - estimated at around 30 percent or higher among young people — and a debt-burdened banking system which may be close to insolvency. The U.S. move threatens Iran with lower export income and less access to hard currency. Analysts expect oil exports to remain higher than they were before 2016, so the economy may muddle through, but banks’ problems mean a financial crisis is not impossible. Mehrdad Emadi, an Iranian economist who heads energy risk analysis at London’s Betamatrix consultancy, said the currency market turmoil in some ways resembled this year’s instability in Venezuela and Argentina’s 2002 currency crisis. “Simply put, the economy is like a giant truck carrying a heavy load with an engine borrowed from a moped.” Additional reporting by Tom Arnold; Editing by Toby Chopra",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-economy/big-gulf-arab-economies-may-be-winners-as-u-s-exits-iran-deal-idUKL8N1SG6ED,09 May 2018,"* Gulf Arab states may fill gap left by lower Iran oil

2018-05-09,"(Adds details, background) WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The United States will continue working with its allies to ensure Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday, a day after President Donald Trump withdrew from an international nuclear deal with Tehran. “We will continue to work alongside our allies and partners to ensure that Iran can never acquire a nuclear weapon, and will work with others to address the range of Iran’s malign influence,” Mattis said in a hearing before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee. “This administration remains committed to putting the safety, interests, and well-being of our citizens first,” Mattis said. Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. The 2015 agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for its agreement to limit its nuclear program. The pact was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Trump’s decision has intensified the strain on the trans-Atlantic alliance since he took office 16 months ago. A number of European leaders came to Washington ahead of Trump’s decision on Tuesday to plead with him to preserve the deal. The Trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal with allies, but it is far from clear if the Europeans would agree to that approach and if they could convince Iran to accept it. Last year, Mattis said the United States should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless it was proven that Tehran was not abiding by the agreement or that it was not in the U.S. national interest to do so. In the hearing on Wednesday, Mattis said Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal had not been a hasty one. “The president could not affirm as required that this agreement was being lived up to and in the best interest in all aspects of what was supposed to be happening under the JCPOA,” Mattis said, using an acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the nuclear deal with Iran. “I think we now have the opportunity to move forward to address those shortcomings and make it more compelling,” Mattis said. He added that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were working on the issue.

2018-05-09,"(Adds details, prices, quotes) May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil, gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell more than expected last week, as crude imports dropped sharply, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 2.2 million barrels in the week to May 4, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 719,000 barrels. The decline in inventories came as net crude imports dropped by nearly 1 million barrels per day to 5.4 million bpd, the lowest one-week figure since late February. The fall in crude stocks came even as refinery activity slowed in the most recent week and crude production hit a fresh record of 10.7 million bpd. Weekly crude output figures are variable, however, and are often adjusted in monthly data that lags by several weeks. “This may one of the most bullish reports that I have surveyed - even with domestic production rising to 10.7 million bpd,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. After the data, prices rose across the energy complex before giving back gains. Still, oil was higher in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions likely to constrain world supply. U.S. crude oil futures were off the day’s highs, but were still up 2.7 percent to $70.87 a barrel by 10:41 a.m. EDT (1441 GMT). Brent crude rose 2.8 percent to $76.90 a barrel. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose by 1.4 million barrels, EIA said. Refinery crude runs fell by 75,000 bpd, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 0.7 percentage points to 90.4 percent, pulled down by a decline in Gulf Coast refining. Gasoline stocks fell 2.2 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 450,000-barrel drop. U.S. gasoline futures rose to $2.1674 a gallon, highest since August 2017, and were last up 2.3 percent on the day. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 3.8 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.4 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. “A whopping drop in imports has resulted in a moderate draw to crude stocks, while a drop in both gasoline and distillates inventories round out a broadly supportive report,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata.

2018-05-09,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Around two million diesel car owners in Germany could join class action lawsuits to seek compensation from Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Justice Minister Katarina Barley said on Wednesday. The German cabinet approved a draft law on Wednesday that paves the way for class action against the carmaker, which in 2015 admitted it had used illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests. The draft law aims to make it easier for people to join a legal test case, thereby avoiding high costs that might otherwise put them off bringing legal action. Only certain associations are entitled to bring proceedings. “There are estimates that some two million diesel car owners could benefit from this legal action,” Barley said. Owners of cars with illegal software are allowed to claim damages only until the end of 2018 so Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government wants to ensure the law takes effect on Nov. 1, 2018 at the latest. “We are making this type of suit so public now to signal to the affected diesel drivers that they have a relatively short window in which to take their claims to court,” said Barley. Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said: “This is an important instrument, especially for affected diesel drivers in the Volkswagen case.” But Volkswagen said the draft law didn’t change the fact that it believes the claims against it in Germany are unjustified, and that it expects the vast majority of them to be rejected.  Klaus Mueller, head of the federal association of consumer protection bodies, said the Volkswagen scandal was “only the tip of the iceberg” and the draft law could help consumers to make use of their rights in many other areas.

2018-05-09,"PARIS/MUNICH (Reuters) - European governments vowed on Wednesday to try to shield their improved economic ties with Iran from the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions, but business leaders struck a more pessimistic note. The EU said it remained committed to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the suspension of its own sanctions, the day after President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from the pact. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also insisted the deal was “not dead”. However, companies with active Iranian investments or plans mostly stayed quiet on the viability of those projects beyond a “wind-down” period of three to six months until the United States reimposes sanctions on entities doing business with Tehran. Siemens is still “assessing the implications of the Iran decision”, the German industrial giant’s Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told reporters on a call. “One of the strongest industrialised countries in the world has made a political decision - as an industrial company we have to recognise that,” Thomas said. Existing projects will be completed “as far as legally possible”, he added. Trump’s move will lead to the reimposition of U.S. penalties that were waived under the three-year-old nuclear deal, including financial sanctions that had made it extremely difficult for global companies to do business with or in Iran. Companies worst affected are likely to include plane manufacturer Airbus (AIR.PA), Peugeot maker PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and its fellow French automaker Renault (RENA.PA). France is seeking an understanding with the U.S. to safeguard its carmakers’ significant Iran investments, a government official said. PSA, which sold 445,000 vehicles in Iran last year, called on the European Union to maintain a united front in defence of the nuclear agreement. Germany’s BDI industry association also said the EU, Russia and China should commit clearly to the deal, after Washington’s new ambassador ruffled feathers by tweeting: “German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.” The nuclear detente had sparked great hopes for the opening of the Iranian market, BDI head Dieter Kempf said. “These hopes have now clearly been dimmed.” Government and company officials said business with Iran had slowed recently in anticipation of Washington’s likely withdrawal from the deal. France, Germany and Italy have introduced euro-denominated export guarantees designed to avoid U.S. dollar exposure and withstand sanctions, while the EU may resort to sanctions-blocking statutes ordering companies not to comply. In updated advice to businesses, however, the British government said: “How UK companies act in response to U.S. sanctions is a commercial and legal decision for that company.” The renewed sanctions “may have implications for UK businesses and individuals dealing with Iran”, it added. British exports to Iran rose nearly 40 percent in 2016 to 262 million pounds, dwarfed by the 3 billion euros (2.6 billion pounds) of German exports recorded last year, up 15 percent. Volkswagen, which resumed exports to Iran in 2017, said it was monitoring the situation closely. Some European banks that had resumed financing Iranian entities after the nuclear deal said they had already stopped doing so in anticipation of Trump’s move. “During recent months the operational and reputational risks associated with doing business in Iran have increased,” Danske Bank’s spokesman Kenni Leth said. “Earlier this year we decided to phase out and exit all activities to and from Iran and suspend our existing relations with Iran.” Austria’s Oberbank decided last November not to provide financing to Iranian counterparts “due to the constantly changing political framework,” a spokesman said.  Germany’s Hermes export guarantee scheme for Iran remains in place for the time being, the country’s economy ministry said. But France’s export finance programme, which had been due to launch in May-June, has been “put on hold” in recent weeks pending Trump’s decision, several French officials told Reuters. Euro-denominated export finance is still being discussed, an Elysee official said, “but it’s not necessarily that simple”. The bpifrance sovereign fund, which was due to administer the scheme, declined to comment. French officials will be focused on helping companies exit Iran within the wind-down periods, said one - or on seeking unlikely U.S. waivers or assurances for activities they want to pursue beyond the deadlines. Companies “will have to choose between their Iranian economic interests and their potential U.S. interests,” said a senior diplomat. “Generally that decision is quickly made in favour of the U.S.” That is precisely the kind of risk calculation the Trump administration appears to be banking on. “Companies should not do business in Iran,” a U.S. State Department official said in a phone briefing for reporters on Wednesday, when asked whether foreign business interests could be damaged as an unintended consequence of sanctions. “That’s an intended consequence, and we thank our ambassador out there for reaffirming that message.”        Writing by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Gilles Guillaume, Michael Nienaber, Mathieu Rosemain, David Milliken, Teis Jensen and Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Keith Weir",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-companies/update-1-eu-defence-of-iran-deal-brings-companies-little-relief-idUKL8N1SG2TH,09 May 2018,"* French officials now focused on compliance

2018-05-09,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Britain’s government on Wednesday played down a media report that it will guarantee Hitachi Ltd’s Horizon Nuclear Power loans for the construction of two reactors in Wales.  British Prime Minister Theresa May met Hitachi Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi last week in London and asked him to go ahead with the project, conveying the government’s intention to fully guarantee the loans, Japan’s Mainichi newspaper paper said, without citing a source. “We don’t recognise these reports,” a spokesman for Britain’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in an emailed statement. “Nuclear power remains a crucial part of the UK’s energy future but we have always been clear that this must be delivered at the right price for consumers and taxpayers,” he said. Britain is seeking new ways to fund nuclear projects after criticism over a deal awarded to France’s EDF to build the first nuclear plant in Britain for 20 years, which could cost consumers 30 billion pounds. “These discussions are commercially sensitive and we have no further details at this time,” the BEIS spokesman said. Hitachi’s Horizon plans to construct at least 5.4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity at two sites in Britain – the first at Wylfa Newydd in Wales, and a second at Oldbury-on-Severn in England. Horizon said the two projects could generate enough electricity to power 10 million homes and create tens of thousands of jobs. “There are regular and ongoing discussions between ourselves and the UK Government on the project but we will not comment on the specifics in terms of the participants in, or content of the conversations,” a spokesman for Horizon said. The Mainichi report said Hitachi is still pushing for the British government to take a stake in the project and guarantee electricity prices to ensure it is profitable. The cost of the Hitachi project in Wales has ballooned to 3 trillion yen (20.2 billion pounds) due to tougher safety measures, the newspaper said.    Hitachi declined to comment, when contacted by Reuters.

2018-05-09,"(Refiles to fix headline) By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, May 9 (Reuters) - Indian refiners said on Wednesday they were in no hurry to replace Iranian oil with alternatives, counting on the fact that many Western countries have so far declined to join the United States in pulling out of a nuclear deal with Tehran. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would reimpose economic curbs on Iran after withdrawing the United States from the 2015 agreement that lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme. But the leaders of Britain, Germany and France, which were signatories to the deal along with China and Russia, said in a joint statement that Trump’s decision was a cause for “regret and concern” and were seeking to salvage the deal. “We are largely unaffected,” said A.K. Sharma, finance chief at Indian Oil Corp (IOC). “This time the situation is different from the last time. We hope clarity on the real impact of sanctions will emerge in 10-15 days.” IOC, India’s biggest refiner, hopes to stick to its plans to buy as much as 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran in 2018/19, more than double the volume in the last fiscal year that ended in March, Sharma said. It would be difficult to replace Iranian oil given the “commercial terms” offered by Tehran, he said. India, which has long-standing ties with Iran but also has close political relations with the United States, is Iran’s top oil client after China. Its state refiners had chalked out plans to almost double oil imports from Iran this fiscal year, drawn to the virtual free shipping on oil sales offered by Iran, Reuters reported last month. The South Asian country remained a big buyer of Iranian oil even during previous Western sanctions, though it had to cut purchases to win some waivers as the trade was mostly done in U.S. dollars. Since the 2015 agreement, however, Indian refiners have been settling oil dues with Iran in euros. And given that three top European countries are still part of the deal, trade won’t be affected much, at least in the short term, said R. Ramachandran, head of refineries at state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. In any case, oil sanctions will kick in in about six months, by which time most Indian refiners “may have consumed most of their Iranian volumes”, Ramachandran said. The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that sanctions won’t be reimposed immediately, and will take up to 180 days to allow Iranian oil customers and other companies involved in doing business with Tehran to make plans. M.K. Surana, chairman of Hindustan Petroleum, said refiners may use that time to step up purchases from Iran. The Indian oil ministry has not commented on the U.S. pullout, but the foreign ministry on Wednesday called for diplomacy to resolve the dispute over the nuclear deal with Iran. Separately, South Korea said on Wednesday it would seek U.S. exemptions to buy Iranian oil, a path many big oil consumers are likely to follow in the wake of new U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which will tighten world oil markets and push up prices.

2018-05-09,"(Adds quotes) BAGHDAD, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out from the international nuclear deal with Iran is “hasty and rash”, Iraq’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The ministry said it was following with “deep concern the dangerous developments” resulting from Trump’s decision. It said the nuclear agreement “had contributed to Middle East peace” and Washington’s withdrawal “goes in the direction of escalation which would bring nothing but destruction and war desolation” in the Middle East. Shi’ite-led Iraq lies on the faultline between Shi’ite Iran and the mostly Sunni Muslim Arab world. Iran became the main foreign power broker in Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011, with its local allies controlling the security services. The ministry statement welcomed the decision of the other signatories of the agreement, including Iran and European nations, to stick with the 2015 deal despite the U.S. pullout. Trump said on Tuesday that the 2015 deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for measures restricting its nuclear programme, did not go far enough in removing the threat posed by Iran to the United States and its allies in the Middle East. During his four-year term in office, Iraqi Prime Minister Haier al-Abadi has cautiously trodden a diplomatic middle course between Tehran and Washington, ensuring the cooperation of both in the war against Islamic State hardline Sunni militants. Abadi is seeking a second term in elections due on Saturday. He is facing two allies of Iran, ex-prime minister Nuri al-Maliki and Shi’ite militia leader Hadi al-Amiri. Iraqi President Fuad Masum earlier in the day expressed concern at the American decision. “The (nuclear) agreement marked a major achievement in bolstering the chances of peace and progress for all the states of the region and the international community,” said Masum, an ethnic Kurd whose position as president of the republic is largely ceremonial. The executive powers in the country are concentrated in the hands of Abadi, who belongs to the Shi’ite Arab majority.

2018-05-09,"* Graphite demand seen rising for EV battery market * Balama project will cut into Chinese dominance By Ed Stoddard JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Reuters) - Australian-listed Syrah Resources is targeting the market for electric vehicle batteries with its Balama graphite mine in Mozambique, which started production in November. A global scramble is on for commodities such as graphite, cobalt and lithium, which are among the key components in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used to power mobile devices and electric vehicles. “The growth market and our focus in the coming years is very much in the lithium-ion battery segment,” Syrah Chief Executive Shaun Verner told Reuters in a telephone interview. Verner said Syrah saw the market for natural-flake graphite more than doubling over the next eight years to 1.6 million tonnes from 700,000 tonnes currently, with the battery industry accounting for the bulk of that demand. Currently battery demand is about 200,000 tonnes or around 30 percent of the market. “About 70 percent of our production is ... the smaller flake in demand in the battery sector,” Verner said. Capacity for the Balama mine and plant is 350,000 tonnes annually and the company is looking at 160,000 to 180,000 tonnes in the first year, reaching full production in three years and cutting into the dominance of China, where 60 percent of global supply currently originates. By 2020 it will be providing 35 to 40 percent of global supply if current projections remain on target. “In our first four months of operation we have exported to 13 countries across Asia,” Verner said, with most going to China, Japan and South Korea. In Europe, Germany has been the biggest consumer. The resource is close to the surface and easy to access. The graphite is exported through the port of Nacala, taken there by road on a 500 km (300 mile) journey from the mine in the interior of northern Mozambique. South Africa’s Grinrod has a logistics contract to provide road transport and warehousing. Infrastructure challenges in the southern African country, which is extremely poor and underdeveloped, have stymied the growth of its coal sector. Mozambique also has huge offshore gas reserves that are being brought to commercial production. Parts of Mozambique’s remote north and central regions have been hit in recent years by security incidents and banditry but Verner said the project had not been impacted. “We have not seen any security concerns right through the period from exploration to pre-development, construction and now into operations,” he said.

2018-05-09,"(Adds quotes) LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain challenged the United States on Wednesday to spell out its vision of a new negotiated settlement with Iran after President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 international nuclear deal. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain had no intention of walking away from the deal, known as the JCPOA. He also said Britain would do its utmost to protect UK commercial interests in Iran. “Now that the Trump administration has left the JCPOA, the responsibility falls on them to describe how they in Washington will build a new negotiated solution to our shared concerns,” he told parliament. “President Trump said himself last night that he is committed to finding a new solution and we should hold him to his word.” Johnson said he had no problem with Trump’s goal for a lasting solution to Iran’s nuclear threat and other Iranian policies seen as malign by London and Washington, but added: “The question is: how does the U.S. propose to achieve it?” Asked about the potential impact of new U.S. economic sanctions against Iran on British firms seeking to do business in the country, Johnson did not go into specifics but indicated the government would be supportive of companies. “We will do our utmost to protect UK commercial interests,” he said. Asked what suggestions the British government would be making to the U.S. administration about the way ahead in dealing with Iran, Johnson talked about the idea of a follow-on agreement that would preserve the central pillars of the JCPOA while addressing other issues beyond the nuclear programme. “The central idea is that around the core of the JCPOA you build a super-structure, a follow-on agreement that would address the problems of the sunset clauses, address the issue of the ICBMs (inter-continental ballistic missiles) and satisfy the president’s anxieties,” he said. Throughout his statement, Johnson repeatedly said the JCPOA had delivered on the core goal of preventing Iran from moving towards acquiring a nuclear bomb. He also said the central bargain of the deal, better economic prospects for Iran in return for de-nuclearisation, remained valid. “We did our utmost to prevent this outcome. From the moment that President Trump’s administration took office, we made the case for keeping the JCPOA at every level,” he said. “The U.S. decision makes no difference to the British assessment that the constraints imposed on Iran’s nuclear ambitions by the JCPOA remain vital for our national security and the stability of the Middle East. “For as long as Iran abides by the agreement ... then Britain will remain a party to the JCPOA,” he added. “Britain has no intention of walking away.” Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-britain-johnson/update-1-britain-tells-trump-spell-out-how-you-will-deal-with-iran-now-idUKL8N1SG693,09 May 2018,"Britain challenged the United

2018-05-09,"(Adds timeline of production expansion) By Ulf Laessing ZUBAIR, Iraq, May 9 (Reuters) - Iraq has lifted oil production at Eni’s Zubair field in the south by 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 475,000 bpd, an Iraqi oil official said on Wednesday. Production rose after the completion of a new oil processing facility, Muhaned Abbas Kojer, the capacity expansion project director, told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony to launch the new installations in al-Zubair, south of Basra. Zubair’s production capacity will rise gradually to 625,000 bpd by the end of the year, as three additional processing facilities are added, and further expansions will take its capacity to its 850,000 bpd target by 2020, Abbas said. The field should produce 140 million cubic feet per day of gas by the end of the year, he added. Iraq, the second-largest crude oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia, has an oil production capacity of nearly 5 million bpd. Crude output is kept at about 4.45 million bpd, in line with a deal between OPEC and some other non-OPEC producers to curb production in order to bolster crude prices. The country is also seeking to lift its refining capacity to become self-sufficient in oil products. The oil ministry has asked investors for bids by June 14 to build a 100,000 bpd refinery in Kut, south of Baghdad. Iraq’s refining capacity was curbed when Islamic State overran its largest oil processing plant in Baiji, north of Baghdad, in 2014. Iraqi forces recaptured Baiji in 2015 but it sustained heavy damage in the fighting. The country now relies on the Doura refinery in Baghdad and the Shuaiba plant in the Basra region.

2018-05-09,"* Parliament aims to pass all three parts of legislation * Buhari would need to sign any bills into law once passed * Bill faces huge policy and logistical challenges -analyst (Adds quotes, details, context) By Alexis Akwagyiram and Paul Carsten ABUJA, May 9 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s parliament aims to pass a long-delayed bill to overhaul the oil sector by the end of July, Senate President Bukola Saraki told Reuters. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which aims to improve transparency, attract investors and stimulate growth, has been debated for more than a decade and was broken into sections to help it pass into law. The PIB was discussed for some 17 years before the governance bill was passed by both houses of parliament in January. That unprecedented move, following the decision to break up the unwieldy PIB into smaller bills, raised hopes that the other pieces of legislation could be passed soon after. Nigeria is an OPEC member and Africa’s largest oil producer. Crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue but the sector’s development has been held back for decades by mismanagement. Saraki said in an interview the aim was to ensure all three remaining parts of the legislation were passed by the National Assembly before it went on holiday in July. “We go on the summer break in July. If we don’t pass it by July, by the time we come back in September it is all going to be elections,” said Saraki, referring to presidential and legislative polls scheduled to take place early next year. He said the break would begin in the third week of July. Any bills passed by lawmakers would have to be signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. The governance bill, passed in January, is awaiting Buhari’s approval. The other three parts — the fiscal, administrative and host community bills — are yet to be passed. Saraki said the bills would be discussed at a public hearing between the first and third weeks of May before being returned to lawmakers. “We are working on all three at the same time. The three should go at the same time,” said Saraki on Tuesday, when asked about the order in which the bills would be passed. Antony Goldman, of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting, said “huge logistical and policy challenges” would have to be resolved for the legislation to be passed by the end of July. “If they could get it done, it would be a very significant achievement,” said Goldman. “If they fail, risk increases that the whole process might stall until well after the next elections.” Growth remains weak in Nigeria’s economy as it continues to emerge from its 2016 recession, the country’s first full-year contraction in 25 years. The recession was largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks on energy facilities. With economic growth still slow, there have been calls for parliament to complete its work on the record 8.6 trillion naira ($27.39 billion) budget that was presented to the legislature by Buhari in November. Any changes made by lawmakers must be sent back to Buhari for approval. The central bank governor last month urged the swift passage of the budget to bolster the economy since it would enable the government to implement its spending plan. ] “It should be laid probably end of this week, latest Tuesday, and hopefully passed on Wednesday,” Saraki said of the budget, during the interview in the National Assembly in the capital, Abuja. He said the delay in passing the spending plan was largely due to a number of ministries and government agencies providing incomplete information. Delays in passing budgets, amid wrangling between the executive and legislature, are common in Nigeria and hindered the implementation of Buhari’s previous spending plans.

2018-05-09," LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran marks the end of the current output agreement between OPEC and its allies. OPEC is likely to insist the current agreement remains in effect, at least for now, but the prospective removal of several hundred thousand barrels per day of Iranian exports from the market will require a major adjustment. Saudi Arabia has already promised to “mitigate” the impact of any potential supply shortages, in conjunction with other suppliers and consumer countries, in a statement released immediately after the sanctions decision. The kingdom is customarily coy about how it might respond but the prospective removal of Iranian crude from the market will send oil prices sharply higher unless other producers step up to fill the gap. As a practical matter, only Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Russia and the United States have the ability to raise production and exports in the short term. Saudi Arabia and its close allies Abu Dhabi and Kuwait hold almost all the spare capacity that could respond quickly to a reduction in Iranian exports. U.S. shale producers could also increase their output but it would take time and their light crude is not a good substitute for heavier Iranian oil. Russian firms may also hold spare capacity and could certainly increase output over a 12-month horizon. Their crude is a close equivalent to Iranian grades. The United States and Saudi Arabia appear to have reached a high-level political understanding in which the United States will intensify pressure on Iran in exchange for Saudi Arabia agreeing to help avoid a spike in oil prices. The existence of an understanding was confirmed by the U.S. Treasury Secretary who told reporters on Tuesday that “we have had conversations with various parties ... that would be willing to increase oil supply”. In retrospect, the president’s tweet on April 20 blaming OPEC for high oil prices can be seen as part of the negotiating process to reach an understanding with Saudi Arabia. In effect, the United States agreed to implement tough sanctions, and Saudi Arabia agreed to limit the impact on oil prices. The outlines of that agreement remain unclear, and may not be entirely clear to Washington and Riyadh, but the understanding is vital to the successful implementation of sanctions. U.S. gasoline prices are already averaging just under $3 per gallon, the highest level since late 2014, up from $2.50 a year ago. U.S. politicians will want to avoid being blamed for a further escalation in the run up to congressional elections in November. Assuming the U.S. sanctions are effective in curbing Iran’s crude exports, Saudi Arabia and its OPEC allies will have to raise their production to make up the shortfall, or risk being blamed for a further rise in motoring costs. The original agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, and other oil exporters, led by Russia, set output levels in December 2016. The output agreement has already been extended twice, in May and December 2017, and is now scheduled to run until at least December 2018. Even before the United States decided to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, OPEC’s output agreement was in danger of being overtaken by events. The collapse in Venezuelan output has reduced production much more than intended and caused global oil inventories to draw down much faster than OPEC predicted at the end of last year. The result has been a sharp increase in prices, which has been broadly welcomed by OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia, which needs the revenues to pay for its ambitious transformation programme. Losing significant volumes of Iranian exports as a result of sanctions will worsen the existing under-supply in the market and cause inventories to decline even faster and prices to rise even higher. But further significant price increases threaten to complicate OPEC’s strategy by accelerating the upturn in shale drilling, as well as denting the growth in oil consumption. They also pose a political problem since neither the Trump administration nor Saudi Arabia will want to be blamed for pushing up prices for motorists in the United States and elsewhere. For all these reasons, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members will come under intense pressure to raise their output to make up for any loss of Iranian barrels. In theory, U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry will not be re-imposed for six months to give customers, traders and banks time to wind down their relationships in an orderly fashion. In theory, too, the United States is open to granting waivers to importers of Iranian crude, provided they show some willingness to reduce their purchases. But the U.S. Treasury has already made clear it expects importers to start cutting purchases of Iranian crude immediately if they want to obtain a waiver later, according to a briefing note issued by the Treasury on Tuesday. The result is that sanctions will start to phase in quickly and could start to progressively cut Iranian exports within the next few months, assuming the sanctions are effective. OPEC members need to start reacting now if they intend to avert an escalation of prices, rather than leaving the decision to December, by which time the market will be exceptionally tight and it will be too late. Current OPEC and non-OPEC production levels were specified for a world over-supplied with crude. That world no longer exists. Negotiating a new deal on output levels is likely to prove tricky since OPEC operates by consensus and sanctions pit two of its most important producers directly against one another. So the existing deal may technically remain in force while members ignore its output levels in practice. But the U.S. sanctions on Iran, assuming they are effective, mark the end of the current output agreement. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-05-09,"OSLO (Reuters) - Sweden’s low electricity prices are likely to attract new data centers to the country this year, according to Swedish utility Vattenfall [VATN.UL], which said it is discussing deals with Silicon Valley companies and Chinese firms. The Nordic countries, which can generate electricity relatively cheaply from renewable sources such as hydropower and wind, have long been a magnet for heavy power industries, but are now attracting power-hungry data centers. Sweden, which also has nuclear reactors, tends to have the cheapest electricity prices during most of the year. Vattenfall already supplies power to a number of data centers in Sweden, including Facebook’s facility in the city of Lulea, which Facebook decided on Monday to double in size. “We are actively discussing bringing more data centers to Sweden with big U.S. companies. We also had our first discussions with Chinese firms that showed interest,” Vattenfall’s head of strategy Andreas Regnell told Reuters.  “Based on these discussions, I expect this year that more data centers will come to Sweden, though not of the Facebook magnitude. But mega-data centers will come as well by 2020,” said Regnell. Sweden plans to decommission two of its remaining eight nuclear reactors by 2020, but big wind projects that will enter the Nordic power system will make up for lost ground and keep prices competitive, Regnell added. In 2017, Sweden cut its tax rate on electricity for data centers by 97 percent, with Norway following suit to compete with its neighbor. Vattenfall said it would seek to win supply contracts itself, but added regardless who won the deals, new centers would be good news for utilities in Sweden, where margins are tight. “We will be happy even if it is not us that will sign the electricity supply contract... total consumption grows and that means prices will go up, which will create profit for us anyway,” he said. Vattenfall believes other power-intensive industries can benefit from Sweden’s competitive prices, such as carbon fiber makers, but data centers are its prime target. “Data centers are the number one, two and three targets for Sweden at the moment. After these comes everything else,” he said.

But offshore rig firm Borr Drilling (BDRILL.OL), whose biggest shareholder is the world’s largest oil service firm Schlumberger (SLB.N), and Houston-based Diamond Offshore (DO.N) were considering bids, sources said. Maersk group declined to comment on the divestment process, which it announced in September 2016, adding it was “thoroughly reviewing all structural options available”, including a listing or trade sale.  Borr Drilling declined to comment, while Diamond Offshore did not respond to a request for comment.  One of the sources said that the Maersk family’s investment company, A.P. Moller Holding, could itself consider buying the unit.  The holding company of the family, which is the biggest Maersk group shareholder with a stake of 41.5 percent, declined to comment.  The proposed sale is part of Maersk group’s restructuring plan of divesting energy businesses - including oil exploration, oil tankers and supply services - to focus on shipping, ports and logistics.  The strategy could allow the company to shed any conglomerate discount in the way investors value its shares. The aim is to build an integrated container shipping firm, giving customers the chance to deal with one company when transporting goods, from factory to shop shelf.      The listing option was shelved because of sluggish investor appetite in the drilling sector, which plagued by an oversupply of rigs and has not yet recovered from a downturn in oil prices.  More broadly, investors and bankers have cautioned initial public offerings will become tougher in Europe as the year progresses to do as money gets tighter and potential investors are more cautious after being burnt by some high-profile failures.   In fact several companies expected to hold IPOs have instead opted for sale at the eleventh hour, including British online betting company Sky Bet. Maersk Drilling reported a loss of $1.5 billion last year versus a loss of $709 million in 2016, hit by an accounting impairment of $1.75 billion following the classification as discontinued operations. AS part of its restructuring, Maersk group agreed last year to sell its oil and gas business, Maersk Oil, to French oil major Total (TOTF.PA) in a $7.5 billion deal.

2018-05-09,"(Adds quotes, context) BAGHDAD, May 9 (Reuters) - Iraqi President Fuad Masum expressed regret on Wednesday over the decision by President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of an international accord that aims to curb Iran’s nuclear programme. Masum also welcomed the decision of the other signatories of the agreement, including Iran and European nations, to stick with the 2015 deal despite the U.S. pullout. Shi’ite-led Iraq lies on the faultline between Shi’ite Iran and the mostly Sunni Muslim Arab world. Iran became the main foreign power broker in Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 2011, with its local allies controlling the security services. “The (nuclear) agreement marked a major achievement in bolstering the chances of peace and progress for all the states of the region and the international community,” Masum said in a statement, the first official Iraqi reaction to Trump’s move. Trump said on Tuesday that the 2015 deal, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for measures restricting its nuclear programme, did not go far enough in removing the threat posed by Iran to the United States and its allies in the Middle East. Masum is an ethnic Kurd and his position as president of the Iraqi republic is largely ceremonial. The executive powers in the country are concentrated in the hands of the prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, who belongs to the Shi’ite Arab majority. During his four-year term in office, Abadi has cautiously trodden a diplomatic middle course between Tehran and Washington, ensuring the cooperation of both in the war against Islamic State hardline Sunni militants. Abadi is seeking a second term in elections due on Saturday. He is facing two allies of Iran, ex-prime minister Nuri al-Maliki and Shi’ite militia leader Hadi al-Amiri.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. The original agreement had lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. “People shouldn’t take it for granted that Saudi Arabia will produce more oil single-handedly. We need to assess first the impact if there is any, in terms of disruption, in terms of a reduction of Iran’s production,” the OPEC source said. “We have managed to put together this new alliance between OPEC and non-OPEC. Saudi Arabia will not in any way act independently of its partners.” Riyadh is working closely with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which holds the Organization of the Petroleum Producing Countries’ presidency in 2018 and non-OPEC producer Russia for “coordination and market consultations,” the OPEC source said. He added that any action will be taken in coordination with all OPEC and non-OPEC partners, if needed.

2018-05-09,"(Updates prices, adds U.S. stocks futures) * Oil at 3-1/2-year high as Trump move threatens global supply * Dollar hits new 2018 high before edging lower * U.S. Treasury yields hurdle 3 pct, safe-haven demand muted * Emerging market currencies hit by prospects of higher U.S. rates * World stocks hold steady, European shares rise By Kit Rees LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices hit 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, while the dollar touched a new high for the year and world stocks held steady. Trump’s move sparked fears of increased tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over global oil supplies. Demand for safe-haven assets remained muted as the immediate market impact was seen as specific to oil supply, but investors remained mindful of the knock-on effects on inflation. Gold prices retreated and bond yields rose. The U.S. 10-year Treasury once again breached the psychologically significant 3-percent level and hit a two-week high of 3.0140 percent, supported by expectations of higher interest rates. “In an environment where the Fed, particularly, is already at its inflation target and people are closely watching the pace of the monetary tightening, something like this which could possibly nudge inflation a little bit higher is going to be quite interesting for the market,” UBS Wealth Management’s UK chief investment office deputy head, Caroline Simmons, said. “That’s why you’re seeing the yields go up a little bit on the bonds,” she said. The impact of Trump’s decision was mostly limited to oil markets and energy-related stocks. West Texas Intermediate crude futures hit their highest level since November 2014 at $71.17 per barrel, last up 2.7 percent. Brent crude futures jumped as much as 2.8 percent to a 3-1/2-year high of $77.20. “There is still an interim period before sanctions kick in. And other signatories and Iran want to keep the deal going so there is a period where things could be hammered out,” ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder said. “But I would have expected a bit of a safe-haven bid this morning,” he noted, referring to bonds. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat and continued to trade in a narrow range. The pan-European STOXX 600 meanwhile rose 0.2 percent as oil majors gained and earnings from Siemens and Imperial Brands dominated trading. In the U.S., stocks futures pointed to a positive start for Wall Street, with E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 up 0.5 percent. “In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities senior investment strategist Norihiro Fujito said. “U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,” he said. The reaction in Asian markets was more pronounced as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have dealings with Iran. Trump’s move is also seen as likely to worsen already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent. Iran, the third-biggest OPEC producer, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4 percent of the world’s oil supplies. The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. The rise in Treasury yields helped fuel the dollar’s rally, with the greenback hitting a new 2018 high before giving up gains. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was at 93.026. It has risen about 1 percent this year. Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been depressed in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets. Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit. The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low and the Turkish lira reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are both down about 1 percent. The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low, and has slid 1 percent this week. Among major currencies, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit an 11-month low of $0.74130 and last stood at $0.74510 . The euro recovered slightly after hitting a new 4-1/2-month low of $1.1821 and last stood at $1.1880, having fallen about 4 percent in the past three weeks. The currency was hit by increasing prospects of another election in Italy as the political impasse there has continued since early March’s vote. The British pound was slightly firmer at $1.3538 but remained close to a four-month low ahead of the Bank of England’s meeting on Thursday. The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 109.65 yen, edging near its three-month high of 110.02 yen touched last week.

2018-05-09,"(Adds detail) May 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. Below is a list of deals and memoranda of understanding (MoU) that Iran has signed with foreign companies, which could now be under threat amid speculation Washington could impose secondary sanctions on firms that continue to work with Tehran. * Total became in November 2016 the first oil major to sign a big deal with Tehran since it was re-admitted to international trade markets, agreeing to help it develop the world’s largest gas field, South Pars. The French company said in October 2017 it would have to review the project if the United States decided to impose unilateral sanctions on Tehran, given the company’s assets in the U.S. market. China’s top oil and gas company CNPC was considering taking over Total’s stake in the project if the French company left, industry sources said in October 2017. * Norwegian oil and gas company DNO said in November 2016 it was the second Western energy company after Total to sign a deal with Iran under which it agreed to study the development of the Changuleh oilfield in western Iran. * Shell signed a provisional deal in December 2016 to develop Iranian oil and gas fields South Azadegan, Yadavaran and Kish. But its annual report published in 2017 showed it had bought only three cargoes of Iranian oil since the easing of sanctions, in a sign of the legal difficulties hampering trade. * South Korea’s Daewoo Engineering and Construction (Daewoo E&C) signed a MoU in 2015 to carry out construction of an oil refinery in Bandar Jask on the southern coast of Iran. * Norway’s Aker Solutions signed an MoU in May 2016 to modernise the Iranian oil industry. * Austria’s OMV signed a MoU in May 2016 for projects in the Zagros area of western Iran and the Fars field in the south. In June 2017, OMV and Russia’s Gazprom Neft announced a MoU to work in Iran’s oil sector. * Italy’s Saipem signed MoUs in 2016 to cooperate on Iranian pipeline projects, upgrading of refineries and development of the Tous gas field in the northeastern province of Khorasan Razavi. * BASF’s Wintershall oil and gas exploration arm signed a MoU with the National Iranian Oil Company in April 2016. In February 2017, it said it was in talks about a possible investment in Iran, but no decision was on the cards because of uncertainty over the status of economic sanctions. * In January 2017, Iran named 29 companies from more than a dozen countries as being allowed to bid for oil and gas projects using a new, less restrictive contract model. The firms included Shell, Total, Italy’s Eni, Malaysia’s Petronas and Russia’s Gazprom and Lukoil, as well as companies from China, Austria, Japan and elsewhere. * Italy’s Eni signed an agreement with Iran in June 2017 for feasibility studies to develop an oil field and a gas field. * India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd in late February signed an initial non-binding agreement with an Iranian company to develop the Susangerd oilfield in the south of Iran, a company source said. * The National Iranian Oil Company signed a deal in March with Russia’s Zarubezhneft to develop two oilfields in Iran fields, according to SHANA, the news site of the Iranian oil ministry. * Norway’s Saga Energy signed a 2.5 billion euro ($3 billion) deal in October 2017 to build solar power plants in Iran. * U.S. planemaker Boeing agreed in December 2016 to sell 80 aircraft, including 15 Boeing 777-300ER long-range jets, to IranAir. Last month, Boeing said it had found new homes for jets it hoped to deliver to Iran this year, adding it had no Iranian deliveries scheduled or part of production this year. * European planemaker Airbus said in December 2016 it had sealed a deal to sell 100 jets to IranAir. * Iran completed a deal in April 2017 to buy 20 aircraft from European turboprop maker ATR, half-owned by Airbus and Leonardo. * Germany’s Lufthansa said in April 2017 it was in talks with IranAir to provide catering, maintenance and pilot training. * Iran’s Aseman Airlines agreed in April 2017 to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets. * Iran’s Zagros Airlines signed a MoU in June 2017 to buy 20 Airbus A320neo and eight A330neo aircraft. * Iran Airtour signed a MoU in June 2017 for 45 Airbus A320neos. * Germany’s Siemens signed a contract in October 2016 to upgrade Iran’s railway network. It was also to supply components for 50 diesel-electric locomotives to Iran. * China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, signed a 2.2 billion-euro deal in May 2017 with Iran’s MAPNA for electrification of a high-speed rail line between Tehran and Mashhad, according to Iran’s Financial Tribune newspaper. * Iran’s state rail company and its Italian counterpart, Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) signed a final agreement worth 1.2 billion euros in July 2017 to build a high-speed railway between the Iranian cities of Qom and Arak. * French train maker and manufacturing group Alstom signed a deal in July 2017 for a joint venture to build metro and suburban rail carriages in Iran. * French carmaker PSA had signed Iranian production deals worth 700 million euros ($768 million) by May 2017. PSA said in January it sold 444,600 vehicles in Iran last year. * Germany’s Volkswagen said in July 2017 it would start exporting cars to Iran, returning to the market after more than 17 years. But the company said in October 2017 its Spanish arm Seat was no longer looking at the possibility of entering the Iranian car market. * France’s Renault said in August 2017 it had signed a joint venture deal in Iran following an initial partnership agreement a year earlier. The new venture included an engineering and purchasing centre to support the development of local suppliers as well as a plant with an initial production capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year, supplementing Renault’s existing capacity of 200,000 vehicles a year in the country. * Germany’s Mercedes-Benz Trucks signed a contract with Iran Khodro in September 2017, laying the foundation for resuming distribution of its trucks in Iran. * Autoneum, a Swiss maker of sound and heat shields for automobiles, in December 2017 announced a licensing deal for Iranian vehicle supplier Ayegh Khodro Toos to produce carpets, inner dashes and floor insulators for carmakers Iran Khodro and PSA, with production due to start in 2019. * Oberbank signed a deal with Iran in September 2017, enabling it to finance new ventures there and making it one of the first European banks to do so since sanctions were eased. But major global banks have shied away from handling Iran-related business. Among them is HSBC, which has said it has no intention of doing any new business involving Iran. Danish insulin supplier Novo Nordisk decided in September 2015 to invest 70 million euros in a factory in Iran, adding 160 staff to the 130 it maintained in the country throughout the sanctions. Medicines were excepted from the sanctions but shipping drugs into the country was troublesome, due to tight curbs on financial transactions and restrictions on technology. $1 = 0.8445 euros

2018-05-09,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China and India's appetite for Iranian crude: reut.rs/2In5u68 By Clyde Russell NUSA DUA, Indonesia, May 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in pole position to be the major beneficiary of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the Iranian nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. It’s little surprise that one of the few voices of support for Trump’s move was from Saudi Arabia, the main rival to Iran in the volatile Middle East. The Saudis stand to enjoy a double-whammy windfall as crude oil prices may remain strong and state producer Saudi Aramco will also likely to be able to pump more oil to replace any Iranian barrels lost because of the reimposed sanctions. A cherry on top of this is that customers who had been turning away from Saudi crude, such as the world’s top importer China, may be forced to buy more from the Kingdom. This would allow the Saudis to regain market share lost since the 2016 deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, such as Russia, to reduce output in order to tighten global oil markets. The main risk for the Saudis is that the U.S. decision inflames an already tense situation in the Middle East, resulting in increased conflict and even the possibility of outright war. However, the Saudis are probably taking a calculated risk that the conflict situations won’t worsen much, and in the meantime they stand to gain a financial windfall and weaken their key rival at the same time. Whether the eventual reality aligns with what the Saudis hope for is inherently uncertain, but there are some points worth noting. Firstly, despite the usual flourish of belligerence and flamboyance in Trump’s announcement, not much is likely to happen for several months. This is because the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that sanctions won’t be reimposed immediately, rather that it will take up to 180 days to allow Iranian oil customers and other companies involved in doing business with Tehran to make plans. It’s also not clear what sanctions will be reimposed and in what form, with the main risk being the so-called secondary sanctions that would target companies that do business with other entities involved with Iran. This means for the moment it is pure speculation as to how much Iranian oil may be lost to the market. Most analyst estimates seem to vary from around 200,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) being at risk, which would be enough to add to an already existing tightness in global crude markets. But it’s also worth noting that even the upper end of this range could be replaced relatively easily by the rest of OPEC and its allies party to the agreement to restrict production. In addition, crude exports from the United States also have the capacity to increase, especially if oil prices remain high, thereby incentivising shale producers to drill more wells. In short, the global oil supply chain can handle the loss of 500,000 bpd of Iranian crude, although doing so may come at the cost of higher prices. It also remains uncertain as to how buyers of Iranian crude will respond to the U.S. decision. Virtually all of them, from Europe to Asia, vehemently disagree with Trump’s move. China’s imports from Iran were 655,000 bpd in the first quarter, up 17.4 percent from the same period in 2017 and enough to make Iran the sixth-biggest supplier, although the gap to number five Brazil is miniscule. China imported 1.1 million bpd from Saudi Arabia in the first quarter, down 5.7 percent, making the Kingdom the second biggest supplier behind Russia. India, Asia’s second-biggest crude importer, brought in 522,700 bpd of Iranian crude in the first quarter, down 8.8 percent from the same period last year. The South Asian nation’s imports from Saudi Arabia were up 1.9 percent to about 811,000 bpd, but the big mover was imports from Iraq, up a massive 45 percent to 1.13 million bpd. While both India and China have scope to lower their imports from Iran, they will likely be reluctant, especially given the ongoing dispute over pricing between China’s top refiner Sinopec and Saudi Arabia. The most likely outcome is that Asian crude buyers will do only the barest minimum to give the appearance of complying with whatever measures the Trump administration takes - or even openly defy them. The least likely outcome is that Asian countries cooperate fully with the United States in its renewed conflict with Iran. While the next months are likely to be characterised by uncertainty, it’s likely the United States is going to find it considerably harder to make the rest of the world bend to its will this time, especially when the major financial beneficiaries are its own oil producers and the Saudi Arabians.

2018-05-09,"* Jubilation gives way to gloom as renewed sanctions loom * Iranians fear greater hostility from Trump-led administration * Deep frustrations over economic hardship By Parisa Hafezi ANKARA, May 9 (Reuters) - Morad Sabzevari was among thousands of jubilant Iranians who took to the streets to celebrate a nuclear deal with major powers in 2015. He expected it to end his country’s isolation, and even bring prosperity one day. Sabzevari’s hopes were dashed on Tuesday, when President Donald Trump announced the United States was withdrawing from “a horrible, one-sided deal” and reimposing sanctions on Iran. His tougher-than-expected tone rattled Sabzevari, 47, a school teacher in central city of Isfahan, criticised Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who overcame fierce opposition from hardliners to secure the deal. “I am scared. I listened to Trump’s speech on English news channels last night ... It was a declaration of war against Iran. It means pressure. It means dark days and months are ahead of us,” Sabzevari said by telephone. “What should I do? I have two children. Mr. President you failed.” The nuclear pact, designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, was thrashed out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran and traded a lifting of sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear program. Trump said the accord, the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor Barack Obama, failed to address Iran’s ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 and its role in conflicts in the Middle East, where it is involved in proxy wars with U.S. ally Saudi Arabia. Rouhani has sought to reassure ordinary Iranians, already deeply frustrated by high unemployment and low living standards, that Iran’s oil-reliant economy could withstand a return to the economic pressures that will follow Trump’s decision. But Fariba Saravi, 26-year-old PhD student at Tehran Azad University, was pessimistic. “I am tired of empty words, promises, lies ... Trump’s message was clear. We will be squeezed. We will be isolated again but this time with a crazy person like Trump, it will be worse than before (the deal),” she said. Iran’s economy has continued to struggle despite the easing of sanctions from 2016. Average unemployment of 12 percent rises close to 30 percent among Iran’s restless youth - more than 30 percent of Iran’s 80 million population are aged 18 to 30. In late December, Iranians staged nationwide demonstrations over poor living standards, calling on Rouhani as well as top clerical leaders to step down. For many, the picture looks even grimmer after Trump’s decision and there is a risk the deal will collapse entirely even though European signatories are trying to hold it together. “You know what? They did not have money to pay our salaries. Now it will be even worse ... God help us,” said factory worker Mostafa, 38, in the northern city of Noshahr. “I have not got my wage in the past two months. Mr. Rouhani promised more jobs ... but now I will be jobless.” Pressure will mount on the Iranian leadership when U.S. restrictions cut its oil exports that are the engine of Iran’s economy, raising the prospect of further unrest. “Why should foreigners invest in Iran when we are trying to move our businesses to another country,” said a businessman, who asked not to be named, in the holy Shi’ite city of Mashhad. “I am in the dried fruit export business. Since last night, I have been seriously thinking of moving to a neighbouring country like Turkey.” More Iranians could come to the same conclusion as sanctions bite. Many foreign firms have shunned Iran, in part due to the remaining sanctions unilaterally imposed by the United States over what it says are human rights violations, terrorism, and the dominant role of the Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iran’s economy. Younger, particularly urban Iranians, have wider concerns as their country is squeezed economically. “I don’t care what politicians do. They are all liars. But now I almost have no hope for more freedoms, social, cultural and even political,” said Garshasb Amini, 19, in the central city of Yazd. Rouhani, a longtime establishment insider who won the presidency in 2013 and 2017, was bolstered by the support of many Iranians yearning for freedoms. But rights groups say there has been little, if any progress. Rouhani and his allies say hardliners, who dominate the judiciary and security services, are a roadblock to more freedoms at home. Maryam Saberi, 51, who lives in Tehran’s affluent Zaferaniyeh neighbourhood, has more pressing concerns. “I could not sleep last night. I am so scared of Iran being attacked by Israel. I remember when Iraq bombed Tehran during the (1980-88) war … I don’t care about the nuclear programme. I just want my country to be safe,” she said. Hardliners are putting their faith in Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who, in Iran’s complex power structure, has the final say on matters of state. “I don’t care what Trump does. My beloved Khamenei will lead us out of this as he has done in the past,” said Gholamreza Ashtiani, 22, a member of Iran’s volunteer Basij militia in the holy city of Qom. “Death to America. Death to Israel,” he said.

2018-05-09,"(Adds additional quote and information) BEIRUT, May 9 (Reuters) - Iran’s Supreme Leader called U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear agreement “silly and superficial”, said he did not trust the European countries that were sticking with the agreement, and cast doubt on the future of the deal. The comments came on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s official website on Wednesday, where Khamenei reiterated his distaste for the agreement. “I said many times from the first day: don’t trust America,” Khamenei said. And he added, “I don’t trust these three countries,” Britain, France and Germany. All three are parties to the agreement and were trying after Trump’s withdrawal to salvage the deal. But Khamenei sounded dubious about their efforts. “If you can’t get a definite guarantee, then the nuclear deal can not be continued,” he said. Khamenei heaped scorn on Trump, saying “You heard last night that the president of America made some silly and superficial comments. “He had maybe more than 10 lies in his comments. He threatened the regime and the people, saying I’ll do this and that. Mr. Trump, I tell you on behalf of the Iranian people: You’ve made a mistake. “This man will turn to dust and his body will become food for snakes and ants,” he added. “And the Islamic Republic will still be standing.” Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, reluctantly gave his backing for the Iran nuclear deal and has publicly criticized the U.S. multiple times for not following through on its promises under the agreement. Raising the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme was an excuse to curb the Islamic Republic’s regional influence and missile programme, Khamenei said. Accepting negotiations on its missiles and regional influence would mean Iran had to make endless concessions, he said. “We accepted the nuclear deal, but the enmity against the Islamic Republic did not end,” Khamenei said. Iran needs to preserve its nuclear programme because the country will need 20,000 megawatts of electricity in the next few years, he said.

2018-05-09,"(Corrects move in bond yields in 3rd paragraph to “rose”, not “fell”.) * Oil at 3-1/2-year high as Trump move threatens global supply * Dollar continues to climb, hits fresh 2018 high * U.S. Treasury yields pop over 3 pct, safe-haven demand muted * Emerging market currencies hit by prospects of higher U.S. rates * World stocks hold steady, European shares rise By Kit Rees LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices jumped back to 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, while the dollar continued its tireless ascent and world stocks held steady. Trump’s move sparked worries about fresh tension in the Middle East and uncertainty over global oil supplies. Demand for safe-haven assets remained limited, however, as the price of gold retreated and bond yields rose. The U.S. 10-year Treasury breached the key 3 percent level once more and was last at 3.0080 percent, a two-week high, supported by expectations of higher interest rates. Caroline Simmons, deputy head of the UK chief investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said that while generally central banks tend to look through the oil price in terms of its impact on inflation, it is still of note to market watchers. “In an environment where the Fed, particularly, is already at its inflation target and people are closely watching the pace of the monetary tightening, something like this which could possibly nudge inflation a little bit higher is going to be quite interesting for the market,” Simmons said. “That’s why you’re seeing the yields go up a little bit on the bonds.” The impact of Trump’s decision remained broadly limited to oil markets and energy-related stocks. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures hit their highest level since November 2014 at $71.17 per barrel, up 2.8 percent. Brent crude futures jumped as much as 2.8 percent to a 3-1/2-year high of $77.20. “There is still an interim period before sanctions kick in. And other signatories and Iran want to keep the deal going so there is a period where things could be hammered out,” said Benjamin Schroeder, rates strategist at ING. “But I would have expected a bit of a safe-haven bid this morning,” he added, referring to bonds. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat in percentage terms and continued to trade in a narrow range. The pan-European STOXX 600 meanwhile rose 0.2 percent as oil majors gained and earnings from Siemens and Imperial Brands dominated the market action. “In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,” he added. The reaction in Asian markets was more pronounced as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have deals with Iran. Trump’s move is also seen as likely to worsen already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent. Iran, the third-biggest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4 percent of the world’s oil supplies. The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. The rise in Treasury yields helped fuel the dollar’s rally, with the greenback trading at a fresh high for 2018. The dollar’s index against a basket of major currencies was last up at 93.264, and has risen 1.2 percent so far this year. Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been clobbered in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets. Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit. The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low and the Turkish lira reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are both down around 1 percent. The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low, and has slid 1 percent this week. Among major currencies, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit an 11-month low of $0.74130 and last stood at $0.74315 . The euro continued to slide to a fresh 4-1/2-month low of $1.1821 and last stood at $1.1841, having declined more than 4 percent in the past three weeks. The currency was hit by increasing prospects of another election in Italy as the political impasse there has continued since early March’s inconclusive ballot. The British pound stood at $1.3538, near a four-month low of $1.3482 touched on Tuesday. The dollar rose 0.5 percent to 109.70 yen, edging near its three-month high of 110.02 yen touched last week.

2018-05-09,"JUBA, May 9 (Reuters) - South Sudan’s government urged the United States on Wednesday not to “abandon” the country after Washington said it would review its assistance programs because it could not continue a partnership with leaders perpetuating “endless war”. “We are asking the United States not to abandon this country (South Sudan) because we need them … their role to assist the population of South Sudan is crucial and cannot be ignored”, said foreign affairs ministry spokesman Mawien Makol Ariik. The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to South Sudan, which has been in the throes of a civil war since late 2013 that has displaced around a third of the 12 million-strong populaton and killed tens of thousands of people. In a sharply worded statement on Tuesday the White House said the United States was a “proud and hopeful supporter” of South Sudan when it gained independence in 2011. “Seven years later, the leaders of this country have squandered this partnership ... killed their own people, and repeatedly demonstrated their inability and unwillingness to live up to their commitments to end the country’s civil war.” The U.S. funding provides aid to millions of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda and lifesaving assistance such as food to people still inside the war-torn country. Washington’s statement says the United States is committed to saving lives but does not want its assistance to “prolong the conflict” or facilitiate corrupt behavior by elites. Producton in some of South Sudan’s oil fields has been shut down due to the conflict, but the government says around 130,000 barrels per day of oil are being produced. Juba spends well more than half ifs budget on weapons and paying soldiers, according to U.N. experts. Washington should “reconsider whatever harsh matter they are taking against this country”, Ariik told Reuters. The government led by President Salva Kiir is fighting a war with a number of rebel groups, some of them loyal to former vice president Riek Machar, who is under house arrest in South Africa. The warring parties signed a ceasefire in December in the Ethiopian capital, but it was violated within hours. A new round of talks is scheduled to begin later this month after delays, but there is little hope among diplomats it will end the war. “The Government of South Sudan has lost credibility, and the United States is losing patience,” the White House declared.

2018-05-09,"SINGAPORE/NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korea said on Wednesday it would seek U.S. exemptions to buy Iranian oil, a path many big oil consumers are likely to follow in the wake of new U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which will tighten world oil markets and push up prices. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a key supplier, especially to refiners in Asia. The United States plans to impose new unilateral sanctions after abandoning an agreement reached in late 2015 which limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for removing joint U.S.-Europe sanctions, which included strict curbs on crude oil exports. New U.S. sanctions will include measures aimed at its oil and shipping sectors, with a six-month “wind down” period “to allow companies to end contracts, terminate business, (and) get their money out”, according to the U.S. State Department.  “President Trump is clearly articulating that he has minimal desire in an alternative agreement with Iran,” said Ehsan Khoman, head of research for Middle East and North Africa at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. During the last round of sanctions, Iran’s oil supplies fell by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd), but the country re-emerged as a major oil exporter after sanctions were lifted in January 2016. Since then, Iran ramped up supplies, producing 3.81 million bpd in March 2018, almost 4 percent of global output. Its crude exports averaged over 2 million bpd in January-March quarter this year. Analysts now expect Iran’s supplies to fall by between 200,000 bpd and 1 million bpd, depending on how many other countries fall in line with Washington. GRAPHIC: Iran crude oil exports - reut.rs/2K4MWVq South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said it planned “to minimize the damage” to its companies, adding it would seek an exemption from sanctions. Japan may follow suit. “Japan and South Korea may comply with the proposed U.S. reimposition of Iranian sanctions on the concern of losing the U.S. security umbrella vis-à-vis North Korea,” Khoman said. Trade data already show a reduction of Iranian oil supplies to Japan and South Korea, and refinery sources confirmed they had started shifting purchases in preparation for renewed sanctions. Iranian crude oil shipments to Japan and South Korea have fallen by half from their post-sanction peak in March 2017, hitting just over 300,000 bpd in April, according to ship tracking data. GRAPHIC: Iran oil shipments to Japan & South Korea - reut.rs/2wq8Gcs The biggest single buyer of Iran’s crude is China, which imported about 900,000 bpd in mid-2016 but has scaled back shipments to around 600,000 bpd in 2018. A senior official with a Chinese oil major, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said new sanctions would hurt Chinese refiners by pushing up the price of crude. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 hit its highest since November 2014 on Wednesday at over $77 (57 pounds) a barrel.  China’s response to the U.S. sanctions is unclear. Beijing has opposed the U.S. move and many Chinese companies may continue to buy Iranian crude, analysts say. And Chinese refiners say there are alternative suppliers, including Russia, Saudi Arabia and exporters in West Africa.    In India, another major buyer of Iranian oil, refiners hope they can continue importing Iranian oil. During the last round of sanctions, India enjoyed waivers allowing limited Iranian oil imports paid for in rupees instead of U.S. dollars. “The impact (of new sanctions) in India will be there, but not so high,” said R Ramachandran, head of refineries at state-owned oil firm Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL.NS). When sanctions were loosened against Tehran in 2016, India ramped up imports from Iran to almost 900,000 bpd in late 2016, but intake has fallen back to around 500,000 bpd this year. GRAPHIC: Iran oil shipments to China & India - reut.rs/2rtsZRh The threat of new sanctions comes as demand in Asia, the world’s biggest oil-consuming region, hit a record and producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia restrict supply to prop up prices. As a result, crude oil inventories in major developed nations have fallen sharply in the last year and a half to 2.85 billion barrels, only slightly above their five-year average. Trying to ease market concerns, Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday that it would work with other producers to diminish the impact of any shortage in oil supplies.

2018-05-09,"(Replaces dropped words in headline with no other change to text) JAKARTA, May 9 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo plans to expand a palm replanting scheme he started last year to cover 185,000 hectares (457,000 acres) of plantations in 2018, according to government press releases on Wednesday. Widodo kicked off the scheme, which was funded by a levy on palm oil exports, in October 2017. The government aimed to replant palm trees on 20,000 hectares of smallholder plantations to try to increase output last year. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of palm oil. “We must work hard to be at the forefront of management including for this rejuvenation programme,” Widodo said, according to a press release by the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs. The government is looking to replant palm trees that have aged more than 25 years on a total of 5.61 million hectares of plantations all over Indonesia, the ministry said. Smallholder plantations produce only 2 to 3 tonnes of fresh palm fruit bunches per hectare a year, much smaller than the productivity of plantations owned by large corporations, the Indonesia Estate Crop Fund said in a press release. The Crop Fund manages the revenue raised by the palm oil exports and is paying for the replanting programme. The government has said yields could be boosted to 8 tonnes per hectare a year if existing palm trees were replanted using better seedlings, with the new trees starting production within two years. Indonesian palm oil exports have come under pressure in Europe where European Union lawmakers have approved draft measures that would ban the use of palm oil in biodiesel from 2021. At the same time, the EU recently removed anti-dumping duties for imports of biodiesel containing palm oil for some Indonesian producers. Plantations that receive funding through the replanting scheme will have to receive Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification, which means they must be legally owned, do not encroach on forest areas and use good agriculture practices without burning.

Germany wants one million electric cars onto the road by 2020, a target it will likely miss. The government said in April it was ready to offer support to companies that make batteries for electric vehicles. Sono Motors, a Munich-based company founded in 2016, is developing the Sion, a fully-electric vehicle that has solar cells integrated into its bodywork. It can be charged via solar power, from conventional power outlets or other electric cars. The battery system that ElringKlinger will provide for the Sion will offer a range of around 250 km (155 miles) before it needs recharging, ElringKlinger said. It said the order from Sono Motors was worth several hundred million euros over a period of eight years, and production would start in the second half of 2019 at one of its German plants. Sono says it has around 4,000 orders for the Sion, which it aims to start selling next year.

Hojatoleslam Mojtaba Zulnouri, who heads the nuclear committee in parliament, said the motion asks President Hassan Rouhani’s government to secure “necessary guarantees” from the remaining signatories to the nuclear deal. They include Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China. Zulnouri, a lawmaker from the city of Qom, did not specify what guarantees should be sought, but said if they are not met then Iran should resume high level uranium enrichment. Ali Mottahari, a lawmaker from Tehran, said there was a “limited opportunity” for European powers to “bring a solid guarantee” that would allow Iran to stick with the deal. “But if this doesn’t happen then it’s possible that we will exit the nuclear deal or take other steps,” he told news agency IRNA.

2018-05-09,"WARSAW, May 9 (Reuters) - Divers were being sent on Wednesday to try to rescue three Polish miners trapped almost a kilometre (half a mile) underground since an earthquake caused a tunnel to collapse four days ago. “We hope that they are there, waiting for our help,” Tomasz Sledz, deputy head of the coal company JSW, told a news conference. The quake struck the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie mine in southern Poland on Saturday morning, trapping seven miners. Two were found dead and two others have been rescued. JSW Chief Executive Daniel Ozon said the next steps would be to drill a new borehole, pump out water and send in divers from the copper and silver mining firm KGHM. “These actions take place in extreme conditions. The priority is to free these people, at a minimised risk for the rescuers,” he said, putting faith in the trapped miners’ “knowledge, experience and intuition”. About 250 people were working underground at the time of the quake. The missing miners were in a team drilling a new tunnel. The 3.5-4.0 magnitude quake was the strongest recorded in the mine, officials there said. Around 83,000 people work in Poland’s coal mining sector. Fifteen miners died in 2017, and eight have died so far this year.

Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio that France wanted to stick to the nuclear accord that Tehran agreed with world powers in 2015 - a pact which he said Iran had honoured. Macron’s meeting would be followed by high-level talks between the Iranians and Britain and Germany, as well as France, Le Drian said. Meetings would also be held with the likes of oil giant Total and others with major business and economic stakes in the region, he added. “The deal is not dead. There’s an American withdrawal from the deal but the deal is still there,” he said. “The region deserves better than further destabilisation provoked by American withdrawal. So we want to adhere to it and see to it that Iran does too, that Iran behaves with restraint.” The 2015 agreement, worked out by the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China and Iran, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme. The pact was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Trump said on Tuesday he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran as he pulled out of “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made”. Other countries that helped Iran develop its nuclear programme would also face sanctions, he added. Britain, Germany and France have already urged the United States not to take steps that would make life harder for other countries that still want to stick to the pact. Separately, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told French radio that Trump’s decision on Iran was a mistake and that the United States should not consider itself as the world’s “economic policeman”. Le Drian said France, like others, was well aware that there were concerns about issues beyond Iran’s nuclear capability, namely its ballistic weapons programme, but said they could be addressed without ditching the nuclear deal. “Yes, there is a real risk of confrontation,” he told RTL, regarding Trump’s decision on Iran. “I hope it will not be a setback for peace,” he added. Le Drian said that regular reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency had showed Iran was complying with the agreement.

2018-05-09,"PARIS/FRANKFURT, May 9 (Reuters) - Major European companies including carmaker PSA, plane manufacturer Airbus and Siemens said they were keeping a close watch on relations with Iran after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal. Peugeot-manufacturer PSA, one of the big European businesses with operations in the country, said it hoped the European Union would adopt a common position on Iran. “Like other economic players, we are following the evolution of the matter, and are also following the EU’s official position on this topic,” said a spokesman for PSA, adding that PSA hoped the EU would adopt its own independent position regarding Iran. Siemens said it would also closely monitor the situation. “We are assessing the implications of the Iran decision,” Siemens Chief Financial Officer Ralf Thomas told reporters. “Of course we will always comply with export control regulations, and we would look at how different governments set the rules. We have a firm grip on our position,” added Thomas. Airbus, which won a bumper order with IranAir along with Boeing, said it needed time to study the impact of Trump’s decision on Iran. On May 8, President Trump pulled the United States out of the international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies.

Trump’s decision could scupper Total’s multibillion-dollar gas project in the country unless it can secure a waiver.

2018-05-09,"* Oil near 3 1/2-year high as Trump move threatens global supply * Asian shares on defensive amid heightened geopolitical risk * European shares seen starting flat * Emerging market currencies hit by prospects of higher U.S. rates By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices jumped back to near 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, sparking worries about fresh tension in the Middle East and global oil supplies. Asian shares ticked lower as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have deals with Iran. Trump’s move is also seen as risking worsening already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region. However, European shares looked set to start flat on Wednesday and U.S. S&P futures were little changed. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE to open 7 points higher at 7,573, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 22 points higher at 12,934 and Paris’ CAC to open up 4 points at 5,526. “In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,” he added. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $70.62 per barrel, up 2.3 percent and near Monday’s peak of $70.84, the highest level since November 2014. Brent crude futures jumped as much as 2.5 percent to a 3-1/2-year high of $76.75 in Asian trade on Wednesday. Iran, the third-biggest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4 percent of the world’s oil supplies. The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent. While some investors drew comfort from the fact Iran pledged to remain in the nuclear deal despite the U.S. pullout, they are wary of escalating tensions in the Middle East. Israel is on a high alert, mobilising reserve forces while Syrian state media accused Israel of launching missiles at a target near Damascus on Tuesday just after Trump’s announcement. In neighbouring Lebanon, Hezbollah and its political allies had just made significant gains in a parliamentary election, boosting an Iranian-backed movement fiercely opposed to Israel and underlining Tehran’s growing regional clout. On Wall Street, caution over rising political risks was palpable. Energy shares gained 0.78 percent and defence contractor stocks rose, with Lockheed Martin up 1.3 percent and Northrop Grumman 3.3 percent. Boeing, however, fell 0.6 percent as a deal to sell jets to Iran was seen as under threat. The S&P500 closed down 0.03 percent, paring earlier losses of 0.65 percent. The Dow Industrial Average and Nasdaq were little changed as well. Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been clobbered in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets. Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit. The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low and the Turkish lira reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are down 1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. The Indonesian rupiah hit a 2-1/2-year low, and has slid 1 percent this week. Among major currencies, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit an 11-month low of $0.74245 and last stood at $0.74355 . The euro hit a 4 1/2-month low of $1.1838 on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1845, having declined more than 4 percent in the past three weeks. The currency was hit by increasing prospects of an another election in Italy as the political impasse there has continued since early March’s inconclusive ballot. The British pound stood at $1.3526, near a 4-month low of $1.3485 touched on Tuesday. The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 109.51 yen, edging near its three-month high of 110.05 yen touched last week as higher oil prices help to lift U.S. bond yields.

2018-05-09,"TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd’s Horizon Nuclear Power unit has received an assurance from the British government that it will guarantee loans for the construction of two reactors in Wales, the Mainichi newspaper reported on Wednesday. British Prime Minister Theresa May met Hitachi Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi last week in London and asked him to go ahead the project, conveying the government’s intention to fully guarantee the loans, the paper said, without citing a source. As the project costs have increased to meet new safety provisions, Hitachi is still pushing for the British government to take a stake in the project and guarantee electricity prices to ensure it is profitable, the Mainichi said. The cost of the Hitachi project in Wales has ballooned to 3 trillion yen ($27.4 billion) due to the tougher safety measures, the newspaper said. Hitachi declined to comment, when contacted by Reuters. The British government is seeking new ways to fund nuclear projects after criticism over a deal awarded to France’s EDF to build the first nuclear plant in Britain in 20 years, which could cost consumers 30 billion pounds ($41 billion). Britain needs to replace ageing nuclear reactors and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s but high up-front costs have delayed the construction of new plants. For Hitachi, Horizon would help further Japan’s ambitions to export its nuclear technology after the Fukushima nuclear disaster made the construction of new reactors difficult at home. Hitachi’s Horizon plans to construct at least 5.4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity at two sites in Britain – at Wylfa Newydd in Wales and at Oldbury-on-Severn in England.

2018-05-09,"WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The United States risks greater isolation and unpredictability in its anti-Iran drive after President Donald Trump opted to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal despite warnings from European allies, advisers and even some fellow Republicans, experts say. Trump said on Tuesday he was withdrawing the United States from the international nuclear deal with Iran, arguing the deal provided Tehran generous sanctions relief without imposing tough enough limits on its nuclear program or other “sinister” activities. But analysts said the decision could make it harder for the United States to rally European allies and others behind future action against Iran, which extends well beyond the nuclear arena to include threats by Tehran’s proxies in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and even Afghanistan. The U.S. move also creates a more unpredictable environment in the Middle East, in which Iran could choose to lash out against U.S. interests more openly or keep chipping away at them and extending its regional influence. “We are now alone on a more dangerous path with fewer options,” retired Army general Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the U.S. military’s Joint Chiefs of staff, wrote on Twitter. Underscoring the tension in the region, the Israeli military went on high alert on Tuesday for a possible flare-up with neighboring Syria, which is allied to Iran. “It’s going to weaken the United States,” said Nicholas Burns, the State Department’s third-ranking official under Republican President George W. Bush, saying it would empower Iran’s hardliners, further isolate the United States from Russia and China on Iran policy and vex European allies. “This is going to have a profoundly negative impact on the willingness of the Europeans to work with us in the way that they have been for a very long time.” One U.S. official noted that a deterioration in the U.S.-Iran relationship would likely have negative effects across the border in neighboring Iraq, where voters are due to elect a new parliament on Saturday. “As tension goes up in the U.S.-Iran relationship, it’s always bad for the U.S.-Iraq relationship,” said the U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has accused Iran of “mucking around” in the parliamentary election, in which Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is seeking another term after a successful, U.S.-backed war against Islamic State militants. Mattis, who once spoke publicly of the need to abide by the Iran nuclear deal, has since tempered his remarks and told Congress it was an “imperfect arms control agreement” that needed to be fixed. But Mattis, in private conversations, has also stressed the need to act with allies, given the threat he believes that Iran poses in the region, one U.S. official familiar with the conversations told Reuters. In April 26 remarks to Congress, Mattis said: “We need to focus on what is in the best interest of Middle East stability and the threat that Iran poses.” He said that threat extended beyond the nuclear program to “their support for terrorism” as well as their cyber threat. A Western diplomat doubted the Iranians would retaliate against the United States in Syria because of the risk of Israeli retaliation, or in Iraq, where Tehran’s influence has vastly expanded since the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled former dictator Saddam Hussein. “They have no interest in destabilizing Iraq. Things are not going so bad for them in Iraq. And in Syria, there is the big, big stick, the Israeli stick, and they feel that the stick is ready to fall,” the diplomat said. “They are not going to risk a war with Israel ... to punish the Americans.” Israel has traded blows with Iranian forces in Syria since February, stirring concern that major escalation could be looming. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that after identifying “irregular activity” by Iranian forces in Syria, it instructed civic authorities on the Golan Heights to ready bomb shelters, deployed new defenses and mobilized some reservist forces. The United States accuses Iran of escalating the civil war in Yemen and threatening to turn it into a broader regional conflict by supplying advanced weaponry, including missiles, to Houthi rebels who have fired rockets at targets in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. intelligence official acknowledged concerns that Iran could, with some deniability, further assist the Houthis in Yemen as they target Iran’s arch-rival Saudi Arabia. A successful missile strike from Yemen that kills large numbers of Saudis could trigger a major backlash, stoking risks of a broader regional war, experts say. On the nuclear front, a collapse of the deal could also hasten the risk that Iran covertly attempts to reconstitute a nuclear program that once consumed U.S. intelligence officials and military planners. Iran denies it has tried to build atomic weapons and says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Mary

2018-05-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - An explosion on Wednesday at a small coal mine in China’s Hunan province that killed two workers while another three are missing, the Hunan coal mine safety regulation bureau said. The incident occurred at Hunan Baodian Qunli Coal Mining Co, which produces 120,000 tonnes of coal annually. Hunan’s mine safety regulator said in a separate statement in September that it temporarily halted production at Baodian Qunli mine after finding the did not follow safety standards and its production licence had expired.  It is not clear whether Baodian Qunli had a production licence when the explosion occurred. The accident happened at     3 a.m. on Wednesday, the safety bureau said. The cause of the accident is under investigation, said the municipal government of Shaoyang, the city near where the mine is located. The coal mine is owned by Hunan Baodian Group, which is 40 percent owned by the municipal asset manager for the city of Shaoyang with China Guodian Group holding the rest. Guodian has made several attempts to sell its stake in the coal mine to private investors since 2014, according to filings with the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange, a state-owned assets auction house.

2018-05-09,"* Oil near 3 1/2-year high as Trump move threatens global supply * Asian shares on defensive amid heightened geopolitical risk * Emerging market currencies hit by prospects of higher U.S. rates * 10-year U.S. yield edges near 3 pct on higher oil prices By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices jumped back to near 3 1/2-year highs on Wednesday after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, sparking worries about global oil supplies. Asian shares ticked down as renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran were seen as disruptive for many companies that have deals with Iran. Trump’s move is also seen as risking worsening already-tense relations between Iran and U.S. allies in the region. “In the very short term, it looks as if the impact of heightened geopolitical worries was limited to oil markets. But that is not the end of the story,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “U.S. sanctions could affect various industries. And tensions between Iran and Israel look set to intensify. Those will begin to cap share prices,” he added. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures traded at $70.57 per barrel, up 2.2 percent and near Monday’s peak of $70.84, the highest level since November 2014. Brent crude futures jumped as much as 2.5 percent to a 3 1/2-year high of $76.75 in Asian trade on Wednesday. Iran, the third-biggest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), or about 4.0 percent of the world’s oil supplies. The U.S. Treasury said it will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including those aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.2 percent while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent. While some investors drew comfort from the fact Iran pledged to remain in the nuclear deal despite the U.S. pullout, they are wary of escalating tensions in the Middle East. Israel is on a high alert, mobilising reserve forces while Syrian state media accused Israel of launching missiles at a target near Damascus on Tuesday just after Trump’s announcement. In neighbouring Lebanon, Hezbollah and its political allies had just made significant gains in a parliamentary election, boosting an Iranian-backed movement fiercely opposed to Israel and underlining Tehran’s growing regional clout. On Wall Street, caution over rising political risks was palpable. Energy shares gained 0.78 percent and defence contractor stocks rose, with Lockheed Martin up 1.3 percent and Northrop Grumman 3.3 percent. Boeing, however, fell 0.6 percent as a deal to sell jets to Iran was seen as under threat. The S&P500 closed down 0.03 percent, paring earlier losses of 0.65 percent. The Dow Industrial Average and Nasdaq were little changed as well. Souring risk sentiment is hitting emerging markets, which have been clobbered in recent weeks by concerns about capital outflows, as the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates lures investors back to U.S. bonds rather than riskier assets. Countries with high perceived political risks, such as Brazil and Turkey, were among the worst hit. The Brazilian real hit a near two-year low and the Turkish lira reached a record low. Since the start of this week, those currencies are down 1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively. The Indonesian rupiah hit 2 1/2-year low, and has slid 1 percent this week. Among major currencies, the risk-sensitive Australian dollar hit an 11-month low of $0.74245 and last stood at $0.7436 . The euro hit a 4 1/2-month low of $1.1838 on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1860, having declined more than 4 percent in the past three weeks. The currency was hit by increasing prospects of an another election in Italy as the political impasse there has continued since early March’s inconclusive ballot. The British pound stood at $1.3548, near a 4-month low of $1.3485 touched on Tuesday. The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 109.54 yen, edging near its three-month high of 110.05 yen touched last week as higher oil prices help to lift U.S. bond yields.

2018-05-09," NUSA DUA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in pole position to be the major beneficiary of U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to walk away from the Iranian nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on the Islamic Republic. It’s little surprise that one of the few voices of support for Trump’s move was from Saudi Arabia, the main rival to Iran in the volatile Middle East. The Saudis stand to enjoy a double-whammy windfall as crude oil prices may remain strong and state producer Saudi Aramco will also likely to be able to pump more oil to replace any Iranian barrels lost because of the reimposed sanctions. A cherry on top of this is that customers who had been turning away from Saudi crude, such as the world’s top importer China, may be forced to buy more from the Kingdom. This would allow the Saudis to regain market share lost since the 2016 deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, such as Russia, to reduce output in order to tighten global oil markets. (GRAPHIC: China and India's appetite for Iranian crude: reut.rs/2In5u68) The main risk for the Saudis is that the U.S. decision inflames an already tense situation in the Middle East, resulting in increased conflict and even the possibility of outright war. However, the Saudis are probably taking a calculated risk that the conflict situations won’t worsen much, and in the meantime they stand to gain a financial windfall and weaken their key rival at the same time. Whether the eventual reality aligns with what the Saudis hope for is inherently uncertain, but there are some points worth noting. Firstly, despite the usual flourish of belligerence and flamboyance in Trump’s announcement, not much is likely to happen for several months. This is because the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that sanctions won’t be reimposed immediately, rather that it will take up to 180 days to allow Iranian oil customers and other companies involved in doing business with Tehran to make plans. It’s also not clear what sanctions will be reimposed and in what form, with the main risk being the so-called secondary sanctions that would target companies that do business with other entities involved with Iran. This means for the moment it is pure speculation as to how much Iranian oil may be lost to the market. Most analyst estimates seem to vary from around 200,000 to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) being at risk, which would be enough to add to an already existing tightness in global crude markets. But it’s also worth noting that even the upper end of this range could be replaced relatively easily by the rest of OPEC and its allies party to the agreement to restrict production. In addition, crude exports from the United States also have the capacity to increase, especially if oil prices remain high, thereby incentivising shale producers to drill more wells. In short, the global oil supply chain can handle the loss of 500,000 bpd of Iranian crude, although doing so may come at the cost of higher prices. It also remains uncertain as to how buyers of Iranian crude will respond to the U.S. decision. Virtually all of them, from Europe to Asia, vehemently disagree with Trump’s move. China’s imports from Iran were 655,000 bpd in the first quarter, up 17.4 percent from the same period in 2017 and enough to make Iran the sixth-biggest supplier, although the gap to number five Brazil is miniscule. China imported 1.1 million bpd from Saudi Arabia in the first quarter, down 5.7 percent, making the Kingdom the second biggest supplier behind Russia. India, Asia’s second-biggest crude importer, brought in 522,700 bpd of Iranian crude in the first quarter, down 8.8 percent from the same period last year. The South Asian nation’s imports from Saudi Arabia were up 1.9 percent to about 811,000 bpd, but the big mover was imports from Iraq, up a massive 45 percent to 1.13 million bpd. While both India and China have scope to lower their imports from Iran, they will likely be reluctant, especially given the ongoing dispute over pricing between China’s top refiner Sinopec and Saudi Arabia. The most likely outcome is that Asian crude buyers will do only the barest minimum to give the appearance of complying with whatever measures the Trump administration takes - or even openly defy them. The least likely outcome is that Asian countries cooperate fully with the United States in its renewed conflict with Iran. While the next months are likely to be characterised by uncertainty, it’s likely the United States is going to find it considerably harder to make the rest of the world bend to its will this time, especially when the major financial beneficiaries are its own oil producers and the Saudi Arabians.

2018-05-09,"(Adds Conoco response) CARACAS, May 8 (Reuters) - A legal dispute between ConocoPhillips and Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA could leave Curacao’s economically important Isla refinery without crude oil to process, posing a “potential crisis” for the Caribbean island, Curacao’s prime minister said on Tuesday. Conoco has won court orders allowing it to seize PDVSA assets on Caribbean islands, including Curacao, in efforts to collect on a $2 billion arbitral award linked to the 2007 nationalization of Conoco assets. The operations of the 335,000 barrel-per-day Isla refinery, which provides as much as 10 percent of Curacao’s gross domestic product, could be left without crude supplies if PDVSA halts all oil shipments to prevent them from being seized, Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath said in a telephone interview. “We are aware of the potential risks for the operation of the refinery,” Rhuggenaath said. “A stoppage of the operation would have a devastating impact economically and socially.” PDVSA has already suspended oil storage and shipping from its Caribbean facilities, according to a PDVSA source and Reuters data. Curacao, a small island off the coast of Venezuela, is prepared to purchase refined products on the global market to ensure it can maintain supplies for the local population as well as for shipping. “This is indeed a potential crisis that can very profoundly affect the social and economic situation of our island, and therefore we are always willing to discuss and reach out to relevant parties,” Rhuggenaath said. He said Conoco has yet to seize any assets. Curacao is still scrutinizing a lien - a legal instrument that paves the way for an asset seizure - because the government’s legal counsel does not fully understand it, he said. Conoco is also seeking to seize assets on the nearby island of Bonaire, where PDVSA owns a storage terminal. In contrast, Isla is owned by Curacao state-run firms and is leased to PDVSA. “This is a different situation than in Bonaire,” said the prime minister. Neither PDVSA nor Conoco has contacted Curacao authorities regarding how the legal dispute could affect the island, according to Rhuggenaath. ConocoPhillips said it has sought to resolve issues caused by its efforts to collect the arbitration award. “We have been in touch with the local officials and are working to address their concerns,” spokesman Daren Beaudo said. “As we said previously, we will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions.” PDVSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Curacao is a constituent country within the kingdom of the Netherlands, with a vibrant tourism industry and deep-water ports used by the oil industry. During the oil boom years, Venezuelans flooded the island to shop and vacation. But the OPEC nation’s calamitous economic decline in recent years has turned Curacao and neighboring islands into havens for migrants seeking escape from hunger and disease.

2018-05-09,"(Adds comments from diplomats, U.S. officials, Reuters/Ipsos poll) * “Horrible one-sided deal,” says Trump * Iran says Trump’s move is “illegal” * America’s European allies concerned * Israel, Saudi Arabia welcome Trump decision * Pullout could stoke Middle East conflicts By Steve Holland and Yara Bayoumy WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East, upsetting European allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. Trump said in a televised address from the White House that he would reimpose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran to undermine “a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.” The 2015 agreement, worked out by the United States, five other world powers and Iran, lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. The pact was designed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. But Trump complained that the accord, the signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, did not address Iran’s ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria. Trump’s decision intensifies the strain on the trans-Atlantic alliance since he took office 16 months ago. One by one, European leaders came to Washington and tried to meet his demands, while pleading with him to preserve the deal. By the middle of last week, however, it was becoming increasingly clear to some diplomats that Trump would not be moved. “We felt like we were going through the motions,” said a person close to the negotiations. Even Trump’s top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk Trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up, a White House official said. The Trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal with allies, but it is far from clear if the Europeans would go for that and if they could convince Iran to accept it. The leaders of Britain, Germany and France, which were signatories to the deal along with China and Russia, said in a joint statement that Trump’s decision was a cause for “regret and concern.” A Western diplomat was more pointed. “It announces sanctions for which the first victims will be Trump’s European allies,” the diplomat said, adding that it was clear Trump did not care about the alliance. Abandoning the Iran pact was one of the most consequential decisions of Trump’s high-stakes “America First” policy, which has led him to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, come close to a trade war with China and pull out of an Asian-Pacific trade deal. It also appeared to reflect the growing influence within the administration of Iran hawks like new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton. Both favored getting out of the deal but did not need to press their case as Trump had already made up his mind, a senior White House official said. Trump had reluctantly been granting Iran sanctions relief every few months and by middle of 2017 was already furious at aides for trying to persuade him to stay in the deal, a source said. Bolton told reporters on Tuesday that Trump did not withdraw from the agreement until now “because he gave repeated opportunities to try to fix the deal.” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that Iran would remain in the deal without Washington. Nevertheless, Trump’s decision to exit the deal could tip the balance of power in favor of hardliners looking to constrain Rouhani’s ability to open up to the West. Iran denies it has tried to build atomic weapons and says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. U.N. inspectors say Iran has not broken the nuclear deal and senior U.S. officials themselves have said several times that Iran is in technical compliance with the pact. Iranian state television said Trump’s decision to withdraw was “illegal, illegitimate and undermines international agreements.” Renewing sanctions would make it much harder for Iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system. Iran is the third-largest member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and pumps about 3.8 million barrels per day of crude, or just under 4 percent of global supply. China, India, Japan and South Korea buy most of its 2.5 million bpd of exports. According to the U.S. Treasury, sanctions related to Iran’s energy, auto and financial sectors will be reimposed in three and six months. Oil prices recouped some losses after Trump’s announcement, in a volatile session in which prices slumped as much as 4 percent earlier in the day. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled 1.7 percent lower at $74.85 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 ended the session 2.4 percent lower at $69.06 per barrel. Wall Street remained in negative territory, while energy stocks cut earlier losses after Trump spoke. Licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell passenger jets to Iran will be revoked, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said, scuttling a $38 billion deal. Trump said the nuclear agreement did not prevent Iran from cheating and continuing to pursue nuclear weapons. “It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” he said. “The Iran deal is defective at its core.” Less than one in three Americans agrees with Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the deal, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll released on Tuesday. The poll, conducted May 4-8, ahead of the Republican president’s announcement to end the deal, found that 29 percent of adults wanted to end it, while 42 percent said the United States should remain in and the remaining 28 percent said they “don’t know.” Trump said he was willing to negotiate a new deal with Iran, but Tehran already has ruled that out and threatened unspecified retaliation if Washington pulled out. Obama described Trump’s decision to withdraw from the deal, known formally as the JCPOA, as “misguided.” “I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake,” Obama said in a statement. Iran’s growing military and political power in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq worries the United States, Israel and U.S. Arab allies such as Saudi Arabia. Israel has traded blows with Iranian forces in Syria since February, stirring concern that major escalation could be looming. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a televised address lauding Trump’s Iran policy and alluding to the tensions over Syria. Saudi Arabia, Iran’s arch-foe in the Middle East, and Washington’s other Gulf Arab allies also welcomed Trump’s decision. Trump devoted part of his speech to the “long-suffering people of Iran,” criticizing Iran’s rulers and saying “the future of Iran belongs to its people.” Reporting by Steve Holland; Additional reporting by Tim

Marathon was also restarting normal production at the neighboring 459,000 bpd Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, the sources said. A 60,000 bpd resid hydrotreater was restarting at the big refinery. A late afternoon fire on a Centerpoint Energy substation near Bacliff, Texas, 8 miles (12 km) north of the refineries, also disrupted production at Valero Energy Corp’s 225,000 bpd refinery in Texas City, the sources said. Marathon spokesman Chuck Rice said in a statement that the company was evaluating operations at the Galveston Bay Refinery after a power dip in the Texas City area. “Even though we have a cogeneration facility for the Galveston Bay Refinery, a larger power dip can affect our operations,” Rice said. “There were no evacuations or injuries.” Cogeneration plants produce electrical power and steam for refineries. The City of Texas City Emergency Management Office said refineries on the south side of Texas City were using safety flares as they worked to restore power on Tuesday. A Valero spokeswoman did not reply to messages asking about operations at the Texas City refinery on Tuesday night. The Valero refinery’s gasoline-producing unit was shut on April 19 following an explosion and fire on the alkylation unit at the refinery, the first of four fires at refineries and chemical plants across the United States in the past 2-1/2 weeks. The Tuesday fire broke out on the Bacliff substation at about 4:30 p.m. CDT (2130 GMT) with flaring seen at the Marathon and Valero refineries about 20 minutes later, according energy industry intelligence service Genscape. At about 6 p.m., Centerpoint said the fire, which was fueled by mineral oil inside the substation, was under control. All personnel at the substation were accounted for and no injuries were reported, according to Centerpoint.

2018-05-09,"(Repeats story first published late Tuesday; no change to text) * Budget surplus seen for 2019/20, a ‘turning point’ for debt * Govt announces some personal income tax cuts * S&P retains its AAA rating and negative outlook By Swati Pandey and Jane Wardell CANBERRA, May 8 (Reuters) - Australia’s centre-right government said in its annual budget on Tuesday that it would return the country’s finances to a small surplus in 2019/20, a year earlier than planned and after almost a decade of deficits. The improved budgetary position was welcomed by the two biggest ratings agencies - Standard & Poor’s Global and Moody’s Investors Service. The improved budgetary position was welcomed by rating agencies Standard & Poor’s Global and Moody’s Investors Service. The ruling Liberal-National coalition also unveiled some big spending measures, including a package of personal income tax cuts for low and middle-income earners, as a revenue windfall from company taxes enabled a shift away from its previous “debt and deficit disaster” rhetoric. “We are no longer borrowing to pay for everyday expenses,” Treasurer Scott Morrison told reporters. “We have reached a turning point for debt.” Morrison predicted a budget surplus of A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) in 2019/20, a remarkable turnaround on the A$2.6 billion deficit forecast in the government’s mid-year review in December. The projected surpluses increase to A$11 billion in 2020/21 and A$16.6 billion in 2021/22. Net debt is seen peaking at 18.6 percent of Australia’s A$1.8 trillion ($1.4 trillion) gross domestic product (GDP) in the current 2017/18, also a year earlier than forecast, before falling to 3.8 percent by 2028/29. In a statement after the budget release, S&P said strength in the Australian and global economies, and “fiscal prudence” by the government, had helped ease negative pressure on the country’s credit rating. It said that global trade tensions may dampen economic growth among Australia’s key trading partners. “The outlook on the long-term Australian sovereign ratings remains negative for now to reflect these uncertainties,” S&P said. S&P put Australia on a “negative outlook” in mid-2016, citing deteriorating government finances. Moody’s said Australia’s AAA rating continues to reflect its strong institutions and solid growth potential. On Tuesday, the Australian dollar hit an 11-month low as a rally in its U.S. counterpart overshadowed the upbeat budget. The marked improvement in Australia’s finances will likely be positive for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after a series of political setbacks. The budget is widely viewed as the unofficial campaign kick-off for federal elections due in the first half of 2019. Morrison maintained the government continued to “live within its means” despite the budget spending splash. The government estimated total 2018/19 revenues would rise to A$486.1 billion, or 25.5 percent of GDP, largely from corporate taxes and as a crackdown on black economic activity and multinational tax avoidance bears fruit. Despite the additional expenditure, spending levels were at just below the 30-year average of 24.8 percent. Australia’s economy, which has outperformed many rich world peers since the global financial crisis, has now entered a 27th straight year of growth, but the pace has slowed significantly as the country recalibrates following the end of a once-in-a-generation mining investment boom. The government predicted domestic activity would accelerate at 3 percent annually through 2021/22, unchanged from December. Its outlook for unemployment and inflation were also unchanged. The budget included a number of voter-friendly spending plans, as Turnbull seeks to improve his standing after a dual citizenship crisis and a sex scandal involving his deputy, that have seen his popularity plummet in polls from record highs of late 2015. Revelations of serious misconduct in Australia’s powerful banking sector - during an ongoing inquiry the government initially resisted as unnecessary - have ramped up the pressure. The budget did not address that crisis in detail, saying only the government would continue to roll out stronger penalties, powers and enforcement for the sector. It also steered clear of discussing a plan to lower taxes for big businesses, which did not have parliamentary support. A A$13.4 billion four-year income tax package included immediate cuts for low- and mid-income households, and a proposal to flatten the overall tax structure by abolishing the highest income bracket, 37 percent, in 2024/25. The extra money will be welcomed by Australia’s heavily indebted households. Monthly retail sales data released on Tuesday showed spending falling on everything from clothes to restaurants. Paul Dales, Capital Economics’ chief economist for Australia, said the tax cuts probably wouldn’t prompt the central bank to hike interest rates before late 2019. “Overall, the treasurer appears to be using a rosy outlook for the economy to justify income tax cuts and an earlier surplus,” Dales said. “We believe that low wage growth and a weakening housing market will mean the economy doesn’t live up to those high hopes.” The government will continue its A$75 billion 10-year infrastructure plan to build rail and road projects and a A$30 billion five-year investment plan for hospitals. It will also spend A$2.5 billion in public technology infrastructure, A$1.6 billion in residential aged care and A$294 million to improve national security.

2018-05-09,"PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.N is in talks with planemakers Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N) over the purchase of wide-body, long-haul passenger jets to replace a fleet of 50 Boeing 767 aircraft, people familiar with the discussions said on Tuesday. Europe’s Airbus is expected to offer its upgraded A330neo jet against Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in a deal potentially worth some $14 billion at list prices, the two sources said. All three companies declined to comment on the nature of the talks. A win in the jet production contest would be especially important for Airbus, whose struggling A330neo program has lost a number of recent bids to U.S. rival Boeing for wide-body, long-haul aircraft. Hawaiian Airlines in March chose Boeing to supply 10 new 787-9 aircraft, dropping an earlier order of the A330neo. The European planemaker was again bested last month when American Airlines, the world’s largest carrier, chose Boeing to supply 47 new 787 Dreamliner jets. The fate of an order for 28 A330neos from IranAir is also in jeopardy, on concerns over a Tuesday decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from an international nuclear deal. Airbus Americas Chairman Jeff Knittel said Airbus remained confident in the A330neo despite recent setbacks. “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” he told Reuters. “We are talking to a number of people as potential customers. We think the airplane makes sense and we are optimistic.” He declined to say whether United was among the airlines with which Airbus is involved in discussions. The Chicago-based carrier’s fleet already includes Boeing 787s, and the carrier has firm commitments for an additional 14 jets scheduled for delivery through 2027.  It does not fly the A330 family, the latest version of which - the A330neo - is due to enter service this summer.

2018-05-09,"* U.S. plans “highest level” of sanctions against Iran - Trump * Most U.S. allies oppose decision to abandon the deal * Move to cut Iran supplies amid tight market - analysts By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices pushed higher in early trading on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from an international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that may curb the OPEC-member’s crude exports in an already tight market. Trump on Tuesday pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran that was agreed in late 2015, raising the risk of conflict in the Middle East and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies. Brent crude oil futures were at $76.21 per barrel at 0005 GMT, up $1.36, or 1.8 percent from their last close and not far off Monday’s $76.34, the highest since late 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up $1.18 per barrel, or 1.7 percent, at $70.24 a barrel, also close to highs last seen in late 2014. “The big event of the night was President Trump’s cancelling of the nuclear deal made with Iran back in 2015. Sanctions will therefore (likely) be reimposed on Iran, which will ultimately affect Iran’s oil exports,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in 2016 after international sanctions against it were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme, with its April exports standing at 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd). This makes Iran the third biggest exporter of crude within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Walking away from the deal means that the United States will likely re-impose sanctions against Iran after 180 days, unless some other agreement is reached before then. ANZ bank said Trump’s decision “puts into place a scenario that could see the crude oil market tighten significantly in H2 2018 and into next year.” Iran’s exports of oil to Asia and Europe will almost certainly decline later this year and into 2019 as some nations seek alternatives in order to avoid trouble with Washington and as sanctions start to bite. Despite this, it is not yet clear, how strongly global oil markets will be affected. The United States buys no Iranian oil, while the other signatories of the agreement, Russia, Britain, France and Germany, are opposed to ending the agreement, and may continue to buy Iranian crude. Asia, by far the biggest importer of oil from Iran, will likely continue to take in some supplies as well, as it did during the previous round of sanctions. “There are worries that Iran’s oil exports could fall by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from current levels,” said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. “The oil supply/demand balance is roughly in balance now, but it could turn to a complete supply shortage (in case of new supply curbs). Oil prices could rise at least $10 (a barrel), with Brent approaching near $90,” he said.

2018-05-09,"(Reuters) - State-run PDVSA ordered an oil tanker that was waiting to discharge in Curacao to divert to Venezuelan waters after ConocoPhillips introduced an order in a Caribbean court to seize its inventories and other assets in the island, according to a shipper and Reuters data on Tuesday. The U.S. oil company has moved aggressively in recent days to attach PDVSA’s assets in the Caribbean, one of its main export hubs, to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award related to the nationalization of Conoco’s projects in Venezuela in 2007. The Aframax tanker British Cygnet loaded crude at Russia’s Primorsk terminal last month. It arrived in Curacao’s Bullenbay terminal on Sunday, two days after at least two Caribbean courts ordered the retention of PDVSA’s inventories and facilities in Bonaire, Curacao, Aruba and St. Eustatius by request of the U.S. oil company. PDVSA has been buying U.S. and Russian crudes this year for refining at its 335,000 barrel-per-day Isla refinery in Curacao and for blending with extra-heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela’s main producing region. The British Cygnet tanker, which set sail for Venezuela’s western coast on Monday night, follows at least nine vessels diverted since Friday from Curacao and Bonaire to Venezuela and Cuba to avoid possible seizures of tankers or their barrels, according to a PDVSA source and Reuters data. Cargoes arriving from the Caribbean have started creating bottlenecks of vessels around PDVSA’s main ports, especially Jose, Venezuela’s largest terminal for crude exports, and the docks that serve PDVSA’s biggest refinery, the Paraguana Refining Center, according to the data. The Caribbean terminals affected by the court orders last year were responsible for shipping about 400,000 bpd of crude and refined products, or 24 percent of PDVSA’s total exports, according to the company’s internal data.  PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum also uses the Aruba terminal to discharge, store and blend Venezuelan and foreign crudes for its refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

2018-05-09,"BUENOS AIRES, May 8 (Reuters) - Argentina’s Energy Ministry said on Tuesday it had reached a price stability agreement with YPF, Pan American Energy and Shell to freeze gas prices for the rest of May and June. The measure will help control consumer prices “in favor of general economic interest,” the ministry said in a statement. It said the companies would be compensated for any costs related to price variations over the six months starting July 1. The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks for Argentine financial markets that led the central bank to hike the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent on Friday and the government to say it was seeking financing from the international monetary fund on Monday. Argentina is battling one of the world’s highest inflation rates and is not expected to make the central bank’s target of 15 percent this year.
