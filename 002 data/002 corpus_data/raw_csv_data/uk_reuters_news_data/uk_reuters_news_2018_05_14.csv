2018-05-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday as OPEC reported that the global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, while U.S. crude’s discount to global benchmark Brent widened to more than $7, its deepest in five months.  Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 gained $1.11 to settle at $78.23 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 26 cents to settle at $70.96. WTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 was as much as $7.28, its widest since Dec. 12 on surging U.S. output.  U.S. shale production is expected to hit a record 7.18 million barrels per day (bpd), the Energy Information Administration said.    The production growth may be far from over, contributing to U.S. crude’s discount to Brent, analysts said.  “You have the threat that a high enough price will start to activate the 7,700 drilled but uncompleted wells in the Lower 48 states,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP TA.  Contrastingly, OPEC’s latest report was more bullish.  “That absolute plunge in Venezuelan production ... just highlights how tenuous the market is in terms of the supply-and-demand balance,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. Even so, OPEC and its allies were still trimming output more than their supply-cutting pact required. Meanwhile, output from third-largest OPEC producer Iran is uncertain on renewed U.S. sanctions.  “If Iranian crude is really taken off the water, it’s going to impact Brent much more than it’s going to impact WTI,” Zimmerman said.  It is unclear how U.S. sanctions will affect Iranian oil. Much will depend on how other major oil consumers respond to Washington’s action against Tehran, which will take effect in November. “Germany has said it will protect its companies from U.S. sanctions, Iran has said French oil giant Total (TOTF.PA) has yet to pull out of its fields and all the while it seems the Chinese are ready to fill the void created by the U.S,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader. Michael Wittner, analyst at Societe Generale, forecasts U.S. sanctions will remove 400,000 to 500,000 bpd of Iranian crude from the global market. Inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, fell about 410,000 barrels between May 8 and May 11, said traders, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.  “The expectation that there’s going to be a drawdown in crude stocks this week is keeping the market very tight,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group.

2018-05-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of stocks around the world reached its highest point in about two months on Monday amid hopes for improving trade relations between the United States and China, while oil prices climbed further. Wall Street’s main stock indexes registered slim gains, pulling back from stronger increases during the session. U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help ZTE Corp “get back into business, fast” after a U.S. ban crippled the Chinese technology company, offering a job-saving concession to Beijing ahead of high-stakes trade talks this week. MSCI’s index of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.12 percent, hitting a roughly two-month high during the session. Growing trade tensions have worried investors, with concerns about a global trade war feeding into increased volatility in the stock market in recent months. “It seems like there’s a little less concern about a trade war with China given some of the overtures that President Trump made,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “They’re hoping for a dying down of the trade war rhetoric and, quite frankly, they’re probably looking for some successful deals (to be) made.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 68.24 points, or 0.27 percent, to 24,899.41, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 2.41 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,730.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 8.43 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,411.32.

2018-05-14,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan named seven new ministers on Monday as part of a cabinet reshuffle that included changes at the ministries of oil and the appointment of a new foreign minister, state news agency SUNA reported. The new appointments are the latest of several within a few months that have seen changes to the heads of the military and intelligence and the sacking of Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour.  They come as Sudan faces a bruising economic downturn and sharp currency crisis despite winning relief from decades-old U.S. sanctions last year.  President Omar al-Bashir, who has ruled Sudan since a 1989 Islamist and military-backed coup, has said he will not stand in elections expected in 2020 and appointed a prime minister last year for the first time.  Al-Dirdiri Mohamed Ahmed, a moderate Islamist lawyer and member of Bashir’s ruling party, will head the foreign ministry, SUNA reported, replacing Ghandour, who was sacked last month following public comments related to foreign currency shortages. Ahmed served previously as a negotiator on the demarcation of Abyei, a contested border region claimed by Sudan and South Sudan. Azhari Abdalla, who has served as the head of the government’s Oil Exploration and Production Authority, was appointed oil minister.  Abdalla replaces current oil minister Abdulrahman Othman amid a sharp fuel shortage that has seen long queues at gas stations. “Changing people will not solve the economic crisis, which requires a change to policies. And the policies are set by the state’s high leadership, not ministers,” said Tayeb Zein Al-Abidine, a professor of political science at the University of Khartoum. “Economic reform requires cutting government spending and fighting corruption,” he said. Once an oil exporter, Sudan was forced to begin importing after the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country’s crude output and its main source of foreign currency.

2018-05-14,"(Adds milestones, background) NEW YORK, May 14 (Reuters) - U.S. shale production is expected to rise by about 145,000 barrels per day to a record 7.18 million bpd in June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. A majority of the increase is expected to come from the Permian basin, the biggest U.S. oil patch, where output is expected to climb 78,000 bpd to a fresh record of 3.28 million bpd, the EIA said in its monthly drilling productivity report here. Soaring Permian crude production has already outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity, depressing prices in the region and leaving traders scrambling for alternatives to get crude to market. Bakken output is expected to rise 20,000 bpd to 1.24 million bpd, the highest since June 2015, while Eagle Ford production is set to rise 33,000 bpd to 1.39 million bpd, the highest since February 2016. Production in the United States has surged thanks to the shale boom, helping send U.S. crude futures’ discount to international benchmark Brent crude futures WTCLc1-LCOc1 to the widest in six months. Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas production was projected to increase to a record 68.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in June. That would be up almost 1.1 bcfd over the May forecast and would be the fifth monthly increase in a row. A year ago in June output was just 56.4 bcfd. The EIA projected gas output would increase in all of the big shale basins in June. Output in the Appalachia region, the biggest shale gas play, was set to rise almost 0.4 bcfd to a record high of 28.1 bcfd in June. Production in Appalachia was 23.5 bcfd in the same month a year ago. EIA said producers drilled 1,297 wells and completed 1,242 in the biggest shale basins in April, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up 55 at a record high 7,677, according to data going back to December 2013.

2018-05-14,"LISBON/PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Portuguese utility EDP (EDP.LS) jumped as much as 12 percent on Monday to trade above the price of a bid by China Three Gorges, indicating investors think the $10.8 billion offer is an opening gambit that could lead to a higher or rival bid.  The gains also show investors think there is little that could stop a bid, as the European Union has limited power to block one and the Portuguese government says it has no objections, despite a call from its Communist allies to renationalize EDP.   EDP shares rose as high as 3.49 euros, above China Three Gorges’ (CTG) 3.26 euros per share bid, which represented a premium of less than 5 percent on EDP’s Friday closing price. The stock closed 9.32 percent higher at 3.40 euros. The deal, proposed late on Friday, values EDP at 9.07 billion euros ($10.8 billion), excluding the 23 percent stake the Chinese state-controlled utility already owns. CTG [CYTGP.UL] could not be reached for comment, but a source familiar with the situation said the bid was a pre-emptive move to deter other utilities from making a bid. The source also said EDP considered the offer too low and was likely to hold a board meeting this week to review it.  A banking source familiar with the matter ruled out any EU utilities launching a counter-bid or coming forward as a “white knight” with an alternative proposal, but expected EDP would negotiate with CTG and push for a better price and a premium.  “CTG has a lot of room for maneuver and if there is a price war, they will do it,” said a second banker close to the matter, but not directly involved with it.  He added CTG was to keep EDP as a Portuguese company listed in Lisbon. Bloomberg reported EDP was poised to reject the bid on the grounds that it undervalued the firm.   Analysts say CTG’s price is low compared with other recent Chinese bids for European energy assets.  “The offer price is too low to be successful,” state-owned Portuguese investment bank CaixaBI said in a note.  European utilities lobby Eurelectric’s chief Kristian Ruby said he was not surprised by CTG’s move and expected to see more such bids as China pursues EU electricity infrastructure assets. Jean-Marc Ollagnier, global head of resources at Accenture, saw the bid as part of China’s “One Belt One Road” strategy under which it wants to reverse the direction of the investment flows along the old Silk Road trading route.  “China knows it will face local resistance about strategic assets, but clearly this is a long-term strategy and we will see progress in the coming years,” he said.  CTG and another Chinese state company, CNIC, together hold 28.25 percent of EDP shares. With full control of EDP and its renewables unit EDPR (EDPR.LS), CTG would become a top European renewables player, with a large presence in the United States  and Brazil.  But other shareholders may balk at being low-balled.  Funds holding major EDP stakes include Capital Research with 12 percent, Masaveu Herrero with 7.19 percent, BlackRock with 5 percent, Mudabala Investment with 4.06 percent and Capital World with 2.69 percent, ThomsonReuters data showed. Qatar and Norway’s sovereign wealth funds also each hold over two percent.  JP Morgan said CTG’s offer was too low to achieve full control of a business providing a strategic footprint in U.S. renewables. It expects management and minorities to demand a higher price. EDP and other shareholders so far have not commented.  Paulo Rosa, a trader at Go Bulling brokerage in Porto, said EDP’s share price jump indicated competing bids could emerge. Last year, Reuters reported that Spain’s Gas Natural GAS.MC had approached EDP about a possible merger, which was subsequently ruled out by the two companies. France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) also reportedly considered a bid, although EDP denied there had been talks. A bid from a utility could face more government resistance, as private firms may want to cut jobs to boost profitability.  While a takeover of EDP may need clearance from competition authorities in some of the countries in which EDP and EDPR operate, the EU can do little to stop it. The European Commission has drafted rules to block foreign takeovers of strategic firms, but there is no unanimity on the proposal, which is currently being discussed by the European Parliament and Member States.  With a separate Chinese state-owned firm, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), owning 25 percent of Portugal’s state power network REN, China is also circumventing EU unbundling legislation, which bans utilities from owning grids. More than a decade ago, EU utilities were forced to split off their power grid units in order to make them more accessible to all power generators.  In recent years, SGCC has built up a web of minority stakes in Southern European grid operators - including REN, Italy’s Snam (SRG.MI) and Greece’s Admie - and sources told Reuters this month that State Grid was in talks to buy a 20 percent stake in German grid operator 50Hertz. The EU has so far not had to consider how to rule on power production and distribution being reunited under a foreign shareholder. The European Commission’s competition and trade spokespeople declined to comment.  “For Brussels to intervene, there would need to be dumping or an abuse of monopoly,” said Nicolas Goldberg of Colombus Consulting.  French power industry consultant Thibault Laconde said CTG’s move was bound to sharpen tensions over international trade.  “It raises the question of reciprocity. A move in the opposite direction would not be possible,” he said.

2018-05-14,"May 14 (Reuters) - Global oil supplies are plentiful enough to withstand a “significant reduction” in petroleum exports from Iran, according to a White House memo issued on Monday as the Trump administration prepares to reimpose sanctions on the OPEC member nation. The memo, sent by the White House to the U.S. State Department, paves the way for U.S. efforts to curb Iranian oil exports after Washington’s decision to pull out of the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers curbing Tehran’s nuclear program. It said there is a “sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.” Prices for oil traded in London jumped to multi-year highs above $78 a barrel on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week that Washington would reimpose the sanctions on Iran. The sanctions are aimed at forcing companies and countries around the world to reduce oil imports from the Islamic Republic. The Trump administration has not specified how much oil it expected importers to cut, but in 2012 the administration of former President Barack Obama pushed countries to reduce imports about 18 percent to 20 percent. Sanctions on Iran’s oil exports are due to take effect after Nov. 4, allowing companies to wind down their purchases. Under the sanctions law passed in 2011, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the independent statistics arm of the Department of Energy, must issue reports to Congress on global oil production in countries other than Iran every two months. The most recent EIA study, included in the agency's short-term energy outlook, showed that global production of oil outside Iran averaged 92.4 million barrels per day from February to March, compared to 91.0 million bpd from 2015 to 2017. Consumption of oil outside Iran was higher, however, averaging 96.4 million bpd compared to 93 million bpd from 2015 to 2017.

2018-05-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - An electrified road in Sweden that is the first in the world to charge vehicles as they drive along is showing promise and could potentially help cut the high cost of electric cars, project backers Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and Elways told Reuters. The state-funded project, named eRoadArlanda and costing about 50 million crowns ($5.82 million), uses a modified electric truck that moves cargo from Stockholm’s Arlanda airport to Postnord’s nearby logistics hub to test the technology.  A electrified rail embedded in the tarmac of the 2-km-long (1.24 miles) road charges the truck automatically as it travels above it. A movable arm attached to the truck detects the rail’s location in the road, and charging stops when the vehicle is overtaking or coming to a halt. The system also calculates the vehicle’s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user. Elways’ chief executive Gunnar Asplund said the charging while driving would mean electric cars no longer need big batteries — which can be half the cost of an electric car — to ensure they have enough power to travel a useful distance. “The technology offers infinite range — range anxiety disappears” he said. “Electrified roads will allow smaller batteries and can make electric cars even cheaper than fossil fuel ones.”     Asplund said the Swedish state, which is funding the project, was happy with the results so far, with the only issue — now resolved — having been dirt accumulating on the rail. Elways has patented the electric rail technology and is part of a Swedish consortium backing the eRoadArlanda project that also includes infrastructure company NCC and utility Vattenfall, which provides power from the national grid to the rail. “Such roads will allow (electric vehicles) to move long distances without big, costly and heavy batteries,” said Markus Fischer, a Vattenfall spokesman, adding that installing the arm in new cars would be cheaper than retrofitting current models.   Vattenfall said in a statement electrified roads could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from lorries, which account for about 25 percent of total road traffic emissions. “The investment cost per kilometer is estimated to be less than that of using overhead lines, as is the impact on the landscape,” it added. Testing at eRoadArlanda started in April and will last at least 12 months so that the electric truck can use it under different weather conditions.

2018-05-14,"LISBON (Reuters) - State-owned power firm China Three Gorges launched its 9 billion euros (7.9 billion pounds) takeover offer for Portuguese utility EDP (EDP.LS) as a pre-emptive move, sensing that other prospective bidders were looking at the company, sources said on Monday. CTG owns 23 percent of EDP and is bidding for the remainder at 3.26 euros per share, a premium of less than 5 percent over EDP’s price before the offer. The stock leapt 9 percent on Monday, implying the price would go higher. A source familiar with the matter said EDP viewed the bid as “low” but its board was likely to meet this week to consider it. No decision had yet been made to reject it, the source added. A banking source close to the matter ruled out any EU utilities launching a counter bid, but that EDP would negotiate with the Chinese and push for a better price and a premium. The source said the offer was not a hostile one. “CTG is not just a shareholder, it is also a partner of EDP,” said a third source familiar with the offer, noting that the Chinese firm had several large joint ventures with EDP. The source said the Chinese firm had sensed some potential interest in EDP from European suitors and wanted to make clear its commitment to Portugal’s biggest company. The source declined to give any names of potential rivals.  In addition to its 23 percent stake in EDP, acquired for 2.7 billion euros in 2011, CTG has invested about 2 billion euros alongside EDP in joint power projects around the world. “Anyone thinking of controlling EDP, whoever it may be, has to deal with this question.

2018-05-14,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union executive will propose at least a 30 percent reduction target for CO2 emissions from trucks by 2030, an EU source said on Monday, as the bloc seeks to slash greenhouse gas emissions. The target will be the first ever CO2 standard for trucks in the EU, which has no limits on what accounts for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions.  Countries such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada have already set targets to reduce CO2 emissions from trucks. Environmental campaigners alongside France and some other EU governments have pushed for an ambitious CO2 reduction target of at least 24 percent for 2025 and 34-45 percent for 2030. The Commission will also propose an intermediary target of 15 percent and would introduce an incentive system of credits to reward manufacturers who invest more in low-carbon technologies, the source said. Credits would be allowed to relax manufacturer’s annual CO2 targets for heavy duty vehicles by no more than 3 percent, while for buses, coaches and small lorries by 1.5 percent. Europe’s Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete has had a flurry of meetings with the auto industry and environment campaigners in the past four months that have led up to Thursday’s unveiling of the European Commission’s draft legislation. Other EU Commissioners will vote on Wednesday to approve the proposal, which then needs to win the backing of national governments and the European Parliament.  A 30 percent target would cut about 54 million tonnes of CO2 from the bloc’s emissions from 2020 to 2030, or roughly the size of Sweden’s yearly output, according to the Commission’s estimates. It argues that the benefits outweigh the technological cost of meeting the new CO2 standards, leading to lower fuel consumption, reduced transport company bills, job creation and a more competitive auto industry. Europe’s powerful car industry lobbied this month for a 16 percent tail-pipe CO2 reduction between 2019 and 2030, with an intermediate target of 7 percent in 2025, the ACEA industry group said in a statement.  Thursday’s proposal to curb transport pollution is part of the bloc’s overall pledge to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. It follows new draft rules on CO2 standards for cars.

2018-05-14,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators will settle their antitrust case with Gazprom (GAZP.MM) by next week, people close to the matter said on Monday, after the Russian energy giant pledged to change its pricing structure and allow rivals a foothold in eastern Europe. The European Commission is due to announce the deal on May 24, one source said, ending one of its longest running competition cases that began with dawn raids at 20 offices in 10 countries in 2011 when investigators seized over 150,000 documents. Two other sources said the EU decision on Gazprom, the EU’s biggest gas supplier, could come this week or next. The EU antitrust authority declined to comment. Reuters was the first to report on April 3 that Gazprom, which supplies a third of the EU’s gas, and the EU competition enforcer would reach a deal, staving off a fine of as much as 10 percent of the company’s global turnover. EU-Russia relations have been frosty since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, sinking further over a nerve toxin attack against a former Russian spy in England in March that the British government blamed on Moscow.  Gazprom, which contributes some 9 percent of Russian gross domestic product, wants smoother ties to help it beat last year’s record sales to Europe. In 2015, the bloc charged Gazprom, run by Alexei Miller, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with abusing its dominance in eight central and eastern European member states by charging excessive gas prices in some countries and blocking rivals in others. Gazprom denies the charges. Gazprom’s concessions consist of linking prices to benchmarks such as western European gas market hubs and border prices in France, Germany and Italy, and allowing price reviews every two years, according to a recent draft seen by Reuters. It will also drop all contractual constraints which bar clients from reselling its gas and let the Bulgarian transmission network operator take charge of the Balkan country’s gas flows to Greece. The concessions are expected to be valid for eight years. The EU will not impose any financial penalty on Gazprom, but if the company fails to abide by the terms of the settlement, the EU can still impose fines. Despite the move to smooth business ties, mutual distrust between the EU and the Kremlin-backed company remains high and many in the bloc still want to see Gazprom punished with fines. Critics say European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s decision to settle with Gazprom with no admission of wrongdoing by the company contrasts with her hefty fines against U.S. tech giants Google (GOOGL.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) for anti-competitive practices. Gazprom foes such as Polish state-run oil and gas company PGNiG (PGN.WA) has urged Europe’s antitrust chief to take a tough line and penalise the company but to no avail. EU regulators say a deal could help the bloc resolve disputes on gas supplies to and through Ukraine. It could also help liberalise the gas market in southeastern Europe, for example by allowing reverse flows and giving rivals access to pipelines.

Sinosteel president Andong Liu said the Chinese firm planned to build three additional furnaces at its majority-owned Zimasco business, which would raise ferrochrome output by 120,000 tonnes over the next five years to 300,000 tonnes per year. Andong said he saw ferrochrome output from Zimasco at 500,000 tonnes annually in ten years’ time. Sinosteel also plans to build a 400 megawatt coalbed methane-fired power plant in western Zimbabwe, the firm’s president added at a news conference with Mnangagwa. “We will continue to review our process to facilitate investment inflows as well as ease of doing business,” Mnangagwa said after the signing of the investment agreement.

2018-05-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - A global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, figures published by OPEC showed on Monday, thanks to an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies that has been in place since January 2017 and due to rising global demand. Despite this, OPEC’s latest report said producers were cutting more than required under the deal, while producers not party to the agreement, such as U.S. shale companies, were starting to face constraints on future output. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter and de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, told OPEC it cut output in April to its lowest level since the supply deal began in January 2017. The OPEC report said oil inventories in OECD industrialised nations in March fell to 9 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017. “The oil market was underpinned in April by renewed geopolitical issues, tightening product inventories and robust global demand,” OPEC said in its report. The deal between OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers has helped oil prices LCOc1 rise 40 percent since it took effect. Oil reached $78.28 a barrel on Monday, the highest since November 2014, after the OPEC report was published. The main goal of the supply deal was to reduce excess oil stocks to the five-year average. But oil ministers have since said other metrics should be considered such as oil industry investment, suggesting they are in no hurry to end supply cuts. Indeed, the report showed OPEC for now is cutting more supply than the group has pledged under the pact. OPEC output rose by just 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 31.93 million bpd in April, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources. That is roughly 800,000 bpd less than the amount OPEC says the world needs from the group this year. Figures reported directly from OPEC members showed even deeper declines in production. Venezuela, whose output has plunged due to an economic crisis, told OPEC its production fell to 1.505 million bpd in April, believed to be the lowest in decades.  Top exporter Saudi Arabia told OPEC it cut output by 39,000 bpd to 9.868 million bpd, which is the lowest since the supply cut deal began, based on figures Riyadh reports to the group. Strong growth in demand due to a robust world economy has helped remove the glut. OPEC slightly raised its estimate of growth in world demand this year to 1.65 million bpd. The higher crude prices that have followed have prompted growth in rival supply and a flood of U.S. shale output. OPEC expects non-OPEC supply to expand by 1.72 million bpd this year, which is higher than the growth in global demand. But OPEC forecast headwinds to future growth, such as the slow place of oil industry investment and an expected dip next year in investment in U.S. shale, also known as tight oil. “Fast-growing U.S. tight oil production is increasingly faced with costly logistical constraints in terms of outtake capacity from land-locked production sites,” OPEC said. Adding to the impact of OPEC-led cuts, the U.S. decision to withdraw from an international nuclear deal with OPEC member Iran and to renew sanctions has raised concerns about Iranian oil exports, helping drive prices higher. OPEC signalled the group and its allies were ready to step in should “geopolitical developments” impact supply. Saudi Arabia said last week it was ready to offset any shortage but would not act alone.   “OPEC, as always, stands ready to support oil market stability, together with non-OPEC oil producing nations participating in the Declaration of Cooperation,” OPEC said, using its name for the pact on supply curbs.

2018-05-14,"PAHOA, Hawaii, May 14 (Reuters) - Residents near Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano faced warnings on Monday that more lava-spewing fissures could open near their homes and that the volcano’s summit may be getting ready for an explosion that could scatter ash and debris for miles. Since Kilauea began erupting on May 3, nearly 2,000 people have been ordered to evacuate as 18 giant fissures ripped through the area, including two new ones that opened on Sunday with ear-piercing screeches that sent lava and rocks flying. But the U.S. Geological Survey also has warned that pent-up steam could cause an explosion at the top of the volcano as the pool of lava recedes, launching a 20,000-foot (6,100-meter) plume that could spread debris over 12 miles (19 kilometers). “More explosive activity generating larger ash clouds remains possible and can occur with no warning,” the USGS said in an alert late Sunday local time. One of the new fissures to open on Sunday, a groove of lava with smoke pouring out both ends, appeared to be about 1,000 feet (300 meters) long and among the largest of those fracturing the side of Kilauea, a 4,000-foot-high (1,200-meters) volcano with a lake of lava at its summit. Oozing flows of molten rock have destroyed some 37 buildings in the past 10 days, while emissions of sulfur dioxide gas in some areas has turned vegetation brown. No deaths or major injuries have been reported since Kilauea, which has been in a state of nearly constant eruption since 1983, began a series of major explosions early this month. The volcano is located in the far east of Hawaii’s 4,028-square-mile (10,430-square-km) Big Island, which is home to about 200,000 people. The USGS warned that fissures could erupt throughout the area, and Civil Defense officials on Sunday ordered people living on Halekamahina Road to evacuate and be on the alert for gas emissions and lava spatter. In the evacuated Leilani Estates neighborhood of about 1,500 people, explosions could be heard on Sunday as steam rose from cracks in the roads. Other fissures continued to billow smoke over homes. The Hawaii National Guard has warned people in the coastal Lower Puna area to prepare to leave, saying anyone who chooses to stay behind cannot count on being rescued. An evacuation has not been ordered there but might be if a local highway is cut off. Reporting by Terray Sylvester in Pahoa and Jolyn Rosa in

2018-05-14,"(Reuters) - Aurora Cannabis Inc will buy rival MedReleaf Corp for C$3.2 billion ($2.51 billion) in the biggest deal yet to unify major Canadian pot growers, as the country moves toward legalizing marijuana for recreational use. The deal announced Monday is the latest in a wave of mergers in the industry as marijuana producers — emboldened by pot legalizations in Europe and a number of U.S. states — seek to cut costs and gain scale. Canada’s relaxed regulations, a mature industry and free-flowing capital have offered firms a unique opportunity to advance research without the legal and political risks that bog down growers in the United States and elsewhere. Canadian regulators have granted over 70 firms licenses to produce and sell medical marijuana, with more than half granted in 2017 or 2018.     Aurora and MedReleaf together expect to produce over 570,000 kilograms per year of cannabis through nine facilities in Canada and two in Denmark. “The combination strengthens our capacity to service the rapidly expanding global medical cannabis markets, and amplifies our early-mover advantage,” Aurora Chief Executive Officer Terry Booth said in a statement. Canada is one of the few countries that exports marijuana, allowing growers to take immediate advantage of recent medical pot legalizations in more than 20 countries. The worldwide legal marijuana market is expected to generate revenue worth $146.4 billion by end of 2025, according to California-based market consultancy by Grand View Research. “(Aurora is) targeting mostly Europe for exports ... the demand is firmly in place, in terms of their medical market,” said Alan Brochstein, founder of cannabis-industry information provider 420 Investor. “(Europe has) perhaps a better program initially in terms of insurance coverage and distribution through pharmacies,” he added. The acquisition is Aurora’s second large deal this year, coming just months after it bought CanniMed Therapeutics for C$1.1 billion.     Shares of Aurora and MedReleaf each rose 1 percent on Monday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Aurora shareholders will own about 61 percent of the combined company, following the all-stock deal. Aurora offered to buy each MedReleaf share for C$29.44, representing an 18.2 percent premium to MedReleaf’s Friday closing price. Aurora would likely sign more deals, but not any as big as the MedReleaf acquisition, Booth said at a media conference in Toronto. The company would also consider listing its shares in New York, he added. “Aurora has ... been pretty aggressive with their expansion plans but now shareholders will want to see those assets being put to use before the company rushes out and buys something else,” said Bruce Campbell, chief investment officer at Cannabis Growth Opportunity Corp.

U.S. President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to help ZTE Corp “get back into business, fast” after a U.S. ban crippled the Chinese technology company, offering a job-saving concession to Beijing ahead of high-stakes trade talks this week. Growing trade tensions have worried investors, with concerns about a global trade war feeding into increased volatility in the stock market in recent months. “At least today, investors are looking at that as a sign that meaningful negotiations are going forward between the U.S. and China on trade,” Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said of the ZTE announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 141.37 points, or 0.57 percent, to 24,972.54, the S&P 500 gained 10.73 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,738.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 42.87 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,445.76. Shares of optical components makers Acacia Communications and Oclaro Inc rallied following the ZTE news. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.62 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.47 percent. Investors also pointed to improving sentiment about geopolitical tensions involving North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that Washington would agree to lift sanctions on North Korea if the country agrees to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, a move that would create economic prosperity that “will rival” that of South Korea. “It looks like the markets want to move up, and there seems to be a rosier outlook for geopolitics especially North Korea,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.05 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.38 percent, reaching its highest level in about two months. The dollar fell as investors questioned whether a rally that last week sent the greenback to more than four-month highs had run out of steam. The dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.23 percent to $1.1969. “The momentum behind the dollar move is starting to stall a little bit,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. Yields on key U.S. and European bonds rose after a European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB could give fresh guidance on the timing it its first rate hike as the end of its bond purchases approaches. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.9951 percent, from 2.971 percent late on Friday, Benchmark German 10-year bond yields climbed to a 2-1/2-week high.

2018-05-14,"(Updates with details from French group Danone) May 14 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on May 8 pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, sealed in 2015, and said he will re-impose economic sanctions on Iran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, most notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Below are reactions since Trump’s decision from companies most likely to be affected by the move to reimpose sanctions. For a related factbox on Iran’s deals with foreign firms since the easing of sanctions in 2015 click on: - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Airbus and Boeing Co will lose licences to sell passenger jets to Iran. - IranAir had ordered 200 passenger aircraft - 100 from Airbus, 80 from Boeing and 20 from Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR. All the deals are dependent on U.S. licences because of the heavy use of American parts in commercial planes. - Boeing said it would consult with the U.S. government on the next steps, adding Boeing’s 777 production plan “is not dependent on the Iranian orders.” - Airbus said it needed time to study the impact of Trump’s decision on Iran. - German carmaker Volkswagen, which began exporting cars to Iran last year, said it was closely monitoring and reviewing political and economic developments in the region. - “As a matter of principle, Volkswagen complies with all applicable national and international laws and export regulations,” a company spokesperson said. - VW, which sold its iconic Beetle in Iran in the 1950s and its Gol subcompact model in the 1990s, left the Iranian market in 2000, before resuming exports in 2017. - France’s PSA said it hoped the European Union would adopt a common position on Iran. - French automakers PSA and Renault have pushed hard into Iran after sanctions were lifted following the 2015 international nuclear pact. - PSA has signed production deals worth 700 million euros ($830 million) to reclaim the leading position it once enjoyed in the market, while Renault invested to increase its production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year. - Germany’s Daimler said it was closely monitoring any further developments and would then evaluate the potential impact on its business. - Nestle said there were no direct implications for its business at this stage, but it was closely following political developments. - Nestle Iran has its headquarters in Tehran and employs 818 people. It operates two factories, producing infant cereals and formula in one and bottled water in another. It imports a limited range of Nestle products from abroad. - Dairy and food group Danone would not discuss implications for its business in Iran, which it described as “small”. Danone has a dairy product plant in Qazvin, which produces Danette pudding.

However, the bank said on Wednesday that it had not provided any financing related to Iran, following a decision by the executive board in November, given the constantly changing political framework. - Oberbank in September signed a deal with Iran, enabling it to provide credit for Austrian companies doing business in Iran - Denmark’s Danske Bank said it decided earlier this year to phase out and exit all activities to and from Iran, due to increasing operational and reputational risks associated with doing business in Iran. - Danske Bank said it also decided to suspend existing relations with Iran that allowed it to support certain customers in doing business in Iran. - Danske Bank, in January last year, said it was in talks with the Iranian central bank on arranging credit to clients with business activities in the country. - Denmark’s Novo Nordisk, the world’s largest diabetes drugmaker, said it was still unclear what the implications would be. - Novo Nordisk, which was operating in Iran even before sanctions were lifted in 2015, has built a local manufacturing plant in the region to support market access for its diabetes products. (reut.rs/2jHe5mm) - The drugmaker is also looking to expand the obesity drug market as the prevalence of obese people in Iran is similar to the high levels in the United States. - German engineering group Siemens said it was assessing the implications of the Iran decision and would comply with all export controls that arise. - Siemens signed a contract in October 2016 to upgrade Iran’s railway network and also to supply components for 50 diesel-electric locomotives to Iran. - Switzerland’s Autoneum, which makes sound and heat shields for vehicles, said Iran accounted for “a negligible proportion” of its consolidated annual sales of 2.2 billion Swiss francs ($2.2 bln). - In December it announced a licensing deal for Iran’s Ayegh Khodro Toos to produce carpets, inner dashes and floor insulators for carmakers Iran Khodro and PSA. - Trump’s decision could scupper French oil major Total’s multibillion-dollar gas project in Iran unless it can secure a waiver. - Total signed a deal with Tehran in July 2017 to develop phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion. - Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne in April said the company would have to apply for specific waivers to continue working in Iran if sanctions were imposed. - In the 1990s it obtained a waiver for the South Pars 2 and 3 projects after the imposition of U.S. sanctions at the time. - Austria’s OMV, which signed an MoU last year for projects in the Zagros area of western Iran and the Fars field in the south, said it was unclear what the implications of Trump’s decision would be and how the company would proceed. - Britain’s Serica Energy said it was studying how renewed sanctions would affect a British gas field which it operates with Iranian Oil Co (UK) Ltd. - Italian state-controlled power engineering firm Ansaldo Energia said it was too early to react to the U.S. decision on Iran and would instead need to see what Europe would do. - In October, Ansaldo signed an MoU with several subsidiaries of Iran’s state oil company National Iranian Oil Company to convert flare gas into electricity at NIOC’s South Pars gas field. - MTN Group said the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran might limit the South African telecoms firm’s ability to repatriate cash from MTN Irancell. - In 2018, MTN had repatriated about 88 million euros ($104 million) from MTN Irancell, with another 200 million euros due. - Sweden’s Concordia Maritime said it sees no direct impact from a tanker perspective, as it expects Saudi Arabia to compensate for whatever tankers lose out in terms of Iranian barrels. - Maersk Line, the world’s biggest container line and a part of A.P. Moller-Maersk, said it will monitor developments and keep customers informed of any changes. - Maersk Line, which employs 12 people in Tehran, Bandar Abbas and Bushehr, said its presence in Iran was limited.

2018-05-14,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2rFWRdl By John Kemp LONDON, May 14 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have continued to pare their bullish positions in petroleum despite the continued rise in prices and the prospect of renewed sanctions reducing exports from Iran. The net long position of hedge funds and other money managers in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts was cut by a further 21 million barrels in the week to May 8. The combined net long has now been reduced by a total of 55 million barrels in the three most recent weeks, according to position reports published by regulators and exchanges. As in previous weeks, the liquidation last week was concentrated in crude, while funds' exposure to refined products was increased slightly (tmsnrt.rs/2rFWRdl). Portfolio managers cut their net long position in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-9 million barrels) and Brent (-22 million barrels) for a third and fourth week respectively. By contrast, net long positions were increased slightly in U.S. gasoline (+1 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+7 million barrels) and European gasoil (+2 million barrels). For all the bullish commentary around the outlook for oil prices, fund managers appear to be taking profits after a strong rally in crude oil rather than adding new positions. Even the threat of tough sanctions on Iran’s crude exports does not seem to have encouraged funds to increase their exposure to oil. The exception is middle distillates, such as diesel and heating oil, where global consumption is growing fast, inventories are declining and the market is looking increasingly tight. Fund positioning remains stretched, with longs outnumbering shorts by 12:1 across the whole petroleum complex and by as much as 14:1 in the case of Brent. While fundamentals still appear supportive, higher oil prices are likely to restrain consumption growth and stimulate more supply in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. Against this backdrop, the extremely lopsided positioning could become a significant source of downside risk if and when portfolio managers try to exit some of their positions. As a result, most managers appear to be looking to lock in some profits after an extraordinary bull run in which oil prices have risen by 75 percent since June 2017.

2018-05-14,"(Adds details, forecast, recasts first paragraph) May 14 (Reuters) - Spanish oil and gas engineering company Tecnicas Reunidas now expects its 2018 profit margin will be at the lower end of its official guidance due to project delays and cancellations, its CEO said. Tecnicas Reunidas reported on Monday that its margin on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) was just 0.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with guidance of 1.5-2.5 percent for the full year. The news sent shares in the company down nearly 4 percent. If no new projects are awarded, EBIT margin for the year would be at the lower end of the outlook range, though reaching a 4 percent target for 2019 was “doable” as the company worked through the backlog, Chief Executive Juan Llado said in a conference call. The company’s first-quarter backlog fell to 9.7 billion euros ($11.6 billion) after two consecutive quarters of growth. Tecnicas Reunidas saw less activity in 2017 with a gap between project completions and new project awards.

The Houthis, an Iran-allied group that holds much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have fired a series of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict in Yemen widely seen as a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. A U.S.-backed military alliance intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to fight against the Houthis on behalf of the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who lives in exile in Riyadh. Iran and the Houthis dismiss Saudi accusations that Tehran arms the group. Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said Saudi air defence forces had tracked the rocket but that it landed in an uninhabited area, according to a report from the official Saudi Press Agency.

2018-05-14,"(Repeating story sent earlier to additional subscribers) * Grey market lenders fuel robust trading in crude oil futures * Some retail investors are borrowing heavily on margin * One retail investor says he lost 1 million yuan in a few weeks * Shanghai exchange says investors should be wary of risky loans * Retail investors’ big role makes the market more volatile By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason BEIJING, May 14 (Reuters) - As 9 pm approaches every weekday night in China, a small army of individual investors from around the country log onto trading apps on their mobile phones and laptops. Wall Street may be about to open but these night owls are interested in trading something much closer to home – the new Shanghai crude oil futures contracts that were launched in late March. Armed with risky loans from online firms or digging into their own savings, they threaten to play an outsized role in the new market, which has got off to a roaring start. It is not for the fainthearted – one contract of 1,000 barrels costs about 476,000 yuan ($75,160) and traders are required to place a deposit – as much as 500,000 yuan – before they are allowed to trade. On average, volume between 9 pm and midnight accounts for almost 60 percent of daily turnover, equivalent to about 22 million barrels of oil worth more than 10 billion yuan. And executives of online lending platforms, managers at major brokerages, and traders interviewed by Reuters all said that most of the orders in that period come from retail investors – and a lot of it involves borrowed money. Their dominance is a reflection of the interest among China’s burgeoning middle class for investments in the country’s vast commodities market – many of the crude oil traders also dabble in other commodities such as iron ore and steel. This is especially the case after the authorities in recent years succeeded in damping down speculative activity in stocks and in real estate. It is also a sign of the kind of mania that is high-risk not only for the individual investors – who can quickly lose a lot of money borrowed on margin – but also for the long-term prospects of China’s oil futures market. The retail investors can exaggerate price swings – they tend to close out positions every day, for example, to avoid holding costs - and the market could lose liquidity quickly if a sell-off prompts a sudden outflow of their money. Liquidity, measured by open interest, hit 15,000 lots, equivalent to 15 million barrels, last Thursday, a record and almost double levels at the start of May after Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and renewed sanctions on the oil exporter. That does suggest a pick up in interest from institutional investors in recent days. But uncertainty about the role of retail players could in the longer run deter foreign institutional investors, potentially undermining China’s attempts to become a major force in oil trading, which so far has been seen largely as a success. The market is also open for two short sessions between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. but the retail crowd prefers the night time because many of them have day jobs and because they can also trade the Shanghai contracts alongside the established benchmarks for crude oil futures, London’s Brent and WTI in the United States. The Shanghai market closes at 2.30 a.m but volume drops off after midnight as the part-time traders head off to bed. “The crude markets tend to have more volatility at night, providing an opportunity for us to trade,” said Lv Peng, a 35-year-old investor based in Zhengzhou, a second-tier city in central Henan province. “Domestic retail investors often find cues for trading from international oil prices.” Peng, a data analyst at a hedge fund, says he has on average been doing between 8 and 15 trades each week - and has been up most nights until 1 a.m. since the launch on March 26. He uses his own money. But that is not the case with a lot of the other night traders. For example, a bank employee in Nanjing in southern Jiangsu province who would only provide his surname, Liu, said he piled on trades in the nascent market with money borrowed from online financing platforms. But Liu, who is in his mid-40s, lost 1 million yuan ($157,900) in the first two weeks after his bets that prices would rally went against him. Instead prices fell 11 percent. He said he concluded that “retail investors are not able to make money in the crude futures market”, paid back his loans and quit the market feeling burned out. The Shanghai Futures Exchange said in an emailed statement that investors should not use grey-market loans which have been banned by the government to trade their products and they should be aware of the risks of doing so. Market regulator China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not respond to a request for comment. “Small investors have made the crude futures trading market more active,” said Xu Wei, head of derivatives trading at software developer Fuxing Online Software Co, which has around 4,000 retail investors using its product to trade oil futures. “At the same time, they are less experienced in the market and could easily lose all they have.” Still, lenders say that if they weren’t providing margin financing the contract wouldn’t have had as successful a start. “We provided almost two thirds of total volume contributed by retail investors. Imagine what would have happened to the market if we pulled out,” said an official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, at a lender called FindOil. His clients traded a total of 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of crude each night, he said. That equates to 30 lots each. But with investors borrowing ten times the money they’re putting down, there is a real danger that some will lose their shirts. With that kind of leverage, a small move in oil crude futures could be very costly for an investor if they were on the wrong side, said a client manager at a medium-sized broker in central Henan province. Xiamen-based Gold and Forex Management Co is one of many firms advertising online as an asset management firm offering loans. Sources at loan companies say interest rates can be as high as 1 percent a day. The company has more than 100 retail customers who needed help paying the deposit. Their combined deposit reached as high as 200 million yuan at one point, a company source said. Still, there is one person who won’t be embarking on any more night-time trading adventures anytime soon. That’s Liu - the Nanjing banker. He said he can handle the financial losses and his wife, though angry, did not blame him. From now on though, he’s going to invest in “less exciting” treasury bonds and is sticking to doing it during daylight hours.

2018-05-14,"MILAN (Reuters) - The trial of top executives from oil majors Eni (ENI.MI) and Shell (RDSa.L) over alleged corruption in Nigeria kicked off on Monday with a brief procedural hearing and a decision to re-adjourn next month. At the next hearing, set for June 20, the Milan court said it would assess requests from third parties, including a series of international non-profit organisations, to join the case.  At Monday’s hearing Domenico Cartoni Schittar, a lawyer representing the Nigerian government, said he was stepping down from his role. In comments in a signed document seen by Reuters, Cartoni Schittar said he had given up on a mandate which he said had become “awkward”. The long-running graft case revolves around the 2011 purchase by Eni and Shell of Nigeria’s OPL-245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion. Milan prosecutors allege bribes were paid to win the licence to explore an oil block that holds an estimated 9 billion barrels of oil but which has never entered into production. Global Witness, a campaign group that has conducted its own investigations, has described the case as one of the biggest corruption scandals in the history of the oil industry. Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded are standing trial along with 11 other defendants and the two companies. All the accused have denied any wrongdoing. The former Shell executives involved in the case have claimed a procedural error was made when the original ruling to send the case to court was taken and have applied to Italy’s Supreme Court to void it. The Supreme Court is scheduled to judge that appeal on June 12.

2018-05-14,"NEW DELHI, May 14 (Reuters) - Indian state fuel retailers raised diesel and petrol prices on Monday to their highest in nearly five years, data from the country’s biggest fuel retailer shows. Opposition leaders criticised the government for the increases, which have come days after a crucial election in the southern state of Karnataka that both the ruling party and opposition Congress party have fought hard to win. Fuel prices had been kept steady for nearly three weeks despite a move to market-linked pricing years ago. State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), whose price decision is followed by other refiners, said last week that it was keeping rates constant because the “current global oil price rise is not supported by fundamentals”. It was not immediately clear what prompted the company to raise prices on Monday. A company spokesman could not be reached for comment. “The retailers may have been asked to absorb the incremental hikes as we had seen during Gujarat state elections (in December),” said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at energy consultancy FGE. An oil ministry spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Petrol prices have risen by about 0.2 percent and diesel prices by 0.3 percent in major Indian cities this week, according to data provided by IOC. “This government is blatantly lying to the people by telling them that prices are controlled by market mechanisms,” said Abhishek Singhvi, a spokesman for the Congress party. Global crude oil prices this month hit their highest in more than three years on record Asian demand and after the United States said it would re-impose sanctions on major oil exporter Iran, which is an important supplier to India.

2018-05-14,"COLOMBO, May 14 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares ended at a near five-week low on Monday, led by industrial shares such as John Keells Holdings, while foreign outflows and the recent fuel price hike weighed on sentiment, stockbrokers said. State-run fuel retailer Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) raised retail prices for gasoline and diesel on Thursday midnight in response to the hike in oil prices, while Lanka IOC, a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp, increased fuel rates the same day. “The fuel price hike hit overall market sentiment. The increase could hit cost of production and services in almost all the companies. So investors expect lower profits,”  said Jaliya Wijeratne, CEO, First Capital Equities. The Colombo stock index fell for a sixth straight session and ended 0.52 percent weaker at 6,444.96, its lowest close since April 10. The index lost 0.4 percent last week, in its third straight weekly decline. The day’s foreign selling accounted for 80 percent of the turnover, which stood at 924.4 million rupees ($5.86 million), less than this year’s daily average of 1.03 billion rupees. Foreign investors net sold 333.2 million rupees worth of equities on Monday, extending net foreign outflow to 668.5 million rupees worth of equities so far this year. John Keells Holdings, whose transport business is seen to be affected due to the price hike, ended 1.2 percent down, while top mobile phone operator Dialog Axiata, closed 1.4 percent lower despite posting a rise of 78.6 percent in first-quarter net profit, and Lanka IOC ended down 4.5 percent. Garment exporter Teejay Lanka Plc accounted for 65 percent of the day’s turnover. The market shrugged off the central bank’s policy decision on Friday as it was widely expected, brokers said. The central bank kept its key policy rates steady, a little more than a month after it unexpectedly cut the main lending rate, forecasting a modest recovery in the economy this year after growth slumped to a 16-year low in 2017. Analysts said the depreciation of rupee also weighed on investor sentiment as it is likely to hit profits of some listed firms that rely heavily on imports. The rupee hit a fresh low of 158.00 per U.S. dollar on Monday on importer demand for the U.S. currency. Analysts said concerns over political instability following President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to suspend the parliament last month after 16 legislators from his ruling coalition defected also weighed on sentiment. Sirisena last week urged his own coalition government and the opposition to end a power struggle in order to achieve ambitious goals including anti-corruption measures.

2018-05-14,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), the world’s biggest listed oil company by output, saw its net profit rise seven-fold in the first quarter, lifted by higher oil prices as the global market moves towards balance, the company said on Monday. Rosneft, headed by Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, controls around 40 percent of Russian oil production, making it key to Moscow’s efforts to temporarily limit oil production under a deal led by OPEC and Russia.  Rosneft said on Monday that its crude output was down 1.2 percent in January-March to 4.57 million barrels per day (bpd), compared with a year earlier, due to Russia’s obligations under the deal with OPEC that was first agreed at the end of 2016 and later extended until the end of 2018. Rosneft said it was ready to add over 100,000 bpd of production quite quickly if needed. The average price of Urals, Russia’s flagship oil blend, rose by 25 percent year-on-year to $65.2 per barrel in the first quarter, Rosneft said.  Alexander Novak, acting energy minister while a new government is being formed after Putin was sworn in for a new term as president last week, told reporters on Monday that the oil market is fundamentally rebalancing as the supply curbs led to global oil inventories shrinking. Asked if U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and to impose sanctions on Tehran had any implications for the oil supply cut deal, Novak said he had discussed the issue by phone with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.  Novak gave no details but said he planned to discuss Iran-related issues with Falih during the Saudi minister’s visit to St. Petersburg for an economic forum at the end of May.  The oil price rise allowed Rosneft to post net profit of 81 billion roubles ($1.31 billion) in the first quarter, up from 11 billion roubles a year ago and beating a Reuters forecast of 76.8 billion roubles. Rosneft said its first-quarter sales were up 22 percent year-on-year to 1.72 trillion roubles, below the 1.76 trillion expected by analysts.  Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 16 percent to 385 billion roubles, while January-March cash flow stood at 142 billion roubles. Rosneft, which has been pursuing an aggressive acquisition policy, expanding its global reach in India, Iraqi Kurdistan and other places, did not disclose its net debt.  Rosneft is under Western sanctions imposed in 2014 over the Ukraine crisis that limit its ability to raise funds on Western markets and to use some Western drilling technologies. Sechin is also on the U.S. sanctions list, barring him from travelling to the United States. According to calculations by Aton brokerage, Rosneft’s net debt declined by 2 percent compared with the end of 2017 to 3.4 trillion roubles (40.57 billion pounds), excluding pre-payments.  “This points to 2.2x net debt/EBITDA based on our full-year EBITDA forecast, compared to 2.5x seen at the end of the preceding quarter,” Aton said in a note on Monday.  Rosneft announced a series of measures on May 1 to improve shareholder returns, such as a $2 billion share buyback and plans to cut total debt and trading liabilities by a minimum of 500 billion roubles. Sechin, commenting on the results, said the company “expects further reduction in liabilities and improvement in shareholder returns”. Rosneft shares were flat on Monday, slightly better than the overall Moscow Exchange index which was down 0.4 percent.   Oil major BP (BP.L) owns 19.75 percent of Rosneft. Qatar’s sovereign investment fund QIA will hold almost 19 percent after agreeing to raise its stake after a deal to sell some of the Rosneft shares to China’s CEFC collapsed.

Trump’s comments on Sunday came ahead of a second round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this week to resolve an escalating trade dispute. China had said last week its stance in the negotiations would not change. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent, holding at its highest level in seven weeks and in positive territory for the year. European stocks dipped 0.3 percent as financials weighed, while EMini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent. “There have been some very serious issues raised in terms of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, and then they’ve had this quite sudden about-turn on this particular company, and it simply raises questions as to what the underlying policy is,” said Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research. “This is perhaps a little reminder which is being relatively well-received by markets over the last 24 hours that (with) the U.S. administration there is a strong degree of unpredictability compared to prior regimes,” George added. The United States has said it will lift sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Stocks in Asia were also upbeat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei also tacked on 0.5 percent. Chinese shares came off the day’s highs but still ended in positive territory after Trump’s comments on ZTE Corp ,, which JPMorgan analysts said was “a significant positive”. Shanghai’s SSE Composite index rose 0.3 percent while the blue-chip rallied 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed 1.4 percent. Elsewhere in Asia, the Malaysian ringgit recovered losses after sliding 1 percent to a four-month trough against the dollar in the first onshore trade since a shock election upset last week. Malaysian stocks sank as much as 2.7 percent at one point but ended 0.2 percent higher. Veteran Mahathir Mohamad, 92, came out of political retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory, defeating prime minister Najib Razak, a former protege whom he had accused of corruption. Some investors were concerned that populist promises such as repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy could undermine the country’s finances. But some analysts believe Mahathir’s proposals could be positive for the economy. “The repeal of GST, while only marginally negative for the fiscal deficit, will be a boon for consumers, who have been upset that they bear the burden of poor fiscal management and came out to vote against the establishment,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis. While tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East. Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices to near multi-year highs. Citi analyst Mark Schofield said rising oil prices risk causing ‘stagflation’, which could create a particularly “hostile environment” for risk assets. On Monday, U.S. crude traded flat at $70.71 a barrel and Brent was up at $77.23, clawing back previous losses after a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity pointed to increased output. The United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational. In currencies, the dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 92.33 against a basket of major currencies and was set for its fourth straight day of losses. Against the Japanese yen, it ticked down to 109.49 per dollar, remaining largely in a holding pattern since late last month.

2018-05-14,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has signed a project development agreement with Spain’s Cepsa for a new linear alkylbenzene (LAB) facility in ADNOC’s Ruwais refining and petrochemicals complex. The LAB facility, which can be used in the production of detergents, paints and cosmetics, is among a number of initiatives taken by ADNOC as looks to expand its refining and petrochemicals operations, it said in a statement on Monday.  The national oil company plans to invest $45 billion over the next five years to expand its refining and petrochemicals operations, it said on Sunday.  The centrepiece of ADNOC’s strategy is the Ruwais industrial complex, which ADNOC wants to turn into the largest integrated refining and petrochemicals complex in the world. The LAB agreement follows the signing last November of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between ADNOC and Cepsa to evaluate the setting up of a LAB facility in Ruwais, ADNOC said.  After completing a feasibility study, the LAB project will now move to the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) stage, ADNOC said. “The LAB manufacturing facility will be fully integrated within the ADNOC refining complex, taking feedstocks of kerosene and benzene and benefiting from the suite of utilities and services of the Ruwais complex,” ADNOC said. “The facility is expected to have a production capacity of 150,000 tons per year of LAB upon completion.” Striving to become a global player in the downstream sector, the state oil giant wants to double its refining capacity and triple petrochemicals output potential by 2025 as it looks to capture new growth markets, ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters in an interview on Saturday. ADNOC plans to expand refining and petrochemical operations at Ruwais by adding a third refinery to boost capacity by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2025, lifting total refining potential to 1.5 million bpd.

2018-05-14,"HANOI, May 14 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s highest-ranking official jailed in decades lost his bid on Monday to set aside a 13-year sentence for financial irregularities when he was chairman of state energy firm Petrovietnam, his lawyer said. A court in the communist-ruled country upheld the sentence for former Politburo member Dinh La Thang, 57, who was arrested and tried in a crackdown on graft, mismanagement and nepotism that felled many high-profile officials. The Hanoi People’s High Court rejected an appeal by Thang against a January trial verdict that held him guilty of “economic mismanagement” at a coal-fired power plant overseen by PetroVietnam. “I am very disappointed with the result of the trial because they didn’t look carefully into all the details I presented,” the lawyer, Dao Huu Dang, told Reuters by telephone. State media this month blamed losses of 120 billion dong ($5.3 million) on Thang, saying he illegally assigned an incompetent subsidiary of the company to build the plant, instead of finding a competent contractor by a tender process. In a separate case in March, Thang received an 18-year jail term on the same charges of “deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management”. At that trial, Thang was prosecuted over losses of up to 800 billion dong, or $35 million, in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank, forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam after it suffered heavy losses. Thang will also appeal against the 18-year term, his lawyer said. If that term is also upheld, the sentences will run successively for a total of 31 years in prison. Another PetroVietnam official, Trinh Xuan Thanh, withdrew an appeal against the life sentence he received in the same case at the January trial, his lawyer said. Last week, the Communist Party of Vietnam said that Thanh, whom Germany has said was kidnapped from Berlin in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War, withdrew his appeal because of “health conditions”. His lawyer, Nguyen Van Quynh, said Thanh did not have any health issues ahead of the appeal trial.

2018-05-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is preparing to sell its North Sea fields as the company focuses on shale operations in its home market, industry and banking sources said. The disposal of Conoco’s North Sea assets after more than 50 years in the British offshore basin could fetch as much as $2 billion, but it was unclear how much of the portfolio would be put up for sale, the three sources said.  Conoco declined to comment. The company has yet to launch a formal process or appoint a bank but executives from Conoco have spoken in recent weeks to a number of North Sea operators and bankers to “gauge the appetite for the sale”, one of the sources said. The assets include a 24 percent stake in the west Shetlands region’s Clair field, which its operator BP (BP.L) says is the largest undeveloped oil and gas resource in the UK North Sea. The Clair Ridge project is expected to begin production this year, according to BP. Other fields include holdings in the Britannia and J-Block hubs. Conoco’s production in the UK North Sea reached 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017, its annual report said. The company tried to sell some of its North Sea assets in 2014 but the process failed, the sources added. Conoco is the latest major oil company seeking to exit the North Sea as production in the ageing basin declines, other areas become more competitive and costs for dismantling ageing infrastructure weigh. Conoco earlier this year said it would cut some 450 jobs in Britain, more than a quarter of its UK workforce.

2018-05-14,"SINGAPORE/NEW YORK/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi oil producer Aramco’s trading arm has begun supplying U.S. condensate, an ultra-light crude oil, to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), four people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Monday, underlining the giant firm’s global ambitions. The sale marks Aramco Trading Company’s (ATC) first U.S. crude spot trade, the people said, with ATC tapping Aramco’s Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] unit in the United States as a supply source for two shipments to the UAE. Aramco sells almost all its crude under long-term contracts, but decided last year to trade in non-Saudi crude in the short-term spot market. For the UAE trades, a first shipment of 1 million barrels (bbl) of U.S. condensate aboard the tanker ‘Astra’ was unloaded at Ruwais on May 12, according to the sources and shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. All the sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to media. Motiva has also chartered the tanker ‘South Sea’ to ship about 1 million bbl of condensate from the U.S. Gulf to Ruwais in May for about $2 million, one U.S.-based shipping source said. Both vessels are ‘Suezmax’ tankers, with capacities from 120,000-200,000 deadweight tonnes, named after the Suez Canal as they are able to transit the canal fully laden. As of May 12, the ‘South Sea’ was docked at Corpus Christi in Texas, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. Motiva, which operates a 603,000-barrel-per-day refinery at Port Arthur, Texas, and ATC did not respond to requests for comment. While the shipments from the United States are a first, the move fits into a strategy outlined by Aramco executives last month. “ATC has started supplying some condensate from West to the East. It started only a few weeks back, slowly, but we will have to make sure that there is an economic sense for us for crude trading,” Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of a conference in April. Nasser said ATC had been focusing on crude oil processing arrangements at refineries with spare capacity, which are mainly located in Europe. But more ATC trades with U.S. oil are set to follow. Motiva is still looking for ships to move U.S. oil to the East, the shipping source said, as price differentials between U.S. crude CLc1 and international crude LCOc1 make such trades profitable. Earlier this month, ATC was also one of the successful bidders in a tender issued by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to buy condensate for delivery in July to September, the sources said. ADNOC bought 6.5 million barrels of condensate in the tender with the bulk of the supplies coming from the United States, a source familiar with the matter said. Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri, Director, Marketing Sales & Trading at ADNOC, told Reuters: “By tendering our condensate we are able to diversify our supply and achieve better commercial value. For example, we are able to take advantage of arbitrage cargoes from long distances that have delivered ADNOC more value and higher returns.” He added that ADNOC now buys condensate from various suppliers. ADNOC started importing U.S. oil in the second half of last year after a diplomatic row with Qatar. ATC is also looking to extend its trading operations in Asia. ATC’s CEO Ibrahim al-Buainain told Reuters last month it plans to handle crude in Asia through its Singapore office in the third quarter of this year, and aims to boost its volumes for trading crude and refined products globally to 6 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, up from negligible amounts currently. Buainain said his company mostly handles third-party crude and has traded “very small” Saudi crude volumes in processing deals in return for refined products.

Trump’s comments on Sunday came ahead of a second round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this week to resolve an escalating trade dispute. China had said last week its stance in the negotiations would not change. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent, holding at its highest level in seven weeks and in positive territory for the year. European stocks were broadly flat as energy stocks and financials weighed. “There have been some very serious issues raised in terms of the trade relationship between the U.S. and China, and then they’ve had this quite sudden about-turn on this particular company, and it simply raises questions as to what the underlying policy is,” Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, said. “This is perhaps a little reminder which is being relatively well-received by markets over the last 24 hours that (with) the U.S. administration there is a strong degree of unpredictability compared to prior regimes,” Edison’s George added. The United States has said it will lift sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Stocks in Asia were also upbeat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei also tacked on 0.5 percent. Chinese shares came off the day’s highs but were still higher after Trump’s comments on ZTE Corp, , which JPMorgan analysts said was “a significant positive.” Shanghai’s SSE Composite index rose 0.3 percent while the blue-chip rallied 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed 1.4 percent. Elsewhere in Asia, the Malaysian ringgit recovered losses after sliding 1 percent to a four-month trough against the dollar in the first onshore trade since a shock election upset last week. Malaysian stocks sank as much as 2.7 percent at one point but were last up 1.5 percent. Veteran Mahathir Mohamad came out of political retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory defeating prime minister Najib Razak, a former protege he had accused of corruption. Some investors were concerned that populist promises such as repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy could undermine the country’s finances. But some analysts believe Mahathir’s proposals could be positive for the economy. “The repeal of GST, while only marginally negative for the fiscal deficit, will be a boon for consumers, who have been upset that they bear the burden of poor fiscal management and came out to vote against the establishment,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis. OIL AND IRAN While tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East. Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices near multi-year highs. Citi analyst Mark Schofield said rising oil prices risk causing ‘stagflation’, which could create a particularly “hostile environment” for risk assets. On Monday, U.S. crude slipped to $70.33 a barrel and Brent was down at $76.70 as a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity pointed to increased output. The United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational. In currencies, the dollar dipped 0.2 percent to 92.40 against a basket of major currencies and was set for its fourth straight day of losses. Against the Japanese yen, it ticked down to 109.52 per dollar, remaining largely in a holding pattern since late last month. The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1974 following two consecutive sessions of gains as Italy’s anti-establishment parties looked likely to form the next government. Last week, the Bank of England held rates steady and New Zealand’s central bank said the official cash rate will remain at historic lows of 1.75 percent for “some time.” That leaves the Fed as the only major central bank in the world committed to rate increases although recent data showing moderate inflation reading has cast doubt over the pace of any hikes.

2018-05-14,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Two new fissures opened on Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano, hurling bursts of rock and magma with an ear-piercing screech on Sunday, threatening nearby homes and prompting authorities to order new evacuations. One new fissure from Sunday morning was a vivid gouge of magma with smoke pouring out both ends and was the 17th to open on the volcano since it began erupting on May 3. Some 37 buildings have been destroyed and nearly 2,000 people ordered to evacuate in the past 10 days. Viewed from a helicopter, the crack appeared to be about 1,000 feet (300 meters) long and among the largest of those fracturing the side of Kilauea, a 4,000-foot-high (1,200-meters) volcano with a lake of lava at its summit. “It is a near-constant roar akin to a full-throttle 747 interspersed with deafening, earth-shattering explosions that hurtle 100-pound (45-kg) lava bombs 100 feet (30 meters) into the air,” said Mark Clawson, 64, who lives uphill from the latest fissure and so far is defying an evacuation order. Closer to the summit, in the evacuated Leilani Estates neighborhood of about 1,500 people, explosions could be heard in the distance as steam rose from cracks in the roads. The bulging rim of one fissure wrecked a building, leaving behind torn metal. An 18th fissure opened nearby on Sunday evening at about 6 p.m. local time, spewing fumes and lava, officials said. In areas where sulfur dioxide emissions were strong, the vegetation turned brown and leafless trees withered.  The U.S. Geological Survey warned that fissures could erupt throughout the area, and Civil Defense officials on Sunday ordered people living on Halekamahina Road to evacuate and be on the alert for gas emissions and lava spatter.  Meanwhile, other fissures continued to billow smoke over homes on the eastern point of the Big Island of Hawaii, the largest of the Hawaiian islands. Even so, some people such as Clawson remained in their homes, confident they would be spared. “We are keeping track of lava bombs. One went through the lanai (porch) roof of a neighbor’s house,” Clawson said. About eight to 10 neighbors had yet to evacuate, he said. The Hawaii National Guard is warning people in the coastal Lower Puna area to prepare to leave, saying anyone who chooses to stay behind cannot count on being rescued. An evacuation has not been ordered there but might be if a local highway is cut off. “We’ve been telling them, ‘Evacuate if you can, because if we have to come in and get you we’ll be putting first responders at risk’,” Major Jeff Hickman told reporters. “There’s a point where we’ll tell our first responders, ‘Nope, you can’t go’.” (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS)  Reporting by Terray Sylvester in Pahoa and Jolyn Rosa in Honolulu; additional reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Paul Simao, Daniel Wallis and Paul Tait",https://uk.reuters.com/article/hawaii-volcano/update-3-huge-fissures-open-on-hawaiian-volcano-some-defy-evacuation-order-idUKL2N1SK0DQ,14 May 2018,"Two new fissures opened on

2018-05-14,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - A U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran is supporting China’s newly established crude oil futures, and may spur efforts to start trading oil in yuan rather than dollars, traders and analysts said. Since launching in March, Shanghai crude oil futures  have seen a steady pick-up in daily trading, while open interest - the number of outstanding longer-term positions and a gauge of institutional interest - has also surged. Traded daily volumes hit a record 250,000 lots last Wednesday, more than double the day before, spurred by news of the Iran sanctions. The jump helped the front-month Shanghai futures contract account for 12 percent of the global oil market last week, up from just 8 percent in week one. “The contract is thundering into action,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. The world’s biggest importer of crude oil, China hopes the Shanghai contract will eventually rival international benchmarks Brent and benchmark WTI. The ascent of Shanghai crude is aided by China’s voracious demand for oil, with imports hitting a record in April of 9.6 million barrels per day. China is also the biggest buyer of Iranian crude oil, and the recent boost in trading volume at least in part flowed from the sanctions decision, said Barry White, senior vice president for derivatives in Singapore at financial services firm INTL FCStone. “The sanctions... can potentially accelerate this process of establishing a 3rd (oil) benchmark,” White said. China took almost a quarter of Iran’s exports in 2017, meeting around 8 percent of its import needs, leaving both sides exposed to the impact of U.S. sanctions. Anticipating shortages, speculators helped push the Shanghai contract to a dollar-converted record high of around $75.40 per barrel last week, outpacing gains on rival benchmarks, while Chinese refiners hedged their facilities against increased feedstock prices. “Chinese refiners are worried as costs of purchasing crude rise... and showed a strong interest in using Shanghai Crude for hedging in the wake of the sanctions,” said Zhang Huiyao, deputy head of crude with Huatai Futures. Beijing also wants to establish the yuan in physical oil markets, which would avoid the cost of exchanging dollars and increase the use of the renmimbi in global financial trade.    State-owned refining major Sinopec has already inked a Middle East import deal against Shanghai crude, with plans being developed to sign more such contracts. Reimposed sanctions on Iran could give China leverage to demand oil imports from the country be priced off Shanghai’s crude futures. “It makes sense for Iran to begin selling oil under contracts denominated in yuan rather than dollars,” said OANDA’s Innes. However, Iranian oil is not among the types of Middle East crude deliverable through the Shanghai exchange mechanism. To price it off Shanghai futures, traders would have to agree to transact Iranian crude through buying opposite positions in Shanghai futures and then swapping those positions Exchange of Futures for Physical (EFP) contract that would account for the price difference between Iranian oil and the Shanghai futures price. Traders said China may also not want to push back too hard against Washington. “I don’t think China will be able to use the sanctions as a leverage to price Iranian imports in yuan... It is more likely that China will curb Iranian imports,” said Huatai’s Zhang. “They (China) will grumble and accept it,” added Fereidun Fesharaki, founder and chairman of energy consultancy FGE. “There is no one who will realistically choose Iran over the United States.” Reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE and Meng Meng in BEIJING; Writing by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-china-oil/chinas-crude-oil-futures-boom-amid-looming-iran-sanctions-idUKL8N1SI0L7,14 May 2018,"A U.S. decision to

It is not for the fainthearted – one contract of 1,000 barrels costs about 476,000 yuan ($75,160) and traders are required to place a deposit – as much as 500,000 yuan – before they are allowed to trade. On average, volume between 9 pm and midnight accounts for almost 60 percent of daily turnover, equivalent to about 22 million barrels of oil worth more than 10 billion yuan.     And executives of online lending platforms, managers at major brokerages, and traders interviewed by Reuters all said that most of the orders in that period come from retail investors – and a lot of it involves borrowed money.  Their dominance is a reflection of the interest among China’s burgeoning middle class for investments in the country’s vast commodities market – many of the crude oil traders also dabble in other commodities such as iron ore and steel. This is  especially the case after the authorities in recent years succeeded in damping down speculative activity in stocks and in real estate.  It is also a sign of the kind of mania that is high-risk not only for the individual investors – who can quickly lose a lot of money borrowed on margin – but also for the long-term prospects of China’s oil futures market. The retail investors can exaggerate price swings – they tend to close out positions every day, for example, to avoid holding costs - and the market could lose liquidity quickly if a sell-off prompts a sudden outflow of their money.  Liquidity, measured by open interest, hit 15,000 lots, equivalent to 15 million barrels, last Thursday, a record and almost double levels at the start of May after Washington withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and renewed sanctions on the oil exporter. That does suggest a pick up in interest from institutional investors in recent days. But uncertainty about the role of retail players could in the longer run deter foreign institutional investors, potentially undermining China’s attempts to become a major force in oil trading, which so far has been seen largely as a success. The market is also open for two short sessions between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. but the retail crowd prefers the night time because many of them have day jobs and because they can also trade the Shanghai contracts alongside the established benchmarks for crude oil futures, London’s Brent <0#LCO:> and WTI in the United States <0#CL:>. The Shanghai market closes at 2.30 a.m but volume drops off after midnight as the part-time traders head off to bed. “The crude markets tend to have more volatility at night, providing an opportunity for us to trade,” said Lv Peng, a 35-year-old investor based in Zhengzhou, a second-tier city in central Henan province. “Domestic retail investors often find cues for trading from international oil prices.”  Peng, a data analyst at a hedge fund, says he has on average been doing between 8 and 15 trades each week - and has been up most nights until 1 a.m. since the launch on March 26. He uses his own money. But that is not the case with a lot of the other night traders. For example, a bank employee in Nanjing in southern Jiangsu province who would only provide his surname, Liu, said he piled on trades in the nascent market with money borrowed from online financing platforms. But Liu, who is in his mid-40s, lost 1 million yuan ($157,900) in the first two weeks after his bets that prices would rally went against him. Instead prices fell 11 percent. He said he concluded that “retail investors are not able to make money in the crude futures market”, paid back his loans and quit the market feeling burned out. The Shanghai Futures Exchange said in an emailed statement that investors should not use grey-market loans which have been banned by the government to trade their products and they should be aware of the risks of doing so. Market regulator China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not respond to a request for comment. “Small investors have made the crude futures trading market more active,” said Xu Wei, head of derivatives trading at software developer Fuxing Online Software Co, which has around 4,000 retail investors using its product to trade oil futures. “At the same time, they are less experienced in the market and could easily lose all they have.” Still, lenders say that if they weren’t providing margin financing the contract wouldn’t have had as successful a start. “We provided almost two thirds of total volume contributed by retail investors. Imagine what would have happened to the market if we pulled out,” said an official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, at a lender called FindOil. His clients traded a total of 20,000 to 30,000 barrels of crude each night, he said. That equates to 30 lots each. But with investors borrowing ten times the money they’re putting down, there is a real danger that some will lose their shirts. With that kind of leverage, a small move in oil crude futures could be very costly for an investor if they were on the wrong side, said a client manager at a medium-sized broker in central Henan province. Xiamen-based Gold and Forex Management Co is one of many firms advertising online as an asset management firm offering loans. Sources at loan companies say interest rates can be as high as 1 percent a day. The company has more than 100 retail customers who needed help paying the deposit. Their combined deposit reached as high as 200 million yuan at one point, a company source said. Still, there is one person who won’t be embarking on any more night-time trading adventures anytime soon. That’s Liu - the Nanjing banker. He said he can handle the financial losses and his wife, though angry, did not blame him. From now on though, he’s going to invest in “less exciting” treasury bonds and is sticking to doing it during daylight hours.

2018-05-14,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Monday that it has taken a dispute to the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States for imposing tariffs on washing machines and solar panels as the measure was deemed to be in violation of the WTO agreement.  South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a statement that it has delivered its request for bilateral consultation to the U.S. side to start a dispute settlement process.  The move is a set of measures that the South Korean government had taken after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped a steep tariff on imported washing machines and solar panels in February to protect American manufacturers. In April, South Korea said it notified its plan to suspend tariff concessions on imported U.S. goods worth $480 million following U.S. tariff measures against South Korean imports. The ministry said it will respond to unfair import restrictions taken by the country’s major trading partners against South Korean companies.

2018-05-14,"(Repeats from MAY 13, no changes to text) * Abubakar confirms to run for president in 2019 * Was vice president from 1999-2007 * Former Buhari ally left ruling party last year * Abubakar says would privatise parts of NNPC By Alexis Akwagyiram and Paul Carsten ABUJA, May 13 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s former vice president Atiku Abubakar will privatise parts of the country’s state oil company and allow the naira currency to float to attract foreign investment if elected as head of state, he told Reuters. Abubakar also confirmed that he intends to run in next year’s presidential election, becoming the biggest opposition heavyweight to say he will take on Muhammadu Buhari. The winner of February’s poll will lead Africa’s top oil producer and most populous nation, which is central to regional stability as it battles Islamist militants in the northeast. Abubakar, a former key ally of President Buhari whose resources helped propel him to power, quit the ruling party in November and re-joined the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) a month later. He has long enjoyed support from the business elite in Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos for his conservative-capitalist ideals and, as vice president in a PDP administration from 1999-2007, he implemented a programme of liberalisation in areas including telecoms sector. Abubakar said he would go further if elected president. “I am also going to expand it to include the oil and gas sector which have not been touched at all and other major sectors of the economy like mining, solid minerals,” he said. Abubakar said he would privatise parts of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which has been beset by decades of mismanagement and is crucial to the OPEC member’s economic fortunes. He did not specify the parts that would be privatised. “I am a strong believer in very, very small government and also the private sector,” he said. A drop in crude oil prices from late 2014 pushed Nigeria into its first recession in 25 years in 2016, spawning chronic dollar shortages because oil receipts make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of the country’s foreign exchange. The economy moved out of recession last year but growth remains weak and multiple exchange rates remain in place, imposed by the central bank to support Buhari’s insistence that the naira should not be allowed to float. “I will allow the naira to float because I believe that is one of the ways foreign direct investment can be encouraged to come in,” said Abubakar, who hopes to replicate Buhari’s 2015 feat of winning a presidential election at the fourth attempt. Buhari, who took office in 2015, and whoever becomes president next will face challenges ranging from weak economic growth to communal violence between semi-nomadic herdsmen and farmers, as well as the Boko Haram insurgency. Abubakar - who, like Buhari, is a Muslim from the north - said voters would welcome someone who could revive their fortunes, adding that of his three previous presidential campaigns he was only once rejected by the electorate. He was not selected as a party candidate on the other two occasions. Parties must select their candidate by Oct. 7. The next president should be a northerner, under an unofficial power-sharing agreement under which the presidency alternates between the north and south after every two four-year terms. Bismarck Rewane, chief executive of Lagos-based consultancy Financial Derivatives, said the former vice president’s familiarity and age could be a disadvantage. “To upset the Buhari candidature, you need something different: someone young, energetic and charismatic. You need something distinct from the current leadership,” he said. Abubakar lacked Buhari’s popularity in northern states and at 71, just four years younger than the president, would struggle to generate “inter-generational appeal”, Rewane said. The UN estimates that the median age in Nigeria is 18.

Trump’s comments on Sunday came ahead of a second round of trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials this week to resolve an escalating trade dispute. China had said last week its stance in the negotiations would not change. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei tacked on 0.3 percent. Chinese shares were also buoyant after Trump’s comments on ZTE Corp , which JPMorgan analysts said was “a significant positive.” Shanghai’s SSE Composite index rose 0.6 percent while the blue-chip rallied 1.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index climbed 1.2 percent. “The fact Trump is now...working to find a resolution for ZTE marks the latest sign of thawing in Beijing-Washington relations,” JPMorgan said. “Trump also needs China to remain on side ahead of his meeting with North Korea’s Kim and this also suggests that until the 12 June meeting the signalling from the U.S. on trade will be more positive.” The United States has said it will lift sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Elsewhere in Asia, the Malaysian ringgit slid 1 percent to a four-month trough against the dollar in the first onshore trade since a shock election upset last week. Malaysian stocks sank as much as 2.7 percent at one point but were up 0.5 percent by midday. Veteran Mahathir Mohamad came out of political retirement to lead the opposition Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) to a stunning victory defeating prime minister Najib Razak, a former protege he had accused of corruption. Some investors were concerned that populist promises such as repealing an unpopular goods and services tax and restoring a petrol subsidy could undermine the country’s finances. But some analysts believe Mahathir’s proposals could be positive for the economy. “The repeal of GST, while only marginally negative for the fiscal deficit, will be a boon for consumers, who have been upset that they bear the burden of poor fiscal management and came out to vote against the establishment,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist at Natixis. While tensions in the Korean peninsula have eased, U.S. plans to reintroduce sanctions against Iran have stoked anxiety in the Middle East. Iran pumps about 4 percent of the world’s oil, and the latest development has sent oil prices near multi-year highs. On Monday, U.S. crude slipped 24 cents to $70.46 a barrel and Brent was off 39 cents at $76.73 as a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity pointed to increased output. The United States threatened on Sunday to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran, as the remaining participants in the Iran nuclear accord stiffened their resolve to keep that agreement operational. In currencies, the dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 92.41 against a basket of major currencies and was set for its fourth straight day of losses. Against the Japanese yen, it ticked down to 109.32 per dollar, remaining largely in a holding pattern since late last month. The euro inched 0.18 percent up to $1.1963 following two consecutive sessions of gains as Italy’s anti-establishment parties looked likely to form the next government. Last week, the Bank of England held rates steady and New Zealand’s central bank said the official cash rate will remain at historic lows of 1.75 percent for “some time.” That leaves the Fed as the only major central bank in the world committed to rate increases although recent data showing moderate inflation reading has cast doubt over the pace of any hikes.

2018-05-14,"* U.S. rig count rises to its highest level since March 2015 * Europe, Asia oppose U.S. plans for new sanctions against Iran By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, May 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Monday as a relentless rise in U.S. drilling activity points to increased output, while resistance emerged in Europe and Asia to U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran. Still, crude prices were near more than three-year-highs reached last week as markets expect Iran’s oil exports to fall significantly once U.S. sanctions bite later this year. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $77.07 per barrel at 0010 GMT, down 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $70.66 a barrel, down 4 cents from their last settlement. Brent and WTI last week reached their highest since November 2014 at $78 and $71.89 per barrel respectively. “Around a million barrels of oil a day is likely to disappear from global oil markets if the U.S. sanctions on Iran bite,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. “But it is still far from certain that they will bite in the way intended... Germany has said it will protect its companies from U.S. sanctions, Iran has said French oil giant Total has yet to pull out of its fields and all the while it seems the Chinese are ready to fill the void created by the U.S.,” he said Markets were also held in check by a rise in U.S. drilling for new oil production. U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to May 11, bringing the total count to 844, the highest level since March 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. Hedge funds and money mangers slashed their bullish wagers on U.S. crude in the latest week to the lowest level in nearly five months, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday, in an indicator that many financial oil traders are doubtful of significant further price rises.
