The name and age of the worker who died was not provided. He succumbed to his injuries on Friday. The explosions occurred late Wednesday morning, when workers from two pipeline companies were investigating a underground gas leak. Two firefighters on the scene were also injured during the explosion. Kinder Morgan Inc and Navitas Midstream Partners both said at least one employee was injured. The accident occurred in the Permian Basin, where oil and gas activity has surged in recent years.

2018-08-03,"NEW YORK/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s proposed tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports opens a new front in the trade war between the two countries, at a time when the White House is trumpeting growing U.S. energy export prowess.  China included LNG for the first time in its list of proposed tariffs on Friday, the same day that its biggest U.S. crude oil buyer, Sinopec, suspended U.S. crude oil imports due to the dispute, according to three sources familiar with the situation. On Friday, China announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, and warned of further measures, signaling it will not back down in a protracted trade war with Washington. That could cast a shadow over U.S. President Donald Trump’s energy dominance ambitions. The administration has repeatedly said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to global allies, while Washington is rolling back domestic regulations to encourage more oil and gas production.  “The juxtaposition here is clear: it is hard to become an energy superpower when one of the biggest energy consumers in the world is raising barriers to consume that energy. It makes it very difficult,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at Barclays.  The United States is the world’s largest exporter of fuels such as gasoline and diesel, and is poised to become one of the largest exporters of LNG by 2019. U.S. LNG exports were worth $3.3 billion in 2017. China is the world’s biggest crude oil importer.  China had curtailed its imports of U.S. LNG over the last two months, even before its formal inclusion in the list of potential tariffs. It had also become the largest buyer of U.S. crude oil outside of Canada, but Kpler, which tracks worldwide oil shipments, shows crude cargoes to China have also dropped off in recent months. It comes at a time when the United States has several large-scale LNG export facilities under construction, and after Trump’s late 2017 trip to China that included executives from U.S. LNG companies. China became the world’s second-biggest LNG importer in 2017, as it buys more gas in order to wean the country off dirty coal to reduce pollution. “This will not affect the trade but will simply make gas more expensive to Chinese consumers,” said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian Inc (TELL.O), one of several companies seeking to build a new LNG export terminal. China, which purchased almost 14 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped between February 2016 and May 2018, has taken delivery from just one vessel that left the United States in June and none so far in July, compared with 17 in the first five months of the year. “The U.S. gas industry will be much harder hit by this as China imports only a small volume whereas U.S. suppliers see China as a major future market,” said Lin Boqiang, professor on energy studies at Xiamen University in China. (For an interactive graphic on U.S. LNG shipments to China, see tmsnrt.rs/2n9bQKn) Meanwhile, according to Kpler, crude exports to China dropped to an estimated 226,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, after reaching a record 445,000 bpd in March. Sinopec, through its Unipec trading arm, is the largest buyer of U.S. crude. China would likely hike purchases from Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq if the tariffs slowed U.S. flows, said Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets division at the International Energy Agency. There will be “others who will be offering barrels to China, so it could find itself able to replace lost volumes from the U.S.,” Atkinson said.  With LNG demand expected to skyrocket over the next 12 to 18 months, there are still some two dozen firms seeking to build new LNG export terminals in the United States and tariffs may limit their ability to secure sufficient buyers to finance their proposed projects. “Cheniere continues to see China as an important growth market and LNG as a ‘win-win’ between the United States and China,” said Eben Burnham-Snyder, a spokesman at Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A), which owns one of the two LNG export terminals currently operating in the United States. He added they do not see tariffs as productive. One project being developed is in Alaska, which would carry natural gas through an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline across the state to a terminal that would convert it to LNG to take it to China.  The $43 billion project is still in development, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corp said on Friday that it believes the “current trade tensions between the United States and China will be resolved well in advance of Alaska LNG exports to China.” Reporting by Scott DiSavino and Aizhu Chen; Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Andres Guerra Luz in New York, Collin Eaton in Houston, Yereth Rosen in Anchorage, and Josephine Mason in Beijing; Writing by David Gaffen; Editing by Chris Reese and Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trade-china-energy/update-2-china-tariffs-on-lng-oil-aim-at-u-s-energy-dominance-agenda-idUKL1N1UU19C,03 Aug 2018,"China's proposed tariffs

2018-08-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks around the world advanced on Friday on strong earnings, with consumer staples results boosting Wall Street, though a trade spat between the United States and China along with weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs numbers capped gains and weighed on the dollar. U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July as employment in transportation and utilities fell, but analysts said the numbers didn’t change their expectations for a September interest rate hike. “With wages and salaries up 2.7 percent, which is consistent with the 2.9 percent annual increase we saw for private sector workers in the June employment cost index report released earlier this week, a third rate hike in September is all but certain,” said Heidi Learner, chief economist at Savills Studley in New York. Market participants were still focussed on an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China, which proposed new tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI has risen 136.42 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,462.58, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 13.13 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,840.35 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 9.33 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,812.02. The S&P consumer staples sector .SPLRCS rose 1.2 percent. Its advance was led by Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), up 8.6 percent after the packaged foods company topped quarterly profit and revenue estimates. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted gains, while the Dow was roughly flat. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.35 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.67 percent.  According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Following news of China’s retaliatory tariffs and the U.S. jobs data, yields on 7-year U.S. Treasury notes led a fall in U.S. government bond yields across maturities.  Italy’s bonds had a volatile day, with yields soaring to eight-week highs early in the day over political tensions, then falling back by the close.  Meanwhile, the Turkish lira TRY= hit a record low of 5.1125 against the U.S. dollar after U.S. sanctions on two Turkish ministers, in a dispute over the trial of a U.S. pastor accused of backing terrorism in Turkey.  Friday’s 0.2 percent decline was part of a more than 4 percent slide this week that took the year to date devaluation of the currency to over 25 percent year-to-date versus the greenback.  Win Thin, global head of Emerging Market Currency Strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said the Turkish central bank would need to send a strong message to support the lira in the form of a rate hike of over 700 basis points to 25 percent. “The longer they wait to respond the harder it is,” Thin said. The U.S. dollar slipped against the yuan after the Chinese central bank raised the forward reserve requirement for foreign exchange in a bid to stabilise its currency. The dollar was 0.52 percent lower against the offshore yuan CNH=. “Traders playing chicken against the People’s Bank of China got hit by a truck this morning,” said Karl Schamotta, a strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. currency.  The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was flat on the day at 95.148, after dipping as low as 94.98. The index was up 0.5 percent for the week.   Gold rallied 1 percent, after falling to the lowest in nearly 17 months, when the U.S. jobs data pushed the dollar lower and Chinese currency lifted.   Oil prices edged lower after Thursday’s rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline after a surprise rise in the latest week.

2018-08-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude futures pulled back on Friday, giving up gains from the previous session as trade concerns weighed on the market and fuelled concerns about demand.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled down 47 cents at $68.49 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $73.21 per barrel, down 24 cents from their last close.   Both grades briefly traded down more than $1 a barrel. U.S. crude ended the week down 0.4 percent, while Brent has fallen 1.5 percent in the week so far. “It’s a jittery feel here, as long as we have Iranian sanctions uncertainty and tariff uncertainty, and it doesn’t take much to spark a significant swing one way or the other,” said Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst in Galena, Illinois. Fears that Chinese demand could taper fuelled the pullback on Friday after state oil major Sinopec cut its purchases of U.S. crude. China’s Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, has suspended crude oil imports from the United States due to the growing trade spat between Washington and Beijing, three sources familiar with the situation said on Friday. “Chinese demand from the independent refiners is also lower while the escalating trade war also doesn’t help sentiment,” said Warren Patterson, commodities strategist at ING.  China has said it plans to impose tariffs on liquefied natural gas, raising concerns that it could also impose tariffs on oil, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose in July, but the U.S. trade deficit recorded its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years in June as the boost to exports from soybean shipments faded and higher oil prices lifted the import bill.  The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap surged 7.3 percent to $46.3 billion. Russian oil output rose by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July from a month earlier to 11.21 million bpd, energy ministry data showed on Thursday. Output by top exporter Saudi Arabia has also risen recently, to around 11 million bpd, and U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA is around that level as well.  Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased production to help to compensate for an anticipated shortfall in Iranian crude supplies once planned U.S. sanctions take effect later this year. But a complete halt to Iranian supplies looks unlikely with Bloomberg reporting on Friday that China, Iran’s biggest customer, has rejected a U.S. request to cut imports from the OPEC member. Low U.S. stockpiles were still providing a floor for prices, with overall U.S. crude inventories below the five-year average of around 420 million barrels. But there were concerns about potential stockpile builds as supply returns from a Canadian production facility that has been shuttered. U.S. drillers cut rigs for the second week in three, reducing the number of oil rigs by two to 859. The rig count can be a forward-looking indicator of production. [RIG/U] Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish U.S. crude bets in the latest week, as oil prices were range-bound, pinned between concerns about tight supply due to sanctions and fears that trade disputes could curb demand. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 5,287 contracts to 407,001 during the week ending July 31, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.

2018-08-03,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Friday began a census of car owners, a move the socialist government says will help determine a “rational” use of fuel but critics warn could lead to rationing in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation. Fuel shortages are already frequent in Venezuela, where a fifth straight year of a brutal recession has led to refinery outages and steep falls in oil production.  President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend said Venezuela needed “rational” gas use and that a census was “the answer to that.” One top party official also proposed increasing the price of highly subsidized fuel, the world’s cheapest. Details of the government’s plans are scarce and the Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but Venezuelans have fretted that the census could be setting the stage for more restrictive gasoline sales. “I am registering myself because I am scared that if I am not in the census, they will not sell gasoline to me,” said taxi driver Juan Suarez, 45, who had spent six hours in line in downtown Caracas on Friday. He and others in the line said they also hoped that being registered could grant them access to cheaper gas.     But dozens of truck drivers blocked streets in Caracas to reject the census they say will not solve chronic shortages that have decimated the number of functioning buses, forcing many poor Venezuelans to rely on precarious flatbed trucks to get around.  “We have not received the tires and lubricants we need to be able to work. The problems of transport workers will not be solved with this census,” said Jose Luis Trocel, the head of the main transport workers union, as he drove toward the Transport Ministry to stage the protest. Under the census, car owners had to use a government-issued “fatherland card” to register details of their vehicle and gasoline consumption online. They then had to line up at government offices to scan the card.  Venezuelans who do not have the card cannot participate. Anti-Maduro politicians say that marginalises government opponents who have refused to get the card the government now uses in distribution of everything from food to bonuses. “They ruined Venezuela. They destroyed (state oil company) PDVSA and now they are trying to ration fuel sales through the fatherland card in the country with the biggest oil reserves of the Western Hemisphere. Say no to this blackmail,” tweeted opposition lawmaker and economist Jose Guerra.

PGNiG has to buy certain amounts of gas annually from Russia under a long-term deal with Russia’s Gazprom, which expires in 2022 and which Warsaw has said will not be renewed. In the first seven months of this year, PGNiG’s imports from Gazprom rose by 6 percent, it said, but the Russian share of PGNiG’s total gas imports fell by 2 percentage points from a year earlier to 75 percent.

2018-08-03,"(Adds rig count in the Permian basin) Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months with recent declines in crude prices. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 3, bringing the total count down to 859, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there held steady at 479 for a second week in a row, the same as in early June and the highest since January 2015. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 765 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. U.S. crude prices were on track to fall for a fifth week in a row on worries the U.S.-China trade dispute could cut oil demand. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.23 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $67 for the balance of 2018 and over $64 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 15 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $83.6 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.8 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,032 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. That compares with their forecast last week of 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,044 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,010. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $67 for the balance of 2018 and over $64 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies they track have provided guidance indicating a 15 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said those E&Ps expect to spend a total of $83.6 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.8 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast average total oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,032 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. That compares with their forecast last week of 1,033 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,044 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,010. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-08-03,"NEW YORK/BEIJING, Aug 3 (Reuters) - China’s targeting of U.S. liquefied natural gas and crude oil exports opens a new front in the trade war between the two countries, at a time when the White House is trumpeting growing U.S. energy export prowess. China included LNG for the first time in its list of proposed tariffs on Friday, the same day that its biggest U.S. crude oil buyer, Sinopec, suspended U.S. crude oil imports due to the dispute, according to three sources familiar with the situation. On Friday, China announced retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, and warned of further measures, signaling it will not back down in a protracted trade war with Washington. That could cast a shadow over President Donald Trump’s energy dominance ambitions. The administration has repeatedly said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to global allies, while Washington is rolling back domestic regulations to encourage more oil and gas production. “The juxtaposition here is clear: it is hard to become an energy superpower when one of the biggest energy consumers in the world is raising barriers to consume that energy. It makes it very difficult,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at Barclays. The U.S. is the world’s largest exporter of fuels like gasoline and diesel, and is poised to become one of the largest exporters of LNG by 2019. China is the world’s biggest crude oil importer. China had curtailed its imports of U.S. LNG over the last two months, even before its formal inclusion in the list of potential tariffs. It had also become the largest buyer of U.S. crude oil outside of Canada, but Kpler, which tracks worldwide oil shipments, shows crude cargoes to China have also dropped off in recent months. It comes at a time when the United States has several large-scale LNG export facilities under construction, and after Trump’s late 2017 trip to China that included executives from U.S. LNG companies. “The U.S. gas industry will be much harder-hit by this as China imports only a small volume whereas U.S. suppliers see China as a major future market,” said Lin Boqiang, professor on energy studies at Xiamen University in China. China became the world’s second biggest LNG importer in 2017, as it buys more gas in order to wean the country off dirty coal to reduce pollution. China, which purchased almost 14 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped between February 2016 and May 2018, has taken delivery from just one vessel that left the United States in June and none so far in July, compared with 17 during the first five months of the year. (For an interactive graphic on U.S. LNG shipments to China, see tmsnrt.rs/2n9bQKn) Meanwhile, according to Kpler, crude exports to China dropped to an estimated 226,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July, after reaching a record 445,000 bpd in March. Sinopec, through its Unipec trading arm, is the largest buyer of U.S. crude. With LNG demand expected to skyrocket over the next 12 to 18 months, there are still some two dozen firms seeking to build new LNG export terminals in the United States and tariffs may limit their ability to secure sufficient buyers to finance their proposed projects. U.S. LNG “producers will try to move to other locations,” said Dominick Chirichella, director of risk management, trading and advisory services at EMI DTN in New York, noting there will likely be a “big push” to places like Europe and Japan. “It’s tough to say whether that would offset the loss of LNG from China, so until producers get reorganized, it could slow down some of the exports,” he said.

2018-08-03,"ODESSA, TEXAS (Reuters) - Job fairs are stocked with people hungry for better opportunities, but inside the MCM Grande Hotel in Odessa, Texas, oil services giant Halliburton is the one doing the wooing.  “We need to hire you is our message,” said Chris Redman, a field services manager with Summit ESP, which Halliburton acquired last year.  More than 500 men and women flocked to the hotel in Odessa, Texas, on a Thursday last month to be courted by Halliburton, which needs people to handle everything from oilfield technicians to truck drivers, as oil production booms and qualified workers become more scarce. The U.S. unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, just off an 18-year low, but job growth has slowed more recently - notably because companies are having trouble finding people. That is particularly true in the oilfields of West Texas, where workers from local towns like Midland and Odessa have flocked to the oil industry for higher pay. According to a June Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey of 60 oil executives operating in West Texas, more than half cited difficulty finding workers as a potential drag on growth.          Halliburton, the second largest provider of oilfield services after Schlumberger, is adding more than 175 jobs a month, hiring executives say. Redman said people with commercial drivers’ licenses are in particular demand, but numerous attendees at the jobs fair do not have that license.  Janice Venables, 57, drove out to West Texas from Mississippi a month ago, after being laid off from Mississippi Power last year. She is applying for two jobs with Halliburton, but says she has applied for as many as 26 other oilfield jobs.  “I don’t care where I go. I just need a job, and I’ve heard the wages are good,” said Venables. She lives in a recreational vehicle with her dog and cat, does not have a commercial driver’s license, but has started the process to enroll in a commercial driving class this fall. Kenneth McGowan, 21, drove 12 hours from Mississippi with five friends, some just above the legal age to work for Halliburton, to apply for oilfield jobs.  Like many in attendance, they heard about the fair through a Facebook advertisement. McGowan, who works as a stocker at a Walmart, hopes to find a job providing cementing services for wells. “I’m not worried about the long hours,” said McGowan, who is supporting a 3-year-old daughter. He does not have a commercial driver’s license, but said he is prepared to get one if needed. McGowan and his friends are not the only job hopefuls to make the trek from Mississippi, where employment in June was 4.7 percent, one of the highest levels in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The rush to apply for commercial drivers’ licenses comes as demand for truck drivers, in the oil industry and elsewhere, has driven up wages for anyone with the license. Frank Hardin of Tennessee, who previously drove trucks delivering sand with Amerifield Inc, said he recently landed a job as a driver CIG Logistics.  Instead of getting paid per load delivered, he now has a salaried position with CIG, which starts workers at as much as $85,000 with full benefits. Hardin welcomes the change. “That’s what everyone wants. It’s a cakewalk for guys who’ve been on the road for years,” he said.

2018-08-03,"(Adds open of U.S. markets, changes dateline to New York from London) * Yields slip as trade tensions ramp up, job growth slows * Dollar dips vs yuan on China central bank move * Wall Street flat on tepid jobs data, trade fears * Yuan gains after central bank says will keep it stable By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world edged higher on Friday on robust earnings, with consumer staples results boosting Wall Street, though a trade spat between the U.S. and China and tepid U.S. jobs numbers capped gains and weighed down the dollar. U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July as employment in transportation and utilities fell, but analysts said the numbers didn’t change their expectations for a September interest rate hike. “The jobs report doesn’t change the strength of the job market, it’s just disappointing this time,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Market participants were still fixed on an escalating trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which proposed new tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods. “The trade war fears are probably going to overshadow the jobs report,” Cardillo said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 52.93 points, or 0.21 percent, to 25,379.09, the S&P 500 gained 4.43 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,831.65 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.84 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,795.85. The S&P consumer staples sector rose 0.8 percent and led the gains among major S&P sectors, after getting a boost from Kraft Heinz Co earnings. Kraft Heinz jumped 5.7 percent after beating profit and revenue estimates. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.59 percent. While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.22 percent. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Following news of China’s retaliatory tariffs and the U.S. jobs data, yields on 7-year notes led the fall in U.S. government bond yields across maturities. The 5-, 7- and 10-year note yields all fell more than 2 basis points in midmorning trade, with the 7-year yield down 2.5 basis points from late Thursday to 2.910 percent. The benchmark 10-year note yield was last at 2.964 percent, down 2.2 basis points from a day earlier. In currencies, the U.S. dollar slipped against the yuan after the Chinese central bank raised the forward reserve requirement for foreign exchange in a bid to stabilize its currency. The dollar was 0.53 percent lower against the offshore yuan. “Traders playing chicken against the People’s Bank of China got hit by a truck this morning,” said Karl Schamotta, a strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto. currency. The greenback also came under pressure against a basket of peers after data showed U.S. job growth slowed in July. The euro, which earlier hit its lowest since the end of June, reversed course to trade 0.06 percent higher as the dollar retreated. Oil prices edged lower after the previous day’s rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week.

2018-08-03,"(Adds CEO quote, details) By Marta Nogueira and Alexandra Alper RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA reported a larger-than-expected jump in quarterly net profit, helped by rising oil prices and diesel subsidies that allowed it to boost its market share, the state-controlled oil company said on Friday. Petrobras, as the company is known, posted a net profit of 10.072 billion reais ($2.69 billion) in the second quarter, soaring from a profit of 360 million reais in the same period a year earlier, when it was hit by a one-time tax-related charge. The company had been expected to earn $1.505 billion in the second quarter of 2018, according to analysts’ estimates. Petrobras shares gained more than 5 percent, advancing to their highest level since May 23 when its former chief executive officer, Pedro Parente, voluntarily cut diesel prices in a bid to defuse a nationwide truckers’ protest over rising fuel costs that paralyzed Latin America’s top economy. The truckers stayed off the job until President Michel Temer’s government agreed to sweeping moves to cut diesel prices through tax reductions and subsidies for Petrobras and other fuel vendors. That sparked fears of renewed political meddling at the state-run company and helped drive Parente to resign. The government-imposed diesel subsidy plan so far has hurt Petrobras competitors that rely on fuel imports more than the state-controlled company, which can refine its own domestically drilled oil. Petrobras boosted its diesel market share to 87 percent in June from 77 percent in March. Utilization rates at Petrobras refineries also rose to 81 percent in June from 72 percent in March. “Companies joined the subsidy program and what happened was a big reduction in the volume of (diesel) imports and a small increase in Petrobras’ market share, but I think that is going back to normal,” Petrobras CEO Ivan Monteiro said on Friday. Monteiro, formerly the company’s chief financial officer, expressed confidence that Petrobras would be reimbursed for the price controls, describing the government’s delay in providing compensation as “natural.” The second-quarter results show the company expects to receive 590 million reais. XP Investimentos analyst Gabriel Francisco said the results were positive and praised the company’s cash generation in the second quarter but noted that “not all of its revenues booked came in as cash flow, given that the company still hasn’t received diesel subsidies.” The oil company, the world’s most indebted, said net debt rose to 284.027 billion reais from 270.712 billion reais, even as it fell in dollar terms. The net debt to EBITDA ratio narrowed to 3.23 from 3.52. The company reiterated that it is still aiming to get that measure down to 2.5 by the end of the year and to meet a target of $21 billion in divestments from 2017 to 2018. A court decision halting privatization of state company assets without congressional approval, ahead of presidential elections in October, means the company may struggle to meet its target. However, Petrobras executives said on Friday the company had received $5 billion from divestments in the first half of the year and expects to receive another $2 billion this year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, rose to 30.067 billion reais, from 19.094 billion reais in the same period last year. Results were supercharged by a pickup in oil prices to around $70 per barrel, helping revenue rise to 84.395 billion reais ($22.51 billion), from 66.996 billion reais in the same period last year, when oil traded at well below $60 a barrel.

2018-08-03,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas producer EOG Resources (EOG.N) on Friday said Delaware Basin completions will make up a smaller percentage of its overall hydraulic fracturing work in late 2018, a signal that pipeline constraints may continue to choke growth in the largest U.S. shale play. Activity in the Permian Basin, which includes the Delaware, has outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity in recent months as U.S. oil production has hit record highs. The pipeline constraints have pushed down the price of local oil and prompted some companies to reallocate resources to other basins. EOG said Delaware completions made up about 40 percent of its total hydraulic fracturing work during the first half of the year, but expected that to decline to 30 percent in the second half of 2018. Conversely, the company expects completions in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, North Dakota’s Bakken, and Colorado’s DJ basin to climb from 10 percent to 20 percent of its total hydraulic fracturing work in the second half. Noble Energy (NBL.N) on Friday said it would slow Permian hydraulic fracturing completions during the second half of the year, shifting more resources to the DJ basin.  Shares of EOG were down about 3.2 percent at $121.92 at 11:48 a.m. eastern (1548 GMT). EOG this week said it was expanding its presence in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, tapping into the Mowry and Niobrara resource plays, in addition to the Turner formation. That basin is now the company’s third largest asset.  The company said it is designing a gas gathering and compression system to facilitate takeaway away from the Powder River Basin. EOG is also evaluating opportunities to move crude from the Powder River Basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast, executives told analysts during the company’s quarterly earnings call.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) this week also said it was growing its footprint in the Powder River Basin.

2018-08-03,"PARIS, Aug 3 (Reuters) - The heatwave across France has forced French utility EDF to reduce or cut nuclear electricity generation at four reactors, power grid operator RTE said on Friday. EDF, which operates the 58 nuclear reactors that cover around 75 percent of France’s electricity needs, extended outages at the 900 megawatt (MW) Bugey 2 and St. Alban 1 nuclear reactors until Aug. 11. Production was reduced by 665 MW at the 900 MW Bugey 3, and by 300 MW at its 900 MW Fessenheim 2 reactor. EDF said on Wednesday said that forecasts of high temperatures in the Rhone River could lead to the shutdown from Aug. 3 of four nuclear reactors which depend on its waters for cooling: Bugey 2 and 3, St Alban 1 and 2. The utility discharges water it uses as coolant for the reactors into surrounding rivers and canals. The quantity and temperature of the water it discharges is regulated by law to protect plant and animal life, forcing EDF to cut output during prolonged hot weather when river temperatures rise. On Friday, water temperature rose to over 26 degrees Celsius (78.8°F) upstream the Rhine River where Fessenheim is located. On the Rhone, the water temperature was also at 26 degrees, according to Thomson Reuters data. Hot air from North Africa’s Sahara has caused the most severe heatwave in Europe since 2003.

2018-08-03,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.290 million barrels per day of crude in July, two OPEC sources said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from a month earlier. The amount of oil supplied to the market in July was slightly higher at 10.380 million bpd, the sources said. Supply to the market - domestically and for export - may differ from production depending on the movement of barrels in and out of storage. Saudi Arabia told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that the kingdom pumped 10.488 million bpd of crude oil in June, an increase of 458,000 bpd from the production figure it submitted for May.  However, crude supply to the market in June was higher than wellhead production at 10.579 million bpd, a figure that includes domestic consumption and all exports, including from storage tanks. OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost. OPEC and the non-OPEC producers said they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. That would mean a roughly 1 million bpd increase in output. Brent oil futures steadied on Friday as the market focused on bearish longer-term factors after gains in the previous session, which were driven by U.S. crude inventories at a major hub falling to their lowest in nearly four years.

2018-08-03,"(Recasts lead, adds analyst comment, background) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Canadian exports hit a record high in June, cutting the country’s trade deficit to its lowest in 17 months, although U.S. metals tariffs slashed shipments of steel, Statistics Canada said on Friday. The June deficit of C$626 million ($482 million) - the lowest since the C$485 shortfall recorded in January 2017 - was far smaller than the C$2.30 billion predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll. The cheery data obscured a 36.8 percent drop in steel exports to the United States after President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff at the end of May. Canada is the largest single supplier of steel to the United States, where some companies are complaining about increased prices. The unexpectedly strong overall performance boosted market expectations that the Bank of Canada could hike interest rates next month. The central bank has raised rates four times since the middle of last year as the economy has strengthened. Exports jumped by 4.1 percent from May to C$50.70 billion on higher shipments of energy products and aircraft, in particular business jets. The advance was the greatest since a 4.8 percent leap seen in November 2016. Second-quarter exports rose by 6.0 percent from the first, the greatest such gain in 10 years. In volume terms, exports grew 2.1 percent. “The data will have markets adding a bit of weight to the odds for a September hike, or at a minimum, gaining even more confidence about one in October,” said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Economics. The Bank of Canada - which announces its next rate decision on Sept 5 - has expressed concern about the potential damage from a trade war with the United States. The value of steel shipments fell to C$536.8 million in June from May while exports of aluminum to the United States, subject to a 10 percent tariff, dropped 7.0 percent to C$851.2 million. Unlike the overall data, the figures for steel and aluminum were not adjusted for seasonality. Exports of both metals had risen significantly in the months leading up to the tariffs as industries stockpiled supplies. Analysts, who say the damage will be much greater if Trump goes ahead with a threat to impose tariffs on autos, did not appear too worried on Friday. “The fact that we can have such a strong print with the metals tariffs dragging on things illustrates they are going to have a marginal impact on the Canadian economy,” said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. The Canadian dollar was little changed at C$1.3001, or 76.92 U.S. cents. Imports fell 0.2 percent on lower volumes of energy products. A number of Canadian refineries that had been shut down in April and May resumed production in June, cutting the demand for foreign gasoline and diesel fuel. The data underscored the importance to Canada of the United States, which took 73.0 percent of all Canadian goods exports in June. Exports rose 2.5 percent to a new record while imports edged up 0.3 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States grew to C$4.12 billion in June from C$3.33 billion in May.

2018-08-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s biggest full-service carrier Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) has told its pilots the airline may be grounded in 60 days unless cost-cutting measures including pay cuts are put in place, a senior company executive told Reuters on Friday. Pilots who have refused a proposed 15 percent pay cut for two years had been informed that the airline was running out of time to slash costs and raise revenue, the source said.  The company was looking at sales and distribution, payroll, maintenance and other areas for savings to create a “healthier and a more resilient business”, a company spokesman said in a statement. Management was in talks with all stakeholders, he added, without giving further details. Jet Airways is looking for working capital loans but banks want the airline to show a turnaround commitment, the source said, adding that salary reduction was part of the same issue. “There are some job losses across verticals but not among pilots,” the source added, declining to be named as the talks with staff were private. Shares of Jet Airways were down 4.2 percent at 0600 GMT while the broader market .BSESN was 0.7 pct higher.  Surging fuel prices and a weaker rupee are hurting Indian airlines, with the country’s leading carrier IndiGo reporting a 97 percent plunge in profit on Monday. Jet Airways agreed last month to purchase 75 Boeing Co (BA.N) 737 MAX aircraft to meet domestic passenger demand, taking its total order for the wide-body planes to 225. The airline said the planes would enhance efficiency and lower costs, a move that is likely to reduce losses and improve competitiveness. The company, part owned by Etihad Airways, had net debt of 81.5 billion rupees (£910.85 million) as of end-March with the bulk of it being U.S. dollar denominated.  Jet Airways in July 2017 asked dozens of junior pilots to take 30-50 percent salary and stipend cuts or quit, sources had told Reuters.

Cash-strapped Eskom was forced to cave in to union demands for higher pay after protesting workers forced some generating units to be switched off, leading to power outages in Africa’s most industrialised economy last month and again this week. Securing an Eskom wage deal would help soothe local markets rattled by other developments including a push by the ruling African National Congress to change the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. Eskom initially refused to raise salaries as part of a cost-cutting drive aimed at reversing a steep financial decline, exacerbated by corruption scandals under previous management. Eskom is critical to South Africa because it generates more than 90 percent of the country’s power. The Solidarity union said on Thursday it had accepted a salary increase of 7.5 percent this year and 7 percent next year and the year after, plus an inflation-linked increase in housing allowances and a one-off cash payment of 5,000 rand ($370). A source told Reuters on Friday that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) was discussing a deal with its members. A draft agreement seen by Reuters showed an offer of a 10,000-rand one-off payment to satisfy its demands for annual bonuses. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) said it had sent Eskom’s latest offer to its members, without giving details about what it entailed. “We’ve arranged different meetings at different plants all over the country over the next few days to discuss the proposal in detail with our members,” NUMSA said in a statement. Eskom said trade unions had committed to assist with normalising its operations but that there was a high risk of power outages over the next 30 days as the company worked to bring all its generating units back online. The firm’s efforts to secure funding for a turnaround plan received a boost this week, when it sold its first dollar bonds since 2015. Eskom sold a $1 billion government-guaranteed bond at par to yield 6.35 percent, and a $500 million non-guaranteed bond at par to yield 8.45 percent. Overall demand for the 10-year bonds was $5.3 billion. Reuters reported on Tuesday that 15 units were down at nine Eskom stations, with 11 going offline on Monday and Tuesday because of factors related to protests and a wildcat strike by some workers, according to an internal document. “Employees are encouraged to report back to work,” Eskom said in a statement. “The parties will formally sign the agreement on Aug. 8, after engaging their members, as discussed during the mediation process.” $1 = 13.3519 rand

2018-08-03,"(Reuters) - Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) (ENB.N) said on Friday it had completed 40 percent of replacement work on its massive Line 3 pipeline and reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit by reining in costs. Canada’s largest pipeline operator won a key approval in June to replace the 1,031-mile (1,660-km) long pipeline, which began service in 1968 and operates at half its capacity.  A replacement would allow the pipeline, which runs from Alberta in western Canada to Wisconsin in the United States, to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day.  The company also reaffirmed that Line 3 is expected to be in service in the second half of 2019. Shares of the Calgary-based company were up about 2 percent in New York, while they rose 1 percent in Toronto.   “With that project moving forward, we have higher confidence in the company’s growth outlook for cash flow and dividends,” said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland. Western Canadian oil producers have pinned their hopes on the pipeline seen as crucial for ramping up crude supplies. Like TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO), which has been trying to build its Keystone XL oil pipeline project linking Canada’s oil sands to U.S. refineries, Enbridge has faced criticism from green groups.  Enbridge said it transported 2.64 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States during the quarter, up from 2.45 million bpd in the year-ago quarter.     Net income attributable to common shareholders rose to C$1.07 billion ($822.4 million), or 63 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from C$919 million, or 56 Canadian cents per share.

2018-08-03,"PEDERNEIRAS, Brazil, Aug 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - “ Tiete river, I count on you for a lifetime” - stirring words from the anthem of Pederneiras city that show the near-sacred status of a waterway that helps power Brazil’s entire economy. Be it generating electricity or transporting crops, the river is key. But acute water shortages have sparked a dispute over who has more right to exploit it - and experts say the government must tackle the issue as shortages grow ever worse. Water scarcity is a “new regular scenario, not an emergency”, Munir Soares, an energy expert at research institute Instituto de Energia e Meio Ambiente (IEMA), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One of Brazil’s key transport corridors for soybeans, corn, fertiliser and other farm products, it was closed for 20 months between 2014-2016 due to drought and the diversion of water for electricity, with an estimated loss of $270 million to shipping companies and 1,600 jobs. As the waterway in the state of Sao Paulo - engine of the nation’s economy - threatens to close again due to erratic rainfall, experts have urged policymakers to define more clearly who can exploit the river, and when. Agriculture and agribusiness accounted for about a quarter of Brazil’s gross domestic product in 2017, according to farm lobby CNA. The country is the third biggest electricity producer in the Americas, according to the Energy Information Administration. Yet despite the existence of a national policy regulating the use of water resources, there is a “grey zone” that triggers conflict between transport and energy companies, said Soares. The law does not clearly define who should enjoy priority access to the river, which is rich in rapids and punctuated by steep falls, in times of water scarcity, he added. In cases of erratic rainfall, national grid operator ONS requests more water from the river to power hydroelectric dams located nearby - which can prevent barge trains from passing down the waterway, Soares explained. If the river is to be used primarily for electricity in times of water scarcity, that needs to be made clear by regulators and shipping companies must have other alternatives if they are grounded, Soares said. “If transportation companies cannot honour their contracts, they will have problems.” Adalberto Tokarski, head of Brazilian government agency Antaq, said transportation companies had filed lawsuits over the 2014-2016 costly waterway closure. “The law is very clear but it is not respected due to the power of interference of the electric sector. The law does not give supremacy to the electric sector. It guarantees the multiple uses of water and there has to be a balance,” Tokarski said. Competition over use of the Tiete-Parana waterway goes back over a decade, when the country faced an electrical crisis due to low rainfall and the waterway was almost closed. In 2014, water that could have helped maintain Tiete-Parana’s levels was used instead for electricity due to rising energy demand and the delay of giant new power projects. In 2014, Brazil was also hosting the World Cup. Sao Paulo, South America’s largest city, came critically close to running out of drinking water. Lower river levels force barge trains to reduce the amount of exports they carry on the waterway, or even prevent them from using the corridor completely, said Raimundo Holanda, head of the National Federation of Waterway Navigation Companies (Fenavega). In 2017, the Tiete-Parana waterway transported a record high of 8.91 million tons of cargo, compared to 6.3 million in 2013, the waterway department of Sao Paulo state said by email. But that may change if the river’s water is again used to power hydroelectric dams - in a country that sources about two-thirds of its energy from hydropower, said Tokarski. The decision to close the waterway lies with national water agency ANA. In 2017, ANA launched a “crisis room” once shortages were underway, gathering ONS, Antaq and transport representatives to assess navigation conditions and the water levels of dams. Located about 200 miles from Sao Paulo, Pederneiras is a strategic waterway hub where cargo is transferred to trains and onward to international markets, said Holanda. “The Tiete river is not just a river,” said Vicente Minguili, mayor of the city known as the “waterway capital”. “The waterway is very important to generate jobs and attract private investments,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Alan de Moura Lima, a former logistics officer, is one of hundreds of workers who lost their jobs when the Tiete-Parana waterway closed in 2014-2016. “It was tough. A good part of my professional life I spent on this waterway,” Lima said by a railway over the Tiete river. “Every year there is a threat to close the waterway. I did not want to come back because of all this uncertainty.” Conflicts over ownership of rivers also rage in the Amazon, where big dams were built in recent years, triggering complaints from transportation companies about the effect on water levels. In Porto Velho, capital of the state of Rondonia, navigation firms and energy companies exploiting the Santo Antonio dam - one of Brazil’s biggest - clash over the Madeira river. Leudo Buriti, head of the Society of Ports and Waterways of the state of Rondonia (SOPH), complains about sharp changes in water levels that disrupt navigation - something he says did not happen before the dam was built. In an emailed statement, energy company Santo Antonio Energia said the dam does not affect levels because the river flow it receives is immediately discharged. ""The changes that occur in the flow of the Madeira river are due to the melting of the Andes and periods of intense rains at the head of the river,"" the company said.

2018-08-03,"LOZENETZ, Bulgaria, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Bulgaria opened a new looping section of its transit gas pipeline to Turkey on Friday, expanding its capacity and adding the possibility of two-way flows as the Balkan country bids to transport Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to Europe. The new 20-km looping link in southeastern Bulgaria will boost the Transbalkan pipeline’s capacity to 15.7 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas per year from its current 14 bcm, and will help increase security of gas supplies, officials said. “Now we have constructed a pipeline that will allow for reversible flows, so we can get gas from Turkey, from Azerbaijan and Russia,” Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said at the official ceremony, which was also attended by Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez. Sofia has also launched a tender for an 11 km pipeline to provide a higher capacity link between the new looping section and the Turkish border. The process has been put on hold however, as one Bulgarian company is appealing the tender conditions. At present Russia’s Gazprom ships about 13 bcm of gas through Ukraine and Bulgaria to Turkey. The shipments however may cease next year, when Moscow expects the first line of TurkStream to become operational. Turkstream is part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, currently the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe, and strengthen its position in the European gas market. It consists of two lines with an annual capacity of 15.7 bcm each that will run under the Black Sea to Turkey. The first line, already completed, will be used for local consumption. The second line is planned to run through Turkey to southeastern and central Europe. Bulgaria has said it wants to serve as an entry point to Europe, but Russia is yet to decide whether that pipeline will ship gas via Bulgaria or Greece. Sofia hopes to reach an agreement with Moscow, Ankara and Brussels that some of the Russian gas from TurkStream can be transported through Bulgaria to Serbia, Hungary and Austria, while part of it can be traded at its planned gas hub.

Italy’s bonds sold off for a second straight day and stocks in Italian banks also fell on signs of renewed government tensions in Rome. After hitting a three-week high, the dollar retreated into negative territory, while the Chinese yuan jumped after China’s central bank said it would keep the currency “basically stable”. The bank also said it would take counter-cyclical measures to keep foreign exchange markets stable based on market conditions. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up by 0.1 percent after the start of European trading, and set to break a four-week streak of gains. While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent, though it was down over half a percent on the week. The trade row between the world’s top two economies intensified midweek after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent U.S. tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing vowed to retaliate. Investors were also cautious before the July U.S. jobs report due later in the day. This will give a reading on the health of the world’s largest economy, now in its second-longest expansion on record. Economists polled by Reuters expect 190,000 jobs were created in July. Futures indicated a higher open on Wall Street. “The stock market trend continues to be characterized by a struggle between trade war distress, growth risks and strong corporate Q2 reports,” SEB strategists wrote in a note to clients. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. The euro, which hit its lowest since the end of June earlier in the day, reversed course to trade 0.1 percent higher as the dollar retreated. Elsewhere in currencies, Britain’s pound reversed course from two-week lows to turn higher on the day. It had earlier fallen after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said there was an “uncomfortably high” risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal. The BoE raised interest rates from crisis-era lows this week but that failed to boost the pound as the British central bank also signalled it was in no rush to tighten policy further. Italian two-year and five-year government bond yields rose about 22 to 25 basis points to 1.27 percent and 2.32 percent in early trade, hitting their highest levels since early June. Italian bank stocks fell 0.8 percent, set for their worst week since early June. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is under pressure from within the government to raise spending and challenge European Union budget rules. The possibility that he might be forced to resign has investors worried that Italy could go on a spending binge, or even that fresh elections could follow. That in turn could strengthen the hand of the eurosceptic League party and its leader, Matteo Salvini. “Clearly, this is about the fear that Tria gets kicked out, which could lead to a collapse of the government, new elections, and the League gaining even further,” said Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger. “Or it may mean that they agree on a budget that’s at odds with the EU,” he said, adding that this would imply heavier borrowing and greater bond supply. Italy’s two-year and five-year government bond yields rose 25 basis points at one stage to eight-week highs before settling at 1.11 percent and 2.18 percent respectively, higher by about 14 bps each on the day. Oil prices edged lower after the previous day’s rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. Brent crude futures were down 0.04 percent at $73.44 a barrel after surging 1.5 percent on Thursday. Copper on the London Metal Exchange recovered after falling for a third straight session, last trading at $6,217.50 per tonne. With trade tensions hurting demand, the industrial metal was down 2.7 percent for the week. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Abhinav

2018-08-03,"GORKHA, Nepal, Aug 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Krishna Maya Sunar received 10,000 rupees ($91) from a forest protection project in Gorkha in Nepal, it changed her life. That was seven years ago. Until then, she got by selling home-brewed liquor. It did not earn much - about 5,000 rupees a month - and, being illegal, was risky. But having that larger sum, which was given to each member of a community forestry group in Gorkha, which lies about 100 kilometres (62 miles) northwest of the capital Kathmandu, meant Sunar could turn her hand to goat-farming. “If it weren’t for the money, I wouldn’t know how I would be able to survive,” she said. Sunar’s situation is unusual - and not only because she was one of the earliest Nepali recipients of money from a REDD+ project, a U.N.-backed forestry conservation scheme aimed at combatting climate change. It is also because Sunar is a Dalit. In this predominantly Hindu, caste-based society, Dalit people - or “untouchables” - are near the bottom of the rung. They have restricted access to natural resources and are often mired in poverty. And few have benefited as much as other Nepalis from REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation)payments, said Nira Jairu, a Dalit and member of parliament. “The REDD+ funds must reach the Dalit,” she said. The government has pledged to come up with an inclusive plan to ensure that such payments benefit all, including the most marginalized. Sindhu Dhungana heads the REDD Implementation Center, a government body tasked with overseeing the development of Nepal’s REDD strategy and the benefit-sharing plan. He said the government would include the input of people at the local level when preparing and implementing the plan. “Principally ... the benefit-sharing will be fair and equitable in principle and at an operational level,” he said. The government will this year consult with marginalized sectors of society - including Dalit communities - on the benefit-sharing plan, before the proposal heads to parliament for approval, he said. By next year, he added, the country would be able to sign a deal with the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) - a World Bank programme of governments, civil society groups and businesses engaged in REDD+ - that sets the price for the carbon credits. Simply put, Nepal must first show that it can distribute the money it will receive to those involved in sustainably managing its forests before the FCPF will make payments, Dhungana said. “The carbon money ... should be trickled down to local people who have contributed to reducing emissions,” he said. U.N.-backed REDD+ schemes look to cut emissions linked to deforestation, while giving local communities a financial benefit for conserving and managing forests. Sunar’s REDD+ project was part of a pilot programme funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) between 2009 and 2013. Forests act as carbon sinks, storing carbon dioxide - a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Cutting trees means carbon dioxide is released. Many experts say protecting forests is one of the least costly ways to reduce climate change. As part of these programmes, industrialized countries and donors - such as NORAD in Sunar’s case - pay developing countries to manage their forests sustainably. Forest countries then can sell credits for emissions reductions, for instance to companies looking to offset the carbon they emit. Developing countries also need to implement REDD+ safeguards to minimize the damage the programme could have on the livelihoods and cultures of communities that rely on forests, particularly indigenous people. The REDD+ pilot project in Sunar’s district, along with two others funded by NORAD, had provided useful lessons that the government would take on board, Dhungana said, including understanding what the programme entails. It had also shown that benefit-sharing should include social aspects, he said, and not simply look at the carbon impact. Sunar’s community learned how to measure carbon to calculate a baseline, and then - by planting trees, preventing fires and cutting less timber - boost the amount of stored carbon in the 1,888-hectare forested Ludikhola watershed where they live. The Asia Network for Sustainable Agriculture and Bioresources (ANSAB) – Kathmandu, one of the organizations which managed the project, said community groups in Gorkha had received about $26,000 from NORAD in 2011. Those groups were able to show they had increased the amount of stored carbon by nearly 28,500 tons, and that they had met the criteria that members must include Dalits, indigenous people and women. And although they have not received money since 2011, the community still looks after the forest. Manu Paniyan, who is also a Dalit, and who used her 10,000 rupees to buy a sewing machine, is one of the forest guards, known as lauro pulo. Under the lauro pulo system, two persons serve as forest guards for a day, looking out for fires, illegal logging and the theft of other forest resources. As members of the community forestry user group they also devised ways of monitoring the funds, including monthly public hearings to discuss how to use the money, said Bhuraman Ghimire, who chairs one of the community forestry groups in Gorkha. “Before REDD+, these activities were not conducted,” he said. Jiba Nath Paudel, Gorkha’s district forest officer, said the pilot had worked well because the community had taken part in making decisions. “The community forestry groups decide properly based on their social norms. There’s ownership,” he said. Reporting by Purple Romero. Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-08-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s monsoon rains, a crucial element for the country’s farm output, are likely to be below average in 2018, after the country experienced tepid rainfall during the first half of the season. There is a 47 percent chance of India recording below average rainfall during the second half of the monsoon season which stretches between June to September, India’s weather office said in a statement on Friday. For the first two months of the monsoon season, rainfall was below average, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. The monsoon rains could be considered the lifeblood of India’s $2 trillion economy since the farm sector contributes 14 percent of the country’s economic output and employs more than half of its 1.3 billion people. A spell of good rains could keep a lid on inflation by holding down food prices, potentially tempting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring forward general elections due in May 2019. Lower rainfall could add to the woes of those dependent on agriculture for a livelihood. Indian farmers, who have been hitting the streets to protest low income levels, are a crucial vote bank for a poll-bound Modi. There is a 41 percent chance of India experiencing average rainfall, and 12 percent chance of above average rainfall during the second half of the monsoon season, the IMD said. “The rainfall for the country as a whole during the second half of the season is likely to be 95 percent of the long-period average,” the IMD said. Modi has set an ambitious target of doubling farmer’s income by 2022. Farmers have planted summer crops on 73.8 million hectares (182.3 million acres) of land as of July 27, down 7.5 percent from a year ago, the Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare said. India is the world’s biggest producer of cotton and pulses and the second-biggest producer of sugar and rice. The IMD had forecast earlier that India in 2018 would receive rainfall measuring 97 percent of the long-term average. The agency has accurately forecast the monsoon season only once in every five years in the last two decades, even after allowing for a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

The company’s core operating profit for the second quarter rose to 277 million euros (£246.65 million), compared to 236 million a year ago and in line with analysts’ average expectation of 278 million euros in a Reuters poll. But Neste’s shares slid as much as 6.2 percent to become the second biggest faller in the European Stoxx 600 index.  At 1046 GMT, they were 4.8 percent lower. The shares have nearly doubled in value over the past year, helped by its profitable biofuel business and its renewable products division. The fall on Friday was mainly due to the so-called additional margin in the renewable product division disappointing in the second quarter, according to Henri Parkkinen, analyst at OP Equities. In April, Neste upgraded its outlook for the year in that category to “strong” from “good”, but still the additional margin in the renewable product division came in at 112 million euros in the period compared to 114 million in the first three months of the year. Total revenue came in at 3.75 billion euros in the three months, beating analysts’ expectations of 3.39 billion. Neste could benefit from potential excess supply in the vegetable oil market which it uses as feed stock, after China imposed extra import tariffs on U.S. soybeans. “We are seeing a downward trend in the vegetable oil market, partly due to the trade war,” Neste Chief Executive Matti Lievonen said in an interview. Retaliating against U.S. trade barriers, Beijing has imposed a 40 percent import tariff on soybean imports from the United States, creating excess in the soybean market. Soybeans were the United States’ top agricultural export to China in 2017 worth about $12.7 billion. Neste, which also has two conventional oil refineries in Finland, is looking into extending the capacity at its biofuel plant in Singapore. The company is on track to make a final investment decision by the end of 2018, Lievonen said. ($1 = 0.8630 euros) Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen.

2018-08-03,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Unipec, the trading arm of state oil major Sinopec, has suspended crude oil imports from the United States due to a growing trade spat between Washington and Beijing, three sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.  The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.  It is not clear how long the temporary halt will last, but one of the sources said Unipec has no new bookings of U.S. crude until at least October.  Unipec and Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner and biggest buyer of U.S. oil, did not respond to requests for comment.  Chinese buyers had already slowed their purchases of U.S. oil to avoid a likely import tariff threatened by Beijing amid the escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.  Beijing has put U.S. energy products, including crude oil and refined products, on a list of goods it will hit with a 25 percent import tax in retaliation for similar moves by Washington. It has not said when it will impose the tariffs.  Unipec said earlier this year it expects to trade up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. crude oil by the end of the year, about triple its trading volume of U.S. oil last year.  China’s crude oil imports from the United States reached an average of 334,880 bpd in the first eight months of this year, according to trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. The amount of U.S. crude arriving in September is expect to fall to 197,515 bpd, as only three supertankers are en-route to China, the data showed. The absence of China, the largest buyer of U.S. crude after Canada, has partly weighed on U.S. spot crude prices, making them more affordable for other buyers in Asia. Unipec will continue trading U.S. crude, selling the oil to Europe, one of the sources said. Still, it is unlikely to ship any of the oil to the east as it no longer has a backstop for the oil if it cannot find a buyer at the right price during the voyage, said three traders that participate in the market. China’s prohibitive import tariff, which amounts to close to $18 a barrel when crude is at $70, has also deterred other Chinese buyers such as state-owned companies PetroChina, as well as state-controlled Zhenhua Oil and independent refiners, from importing U.S. crude, they said. Meanwhile, a narrower price spread between the Brent and Dubai crude benchmarks has made oil from Europe and Africa that is similar in quality to the U.S. crude more affordable for China.  China’s oil imports from West Africa are set to rebound in August to 1.6 million bpd, the highest since May, according to data on Eikon. Unipec has also bought North Sea Forties and Russian Urals last month for September delivery when the arbitrage opened, trade sources said.

2018-08-03,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI ACWI drifts lower on trade worries * Dollar hits 3-week high * Italian government worries hit bonds, bank stocks * Oil slips * Copper falls for third day By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - World stocks drifted lower on Friday as the latest exchange of trade threats between the United States and China dampened risk appetite, while Italian bonds and shares in the country’s banks sold off on signs of renewed government tensions in Rome. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down by 0.1 percent after the start of European trading, and set to break a four-week streak of gains. While a tech-led rally on Wall Street overnight filtered through to Asian stock markets, gains were capped by the trade tensions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.05 percent, though it was down over half a percent on the week. The trade row between the world’s top two economies intensified midweek after President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent U.S. tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing vowed to retaliate. Investors were also cautious before the July U.S. jobs report due later in the day. This will give a reading on the health of the world’s largest economy, now in its second longest expansion on record. Economists polled by Reuters expect 190,000 jobs were created in July. “The stock market trend continues to be characterized by a struggle between trade war distress, growth risks and strong corporate Q2 reports,” SEB strategists wrote in a note to clients. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar hit its highest in over three weeks, extending sharp gains made the previous day, while the euro fell to its lowest level since the end of June. Investors said the greenback was benefiting from safe haven flows. Italian two-year and five-year government bond yields rose about 22 to 25 basis points to 1.27 percent and 2.32 percent in early trade, hitting their highest levels since early June . Italian bank stocks fell 0.8 percent, set for their worst week since early June. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is under pressure from within the government to raise spending and challenge European Union budget rules. The possibility that he might be forced to resign has investors worried that Italy could go on a spending binge, or even that fresh elections could follow. That in turn could strengthen the hand of the eurosceptic League party and its leader, Matteo Salvini. The two- and five-year bonds have been most sensitive to concern over the chance of an Italian exit from the euro, which would increase default risk on debt coming due soon. “Clearly, this is about the fear that Tria gets kicked out, which could lead to a collapse of the government, new elections, and the League gaining even further,” said Commerzbank strategist Christoph Rieger. “Or it may mean that they agree on a budget that’s at odds with the EU,” he said, adding that this would imply heavier borrowing and greater bond supply. Yields on 10-year bonds also rose, by 9 basis points, to hit 3 percent for the first time since June 11, and the closely watched spread over Germany was at its widest since late June at 257 bps,. With the trade tensions encouraging demand for safe haven assets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield pulled back to 2.9767 percent from a 10-week high above 3 percent brushed midweek. The 10-year Treasury yield had hit the peak partly due to a surge in Japanese government bond yields to 1-1/2-year highs this week as the market tested the Bank of Japan’s rejigged policy framework, under which it now allows yields to fluctuate in a wider band. Oil prices eased back slightly after the previous day’s rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent at $73.17 a barrel after surging 1.5 percent on Thursday. Copper on the London Metal Exchange slipped half a percent to $6,107 per tonne. With trade tensions hurting demand, the industrial metal was down 2.8 percent for the week. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Abhinav

Although Eskom is on a cost-cutting drive as it tries to emerge from a financial crisis, it caved in to union demands for higher pay after protesting workers forced some of its generating units to be switched off, leading to power outages in Africa’s most industrialised economy.

2018-08-03,"MUMBAI/KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Edible oil traders are sourcing exports of palm oil and other cooking oils to India from neighbouring countries, designating the supplies as duty-free under a regional free-trade pact and circumventing India’s import tax hike on the oils. India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among the signatories of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) that created a free-trade zone in the South Asian region. The rising flow of duty-free edible oils is disrupting trade in India, the world’s biggest importer of the oils, and is undermining efforts to raise local oilseed prices, the reason for imposing the taxes. Two palm oil traders confirmed that they have sold palm olein from Bangladesh to India as a duty-free product under the SAFTA. Another Malaysia-based palm trader said shipments of palm-based speciality products like cocoa butter substitute and palm-based ghee from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to India have increased. “Earlier volumes were less but after the recent duty increase, volumes too have increased,” the trader said. “It’s surprising to see now that bulk volumes are coming in,” he said, referring to Indian imports from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. All three traders declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. India raised its import tax on refined palm oil in March to 54 percent to support local farmers. In June, taxes on crude and refined soyoil, sunflower oil and canola oil were raised to 45 percent. Exports of palm oil to Bangladesh from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer after Indonesia, climbed from 3,500 tonnes in May to 36,995 tonnes during July 1 to 25, according to data from surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance. The Malaysian-based trader also estimated that Indonesia’s palm oil exports to Bangladesh in July increased by one-third. Traders had been bringing in edible oils from Bangladesh into neighbouring northeastern India, but now vessels have been booked for western ports, where large refineries are located, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer. Bangladesh is forecast to fulfil 91 percent of its edible oil consumption, including soybean oil and palm oil, during the 2018/19 crop year through imports, Reuters calculated using data from a U.S. Department of Agriculture report, which notes “there is no domestic palm oil production industry in the country.” India’s Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA), an edible oil trade group, and the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) have requested the federal government halt the duty-free imports. The gap between the local soyoil price and duty-free soyoil price is as high as 11,000 rupees ($160.80) per tonne, said Davish Jain, the SOPA chairman. “Imports of large quantities of edible oil at zero duty will totally negate the advantage to the farmers and also affect the industry adversely,” Jain said. The Executive Director of the SEA, B.V. Mehta, noted that a trader imported 10,000 tonnes of refined soybean oil from Bangladesh on the tanker Bertina. There have been at least four ships that potentially carried palm oil from ports in Indonesia and Malaysia to Bangladesh in the past 14 days, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon.

2018-08-03,"* Scorching conditions expected to continue in August * Japanese utilities seek cargoes in spot market * South Korea, India and Mexico buyers also looking By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices rose for a second consecutive week as sizzling high temperatures continued to grip Japan, the top buyer of the super-chilled fuel. Spot prices for September LNG-AS delivery in Asia rose to $10.00 per million British thermal units (Btu), up 25 cents from the previous week, while prices for October delivery were at $10.40 per mmBtu, industry sources said. Scorching conditions in Japan, where temperatures have risen to record highs in recent weeks, are expected to continue in August with Thomson Reuters Eikon data showing well above average temperatures in the country for the next 15 days. Japan’s biggest electric utilities are firing up old fossil fuel power plants and ramping up others that are already operating, pushing to meet demand as power prices hit record highs amid the deadly heat-wave. Temperatures in Seoul and Beijing are also expected to be above average over the next 15 days, but are expected to moderate over the period, the Eikon data showed. Japan’s Tohoku Electric has a tender seeking 2 LNG cargoes for September delivery while Kansai Electric has bought 2 to 3 cargoes a month, with the latter being in a sell position just a few months ago, a Japan-based industry source said. “How much more (Japan needs to buy LNG) will depend on the weather, but this heat is expected to continue for a while which will prompt more demand and tighten the market,” the source added. South Korean steelmaker POSCO bought a cargo for delivery in October, a second industry source said. South Korean utility Komipo had earlier sought a cargo for November but it was not immediately clear if the tender has been awarded. Indian demand was also firm post-monsoon, with gas distributor Gail India seeking a cargo for delivery in the second half of October. Further out, the company also issued a tender to swap 36 cargoes of its U.S. term cargoes from Dominion Energy’s Cove Point plant and Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass, sources added. Mexico’s state-owned utility CFE is seeking 10 cargoes for delivery over October to January in a tender that closes early next week. The start-up of the second train at Novatek’s Arctic Russian operations in Yamal is expected to cap spot price increase, traders added. Japan’s Inpex also said earlier this week that it has begun producing gas at its giant Ichthys field off northern Australia with traders expecting the first LNG cargo to be exported in September.

The dollar added 0.1 percent to 111.73 yen, having gained about 0.6 percent this week.

The new draft rules followed requests from the country’s energy operators, especially in natural gas, for equal access to the nation’s natural gas pipeline network, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said. The draft marks the first time the government has published a concrete plan to promote fair access to gas-related facilities, including LNG terminal and storage. It is Beijing’s latest move in its ongoing reform of the oil and gas sector to keep it from being monopolized by state companies. The NDRC also proposed adopting thermal units as the standard measurement of gas instead of tonnes, saying it’s an easier way to calculate gas transportation cost. Companies such as refiners, oil and gas producers, trading companies and utilities are encouraged to sign term contracts with pipeline operators to increase the utilization rate of the network grid, the statement said.

Utility provider Wellington Electricity said on its website the outage had cut electricity to around 12,500 customers in the north of the city and it was working to fix the problem. Media company Stuff reported that parliament was in semi-darkness and its internet was down while it relied on back-up generators. The legislature was not in session on Friday but parliamentary committees and ministerial offices were affected.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was still in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city, after returning to work the previous day from six weeks of maternity leave. She was set to arrive in the capital on Saturday. Lectures at Wellington’s Victoria University were cancelled and court operations were halted due to the outage, Stuff reported.

2018-08-03,"TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Friday after strong gains the previous day, easing on persisent supply concerns as Russia increased production in July and Saudi Arabia cut the price of crude for its Asian customers. Brent crude futures were down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent at $73.32 a barrel by 0052 GMT, after rising 1.5 percent on Thursday. U.S. crude was off by 5 cents at $68.91, after gaining nearly 2 percent in the previous session. Russian oil output rose by 150,000 barrels per day in July from a month earlier, surpassing the amount Moscow had said ti would add following a meeting of global oil producers in Vienna in June, energy ministry data showed on Thursday. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have increased production to help to compensate for an anticipated shortfall in Iranian crude supplies once planned U.S. sanctions take effect later this year. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia had earlier cut output to rebalance supply and demand. Saudi Aramco cut its September price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by $0.70 a barrel versus August to a premium of $1.20 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, it said on Thursday. Oil prices tanked earlier this week when the U.S. government reported that U.S. inventories rose 3.8 million barrels in the prior week, against expectations, but rose on Thursday on expectations the stockpile would soon decline again.

2018-08-03,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.03 pct, Nikkei up 0.25 pct * Lingering trade woes continue to curb risk appetite * Dollar index reaches 2-week peak amid trade tensions * Crude oil prices dip slightly after previous day’s rally By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were steady on Friday, with gains from the tech-led rise on Wall Street capped by the latest exchange of trade threats between Beijing and Washington, while safehaven flows lifted the dollar to a two-week high. Investors also remain cautious ahead of the July U.S. jobs report due later on Friday, which will give a reading on the health of the world’s largest economy and possible clues about the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate rises. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched down 0.03 percent. The index was down about 0.6 percent for the week, during which it slumped to a two-week high on Thursday on U.S.-China trade tensions. The trade war between the world’s top two economies intensified midweek after U.S. President Donald Trump raised pressure on China by proposing a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. “The equity markets now have time to regroup and settle down after yesterday’s slide. But the U.S.-China trade conflict involves the epicentre of the region and this will continue to weigh psychologically on Asian equities,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.25 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.32 percent, drawing some support from overnight gains by U.S. stocks. Technology stocks pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq higher on Thursday, driven by Apple shares as the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded U.S. company worth a trillion dollars. In foreign exchange, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies extended its overnight gains and rose to a two-week high of 95.209. Trade tensions were seen driving demand for the U.S. currency, with a slide by the pound providing an extra lift. Sterling dropped more than 0.8 percent on Thursday despite the Bank of England lifting interest rates, after Governor Mark Carney said monetary policy needed to “walk not run” and expressed concern about the risks of a cliff-edge Brexit. The euro was flat at $1.1586 following a loss of 0.6 percent the previous day. Bubbling concerns over Italy weighed on the euro, with the country’s bond yields rising to two-month highs following media reports of a government meeting on the budget revived market concerns about tensions within the ruling coalition. The dollar added 0.1 percent to 111.75 yen, having gained about 0.6 percent this week. The dollar received a big boost against the yen earlier this week after the Bank of Japan tweaked its monetary policy but retained its commitment to keeping interest rates low. Financial markets are now looking to the July jobs U.S. report due later in the session for immediate cues. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 190,000 jobs in July after increasing by 213,000 in June. “A decent jobs report should prompt a straight-forward reaction by the markets, with U.S. yields rising and the dollar gaining,” said Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. With trade tensions generating investor demand for safehaven assets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield pulled back slightly to 2.985 percent overnight from a 10-week high above 3 percent brushed midweek. The 10-year Treasury yield was pushed to the 10-week peak partly due to a surge in Japanese government bond yields, which rose to 1-1/2-year highs this week as the market tested the BOJ’s rejigged policy framework under which it now allows yields to fluctuate in a wider band. Crude oil prices eased back slightly after the previous day’s rally, which was driven by an industry report suggesting U.S. crude stockpiles would soon decline again after a surprise rise in the latest week. Brent crude futures were down 0.25 percent at $73.26 a barrel after surging 1.5 percent on Thursday.

2018-08-03,"(Repeats Thursday story without changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2O3VJZS By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The United States has adopted an “escalate to negotiate” strategy towards China, threatening a dramatic hike in tariffs to try to force a resumption of trade talks while the U.S. economy remains strong and as elections approach in November. U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly rejected a plan to levy tariffs of 10 percent on an additional $200 billion of imports from China and ordered aides to prepare a proposal for tariffs at the higher rate of 25 percent. The levies are in addition to the tariffs on $34 billion of imports that have already gone into effect and the $16 billion of tariffs announced but not yet implemented. The administration’s approach to China is the same one it has employed in dealing with North Korea, Iran, the European Union and NAFTA partners. The basic strategy, including the risks and opportunities, will be familiar to anyone who has studied the Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union (“On escalation: metaphors and scenarios”, Kahn, 1965). The administration’s decision to escalate the confrontation dramatically at this point, threatening significant tariffs on a wide range of imports, including consumer items, is likely to stem from a combination of strength and fear. So far, the trade war appears to have hit China’s economy and financial markets harder than the United States, which has given the administration confidence that it is escalating from a position of strength. The U.S. S&P500 equity index is up by more than 5 percent since the start of 2018, and 25 percent since the start of 2017, while China’s Shanghai composite index has fallen by 13 percent and 7 percent respectively. The U.S. dollar has strengthened by 5 percent against China’s yuan since the beginning of the year and has risen by around 3 percent on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of other major U.S. trading partners. China’s economy has shown signs of slowing, with the central government resorting to fiscal and monetary stimulus to offset the slowdown in external demand and boost confidence. In contrast, the U.S. economy expanded at an annualised rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest for almost four years, according to advance estimates (tmsnrt.rs/2O3VJZS). U.S. manufacturers have reported a broad-based upturn in business activity in recent months, while consumer confidence is close to multi-decade highs. The asymmetric economic and financial performance of the United States and China has convinced the White House it has “escalation dominance” and should press home its advantage. The White House strategy has been to escalate pre-emptively, secure in the belief China has more to lose than the United States on each of the next few rungs up the escalation ladder. Until now, China has matched U.S. tariff moves but not sought to escalate them, which has also probably also emboldened the White House to think it holds a stronger position on the escalation ladder. But if the White House thinks it is escalating from a position of strength, it probably also fears strength may not last forever and could diminish the longer the conflict lasts. Rapid U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter was mostly the result of tax cuts, which stimulated consumer spending, as well as a race to export soybeans and beat the tariffs. Growth in the third and fourth quarters is likely to be slower as these temporary effects unwind and the baseline for quarter-on-quarter comparisons becomes more challenging. Economic expansions tend to be cyclical, and even within each expansion there are spurts of rapid growth followed by more sluggish intervals, so the administration cannot count on the recent spurt to be sustained. Businesses are already starting to report widespread increases in input costs, in part as a result of steel and aluminium tariffs. Consumer price inflation is also rising and starting to erode the real value of wage rises. So far, the administration has tried to avoid imposing tariffs on consumer items in order to avoid politically controversial price rises at retail level. But if the United States is forced to carry out its threat and actually imposes 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of additional items from China, hitting consumer goods will become inevitable. Until now, senior administration officials have made great efforts to reassure investors and businesses that (a) tariffs are unlikely to be imposed; (b) even if imposed, the economic impact will be small; (c) the economy is strong enough to weather any hit; and (d) the short-term pain is worth the long-term gains from resetting relations with China. If the White House is forced to carry out its threat to extend 25 percent tariffs to a much wider range of items, however, the fallout will be greater and pose a more serious test of resolve for investors and businesses. Part of the strategy seems to be to intensify the pressure on China quickly through rapid escalation in the hope it will force an early restart of negotiations on advantageous terms and permit de-escalation quickly, before the economic damage becomes too great. If the White House can secure an early resumption of negotiations, or an early settlement, even a partial one, it will feature heavily in the political campaign ahead of congressional elections as a successful example of the president’s tough negotiating style. The administration therefore has a strong incentive to escalate quickly in the hope of forcing a favourable outcome well before the country goes to the polls in November. For the White House, the economic and political cycles favour rapid escalation in the hope of being able to claim an equally quick victory before the costs start to rise. By bringing the conflict to a crisis (in the Greek sense of “a moment of decision”) the administration hopes to end the dispute or at least de-escalate before the damage grows. China’s reaction remains uncertain, however, which introduces a dangerous element into the escalation strategy and means it could backfire. China’s economy is under greater pressure in the short term but its policymakers may conclude that it is better to absorb the short-term costs and wait for the pressure to start to mount on the United States. In the end, tariffs are a tax on consumers, and if high tariffs go into effect on consumer items, and are sustained for any length of time, the economic and political fallout could be considerable. There are already some preliminary signs that the global economic expansion has started to slow under pressure from higher oil prices and the costs and uncertainty created by the trade conflict. If the United States chooses to escalate rapidly while China elects to ride out the attack and wait for the costs to rebound on the U.S. and global economies, the damage to both as well as third countries could be extensive.

2018-08-03,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing Gas Group’s Chairwoman Li Yalan is guiding the Chinese capital’s natural gas distributor into the highly competitive world of natural gas trading while still providing fuel to a city that consumes as much gas in a year as Belgium.  Li became one of the few women to head a major energy company after taking the helm in 2014. She currently leads a company that distributes 16 billion cubic metres of gas a year, more than the amount of gas that global trader Vitol moved in 2017.   Under Li’s tutelage, the firm, part of Beijing Enterprise Holdings (0392.HK), plans to move beyond gas distribution into natural gas trading by procuring supplies it can sell to Chinese end-users. The company last year completed a $1.1 billion (844.53 million pounds) purchase of a 20 percent stake in an East Siberian gas field owned by Russia’s Rosneft ROSM.NN. (Beijing gas consumption, reut.rs/2n5Oy8c) “If we remain only as a city gas distributor, we’ll have limits in securing supplies,” Li, 56, told Reuters in an interview. “Having control over resources will empower us.” As part of its foray into natural gas trading, Beijing Gas is planning to construct a liquefied natural gas receiving terminal that can regasify 18.25 billion cubic metres a year of gas along with a storage farm that can hold 2 million cubic metres near the city of Tianjin, an official from the Tianjin government confirmed. The project would also include a 300-kilometre (188-mile) pipeline connecting the terminal to Beijing, the official said. The first phase of the terminal is slated to start in 2021, pending regulatory approval, and the final cost is expected to be over 10 billion yuan, the official said. The terminal will give Beijing Gas extra supply to trade as it plans to start a trading desk once the project is operational, said Li.  The investments in the Rosneft field and shale gas assets in southwestern China, along with the LNG receiving terminal, help Beijing Gas stand out from other municipalities that have focussed on pipelines and their local markets. “Beijing Gas could comfortably live on its city gas business, but under the leadership of Madame Li, the firm has developed a global vision that is rare among its peers,” said Li Yao, founder of consultancy SIA Energy. The growth that Li is seeking for Beijing Gas directly stems from the Chinese government’s mandated switch to cleaner-burning natural gas from coal for residential heating and industrial fuel as part of its fight against air pollution. That policy caused China’s LNG imports to surge, as the country last year overtook South Korea as the world’s second-largest importer. However, piped natural gas will still fulfil crucial parts of China’s needs. Beijing Gas’s stake in Rosneft’s Verkhnechonsk oil and gas field gives them access to 3 billion cubic metres of gas per year through imports on Russia’s Power of Siberia pipeline starting in December 2019. “Rosneft didn’t know us well at the start...but eventually the deal factored in Beijing Gas’ value that few competitors could match, direct access to a vast end-user market,” said Li. Li’s career has been intricately tied to securing natural gas for Beijing ever since she chose the energy industry nearly four decades ago by picking “city gas” as her university major since her parents had hoped it would result in a job in a city rather than the countryside. From there, Li gained exposure to the French gas network during a two-year training stint with Gaz de France in the late 1980s. There she learned the practices of procurement, pricing and infrastructure necessary for a distribution business and a model for Beijing Gas to later emulate. “That was a huge eye-opener,” said Li. “China then had very rudimentary infrastructure while France was already highly developed.” Li parlayed that experience to become in 1993 a leader for planning China’s first major gas pipeline, carrying supplies from the Ordos basin in northern China to Beijing.  She was meticulous in her details, mapping out how many small restaurants and businesses in the capital needed to shift to gas from coal for their cooking and heating needs. She also lobbied the government to remove a ban on gas as a boiler fuel. Beijing Gas is now the link between end-users and energy producers such as PetroChina Ltd (0857.HK) and has invested billions of dollars over the years in domestic gas infrastructure controlled by the state-owned company. The early cooperation and trust built with PetroChina, China’s largest gas producer and pipeline operator, gave Beijing Gas a head-start as a strategic partner in nearly all of PetroChina’s major trunk pipelines, a key source of cash flow for the distributor. Li’s decades of work and her commitment to the natural gas industry were recognised with her election to President of the International Gas Union for a three-year term starting in 2021, during which China will host the World Gas Conference. She is the first woman and the first Chinese person to hold the position.
