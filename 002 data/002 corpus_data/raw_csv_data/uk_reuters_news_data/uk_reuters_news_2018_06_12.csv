2018-06-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department has been unable to adequately explain why it canceled a $1 million study on the public health impacts of mountaintop removal coal mining, the agency’s inspector general office said in a report released on Tuesday. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke canceled the government-funded study on the health impacts of the controversial mining technique used in Appalachia last August as part of what officials said was an agency-wide review of grants in excess of $100,000. The study was by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.  Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining in which explosives are used to extract coal from mountaintops and ridgelines. It has raised concern about impacts on rivers and streams, and on human health in surrounding communities.  When the Interior Department was asked by the inspector general to detail the reasons for its decision to cancel the study, it could not produce any evidence of a formal review, the watchdog said in its report.  “Departmental officials were unable to provide specific criteria used for their determination whether to allow or cease certain grants and cooperative agreements,” the report said. It added the cancellation “wasted” some $455,110 that had already been spent on research and that the remaining $548,443 would be returned to the Treasury in 2021. Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift defended the decision, saying the coal study was “duplicative” and was drawing money away from more important efforts “like rebuilding public lands infrastructure and securing public lands along the U.S.-Mexico border.” “It may not sound like a lot of money to House Democrats who continually look for ways to spend us into obliteration,” she told Reuters in an email. The Obama administration had launched the study shortly before leaving office. The inspector general probe was triggered by a request from U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, who has accused the Interior Department of lying and mishandling taxpayer money. A report this week by magazine Pacific Standard showed that Katharine MacGregor, deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management at Interior, was pushing for the study to be suspended after meetings with coal industry groups, according to public records it obtained. Efforts to reach MacGregor were not successful. The National Mining Association called the NAS report “unnecessary” and said existing literature on mountaintop mining shows it poses no public health hazards.

2018-06-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Tuesday, with U.S. crude settling higher before falling in post-settlement trading, and Brent slipping as investors prepared for a key meeting of the OPEC producer group next week. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 58 cents to settle at $75.88 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 climbed 26 cents to $66.36. In post-settlement trading, however, WTI turned negative while Brent extended losses after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed a surprise build of 833,000 barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles. Analysts had expected a decline of 2.7 million barrels. [API/S] A stronger dollar .DXY and euro weakness EUR= was putting some pressure on Brent prices, said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. A strong dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies. “I was looking for an up day (for WTI) - in just a few weeks it had fallen from around $73 (a barrel) to $65, ... and even for the window of seasonal decline, that’s a big move to go uncorrected,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP-TA. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries released its monthly report on Tuesday, saying a high degree of uncertainty was hanging over the global oil market. [nL8N1TE33E] OPEC and other producing countries including Russia have cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017 in an effort to boost the market.  OPEC holds its next meeting on June 22-23, and is expected to decide on future supply policy.  With U.S. sanctions threatening to cut Iranian exports and the potential for more declines in Venezuelan production, Saudi Arabia and Russia have indicated they would be willing to make up for any supply shortfall. U.S. production, meanwhile, is expected to rise by less than previously expected, to 11.76 million barrels per day next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Still, OPEC said the outlook for the second half of 2018 is highly uncertain, even though the group’s figures show a global glut is gone. On Monday, Iraq’s oil minister said producers should not be influenced by pressure to pump more oil. Nonetheless, many analysts expect OPEC to decide to hike production. “I feel that if they would like to be a responsible swing producer for the global oil market, based on their (demand) numbers, they should increase production by at least 1 million bpd from the current level,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.

2018-06-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street made modest gains on Tuesday while the U.S. dollar rose slightly against a basket of major currencies, with only muted impact from the long-awaited U.S.-North Korea summit aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. Investors were more focused on the start of a two-day policy meeting of the Federal Reserve, looking for hints as to whether the U.S. central bank would move to raise rates three or four times this year. “I don’t think (the Fed) is going to say anything particularly related to a rate hike in December,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “If they say a little too much about inflation, that’s going to give the market a reason to get concerned.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.58 points, or 0.01 percent, to 25,320.73, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.85 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,786.85, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 43.87 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,703.79. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) rose 5.0 percent after J.P. Morgan raised its price target on the stock by $11 to $50, while Tesla (TSLA.O) shares gained 3.2 percent after the company said it is cutting several thousand jobs as part of efforts to become profitable. After the closing bell, AT&T (T.N) won U.S. court approval to buy Time Warner Inc TWX.N for $85 billion. AT&T shares fell 2.6 percent and Time Warner shares rose 3.8 percent, in extended trading following the decision. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.24 percent, steadied in part by data showing that U.S. consumer prices increased in May amid a slowdown in the rise of gasoline costs. The euro EUR= was down 0.28 percent to $1.1749. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in Singapore, pledging to work toward complete denuclearization, while Washington committed to providing security guarantees for its old enemy. The MSCI all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.06 percent.  Investors had mixed reactions to the summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved.  “Any de-escalation is good,” said Ian Ormiston, a European fund manager with Old Mutual Global Investors. Others felt the sit-down between Trump and Kim did little to change the game.  “This is more of a case of ‘we’ll believe it when we see it,’ rather than actually reacting,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts.  Investors were more focused on the Fed meeting and policy meetings later in the week of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as the positive U.S. inflation data.  The Fed is expected to raise interest rates at the close of its meeting on Wednesday. “We’re eagerly awaiting the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ, in that order,” said Gregory Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. “People are reluctant to do a whole lot ahead of that.” Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.9645 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.0952 percent, from 3.097 percent.

2018-06-12,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri, who won first and second place respectively in Iraq’s May parliamentary election, announced on Tuesday an alliance between their political blocs. The move announced from the Shi’ite holy city of Najaf is the first serious step towards forming a new government after weeks of negotiations between parties. It comes exactly one month after an election marred by historically low turnout and fraud allegations. The two Shi’ite figures said they would keep the door open for other winning blocs to join them in forming a new government. “Our meeting was a very positive one, we met to end the suffering of this nation and of the people. Our new alliance is a nationalist one,” Sadr said. Sadr and Amiri are strange bedfellows. The cleric, who once led violent campaigns against the U.S. occupation that ended in 2011, has emerged as a nationalist opponent of powerful Shi’ite parties allied with neighbouring Iran and as a champion of the poor. He backed in the election the Saeroon list composed of his followers, the Communist Party, and other secular candidates. Amiri, a fluent Farsi speaker, is Iran’s closest ally in Iraq, having spent two years in exile there during the era of Saddam Hussein. The Fatih alliance he led in the election was composed of political groups tied to Iran-backed Shi’ite militias who helped government forces dislodge Islamic State militants from the third of Iraq they seized four years ago. “Fatih and Saeroon announce forming the nucleus of the largest bloc and call on all winning blocs to participate in this alliance under a government programme agreed upon by all that is suitable to face the challenges, crises, and problems facing Iraq,” a Fatih spokesman said in a statement. The alliance, which together has 101 seats, 64 short of the majority needed to form a government, came hours after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who’s own bloc came third, urged politicians to keep negotiating over government formation despite an impending nationwide manual recount of votes. Parliament mandated the recount after Abadi said a government report showed there were serious violations.  A few days later a storage site housing half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes caught fire, raising tensions and prompting some to call for the election to be repeated. Abadi said on Tuesday he opposed a repeat, echoing the stances of Sadr and Amiri, and warned that anyone who tried to sabotage the political process would be punished. He may yet secure a second term as a compromise candidate if he joins his blocs with Sadr and Amiri and manages to win their backing. “The matter is exclusively in the hands of the judiciary, not politicians. The government and parliament don’t have the power to cancel the election,” Abadi said of a repeat. The government report had recommended a recount of 5 percent of votes but the outgoing parliament, in which over half of lawmakers including the speaker lost their seats, instead voted for a nationwide one. Amiri said on Tuesday he supported only a partial recount. Abadi called the fire a deliberate act and said the attorney general would bring charges against those who are trying to undermine the political process. An Iraqi court ordered the arrest of four people accused of setting fire to the storage site. Three of them were policemen and one an employee of the elections commission. Abadi said a preliminary report had provided evidence of gasoline at multiple areas inside the storage site. It also showed that security cameras had been disabled and no locks had been broken, implying it was carried out by someone with access to the storage site. Iraqi authorities said the ballot boxes had been rescued but the fire has fuelled fears of violence. Sadr has warned that certain parties are trying to drag Iraq into a civil war, adding that he would not participate in one. Abadi thanked Sadr for a disarmament initiative he floated after a weapons cache at his Baghdad stronghold of Sadr City exploded, killing 18 people, and said he hoped the cleric would stick to it. “I welcome Sayed Moqtada’s announcement that his followers commit to not having weapons outside the framework of the state. We consider this good,” he said, adding that those responsible for the explosion would be brought to justice. “What happened in Sadr City is very regrettable, it is a crime. Those responsible will receive their just punishment.” Sadr, who ordered his own separate investigation into the incident, said on Tuesday he had identified the culprit who was now on the run and that he would be brought to justice.

2018-06-12,"(In 9th paragraph, corrects monthly decline in U.S. corn ending stocks estimate to 80 million bushels instead of 80 billion.) By Mark Weinraub WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Rising demand on both the domestic and overseas fronts spurred a cut in the U.S. Agriculture Department’s outlook for corn and soybean stockpiles, the government said on Tuesday. USDA also raised its estimate for 2018/19 U.S. wheat production due to slight increases in all classes of winter wheat. It lowered its forecast for ending stocks that year after boosting its export outlook by 25 million bushels, which traders attributed to a smaller Russian harvest forecast. Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybean and wheat futures all rallied to session highs after the report was released. “We have a bullish report here,” said Rich Nelson, chief strategist with Allendale Inc. “Better demand expectations that are supporting pricing.” In its monthly supply and demand report, USDA pegged soybean ending stocks for the 2017/18 crop year at 505 million bushels, down from 530 million bushels a month ago. It boosted its soybean usage by crushers to 2.015 billion bushels, up 25 million bushels. For the 2018/19 marketing year, USDA estimated soybean endings stocks at 385 million bushels, down from its May estimate of 415 million bushels, largely due to a smaller carry-in from 2017/18. The 2018/19 stocks estimates fell below a range of analysts’ forecasts in a Reuters survey. The 2017/18 figure was below the average of estimates in the survey. High soybean meal usage was sparking demand for soybeans at processors, USDA said. On the corn front, USDA pegged 2017/18 ending stocks at 2.102 billion bushels, down 80 million bushels from May. That was below the low end of analysts’ estimates. The government raised its 2017/18 corn export outlook by 75 million bushels to 2.300 billion. USDA said that corn exports in April hit a record high, topping the monthly shipping record set in November 1989. For 2018/19, corn ending stocks were seen at 1.577 billion bushels. In May, USDA pegged corn ending stocks at 1.682 billion bushels. USDA boosted its 2018/19 ethanol usage estimate to 5.675 billion bushels, up 50 million bushels from May. USDA also pegged domestic wheat ending stocks at 1.080 billion bushels for 2017/18, up 10 million bushels from May, and at 946 million bushels for 2018/19, 9 million bushels lower than May. The government raised its estimate of all U.S. wheat production for 2018/19 by 6 million bushels to 1.827 billion bushels. It cut its 2018/19 Russia wheat harvest estimate to 68.50 million tonnes from 72.00 million tonnes. Additional reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago

2018-06-12,"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - The surging share price for automaker Tesla Inc this month has slammed short-sellers of the stock with more than $2 billion in losses on paper so far in June, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. Tesla shares are up 20.5 percent in June, on pace for their biggest monthly gain month since August 2014, boosted by optimism the company can meet production targets for its Model 3 sedans. The sharp gains have caught short-sellers in a tough spot, putting their mark-to-market losses for June to $2.09 billion, S3 data showed. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. “In all of 2017, they (short-sellers) were down $3.4 billion. To lose $2 billion in a month, stands out as one of the biggest losses for a stock that I have seen,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York. With Tesla shares up about 2 percent in late afternoon trading on Tuesday, shorts were down $278 million in mark-to-market losses, in addition to $549 million in losses on Monday, said Dusaniwsky. That makes it the worst performing stock for short sellers this year, he said. On Tuesday, Tesla shares rose as much as 6.9 percent to a 3-1/2 month high of $354.97, before paring gains on news that the electric carmaker would cut 9 percent of its staff, or several thousand jobs, across the company as it seeks to reduce costs. Tesla short interest stands at $12.6 billion, with 37.9 million or nearly 30 percent of the share float, sold short, according to S3 data. Shares of heavily shorted companies can at times get pushed higher as traders rush to buy stock to cover their short bets, triggering what is known as a ‘short squeeze.’ That has not happened so far for Tesla, according to S3 data. There has only been a small drop in the number of shares sold short in June. “With almost 80 million shares traded in June this slight short covering did not move Tesla’s stock price,” said Dusaniwsky. “This is the biggest cry wolf on Wall Street - everyone says short squeeze, and it never is. They will be right one day, but not today,” said Dusaniwsky.

2018-06-12,"NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - A week after the White House suspended its bid to reform the nation’s biofuels policy to aid oil refiners, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday dangled a tantalizing prospect to Midwest corn farmers, saying the agency has the power to expand sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made the comments during a multi-day tour of the Midwest, as he fended off criticism from farmers and heartland lawmakers that his attempts since last year to overhaul the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) marked a betrayal of Republican President Donald Trump’s promises to support rural jobs. Those efforts, aimed at helping the oil industry cope with the costs of the RFS, came to a halt last week when the White House delayed indefinitely the announcement of a deal that had been months in the making. The deal would have effectively reduce the amount of corn-based ethanol U.S. refiners were required to blend, while also allowing summertime sales of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, a practice EPA currently bans due to smog concerns. “He said they have the authority” to allow higher-ethanol gasoline sales year-round, said Bill Pracht, president and CEO of East Kansas Agri-Energy, after Pruitt visited his ethanol plant in the town of Garnett. “He didn’t commit to it as a standalone.” The corn industry has long sought approval to sell gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, a blend called E15, in the summer because it would increase demand for corn-based ethanol. EPA currently bans E15 during summer due to concerns the product contributes to smog, a finding contested by the biofuels industry, which has some research to back its position. EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson confirmed Pruitt’s comments: “The Administrator shared that he believes statutory authority to grant the ... waiver for E15 exists under the Clean Air Act, and to be effective, would require a subsequent notice and comment rule making process.” The RFS requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year, and prove compliance by earning or acquiring blending credits that must be handed in to the EPA. The law has helped Midwest corn farmers by creating a 15-billion-gallon-a-year market for ethanol, but refining companies have complained it incurs steep costs for them. The White House deal last week would have allowed U.S. biofuels exports to count, for the first time, toward the annual volumes quotas, reducing the blending burden on refiners and lowering their costs. Farm state lawmakers refused to support that idea, even though it also would have provided the E15 waiver as a concession to the corn lobby. During his visit, Pruitt added that he still supported allowing exports of ethanol and other renewables to qualify under the RFS, though he said the decision from the White House on that was put on hold, according to Pracht. “It was important he finally got a glimpse of our industry firsthand,” said Pracht. “This is such an economic driver for our community,” said of his operation, which employs 50 people.

2018-06-12,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Investors in Colombia’s oil and mining sectors have much at stake in Sunday’s presidential race with the frontrunner pledging business-friendly measures to revive production while his leftist rival wants to end reliance on petroleum and coal, the country’s top exports.     Leftist candidate Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M-19 guerilla group, has promised to overhaul state-run oil firm Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN, the South American nation’s biggest company, to refocus it on renewable energy.    Ecopetrol is responsible for about 60 percent of Colombia’s flagging oil production of around 830,000 barrels per day and operates export pipeline infrastructure.      At current rates of production, Colombia has just six years worth of oil, the energy ministry says, and urgent investment in exploration is needed to replace reserves, making Sunday’s vote decisive for its future as an oil exporter.    Petro has also stirred alarm with promises to let coal mining contracts lapse in Colombia, the world’s fifth-largest coal exporter, target a shift towards agricultural production.    However, the right-wing favourite to win Sunday’s poll, Ivan Duque, has diametrically opposed positions, pledging to cut taxes and boost Colombia’s competitiveness in extractive industries.        “We can’t have a policy of destroying productive sectors,” Duque told Reuters. “We are not yet an oil country. We are a country with potential. We must continue exploration of conventional and offshore oil so that we maintain the foreign currency flows that oil exports bring us.”     Ecopetrol declined comment but it has said any transition to renewable energy should be orderly.     Companies are already grappling with security concerns as well as local referendums and environmental court rulings that have stymied major mining projects in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy.     “We like Duque obviously,” Continental Gold Inc (CNL.TO) Chief Executive Ari Sussman said during a visit to the company’s Buritica project, which will begin full production in 2020.    “I do not think (Petro) would be good for Colombia because I think everything would freeze,” Sussman said, referring to the legislative bottlenecks that the leftist’s lack of support in Congress could cause.     AngloGold Ashanti Ltd (ANGJ.J) suspended a potentially $2 billion (1.50 billion pounds) project last year after the surrounding community voted to ban mining.     A recent paper by the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP), which represents private crude producers warned that planned referendums put one-fifth of oil production at risk.    Petro, however, has voiced strong support for such local community referendums and also wants to ban open-pit mining, which accounts for almost all Colombia’s coal and gold production.     Although Petro, 58, lies some 20 points behind 41-year-old Duque in opinion polls, his economic proposals are stirring alarm among some investors.     “There is unified concern over what Petro has proposed economically,” said analyst Sergio Guzman of Control Risks. “The chances that it happens are slim but, the fear doesn’t stop being there.”  Most companies and trade associations declined to comment for this story.          Graphic on Latin American elections  - tmsnrt.rs/2rAQ4l1 Duque’s solution to dwindling oil reserves is to encourage investment in exploration, which he says could provide years more oil production - though his campaign has declined to give precise figures.     The ACP says the industry needs to spend up to $7 billion a year just to keep output between 800,000 and 860,000 bpd.     Private oil companies plan to invest up to $4.9 billion this year, ACP said, while Ecopetrol plans to spend up to $4 billion.     Duque has promised tax cuts for the sector combined with investment at Ecopetrol’s refineries meant to allow exports of  more higher-value derivatives.       “Duque will bolster foreign investor sentiment into extractive industries,” analysts Molly Shutt and Mara Roberts Duque of BMI Research said.     The former senator has also pledged to improve transport for crude - as part of a $10 billion in industrial improvements - and bolster security to curb attacks by the leftist ELN rebels on Ecopetrol’s pipelines.     Bombings have kept the Cano-Limon export pipeline - which runs from Colombia’s eastern border with Venezuela to the Caribbean coast - offline since January. The Transandino - which runs near the southern border with Ecuador - was also recently halted by attacks.      The ACP declined to comment on candidates’ proposals but has warned about the damaging effect of referendums, high taxes and pipeline bombings.     Petro has said he will replace lost commodities income over a decade with agricultural production, which he says will provide more jobs. His platform mentions food production but he has not provided further details.  His campaign did not respond to questions.     Despite Petro’s pledge to aid poor farmers with land reform, the agricultural federation, which includes coffee growers, made a rare presidential endorsement last week backing Duque, who has promised to modernize the industry, incentivising a crop output increase with tax cuts and credits.     Petro’s pledge to buy unproductive land to give away to poor farmers has sparked concern. Opponents said the rhetoric reeked of the expropriation practiced by socialist leaders in neighbouring Venezuela, which is in deep economic and social crisis. Petro denies he would expropriate.

2018-06-12,"WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - All five members of the panel that regulates the U.S. power grid indicated at a Senate hearing on Tuesday there was no emergency in the country’s electricity markets, potentially undermining efforts by President Donald Trump’s administration to save ailing coal and nuclear plants through subsidies. Trump this month directed U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency measures to keep coal and nuclear plants running in order to protect national security. Many of the plants have shut in the face of plentiful natural gas, growth in wind and solar power, and stagnant power demand. More closures are expected in coming years. Kevin McIntyre, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and one of three Republicans on the five member panel, said there was “no immediate calamity or threat” to power plants operating or serving the needs of consumers. Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat, later asked all members of the FERC at the Senate energy committee hearing whether any of them saw a national security emergency in power markets. Cheryl LaFleur, a Democrat, said she did not, and the other four members responded to the question with silence. Neil Chatterjee, another FERC Republican, cautioned that even though the power grid is reliable, regulators need to be vigilant that the turn away from coal and nuclear to natural gas does not make the grid less able to bounce back from weather disasters and physical and cyber attacks on the infrastructure. But Robert Powelson, a Republican member of the commission said a directive to the Energy Department to subsidize coal and nuclear could result in “significant rate increases without any corresponding reliability, resilience or cyber security benefits.” He said intervention threatens “to collapse the wholesale competitive markets that have long been a cornerstone of FERC policy.” Richard Glick, a Democrat on the FERC, said Trump’s push to save aging coal and nuclear plants would “clearly” raise power bills for residents and businesses. “The question is how much,” he said. Glick said estimates he had seen showed the country’s utility rates could rise tens of billions of dollars. Chatterjee, from coal-producing Kentucky, commiserated with Senator Steve Daines of Montana about how the loss of coal plants means job cuts at power generators and mines. But he suggested that lawmakers may have to legislate changes to help save those jobs. “That is not something we factor into our record,” Chatterjee said about the deliberations of FERC, which ensures that power markets run efficiently.

2018-06-12,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian government has prepared the country’s power grid to deal with the wild swings in demand for electricity as most people in the football-mad country tune out everything except their televisions to watch the national team play in the Fifa 2018 World Cup. Brazil comes to a near paralysis when the “seleção”, winner of a record five trophies, plays for the World Cup. Power demand falls sharply close to the start of the games, then surges during halftime breaks as people rush to grab a drink in the refrigerator or make microwave-popcorn. As play resumes, power demand falls sharply again. “Such events cause system behaviour that is totally different from normal days,” said Álvaro Fleury Veloso da Silveira, IT director at national grid operator ONS. “But we are used to it,” he said. Brazilians abandon their daily routines on World Cup game days for the national team. Schools change class times or cancel them altogether. Companies let employees go home early or set up televisions so people can watch in the workplace. The FIFA 2018 World Cup starts on Thursday in Russia. Brazilians celebrate national team game days like holidays, with people getting together to party whenever possible.  To guarantee sufficient electricity for sudden surges in demand, Silveira says more power plants than normal are put on alert, prepared to boost production if necessary. Other football-crazy nations, such as the United Kingdom, have similar preparations in place. In Brazil, the swings in demand can reach up to 11,000 megawatts, for instance when a game finishes in the evening and people go back to their routines at the same time public lighting is turned on.

2018-06-12,"June 12 (Reuters) - Finland on Tuesday said it would sell 12.8 million shares in oil refiner Neste, representing about 5 percent of the company. After completion of the sale, Finland’s holding in Neste will fall to 44.7 percent from 49.7 percent, the Finnish state said in a statement. The oil refiner’s shares will be offered to Finnish and international institutional investors via an accelerated bookbuild, the statement said. The Finnish state said it would declare results of the share sale around June 13. Earlier in the year, Finland gave up control of the oil refiner by donating shares to a charitable foundation when it donated shares worth 50 million euros ($58.79 million) to a Finnish foundation. This cut the government’s stake in Neste to 49.7 percent from 50.1 percent. The centre-right government last year got the parliament’s mandate to cut the Neste stake to 33.4 percent as it seeks funds for potential investments in new growth companies. $1 = 0.8506 euros

2018-06-12,"(Adds Israeli statement) By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Iran warned North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday against trusting U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he could cancel their denuclearisation agreement within hours. Tehran cited its own experience in offering the advice to Kim a month after Washington withdrew from a similar deal with Iran. Trump and Kim pledged at a meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula while Washington committed to provide security guarantees for its old enemy. “We don’t know what type of person the North Korean leader is negotiating with. It is not clear that he would not cancel the agreement before returning home,” Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht was quoted as saying by IRNA new agency. Nobakht questioned Trump’s credibility. “This man does not represent the American people, and they will surely distance themselves from him at the next elections,” he said. As well as pulling the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Trump disowned on Saturday a joint communique issued by Group of Seven leaders, just hours after he had left their summit for the meeting with Kim. Israel, which has hailed Trump’s tough line on Iran, praised his summit with Kim. “This is an important step in the effort to strip the Korean peninsula of nuclear weaponry,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. “President Trump is also taking a firm stance against Iran’s attempt to obtain nuclear weaponry, as well as its belligerence in the Middle East.” Israel is believed to have the region’s sole atomic arsenal. Trump has said would be open to striking a new nuclear accord with Tehran. However, he says the existing deal negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama had failed to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme. On top of this, he also cited the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites and “sunset” clauses, under which limits on the nuclear programme start to expire after 10 years. Trump has insisted any deal with North Korea should include irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation. Washington will reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including measures aimed at the oil sector and transactions with its central bank. Other remaining signatories of the deal - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia- have criticised the U.S. exit and are still trying to salvage the accord.

2018-06-12,"(Adds Breakingviews link) By Liz Hampton, Ernest Scheyder and Dmitry Zhdannikov HOUSTON/LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is pushing deeper into energy trading, building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk-management systems to lift profit, according to executive recruiters and people familiar with the business. The development is a sea change for a company that has stood out from rivals by limiting its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter. Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade. Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore, the world’s second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66. This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP’s first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later. The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc , Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions. “Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,” said a trading house executive who knows Butcher. Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks. Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon’s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. “Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,” said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. “A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.” Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses. During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division. Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon’s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale. Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms. “Exxon still doesn’t plan to begin speculative paper trading,” said one source familiar with Exxon’s thinking. Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025. The company’s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business. Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople. Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading. “We’ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it’s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,” said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved.

2018-06-12,"PARIS (Reuters) - Oil and gas major Total (TOTF.PA) said on Tuesday that 3.5 percent of its petrol stations in France had run out of fuel on the second day of a blockade of refineries and fuel depots by farmers that has disrupted distribution. Farmers are protesting against France’s decision to allow Total to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant, which would compete with biodiesel made from locally produced oilseed crops, further souring relations between the EU’s biggest farm sector and the government of President Emmanuel Macron. The blockade now concerned a total of 18 refineries and depots across France, and would continue until the farm minister agreed to some of the farmers’ demands, said the FNSEA, the country’s largest farm union, which is organising the protests. “It is really an alarm call that 3,000 farmers on 18 blocked sites have sent out to say, please listen to us and take up this message at a European level,” FNSEA President Christiane Lambert said after meeting Agriculture Minister Stephane Travert. “The negotiation is not over, we do not have what we want. But by mutual agreement we decided to meet again at the end of the day to move forward on our claims,” she added. Total, which operates 2,200 petrol stations and five of France’s seven refineries and nine depots, said the depots and four refineries were still blocked. The refineries were still operating. “There are some difficulties in supplying petrol stations particularly in Paris and the Ile-de-France region,” a Total spokesman said. Total had urged customers not to rush to petrol stations to fill their tanks, which could spark panic buying and shortages. French authorities last month gave Total permission to use palm oil as a feedstock at its La Mede biofuel refinery in southern France, infuriating farmers who grow crops such as rapeseed. Environmentalists also blame palm oil cultivation for deforestation in southeast Asia.  Total argues its plans call for using less palm oil than allowed by the authorities, offer an outlet for 50,000 tonnes of locally produced rapeseed and will develop large-scale recycling of used oil and fat. But Lambert said 50,000 tonnes was “not enough” and that the price needed to be based on producers’ costs, not on palm oil prices. “As long as we are not successful ... we will remain on the blockades,” the head of France’s young farmers group JA, Jeremy Decerle, said.

2018-06-12,"(Adds quarterly numbers, description of solar market) By Nichola Groom June 12 (Reuters) - New U.S. solar installations in 2018 will stay at the same level as last year due to weakness in several major residential markets and a slowdown in big projects after a rush to beat a tax credit deadline, according to a report released on Tuesday. The zero-growth forecast came despite a 13 percent rise in the first quarter to 2.5 gigawatts, accounting for 55 percent of total U.S. generating capacity added, GTM Research said in the report commissioned by the Solar Energy Industries Association. New solar installations, which surged for much of the last decade, fell almost 30 percent in 2017 to 10.8 gigawatts because developers in 2016 completed a slew of projects ahead of a scheduled expiration of a key tax credit that ultimately was extended, the report said. Government policies that supported renewable energy and a sharp fall in the price of the technology propelled expansion. GTM raised its forecast for utility-scale installations by 2 percent to 6.6 gigawatts, noting that many developers had secured panels before import tariffs were imposed by the Trump administration this year. The tariffs will be felt mostly next year and beyond, GTM said, reducing its 2019 utility-scale forecast by 600 megawatts. This sector will grow about 5 percent in 2019, but will be flat in 2021 and 2022 due to tariff-related project delays, it added. Module prices averaged 47 cents per watt during the first quarter, 24 percent above the 38 cents average a year ago, due to the U.S. tariffs. The research firm ratcheted down its 2018 residential market outlook by 8 percent from 2.4 GW to 2.2 GW. Mature markets including Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey are expected to decline this year, GTM said. Residential solar installations fell 15 percent last year but was flat during the first quarter, a promising sign of a market recovery after a 2017 pullback by national installers like Tesla Inc, it added. Residential system prices have stagnated as the cost of acquiring customers has risen steadily over the last four quarters, GTM said.

In its monthly short-term energy outlook, the agency forecast that U.S. crude oil output will rise by 970,000 bpd in 2019. Last month, it expected a 1.14 million bpd year-over-year increase to 11.86 million bpd. U.S. oil production was forecast to touch a record 12 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2019 but EIA pared its expectations, saying it was now expected to be about 11.97 million bpd. For 2018, the agency upped its production estimate to 10.79 million bpd, expecting growth of 1.44 million bpd, according to the report. It previously expected output to rise by 1.37 million bpd to 10.72 million bpd. U.S. crude production has surged over the past eight years thanks to a shale boom, driven primarily by gains in the prolific Permian basin, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. On the demand side, the EIA expects U.S. oil consumption growth in 2018 to rise by 530,000 bpd to 20.41 million bpd compared with a previous forecast of a rise of 500,000 bpd to 20.38 million bpd.

2018-06-12,"SARAJEVO, June 12 (Reuters) - Fuel distributors in Bosnia’s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation agreed a deal with the regional government on Tuesday to cut fuel prices after drivers repeatedly blocked roads in protest against rising prices, a government minister said. The Federation government decided to take action after traffic jams disrupted life in several Bosnian cities in recent days. The decision to cut prices was also seen as a sweetener ahead of an October general election. “We have reached a consensus there will be no further hikes of fuel prices,” Federation Trade Minister Zlatan Vujovic was quoted as saying by Fena news agency after his meeting with oil distributors in the southern town of Mostar. “Fuel will be cheaper at some oil stations even from tomorrow,” said Vujovic, adding the government and the distributors had agreed on the rationalisation of operations and lower costs for distributors so that the prices could go down. Fuel prices were first increased in February after a rise in biofuel excise taxes, and there have been two further increases, lifting the price of a litre of gasoline to 2.35 Bosnian marka (1.20 euros). Officials have blamed the higher prices on global markets, where crude oil prices have been bolstered by a supply pact led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The government of Bosnia’s other autonomous region, the Serb Republic, said it would discuss the problem of rising fuel prices on Thursday. Drivers have also blocked roads in major Serbian cities in recent days, protesting against prices that have risen to 1.24 euros ($1.46) for a litre of gasoline and 1.30 euros for a litre of diesel. Protesters said prices should be kept under 1 euro a litre in Bosnia and Serbia, where average monthly pay is about 400 euros. $1 = 0.8481 euros

2018-06-12,"WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Rising demand on both the domestic and overseas fronts spurred a cut in the U.S. Agriculture Department’s outlook for corn and soybean stockpiles, the government said on Tuesday. In its monthly supply and demand report, USDA pegged soybean ending stocks for the 2017/18 crop year at 505 million bushels, down from 530 million bushels a month ago. It boosted its soybean usage by crushers to 2.015 billion bushels, up 25 million bushels. For the 2018/19 marketing year, USDA estimated soybean endings stocks at 385 million bushels, down from its May estimate of 415 million bushels. The lower stocks figure was largely due to a smaller carry-in from 2017/18. Additionally, the 2018/19 crush estimate was raised by 5 million bushels. The 2018/19 stocks estimates fell below a range of analysts’ forecasts in a Reuters survey. The 2017/18 figure was below the average of estimates in the survey. High soybean meal usage was sparking demand for soybeans at processors, USDA said. On the corn front, USDA pegged 2017/18 ending stocks at 2.102 billion bushels, down 80 billion bushels from May. That was below the low end of analysts’ estimates that ranged from 2.132 billion bushels to 2.192 billion bushels. The government raised its 2017/18 corn export outlook by 75 million bushels to 2.300 billion. USDA said that corn exports in April hit a record high, topping the monthly shipping record set in November 1989. For 2018/19, corn ending stocks were seen at 1.577 billion bushels. In May, USDA pegged corn ending stocks at 1.682 billion bushels. USDA boosted its 2018/19 ethanol usage estimate to 5.675 billion bushels, up 50 million bushels from May. USDA also pegged domestic wheat ending stocks at 1.080 billion bushels for 2017/18, up 10 million bushels from May, and at 946 million bushels for 2018/19, 9 million bushels lower than May. The government raised its estimate of all U.S. wheat production for 2018/19 by 6 million bushels to 1.827 billion bushels, with slight increases seen in hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat and white winter wheat production. USDA also lowered its estimate of 2017/18 soybean production in Argentina to 37.00 million tonnes from 39.00 million tonnes, but raised its estimate for Brazil’s 2017/18 soybean harvest to 119.00 million tonnes from 117.00 million tonnes. It trimmed its corn harvest forecast for Brazil by 2 million tonnes to 85 million tonnes and left its estimate of Argentina’s corn production unchanged. Reporting by Mark Weinraub

2018-06-12,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Dollar index dips after U.S.-North Korea summit * Broad world stock index creeps into positive territory * Trump, Kim agree on denuclearization but deal seen symbolic * Focus shifts to Fed, positive U.S. consumer data By Nick Brown NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters) - World stock markets were little changed on Tuesday while the U.S. dollar fell slightly against an index of major currencies, as investors brushed aside a long-awaited U.S.-North Korea summit aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in Singapore, pledging to work toward complete denuclearization, while Washington committed to providing security guarantees for its old enemy. The MSCI all-country world index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.07 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.04 percent, steadied in part by data on Tuesday showing U.S. consumer prices rose in May amid a slowdown in the increase of gasoline costs. The euro was up 0.06 percent to $1.1789. Investors had mixed reactions to the North Korea summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved. “Any de-escalation is good, because in the background you always have worries about these situations,” said Old Mutual Global Investors European fund manager Ian Ormiston. Others felt the sit-down between Trump and Kim did little to change the game. “Markets are skeptical,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “This is more of a case of ‘we’ll believe it when we see it’, rather than actually reacting.” Buyers of equities and government bonds seemed more interested in other matters. Along with the positive U.S. inflation data, investors were focused on the kick-off of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, at which the Fed is expected to raise interest rates, as well as meetings later this week by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. “”We’re eagerly awaiting the Fed, the ECB and the BOJ, in that order,” said Gregory Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. “People are reluctant to do a whole lot ahead of that.” Futures contracts indicate a 96 percent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, according to CME Group. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.9663 percent, from 2.957 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.1032 percent, from 3.097 percent Monday. Wall Street’s main equity indexes were mixed but steady, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 8.78 points, or 0.03 percent, to 25,313.53, the S&P 500 gaining 3.07 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,785.07 and the Nasdaq Composite adding 28.74 points, or 0.38 percent, to 7,688.66. Twitter drove the jump on the benchmark S&P, gaining 6.25 percent in midday trading after J.P. Morgan raised its price target by $11 to $50. Tesla jumped more than 4.8 percent after Keybanc raised its estimates for Model 3 deliveries for the second quarter and full-year. In Europe, the regional FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.01 percent. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, with some expecting it to provide guidance for ending its bond-buying program at the end of this year. The spread between Italian and German 10-year borrowing costs narrowed as the U.S.-North Korea summit drew to a close, following a rally on Monday after reassuring comments from Italy’s new economy minister. Oil was mixed after falling earlier in the day. Volatility subsided to its lowest in three weeks, as investors prepared for a key meeting of the OPEC producer group next week. U.S. crude rose 0.53 percent to $66.45 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.41, down 0.07 percent. In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan’s Nikkei paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent.

2018-06-12,"OSLO, June 12 (Reuters) - Sweden’s nuclear fuel and waste management company (SKB) will meet a January deadline to submit new information in support of its application to build a permanent radioactive refuse store, and expects a decision by mid-2020, it told Reuters on Tuesday. SKB’s application for the nuclear waste repository, needed to replace an interim storage facility it is currently using, was dealt a blow earlier this year when an environmental court said it was not sure of the proposed plan’s safety. The company is working on additional requested research and will submit it by Jan. 7, 2019, a deadline set by Sweden’s environment and energy ministry, which will in turn rule on the application, said SKB spokesman Simon Hoff. “We have just received the request by the ministry to continue with the application and submit the additional documents by January 7. We are doing the research needed and will produce what is needed by then,” he said. The court’s objections to SKB’s application, otherwise supported by Sweden’s radiation safety authority, were due to concerns over the ability of the designed capsules to contain the nuclear waste in the long term. “After we hand the documentation, the ministry should decide on the application by the first half of 2020,” said Hoff. The permanent repository, designed to store up to 12,000 tonnes of spent fuel from Sweden’s nuclear plants, could take 10 years to complete and the country’s nuclear plant operators have raised concerns about the delays in authorising it. “It is important that we get a solution in place for the permanent storage of nuclear waste as soon as possible .... Expediting this matter must be prioritised to prevent the process from becoming drawn-out and costly,” Vattenfall chief executive Magnus Hall said in April. Of Sweden’s eight nuclear reactors in operation, Vattenfall controls seven. The eighth belongs to OKG, a unit of Germany’s Uniper. Six power reactors and two research units are being decommissioned in Sweden, with a third research unit already dismantled.

2018-06-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. monthly consumer inflation rose moderately in May as gasoline price increases slowed, suggesting the Federal Reserve could continue to gradually raise interest rates this year.  The Labor Department’s inflation report was published ahead of the start of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Steadily rising inflation and a tightening labour market are seen encouraging the U.S. central bank to hike rates for a second time this year on Wednesday. “Neither too hot nor too cold,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “As such, today’s news won’t change the terms of the inflation debate, and is likely to do little to stir the pot at the Fed meeting.”  The Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month, also as food prices were unchanged. That followed a similar gain in the CPI in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI accelerated 2.8 percent, the biggest advance since February 2012, after rising 2.5 percent in April. The surge in the annual CPI is largely the result of last year’s weak readings, which were driven by big declines in the prices of cell phone service plans and doctor fees, falling  from the calculation. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2 percent, supported by a rebound in new motor vehicle prices and a pickup in the cost of healthcare, after edging up 0.1 percent in April. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the so-called core CPI to 2.2 percent, the largest rise since February 2017, from 2.1 percent in April.  The Fed tracks a different inflation measure, which is just below its 2 percent target. Economists are divided on whether policymakers will signal one or two more rate hikes in their statement accompanying the rate decision on Wednesday. “The slow but steady upward pressure on inflation could tilt a majority of policymakers to lift their suggested interest rate forecast, possibly pencilling in two additional moves in the second half of the year after almost certainly raising rates tomorrow,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries fell slightly. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in April, matching March’s increase. Economists expect the core PCE price index will breach its 2 percent target this year.  Fed officials have indicated they would not be too concerned with inflation overshooting the target.  A survey by the NFIB on Tuesday showed the share of small businesses reporting raising prices hitting it highest level since 2008 in May. Several regional factory surveys have shown manufacturers paying more for raw materials this year. Economists expect these higher costs will eventually be passed on to consumers. That, together with an expected acceleration in wage growth from a tight labour market could boost inflation later this year. The unemployment rate is at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent. “There is inflation out there on the horizon but it is largely a mirage policymakers think will disappear when the economy gets there,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. Last month, gasoline prices increased 1.7 percent after surging 3.0 percent in April. Food prices were unchanged in May after rising 0.3 percent in the prior month. Food consumed at home fell 0.2 percent amid declines in the cost of meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3 percent in May after a similar gain in April.  Healthcare costs gained 0.2 percent last month, with prices for prescription drugs jumping 1.4 percent and the cost of hospital visits rising 0.5 percent. Healthcare costs nudged up 0.1 percent in April. Prices for new motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent after sliding 0.5 percent in April.  But prices for used cars and trucks fell 0.9 percent after tumbling 1.6 percent in April. Airline fares declined 1.9 percent in May after dropping 2.7 percent in the prior month. Prices for apparel and recreation were unchanged in May.

2018-06-12,"* OMV agreed deal with Gazprom on 2016 * Norway concerned at Russian access to its continental shelf * Austrian group working with Gazprom on new Europe pipeline (Adds comments from CEO on Gazprom deal, Iran) By Kirsti Knolle and Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich VIENNA, June 12 (Reuters) - OMV will seek talks with Norway about the Austrian energy group’s planned asset swap deal with Gazprom in order to address Oslo’s concerns, the chief executive said. In 2016, OMV agreed to swap 38.5 percent of its Norway assets for 24.98 percent of the Russian company’s Urengoy gas field. But Norway’s energy minister, Terje Soeviknes, said in May this year he was concerned the deal would give Gazprom access to the Norwegian continental shelf. “We now have to hold tri-partite discussions and talk to the minister,” Chief Executive Rainer Seele told Reuters on Tuesday. Talks would take place in mid-July at the earliest, he said in an interview. “I do not even want to think about setting up a date during the World Cup,” the 57-year-old German added. OMV and Gazprom remained committed to the deal, he said when asked whether an outright purchase of Gazprom’s assets, as suggested by sources, was also an option. “Should any obstacles arise in the talks with the ministry, then we must discuss with Gazprom how to deal with it,” he said. Russia is a core region for OMV as production is cheap and transport pipelines to Austria are in place. OMV bought about a quarter of the Yuzhno Russkoye field, one of Russia’s largest gas fields, last year and is one of Gazprom’s construction partners in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Nord Stream 2, which will double Russia’s capacity to pipe gas to Europe, has been criticised by some in the European Union who say it will make the bloc too reliant on Russian gas and strengthen Gazprom’s already dominant position. Seele said the pipeline would protect European energy security against possible transatlantic interventions. He also said Russia could be relied on to keep gas flowing as it needed the revenue from European importers. “As long as Russia needs this market, we can manage that wonderfully,” he said. With more than 80 percent of necessary approvals on the route already granted, Seele said he hoped Denmark would give approval for the pipeline to be built near its coast in the summer. Regarding OMV’s work in Iran, Seele said the Austrian group planned to conclude seismic studies but would not pursue projects further, after the United States withdrew from a nuclear pact with Tehran and said it would reimpose sanctions. “Let’s face it, you cannot simply carry on in Iran,” he said. “U.S. sanctions are a much bigger risk for OMV’s business than any possible compensation that Europe ... could offer.” The European Union signatories to the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran have said they want to keep the deal in place. OMV started operations in Iran in 2001 as operator of the Mehr exploration block in the west of the country. It halted work in 2006 due to sanctions, but signed several agreements for new projects when the 2015 deal was reached. Reporting by Kirsti Knolle

2018-06-12,"HAMBURG/BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) supervisory board will on Monday discuss German prosecutors’ investigation into the head of its Audi brand, as the carmaker weighs up how to tackle the latest fallout from its 2015 emissions scandal, sources said. Munich prosecutors said on Monday Audi (NSUG.DE) Chief Executive Rupert Stadler and another member of Audi’s top management were being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and had their apartments searched. Stadler has been under fire since Audi admitted in November 2015 - two months after Volkswagen - that it used illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines.  The 55-year-old has held onto his post mainly thanks to the backing from members of Volkswagen’s (VW) controlling Porsche-Piech families. VW’s supervisory board, which includes representatives of the ruling families, labour leaders, shareholders and officials from the group’s home state of Lower Saxony, want to hear from the carmaker’s lawyers what evidence the prosecutors have against Stadler, sources close to VW said on Tuesday. Next Monday’s board meeting was arranged a while ago and was not triggered by this week’s move by the prosecutors to widen their probe into Audi, one source said. News of the probe has come just as VW’s new group CEO Herbert Diess is trying to introduce a new leadership structure and speed up the group’s costly shift towards electric vehicles in the wake of its emissions scandal. But recurring problems at Audi, the group’s main profit engine, continue to pose distractions. Last month, the Ingolstadt-based luxury brand said it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars. An expert committee set up by VW’s supervisory board in 2015 to lead internal investigations is due on Monday to brief the 20-strong board on its progress, another source said. Munich prosecutors accuse Stadler of taking no action in late 2015 to stop deliveries of manipulated Audi models in Europe, a person familiar with the matter said. Stadler could not be reached for comment. A source close to VW’s supervisory board said support for Stadler from the Porsche and Piech families could dwindle if the probe found strong evidence of wrongdoing against him. For the time being, however, the families were still backing Stadler, he added.     Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group’s controlling clan.

2018-06-12,"HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is pushing deeper into energy trading, building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk-management systems to lift profit, according to executive recruiters and people familiar with the business.   The development is a sea change for a company that has stood out from rivals by limiting its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter.  Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon (XOM.N) expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade.   Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore (GLEN.L), the world’s second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N).  This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc BLT.L trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP’s first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later. The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc (BP.L), Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions. “Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,” said a trading house executive who knows Butcher.  Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks. Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon’s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.      “Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,” said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. “A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.”   Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc (BP.L), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses. During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell (RDSa.L) often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division. Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon’s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale. Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms. “Exxon still doesn’t plan to begin speculative paper trading,” said one source familiar with Exxon’s thinking. Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025.  The company’s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business.  Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople. Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading.     “We’ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it’s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,” said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved.

2018-06-12,"* India’s May Iran oil imports up 10.2 percent from April * Oil imports from Iran to ease from June By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, June 12 (Reuters) - India’s oil imports from Iran surged to about 705,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, their highest level since October 2016, according to data from shipping and industry sources, despite the threats of fresh U.S. sanctions. From June India’s oil imports from Iran could drop because at least two refiners — accounting for about 35 percent of Indian refining capacity of around 5 million bpd — are preparing to curb purchases under pressure from the U.S. sanctions. On May 8 U.S. President Donald Trump said that the United States was pulling out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions seeking to reduce the country’s oil shipments. India’s oil imports from Iran in May rose by 10.2 percent from the previous month and were about 45 percent more than a year ago, the data showed. Iran’s oil exports hit 2.7 million bpd in May, Iranian news agency SHANA reported this month, representing a record high since the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran in 2016. Indian state refiners had cut oil imports from Iran in the 2017/18 financial year because of a dispute over development rights for a giant gas field. However, the refiners had drawn plans to raise imports in the current fiscal year from April after Iran agreed to steep shipping discounts. India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, is Iran’s second-biggest customer behind China. Nayara Energy, formerly known as Essar Oil and in which Russia’s Rosneft holds a majority stake, has started reducing Iranian oil imports from this month, sources said. In May Nayara was the biggest Indian buyer of Iranian oil, receiving more than 200,000 bpd, the data showed. Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, is preparing to halt imports of Iranian oil from October or November, sources said. India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week said the country has adopted a “wait and watch” policy pending clarity on the impact of U.S. sanctions. In the first five months of 2018 India imported 583,500 bpd from Iran, about 6.5 percent more than a year ago, data from the sources showed. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media. Iran remained the third-biggest oil supplier to India last month behind Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the data showed, with the United Arab Emirates having replaced Venezuela as the fourth-biggest supplier. Overall, India imported 4.34 million bpd in May, about 2.8 percent higher than a year ago. The U.S. sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry will take effect after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4, but many European refiners and Asian buyers are already winding down Iranian oil purchases.

2018-06-12,"(Adds details, background, analyst) CAIRO, June 12 (Reuters) - Egypt announced on Tuesday new cuts to electricity subsidies, raising prices by an average of 26 percent from July, the latest in a raft of tough economic reforms. Electricity Minister Mohamed Shaker said electricity costs for factories would rise by 42 percent and for households by 21 percent. Egypt has committed to deep cuts to energy subsidies and other tough fiscal measures as part of a three-year, $12 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme begun in 2016. The government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, re-elected for a second term this year, intends to take further tough measures, including fuel subsidy cuts expected in the summer. Egypt’s economy was hit during the years of unrest following the 2011 popular uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. The IMF has praised Egypt’s economic reforms, which included a currency float in 2016 that halved the value of the pound. Economists see some grounds for hope in reviving the economy, pointing to indicators such as GDP growth, which rose to 5.4 percent in the third quarter of 2017-2018, up from 4.3 percent during the same period the previous fiscal year. Egypt’s fiscal year runs from July to June. The government has said electricity subsidies will be phased out completely by the end of the 2021-2022 fiscal year. Egypt will be “forced to increase administered prices by more than it otherwise would have done in order to meet IMF mandated fiscal targets,” Capital Economics said in a report in May. It said fuel price rises would have to rise by 60 percent in July to keep the subsidy reform programme on track. Many ordinary Egyptians have been hit hard by the austerity measures, especially the currency devaluation. But the moves are seen as vital to improve the battered economy, however. “It will be challenging for middle income and lower income groups,” Radwa El-Swaify, head of research at Pharos, told Reuters in May. “However, the government has implemented different social packages ... trying to alleviate some of the negative impact on the lower income groups.” Reporting by Ehab Farouk and Nadine Awadalla

2018-06-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC said the oil market outlook in the second half of 2018 is highly uncertain even though the producer group’s figures show a global glut has ended, suggesting talks next week on relaxing a supply cut deal won’t be straightforward. OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers have been cutting output since January 2017 to get rid of excess supply and boost prices. The deal’s goal was originally to reduce inventories in developed nations to that of the five-year average.  In a report on Tuesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said those inventories in April fell to 26 million barrels below the five-year average. That’s down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017. With oil LCOc1 hitting $80 a barrel this year, the highest since 2014, Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising output. But Iran disagrees and Iraq has voiced restraint, pointing to a tough policy meeting on June 22-23 in Vienna. OPEC in the report was cautious on the outlook for the rest of 2018, citing a faster-than-expected rise in non-OPEC oil production and the chances of global demand weakening. “Recent developments in the oil market have led to pronounced uncertainty about the second half of the year,” OPEC said in the report. “While oil demand in the U.S., China and India shows some upside potential, downside risks might limit this potential going forward.” Oil LCOc1 pared an earlier decline after the report was released trading just above $76 a barrel.  While the main goal of the supply deal was to reduce oil stocks to the five-year average, ministers have said other metrics should be considered, also suggesting they are in no hurry to end supply cuts. The report said OPEC members were still cutting much more than needed, even though output in May rose slightly and top exporter Saudi Arabia is boosting supply. OPEC output climbed by 35,000 barrels per day to 31.87 million bpd, OPEC said, according to figures it collects from secondary sources. That is almost 900,000 bpd less than the amount OPEC says the world needs from the group this year. Figures reported directly by OPEC members showed some bigger rises in production. Saudi Arabia told OPEC its output rose to 10.03 million bpd, up 161,000 bpd from April, although this is still below Riyadh’s OPEC target. Venezuela, whose plunging output due to an economic crisis has helped boost OPEC compliance with the deal, told OPEC production rose by 28,000 bpd to 1.533 million bpd. April’s figure was the lowest in decades. Strong demand due to a robust economy has helped remove the glut. OPEC left its global demand growth estimate this year unchanged at 1.65 million bpd and said oil use would surpass 100 million bpd for the first time during the fourth quarter. But the higher prices that have followed the OPEC-led deal have prompted growth in rival supply and a flood of U.S. shale. OPEC expects non-OPEC supply to expand by 1.86 million bpd this year, about 130,000 bpd more than expected last month. OPEC said there is a “wide forecast range” of 1.7 million bpd in estimates of the amount of crude the group needs to pump in the second half, meaning demand could be significantly more or less than members’ current output.   “This outlook for the second half of 2018 warrants close monitoring of the factors impacting both world oil demand and non-OPEC supply that will shape the outlook of the oil market going forward,” OPEC said.

2018-06-12,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2JD9EEe By John Kemp LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Investors continue to reduce their bullish position in crude oil futures and options, after a blistering rally over the last year, but now the profit-taking has spread to refined fuels such as gasoline and heating oil. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 72 million barrels in the week to June 5, according to data from regulators and exchanges. Funds cut their net long positions in Brent (-14 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-19 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-17 million), U.S. heating oil (-12 million) and European gasoil (-10 million). Portfolio managers have trimmed their combined net long in petroleum to 1.113 billion barrels, down from a recent high of 1.411 billion on April 17 and a record 1.484 billion on Jan. 23. Heavy liquidation has seen the combined position cut by 298 million barrels over the last seven weeks, with most of the reduction coming from crude, where net length has been reduced by 302 million barrels. But in the two most recent weeks the liquidation has spread to gasoline, heating oil and gasoil, reflecting broader doubts about the sustainability of the rally (tmsnrt.rs/2JD9EEe). Oil consumption growth has been strong and the combination of OPEC output restraint and involuntary production losses from Venezuela and other countries has pushed the market into deficit this year. However, with benchmark crude prices up by almost 70 percent over the last 12 months, and now apparently stalling, many fund managers appear to have decided now is a good time to realise some profits. Most of the reduction in net length has come from the liquidation of long positions (-232 million barrels) rather than the creation of fresh short positions (+66 million barrels) confirming profit-taking is the main motive. Indeed, total short positions remain very low at just 175 million barrels across all six major contracts. Fund managers remain overwhelmingly bullish about the outlook for oil, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a ratio of more than 7:1. They are just a little bit less bullish than in the middle of April, when the ratio was almost 14:1.

2018-06-12,"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand.     Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants, ahead of an initial public offering next year - the largest IPO in history. The state oil giant is moving ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects in China, India and Malaysia and aims to finalize new partnerships this year, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, Aramco’s senior vice president for downstream, told Reuters.     Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from some 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030, he added. Aramco pumps around 10 million bpd of crude oil. “Our strategy is very simple. We want to be at 8 to 10 million barrels per day of participated (refining) capacity ... (and) we are going forward by trying to be a top leader in chemicals by 2040,” Judaimi said. “The market that we want to grow in ... has to be growing, a strong market, with good demand and of course these assets have to be integrated to the whole value chain of the downstream,” he said in an interview at Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran.      To help it reach these targets, Aramco has entered a 50 percent joint venture with three Indian refiners to build a $44 billion, 1.2-million-bpd refinery integrated with petrochemical facilities on India’s west coast.      Aramco has said it may introduce a strategic partner to share its 50 percent stake in the Indian refining venture. Judaimi said Aramco was working with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) toward securing a partnership. It would be the first time for the two national oil companies to join hands in an international venture. “We are now finalizing the MOU (with ADNOC) that would cover certain commercial principles between us,” he said, adding that the memorandum of understanding would be finalised this year. He said front-end engineering for the project could start by early 2019.     Apart from India, Aramco is also taking a 50 percent stake in Petronas’ huge RAPID project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor. Aramco hopes this will help it dominate supplies in India and Malaysia, two of the world’s fastest-growing oil markets after China, and where growth potential is bigger than in other, more developed regions. Aramco is eyeing three separate refining and petrochemical projects in China, Judaimi said.     “Asia has to have the lion’s share ... We believe markets east of the Suez Canal will continue to grow, including the Middle East as well,” Judaimi said, adding that the United States is “another market we want to grow in”. In April, Aramco said it was integrating a petrochemicals business into its subsidiary Motiva, the United States’ biggest oil refinery.     Aramco is strengthening its refining role in China, one of its biggest customers. It has a refinery joint venture with Sinopec and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and is in talks with CNPC to finalize the purchase of a stake in a 260,000-bpd refinery in Yunnan.  Judaimi said he expects to take a final investment decision on the Yunnan refinery, which is operational, by the end of this year.  “We are in the final stage of negotiations. It’s like building a house - the last touches take much longer.”  Aramco plans to build a 300,000-bpd refinery with China’s Norinco. Judaimi said he expects to finish front-end engineering for the Norinco project by mid-2019, following which the company will take its final investment decision. Judaimi said Aramco had also started negotiations for a third refinery in China.  “It’s a smart refinery with higher conversion of liquids into chemicals,” he said, declining to give details. Aramco has been integrating its refining with petrochemicals to help the company expand its market share and refined products portfolio. The company is betting on growing demand for fuel in India and Southeast Asia but also shifting more into petrochemicals in case those consumption forecasts prove too optimistic. “In the long term, we are thinking of investing more into chemicals,” he said. “We know the world needs chemicals ... as populations grow they need more plastic,” he added. One centerpiece of Aramco’s push into chemicals is a project it is building at home with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company. The $20 billion project with SABIC is to build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage. Judaimi said Aramco would make a final investment decision by the end of 2019.  “This is a very critical program and we are going to do all we can to make it happen,” Judaimi said.  “We believe we are the last man standing in terms of energy supply. Our cost position on the upstream side, our reliability, our location and our infrastructure are all competitive advantages to us.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-downstream/exclusive-saudi-aramco-eyes-partnerships-as-it-expands-refining-petrochems-idUKL8N1TC0CE,12 Jun 2018,"Saudi Aramco

U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, while Washington committed to providing security guarantees for its old enemy. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell nearly 0.1 percent on the day. The dollar slipped into negative territory in morning trade in Europe after earlier reaching a three-week high. It was last flat on the day. Investors had mixed reactions to the summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved. “Any de-escalation is good, because in the background you always have worries about these situations,” said Old Mutual Global Investors European fund manager Ian Ormiston, adding trade conversations over the weekend at the G7 summit were more concerning. Others, such as RBC Capital Markets’ head of Asia FX strategy Sue Trinh said there was “nothing particularly game-changing” about the summit and both sides stood far apart on what denuclearisation means. “To the U.S., it means North Korea must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means North Korea suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the U.S. stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region.” In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan’s Nikkei paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan seesawed between positive and negative, and was last up 0.15 percent. South Korean shares were weaker while Chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red. The blue-chip CSI 300 index jumped about 1.3 percent. Europe had a muted open, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index last up less than 0.1 percent. Futures indicated a lower open on Wall Street. Investor focus was shifting to the two major central bank meetings later this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday, where it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year. Futures contracts indicate a 96 percent probability the fed funds rate will be raised a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, according to CME Group. Investors are focused on how the U.S. central bank characterizes its monetary policy as borrowing costs return to normal amid an economic expansion. The Fed may signal whether it feels the era of loose money is, in effect, over. U.S. inflation data due later in the day will also add to speculation over the path for U.S. interest rates later this year. Markets now are pricing in slightly more than one chance in five rates will be raised for a fourth time this year. On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets, and some expect the Bank to provide guidance for an ending of its bond-buying programme at the end of this year. The spread between Italian and German 10-year borrowing costs narrowed as the U.S.-North Korea summit drew to a close, adding a relief rally on reassuring comments from Italy’s new economy minister. In currencies, the dollar was 0.1 percent lower against a basket of its peers. It jumped to a three-week top against the yen of 110.49 and was last at 110.25. The British pound was up 0.1 percent as a crucial parliamentary debate began on amendments to Britain’s European Union withdrawal bill. The euro was flat. In commodities, U.S. crude was down 0.3 percent to $65.94 per barrel. Brent crude fell half a percent to $76.07. Spot gold slipped 0.2 percent to $1,297.64 an ounce.

2018-06-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy regulator plans to force companies to pay compensation to customers facing problems when switching supplier, in a bid to encourage more people to make the change. Customers could be paid at least 30 pounds ($40.15) for any issue faced, such as lengthy delays in any repayment or incorrect billing, under proposals launched by regulator Ofgem on Tuesday. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found households overpaid 1.4 billion pounds a year from 2012 to 2015 because of uncompetitive standard tariffs, prompting the government to encourage people to switch supplier. Switching to smaller independent suppliers has cut the market share of Britain’s big six energy suppliers to a record low in 2017 of 79 percent for electricity and 78 percent for gas, compared to 84 percent for both in 2016. Britain’s six biggest suppliers are Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, SSE (SSE.L), E.ON (EONGn.DE), EDF Energy (EDF.PA), Innogy’s (IGY.DE) Npower and Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power. The new proposals, which could be in place by the end of 2018 should boost consumer confidence in switching, Ofgem said. The regulator said most switches ran smoothly but some customers have faced issues such as struggling to get money back from old suppliers when they were in credit or being incorrectly billed. Ofgem also plans to introduce a price cap for standard tariffs by the end of the year but has said switching supplier may still offer the best value even when the cap is in place.

The sale, run by Scotiabank (BNS.TO), could fetch up to $250 million, according to banking sources. The transaction would mark the latest exit of a long-standing player in the ageing basin as a new generation of companies, many with the backing of private equity, seeks to inject new life into oil and gas fields. Itochu, through its British subsidiary CIECO UK, is offering to sell its 23 percent stake in the Western Isles field cluster in the northern North Sea, located some 160 km (100 miles) east of the Shetland islands. The field, which is operated by British group Dana Petroleum [KOILCD.UL], started production in November 2017 and yielded 45,000 barrels of oil per day in April 2018, according to the sale brochure.  Itochu is also selling a 26 percent stake in the Hudson field and small stakes in the Brent System Pipeline and the Sullom Voe Terminal. Bids are due by midday London time on June 27, the document showed. Itochu and Scotiabank did not respond to requests for comment. Itochu recently agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the Iraqi West Qurna 1 oilfield from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), signalling that the Japanese firm is turning its attention to new regions. It entered the North Sea in the early 1990s. The sale does not include CIECO’s 12 percent stake in the Verbier discovery, operated by Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL).

2018-06-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - The oil industry will face the biggest squeeze on its spare production capacity in more than three decades if OPEC and its allies agree next week to hike crude output, leaving the world more at risk of a price spike from any supply disruption. Spare capacity is the extra production oil producing states can bring onstream and sustain at short notice, providing global markets with a cushion in the event of natural disaster, conflict or any other cause of an unplanned supply outage. That buffer could shrink from more than 3 percent of global demand now to about 2 percent, its lowest since at least 1984, if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers decide to increase output when they meet on June 22-23, U.S. bank Jefferies said. “You would essentially be taking 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of spare capacity down to approximately 2 million bpd,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said, adding global demand was 100 million bpd. Some analysts say spare capacity could even fall below 2 percent, after years of low oil prices drove down investment in new production across the industry. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader which has indicated its support for hiking output at next week’s meeting in Vienna, has said it is alert to the potential squeeze on the market. “We are concerned about tight spare capacity nowadays,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters last month, although he also said the industry was in “better shape” than in 2016 when oil prices plunged below $30 a barrel. OPEC and its allies have been curbing supply since January 2017 to boost oil prices and cut bloated global inventories. The price of crude has since surged, climbing above $80 a barrel last month, while inventories have also fallen. (Graphic: OECD Stocks - reut.rs/2JEg5dG) But falling inventories, which have now dropped back to around their five-year average in industrialised nations, adds to the conundrum facing OPEC.  “Today we no longer have an inventory cushion or a large spare capacity,” Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), said in January. “In this context, any geopolitical event can create a price spike.” Oil prices have faced one jolt already this year. A U.S. decision to pull out from an international nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions helped prices climb to their highest since 2014. Sliding Venezuelan output has added to supply concerns. (Graphic: Venezuela Oil Production - tmsnrt.rs/2JpqiLT) “The high level of inventory over the past few years has meant that the market did not need to react to rising political risk, because the inventory was effectively the same thing as spare capacity,” Gammel of Jefferies bank said. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters last week that the oil price could jump to $140 if U.S. sanctions hurt his oil exports from this country, the third biggest producer in OPEC behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 is now trading above $76.  Martijn Rats, Morgan Stanley’s global oil strategist, said oil prices would be supported “if supply and demand is in balance, if inventories have drawn significantly and spare capacity isn’t all that great.” The precise level of spare capacity available depends in part on how it is defined. The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), which bases its figures on oil production that can be brought onstream within 90 days and sustained for an extended period, estimates OPEC’s spare production capacity was 3.47 million bpd in April, with Saudi Arabia accounting for roughly 60 percent. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which defines it as production that can be brought online for 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days, put OPEC’s spare capacity at 1.91 million bpd in the first quarter. Based on the EIA definition, Robert McNally at consultancy Rapidan Energy Group said Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates together had spare capacity of about 2.3 million bpd. “So were they to raise by 1 million bpd, then 1.3 million bpd is left, scraping the low end of the range historically and uncomfortably tight given the high and rising geopolitical disruption risk,” McNally said. (Graphic: OPEC spare production capacity - tmsnrt.rs/2JoZaML) But OPEC, Russia and others have said any increase in output would be made gradually. Consultancy Energy Aspects said Gulf OPEC members would likely add less than 1 million bpd immediately, rising to about 1.5 million bpd in three to six months. Energy Aspects analyst Sam Alderson said he expected OPEC and Russia to add about 500,000 bpd of production in the second half of 2018, which would reduce spare capacity as a percentage of demand to about 1.75 percent by December 2018. (Graphic: Actual OPEC spare capacity png - tmsnrt.rs/2JDnTw8) Saudi Arabia, with the bulk of the world’s spare capacity, has said it would need 90 days to move rigs to drill new wells and raise production to 12 million or 12.5 million bpd. The kingdom’s output in May was about 10 million bpd. But Saudi Arabia could even boost production beyond its stated output capacity of about 12.5 million bpd, possibly adding another 1 million bpd of what is known as surge capacity. The kingdom did this during wars in the Gulf and Iraq, but the surge in output was only sustained for a few months.

2018-06-12,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - World stocks crept higher on Tuesday while the dollar turned negative after hitting a three-week high at the end of a U.S.-North Korea summit aimed at the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, while Washington committed to provide security guarantees for its old enemy. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was higher by less than 0.1 percent on the day. The dollar slipped into negative territory in European trade after earlier hitting a three-week high. Investors had mixed reactions to the summit, which ended with the signing of a joint statement that gave few details on how the goals set by both sides would be achieved. “Any de-escalation is good because in the background you always have worries about these situations and if we compare where we were a year ago with talk of fire and fury and the like, we are clearly at a better place,” said Old Mutual Global Investors European fund manager Ian Ormiston, adding trade conversations over the weekend at the G7 summit were more concerning. Others, such as RBC Capital Markets’ head of Asia FX strategy Sue Trinh said although a historic event, there was “nothing particularly game-changing” about the summit and both sides stood far apart on what denuclearisation means. “To the U.S., it means North Korea must deliver complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation. To Kim, it means North Korea suspends nuclear and missile tests in exchange for major economic concessions and the U.S. stepping back as torchbearer for the Asian region.” In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan’s Nikkei paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan seesawed between positive and negative territory, and was last up 0.15 percent. South Korean shares were a tad weaker while Chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red. The blue-chip CSI 300 index jumped about 1.3 percent. Europe had a muted open, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.1 percent. Investor focus was shifting to the two major central bank meetings later this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting on Wednesday, where it is widely expected to deliver its second interest rate hike for the year. U.S. inflation data due later in the day will also add to speculation over the path for U.S. interest rates later this year. Markets are currently pricing a slightly more than 1 in 5 chance of a fourth interest rate hike by the end of the year. On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets and some expect the Bank to provide guidance for an ending of its massive bond-buying programme at the end of this year. Due at 0900 GMT is the ZEW index of economic sentiment, which may provide markets a glimpse of whether recent economic data misses in Europe have dented sentiment in corporate Germany. In currencies, the dollar was 0.1 percent lower against a basket of peers. On the safe haven yen, the dollar jumped to a three-week top of 110.49 in early deals. It was last at 110.25. Helping calm markets were comments from Italy’s new coalition government that it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt. The euro was just below a three-week high of $1.1840, up 0.1 percent on the day. In commodities, U.S. crude was rose half a percent to $66.39 per barrel, while Brent climbed half a percent to $76.86. Spot gold slipped 0.2 percent to $1,296.95 an ounce.

2018-06-12,"* Utility demand, tight supply boosting fuel oil crack since April * Crack to remain elevated through summer on utility demand * Disruptions, lower crude prices could limit post-summer decline By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, June 12 (Reuters) - Asian refining margins for fuel oil are set to hold near their current strong levels through the summer as increased use of the fuel by utilities to power air conditioners for cooling and disruptions to trade flows shrink global supplies. “Robust power generation demand in the Middle East (notably Saudi Arabia) should result in lower fuel oil outflows from the region,” said Iman Nasseri, managing director of energy consultancy FGE’s Middle East office. While fuel oil markets typically strengthen during the northern hemisphere summer months, four trade sources said fuel oil margins have demonstrated additional strength this year by shrugging off sharp gains in crude oil prices, which in mid-May climbed to their highest since November 2014. The trade sources declined to be identified as they are unauthorised to speak to the media. “Fears over falling Iranian supply ... structural falls in global supply, and a strong seasonal demand uptick in the Middle East for power generation are combining to provide support,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a research note last week. Lower fuel oil output in Venezuela due to refinery outages and a lack of crude oil, and refinery upgrades in Russia, the Middle East, India and South Korea have all contributed to tightening global supplies of the fuel, used to generate electricity and power industrial boilers and ships. With the fuel oil surplus in the Middle East shrinking this year and next due to increased oil-fired power plant expansions, the region is projected to become a net fuel oil importer by mid-2019, though only for a short period of time, Nasseri said. Increasing Saudi Arabian power demand amid falling supply from there, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait underpin the big shift, he said. The 180-centistoke high-sulphur fuel oil discount to Dubai crude on Monday settled at $3.21 a barrel, with Dubai crude DUB-1M-A holding above $74 a barrel. In November 2014, when Dubai crude was last at similar levels, the same fuel oil crack or margin was at a discount wider than $6 a barrel. Reflecting fuel oil’s strength, the Singapore crack was the only one to post gains over the past few weeks, with ample supplies and rising crude prices weighing on other refined fuels, including gasoline and diesel. “Fuel oil cracks should weaken as we move through (second-half 2018) as seasonal demand support wanes and destocking pressures from a highly backwardated market ... compensate for growing tightness in the fundamental balance,” JBC said. While strength in fuel oil markets subsides with the passing of peak utility demand, though, some analysts and traders see limited downside for fuel oil in the second half of the year. In addition to tightening supplies, looming U.S. sanctions on  oil exports from Iran - a major fuel oil producer with exports of about 17 million tonnes in 2017 - could further limit fuel oil outflows, mainly to Asia. Also, expectations of higher crude supplies in the second half of the year amid rising output from producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including the United States and Russia, could weigh on crude prices, potentially lending support to fuel oil cracks.

2018-06-12,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING, June 12 (Reuters) - Chinese truck drivers are demonstrating against higher fuel costs and the dominance of local truck hire platform Manbang which they said is squeezing incomes, a potential headache for the firm backed by SoftBank Group Corp and Alphabet Inc. Since late last week, demonstrations by truck drivers have been seen in over a dozen locations around China, according to Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, which tracks labour action in mainland China. On social media, photos and videos circulated showing long lines of parked trucks adorned with banners. The demonstrations come as oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 in recent weeks, scraping $80 per barrel and stoking cost increases for businesses and consumers, especially in large oil-importing nations such as China. The truck drivers also cited a squeeze on haulage rates due to the dominance of Manbang, formally known as Full Truck Alliance Group. Manbang raised $1.9 billion in April from Japan’s Softbank and Alphabet’s venture capital fund CapitalG. The firm is often described as China’s “Uber for trucks”, in reference to U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc . It runs an app that allows companies to connect with truck drivers - often independent contractors - tapping into demand for haulage in one of the world’s busiest markets for goods transport. China Labour Bulletin said that earlier in June, Manbang implemented a policy to prevent registered truck drivers and customers from contacting each other directly, to ensure transactions and haulage rates were set only via the app. Manbang, formed in a merger of haulage platforms Yun Man Man and Huo Che Bang, did not respond to requests for comment. The firm in April said 5.2 million of China’s 7 million freight trucks were members of the Full Truck Alliance Group. Demonstrations were recorded in provinces including Shandong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hubei, Henan and Zhejiang, the labour monitor said. Banners featured slogans such as “boycott low prices” and “truckers all rise”. There were also messages threatening violence toward truck drivers who did not strike. So far, there have been no reports of any significant impact from the demonstrations. China’s truckers are not alone. On Sunday, drivers in Bosnia blocked roads to demonstrate against rising fuel prices. Reporting by Adam Jourdan and Pei Li

Trump said the process of denuclearisation would happen “very, very quickly”, adding he had formed a “special bond” with Kim and the relationship with North Korea would be very different. “The letter that we’re signing is very comprehensive and I think both sides are going to be very impressed with the result,” Trump said after a “really very positive” summit meeting in Singapore. “A lot of goodwill went into this, a lot of work, a lot of preparation.” Both leaders are set to hold a press conference later. The dollar rose against the safe-haven yen, while the Korean won pared gains to stay near a recent two-week trough. Spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for Europe while E-Minis for the S&P 500 also gained 0.1 percent. Kim had earlier said the meeting was “a good prelude to peace”, just months after the two leaders traded insults and tensions spiralled in the region over the reclusive regime’s nuclear programmes. Yet, there was some unease among investors about the outcome of the talks given the tense relations between the two nations. The combatants of the 1950-53 Korean War are technically still at war, as the conflict, in which millions of people died, was concluded only with a truce. In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan’s Nikkei paring early gains to close 0.3 percent higher after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent.

South Korean shares were a tad weaker while Chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red. The blue-chip CSI 300 index jumped about 1.3 percent. “The peace on the Korean peninsula could deliver significant benefits to both North and South Korea, including potentially a re-rating for South Korean stocks,” analysts at Singapore’s DBS said in a note. “The landmark summit meeting should help to remove a major tail risk for the region’s markets and economies,” they added. “However, it would be prudent to contain excessive optimism, given the enormous gulf between the two Koreas and the costs of reunification.” Many analysts were uncertain about the overall impact on global economies and markets from the peace talks, with some pointing to a growing risk of an international trade war as a much bigger headwind to world growth. Just this past weekend, Trump upset the Group of Seven’s efforts to show a united front, choosing to back out of a previous joint communique. The action drew criticism from Germany and France, and Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” However, “markets are generally shrugging off the G7 trainwreck,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank.

What is perhaps more likely, is a positive opening act in a long drawn drama,” they said. “Expect a positive risk environment to persist if the summit can conclude without hiccups.” Many analysts said the bar was pretty low for what will be deemed a ‘successful’ summit, given the past failures in talks with North Korea. “So today, we have the opportunity for a historic meeting, a possible end to the Korean war, and a possible move to denuclearise, and maybe even demilitarize the Korean peninsula,” said Robert Carnell, chief economist Asia-Pacific at ING. “All of that’s great, but how can you make money from it. Well, the short answer is you probably shouldn’t even try.” Carnell said that a far bigger “existential global threat” was the ongoing tariff dispute after Trump upset the Group of Seven’s efforts to show a united front, choosing to back out of a previous joint communique.

2018-06-12,"HOUSTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is pushing deeper into energy trading, building a global cadre of experienced traders and beefing up risk-management systems to lift profit, according to executive recruiters and people familiar with the business. The development is a sea change for a company that has stood out from rivals by limiting its past activity out of concern it would be accused of market manipulation. Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter. Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade. Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore, the world’s second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66. This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP’s first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later. The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc , Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions. “Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,” said a trading house executive who knows Butcher. Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks. Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon’s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. “Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,” said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. “A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.” Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses. Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025. The company’s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business. Exxon has focused on hedges that allow it to get the best prices for its products and protect it against price shifts as its cargoes move to markets. Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople. Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading. “We’ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it’s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,” said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved.

2018-06-12,"(Updates with fresh levels throughout, adds analyst comment) * MSCI ex-Japan a tad firmer, Nikkei pares early gains * Trade volatile as U.S.-North Korea summit gets underway * Dollar rises to the highest in 3 weeks against yen By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, June 12 (Reuters) - The dollar jumped to a 3-week top on Tuesday while stock markets in Asia ticked higher as a landmark U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore raised hopes the bitter foes might be able to strike  a deal to end a nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had forged a “good relationship” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the start of their historic meeting, just months after they traded insults and tensions spiralled in the region over the reclusive regime’s nuclear programmes. Kim said the meeting was “a good prelude to peace”, but there was some unease among investors about the outcome of the talks given the tense relations between the two nations. The combatants of the 1950-53 Korean War are technically still at war, as the conflict, in which millions of people died, was concluded only with a truce. The dollar rose against the safe-haven yen, while the Korean won gained 0.2 percent to edge above a recent two-week trough. U.S. stock futures were barely changed with E-Minis for the S&P 500 up 0.02 percent and Dow futures inching 0.06 percent higher. In Asian equity markets, trading was volatile with Japan’s Nikkei paring early gains to add 0.3 percent after earlier rising as much as 0.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan seesawed between positive and negative territory, and was last up 0.1. South Korean shares fell 0.2 percent in choppy deals, while Chinese shares were buoyant after starting in the red with the blue-chip jumping 0.8 percent. Australian shares were a tad firmer. “It seems that investors are hesitant to carry large directional exposure into this week’s events,” Citi analysts said in a note. Even so, leveraged investors were long Korean won, Citi said citing the average of past four weeks of money flows. “Any disappointment from the summit could cause an unwind of such bullish positions. On the other hand, a successful summit could trigger a faster conversion into the Korean Won of foreign currency deposits.” Many analysts said the bar was pretty low for what will be deemed a ‘successful’ summit, given the past failures in talks with North Korea. “So today, we have the opportunity for a historic meeting, a possible end to the Korean war, and a possible move to denuclearise, and maybe even demilitarize the Korean peninsula,” said Robert Carnell, chief economist Asia-Pacific at ING. “All of that’s great, but how can you make money from it. Well, the short answer is you probably shouldn’t even try.” Carnell said that a far bigger “existential global threat” was the ongoing tariff dispute after Trump upset the Group of Seven’s efforts to show a united front, choosing to back out of a previous joint communique. The action drew criticism from Germany and France, and Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” However, “markets are generally shrugging off the G7 trainwreck,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. Instead, they are looking ahead to a busy week. Tuesday’s North Korea summit will be followed by policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise rates, and the European Central Bank as well as a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament. The dollar was well bid on Tuesday, with the dollar index up 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies. On the safe haven yen, the dollar jumped to a three-week top of 110.49 in early deals.

2018-06-12,"June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. solar installations are expected to be flat this year compared with 2017 due to weakness in several major residential markets and slower growth in big projects, according to a report released on Tuesday. The solar market, which for much of the last decade experienced runaway growth, is expected to be about the same as the 10.8 gigawatts installed in 2017, GTM Research said in a report commissioned by the Solar Energy Industries trade group. Government policies that support renewable energy and a sharp fall in the price of the technology propelled expansion. But the solar market fell 30 percent in 2017. The decline was anticipated because in 2016 developers completed a slew of projects ahead of what was supposed to be an expiration of a key tax credit. Ultimately, the credit was extended. GTM Research raised its forecast for utility-scale installations by 2 percent to 6.6 gigawatts, saying 2018 projects are relatively insulated from import tariffs on panels implemented by the Trump administration this year because many developers secured supplies prior to their implementation. Most of the impact of the tariffs will be seen next year and beyond, GTM said, reducing its forecast for 2019 by 600 megawatts. That market will still grow next year, by about 5 percent, but will be flat in 2021 and 2022 due to tariff-related project delays, the report said. Module prices averaged 47 cents per watt during the first quarter of 2018, 24 percent higher than the 38 cents they averaged a year ago due to the U.S. tariffs. The research firm ratcheted down its residential market outlook for 2018 by 8 percent from 2.4 GW to 2.2 GW. Mature residential markets including Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey are expected to decline this year, according to GTM analyst Austin Perea. Residential solar fell 15 percent last year but was flat during the first quarter. GTM said that was a promising sign that the market was recovering from a pullback over the last year by national installers like Tesla Inc. In the residential market, total system prices have stagnated due to the high cost of acquiring customers. Those costs have risen steadily over the last four quarters, GTM said.

2018-06-12,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The world’s first third-generation AP1000 reactor designed by U.S.-based Westinghouse is expected to be completed in China by November, the official Science Daily reported on Tuesday, citing a senior Chinese executive. The AP1000 unit in Sanmen in the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang was expected to reach criticality at the end of June and go into commercial operation by November, Chen Hua, chairman of the China National Nuclear Power Corp (CNNP) (601985.SS) was quoted as saying. China agreed in 2007 to build four AP1000 units, including two at Sanmen and two at Haiyang in Shandong province. The first was originally scheduled to be completed in 2014, but it has been beset by safety concerns and design changes. The project was delayed again in February, but fuel loading was finally approved in April. Criticality is the start of the fission process.  Westinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba (6502.T) filed for bankruptcy last year, hit by billions of dollars of cost overruns at four reactors being built in the United States. It originally saw the AP1000s at Sanmen and Haiyang as a shop window for its technology, and hoped to win more projects in China, one of the few countries with an active civil nuclear programme. But the disaster at Fukushima in 2011 forced Beijing to suspend new approvals and slow down construction plans, and it is now expected to focus primarily on its own third-generation reactor design known as the Hualong One. Third generation reactors refer to a series of new models with higher capacity, enhanced safety features and greater fuel efficiency. They also include Areva’s EPR now under construction in France, China, Finland and the United Kingdom.          The Hualong brand is competing with Russia’s VVER design, with Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom last week securing a deal to build four VVER-1200 units in China. The deal included two units at Xudaobao in northeast China’s Liaoning, a site once earmarked for Westinghouse’s AP1000.          China aims to bring total nuclear installed capacity to 58 gigawatts by the end of 2020 and have another 30 GW under construction. Total capacity stood at 35.8 GW by the end of last year, with nearly 23 GW under construction.  China has not approved any new projects in more than two years, but the government promised in March to commission another six to eight reactors in 2018.

2018-06-12,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s decision to curb solar power capacity growth and cut subsidies will help the sector focus on quality rather than quantity and ease the financial burden on the government, an energy official said in an interview with state news agency Xinhua. The country’s planning agency said at the beginning of the month that it would cut subsidies and approve no more than 30 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity this year as it tried to ensure that grid transmission capabilities could keep up with the vast number of new projects being commissioned. But China’s solar panel manufacturers last week urged authorities to rethink the plan, saying it would damage the sector at a critical time in its development. Some manufacturers were already facing closure as a result of overcapacity, Wang Bohua, vice-chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said in April. However, the unnamed energy official told Xinhua that while the new measures might hurt, they were a price worth paying. “The costs of solving the difficulties facing the photovoltaic industry are now much lower than the costs would have been after the recent bubble,” the official was quoted as saying.  The policies would help relieve a massive subsidy backlog now estimated at around 120 billion yuan ($18.75 billion), with the finance ministry struggling to find the funds to support the vast number of new projects. “If this abnormal increase (in capacity) continued, the subsidy gap would widen further and have an even more unfavorable impact,” he said.   China’s solar capacity rose by a record 53 GW in 2017, bringing the total to 130 GW by the end of the year. Solar makes up about 7 percent of China’s total generation capacity.

2018-06-12,"* Reuters Live blog - here * OPEC, non-OPEC producers due to meet on June 22 in Vienna By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed in early Asian trading on Tuesday as markets awaited the outcome of a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. Traders also said they were reluctant to take on large new positions ahead of a meeting between producer cartel OPEC and some of its allies on June 22. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $76.50 per barrel, up 4 cents from ther last close at (0003 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.16 a barrel, up 6 cents from their last settlement. Crude has been supported by healthy demand and voluntary production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), but analysts said oil markets were also currently heavily driven by public policy events and statements. Trump and Kim will hold a summit on Tuesday in Singapore, where both sides seek to narrow differences over how to end a nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula. The meeting is officially due to start at 0900 Singapore time (0100 GMT). “A positive resolution from Singapore is bullish for stocks,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, and several oil traders said crude futures could also get a lift from such an outcome. In oil market fundamentals, however, not all things point to higher prices, with output from the three biggest producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia on the rise. Russian production has reportedly risen from below 11 million barrels per day (bpd) to 11.1 million bpd in early June. In the United States, production has risen by almost a third in the last two years, to a U.S. record of 10.8 million bpd. Now, top exporter Saudi Arabia - which has so far led OPEC’s efforts to withhold supplies - is also showing signs of upping production. Saudi Arabia has told OPEC that it raised oil output to a little more than 10 million bpd in May, up from 9.9 million bpd in April. “This fits with the theory that the Saudis and Russians are subtly moving toward a change to the agreement at this month’s meeting,” McKenna said. OPEC, together with some non-OPEC producers including Russia, started withholding output in 2017 to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices. OPEC and its partners are due to meet on June 22 at the cartel’s headquarters in Vienna, Austria, to discuss policy. “Oil prices are likely to trade in a tight range ahead of next week’s OPEC meeting,” ANZ bank said on Tuesday.
