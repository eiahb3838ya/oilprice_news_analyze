2019-02-14,"(Adds company comment, details on costs) Feb 15 (Reuters) - Australia’s Whitehaven Coal said on Friday its first-half profit rose 19 percent helped by robust prices for its higher grade thermal coal, but investors were rattled by increasing costs, knocking its shares lower. Net profit for the six months ended Dec. 31 came in at A$305.8 million ($217.3 million), up from with A$256.2 million last year. “Recently imposed coal import restrictions by China have led to reduced demand for Indonesian low CV (calorific value) coal and have helped to increase the price differential that exists between high and low CV coals,” Whitehaven, which doesn’t sell to China, said in a statement. China cut coal imports last December following signals from Beijing that it would stop clearing shipments until 2019. Shipping data earlier this month showed dozens of ships carrying coal and iron ore to China stuck outside ports waiting to unload. Whitehaven said revenue for the period rose 11 percent during the period to A$1.27 billion. However, the cost of producing coal rose by A$12 a tonne for the period to A$69 a tonne, and it increased its full year cost guidance to A$67 a tonne from A$64 previously. Costs have risen due to higher diesel prices, increased washing of coal to sell more higher quality coal and lower output from the company’s lower cost mines, Whitehaven said. The company also trimmed its fiscal 2019 guidance for saleable coal to 21.5 million tonnes to 22.5 million tonnes, down from an earlier 22-23 million tonnes as it changed its output mix to take advantage of solid prices for higher grade coal. Whitehaven shares fell as much as 9.2 percent to a one-month low and were last trading down 5.6 percent at A$4.52 a share in a flat broader market. The company declared an interim dividend of 15 cents a share, above last year’s 13 cents a share, and said it would pay a special dividend of 5 cents a share. $1 = 1.4075 Australian dollars

2019-02-14,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s top two negotiators in trade talks with China will meet on Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but there has been no decision to extend a March 1 U.S. deadline for a deal, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday. “The vibe in Beijing is good,” Kudlow told Fox News Channel of the U.S.-China talks that are set to conclude on Friday in Beijing. But Kudlow’s upbeat assessment contrasted with reports from two people familiar with the talks, who said progress has been difficult on the thorniest issues involving U.S. demands that China make sweeping changes to curb forced technology transfers and to enforce intellectual property rights. Sources briefed on the talks also told Reuters that China had pledged to make its industrial subsidy programs compliant with World Trade Organization rules and end those that distort markets, but had offered no details on how it intends to achieve that goal. The offer has been met with skepticism from U.S. negotiators, in part because China has long refused to disclose its subsidies.   Negotiators from the two sides are pushing to de-escalate a tariff war that has dimmed global growth forecasts, roiled financial markets and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China are scheduled to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if the two sides do not reach a deal by March 1, increasing pressure and costs in sectors from consumer electronics to agriculture. Although U.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this week that an extension of the deadline was possible if a “real deal” was close, Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said the White House had made no such decision. The talks, scheduled to run through Friday, follow three days of deputy-level meetings to work out technical details, including a mechanism for enforcing any trade agreement. China proposed in the talks this week to increase purchases of U.S. semiconductors to $200 billion over six years as part of a deal to ease American tariffs, a person briefed on the talks told Reuters. But the semiconductor proposal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, was part of a “recycled” package of goods purchase offers that Beijing first presented in the spring of 2018, the source said. China has also offered to sharply increase purchases of U.S. soybeans and other farm and energy commodities to help cut the U.S. trade deficit, which exceeded $382 billion in 2018. News that Chinese buyers had canceled some recent orders for U.S. soybeans caused Chicago grain futures prices to tumble on Thursday , while negative sentiment weighed on U.S. stocks, keeping major indexes in negative territory. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opened high-level talks Thursday at the Diaoyutai state guest house with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that the negotiations had been progressing “very well.” A Bloomberg report cited sources as saying Trump was considering pushing back the deadline by 60 days to give negotiators more time after the Chinese side requested a 90-day extension. But a source familiar with the talks told Reuters on Wednesday, before the high-level talks began, that the Chinese had not raised the idea of a 90-day extension.   Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China’s nationalist Global Times tabloid, also tweeted that speculation on an extension was “inaccurate,” citing a source close to the talks. Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters he had no information on the trade talks’ progress.  Trump has said he did not expect to meet with Xi before March 1, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has raised the possibility of a meeting between the leaders at the president’s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she noted Trump had said many times he wished to meet with Xi, and that China was willing to maintain “close contact” with the U.S. side, but said she had no information to share on any visit by the Chinese president.     The Chinese government has offered few details about the state of negotiations this week.  Chinese January trade data released on Thursday showed imports from the United States fell 41.2 percent from a year earlier to $9.24 billion, the lowest amount in dollar terms since February 2016. Exports to the United States also declined 2.4 percent to $36.54 billion, the lowest amount since last April.       China’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $27.3 billion in January, from $29.87 billion in December.     China’s soybean imports fell 13 percent in January from a year earlier, customs data showed, as a hefty duty on shipments from the United States, its second largest supplier, curbed purchases.

2019-02-14,"TORONTO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said on Thursday it had taken a fresh stake in Suncor Energy Inc for the second time in about six years, sending the U.S.-listed shares of the energy major up 4 percent in after-market trading. Suncor, Canada’s biggest oil and gas company, is considered one of the safest Canadian energy companies to invest in, given its integrated structure and diversified business mix. Berkshire’s investment puts the Buffett stamp on Suncor and could be seen as a positive for the Canadian energy sector. The move comes at a time when global investors have been pulling away from Canada because of its carbon-intensive oil sands and struggle to approve pipelines.     Berkshire said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it has a stake of 10.8 million shares in the company, representing about 0.7 percent of Suncor’s total outstanding shares, according to Eikon data from Refinitiv. Ahead of Thursday’s news, Suncor’s shares had shed 17.3 percent in the last six months, due in part to Alberta’s decision to force mandatory production cuts last year.  The new position comes more than two years after Berkshire sold its stake in Suncor. Berkshire took a position in Suncor in 2013 and exited its stake in 2016.

2019-02-14,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc said it has trimmed its stake in iPhone maker Apple Inc, though none of the selling was Buffett’s, and added positions in Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc and software company Red Hat Inc. Berkshire also appeared to have shed a $2.13 billion stake in database software company Oracle Corp after having first disclosed it in November. It is rare for Berkshire, which owns some stocks for decades, to unwind an investment so fast.     The changes were disclosed in a Thursday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of Dec. 31, which shrank $38 billion in the quarter to $183.1 billion amid a broad selloff in stocks. A recent change in accounting rules means that decline will likely punish Berkshire’s reported net income, though not operating profit, when the Omaha, Nebraska-based company reports fourth-quarter and year-end results, expected on Feb. 23. Thursday’s filing includes investments by Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, but does not say who bought and sold what. Berkshire said in the filing that its Apple stake shrank to 249.6 million shares in the quarter from 252.5 million, reducing its reported stake to below $40 billion as Apple’s share price slid 30 percent. Buffett, though, had nothing to do with the selling. “One of the managers other than Warren had a position in Apple and sold part of it in order to make an unrelated purchase,” Buffett’s assistant Debbie Bosanek said in an email. “None of the shares under Warren’s direction have ever been sold.” Investors monitor Berkshire’s quarterly filings for signs about where Buffett, Combs and Weschler see value. Stock prices often move higher or lower when Berkshire discloses new stakes, or sheds old ones. Suncor shares rose 4 percent after Berkshire reentered the stock, which it last owned in the third quarter of 2016, owning 10.76 million shares worth $300.9 million. Shares of Red Hat rose 0.3 percent after Berkshire said it owned 4.18 million shares worth $733.4 million. Oracle shares fell 1.3 percent. Suncor, Red Hat, Oracle and Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive. Its last major acquisition was in January 2016.   Most other changes in Berkshire’s stock portfolio were relatively smaller, though it boosted its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co 41 percent to 50.1 million shares, worth $4.9 billion. Combs is a director at JPMorgan, which is working with Berkshire and Amazon.com Inc to create a new company aiming to cut employee healthcare costs.        Berkshire also confirmed its new, $261 million stake in StoneCo Ltd, a Brazilian credit card processor that went public in October.

2019-02-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are in Beijing this week as Chinese and American negotiators try to hammer out a trade deal to ease a trade war and avert an increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods scheduled for March 2. The governments of the world’s two largest economies have been locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle for months as Washington presses Beijing to address long-standing concerns over Chinese practices and policies around industrial subsidies, market access and intellectual property rights protections. Here is a look at the key issues in the talks and their implications: After years of steadily rising U.S. trade deficits with China and U.S. complaints that Beijing has systematically obtained American intellectual property and trade secrets through coercion and outright theft, the Trump administration last year demanded fundamental changes to China’s economic model to allow U.S. companies to compete on a more level playing field. These include an end to policies that Washington claims effectively force U.S. companies to transfer their technologies to Chinese partners and full protection for American intellectual property rights. At the most basic level, a dominant position in future high-technology industries, according to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office. China is determined to upgrade its industrial base in 10 strategic sectors by 2025, including aerospace, robotics, semiconductors, artificial intelligence and new-energy vehicles. U.S. officials say they do not have a problem with China moving up the technology ladder, but they do not want it to happen with stolen or unfairly obtained American know-how. They argue that China’s massive support for state-owned enterprises is leading to overproduction, making it hard for U.S. companies to compete on a market-driven basis.   Chinese officials generally view the U.S. actions as a broad effort to thwart the Asian country’s inevitable rise to a dominant position in the global economy. They deny that China requires or coerces technology transfers, saying that any such actions are commercial transactions between American and Chinese firms. At the same time, China is looking to make a deal with President Donald Trump to ease U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and to directly reduce the trade imbalance between the world’s two largest economies through increased purchases of U.S. goods, including soybeans and energy. Beijing has also taken some steps to open up to more imports, including lowering tariffs on imported cars and allowing foreign companies in some sectors to own a majority of their operations in China. Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on $250 billion worth of imported goods from China so far - a 25 percent duty on $50 billion worth of machinery, semiconductors and other technology-related products, and 10 percent tariffs on a broader, $200 billion range of goods that includes many chemicals, building materials, furniture and some consumer electronics. Thus far, Trump has spared many consumer goods, including cellphones, computers, clothing and footwear from tariffs. But if no deal is reached by March 2, the United States is scheduled to raise tariffs on the $200 billion in goods from China to 25 percent from 10 percent. Trump said on Wednesday that a delay was possible. Yes. China has imposed tariffs of 25 percent on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, including soybeans, beef, pork, seafood,  whiskey, ethanol and motor vehicles. Beijing also has imposed tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on another $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, including liquefied natural gas, chemicals, frozen vegetables and food ingredients. So far, Beijing has spared imports of U.S. commercial aircraft largely made by Boeing Co. Since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to pursue the current round of talks, China has also suspended tariffs on U.S.-made autos and has resumed some purchases of U.S. soybeans. China has pledged to make its industrial subsidy programs compliant with World Trade Organization rules and nondistortive to markets, but has offered no details on how it will achieve this, sources told Reuters. It’s unclear if that will be enough to satisfy U.S. negotiators, but that indicates China may be willing to address those American concerns. The two sides seemed far apart on industrial subsidies and forced technology transfer when they met in late January, though they indicated some progress had been made around intellectual property rights issues. A key U.S. demand is creating a mechanism for regular reviews of China’s progress on following through on any reform pledges that it makes, a plan that would maintain a perpetual threat of U.S. tariffs. China has also offered to make purchases of over $1 trillion worth of goods over the next six years, including of agricultural and energy products as well as industrial goods.     WILL U.S. OFFICIALS ACCEPT A DEAL BASED MAINLY ON PURCHASES? Trump has been optimistic about a deal, saying on Wednesday that the talks were going “very well”. But he indicated in his State of the Union address on Feb. 5 that big spending by China on American goods would not be enough for a deal. Any new trade deal with China “must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect American jobs,” he said in the address.  The president’s advisers say he will not soften his demands that China make structural reforms on intellectual property and related issues. The United States rebuffed some initial offers by China last spring to increase purchases of U.S. goods, choosing instead to proceed with tariffs.  The two sides could report some progress toward a deal and may extend the March 2 deadline to keep negotiating, as often happened during talks last year to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. A stalemate on core structural issues would be viewed as a negative sign, and investors would brace for higher tariffs. Trade negotiations often go down to the wire, so a final outcome is not likely before the end of February, and any agreement will need the approval of Trump and Xi. The two presidents have no meeting planned before the March deadline.

2019-02-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Tennessee Valley Authority voted on Thursday to close two aging coal-fired power plants, including one supplied by a company led by a major supporter of President Donald Trump, who had urged the U.S.-owned utility to keep it open.  “It is not about coal. This decision is about economics,” said President and Chief Executive Bill Johnson, who is retiring from the TVA. “It’s about keeping rates as low as feasible.”  Ahead of the vote, Johnson had said the plants, which operated only sporadically in recent years, had become too expensive to operate and that closing them would save customers $320 million. The board voted 5-2 to approve the closures. The members who voted to keep them open were both appointed by Trump.  The 870-megawatt Bull Run coal plant in Tennessee will close by December 2023 and the 971-MW Paradise 3 plant in Kentucky will be shut by December 2020. Both are about 50 years old. Johnson told Reuters in December that TVA will keep cutting carbon emissions in future years after replacing much of its coal-fired fleet with plants run on natural gas, nuclear and renewables. Paradise 3, which entered service in 1970, was mostly supplied with coal last year by Murray Energy, chaired by Robert Murray, a donor to Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016 and a frequent attendee at events held by the administration.  Early in the Trump presidency, Murray had presented the administration with a wish list of environmental regulations he wanted slashed.     Trump, whose base is partly made up of voters in coal country, has prioritized rolling back environmental regulations and opening up U.S. lands to mining and drilling.  The president had urged the TVA in a message on Twitter on Monday to consider the role of coal in the electric grid before voting.  His administration’s efforts to save coal plants with proposals to subsidize them have not been successful. More U.S. coal plants were shut in Trump’s first two years than were retired in the entire first term of former President Barack Obama. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In total, more than 23,400 MW of coal-fired generation were shut in 2017-2018 versus 14,900 MW in 2009-2012, according to data from Reuters and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). On Tuesday, the EIA said it expected coal’s contribution to the U.S. power mix to keep falling in coming years.  This year, it should average 26 percent of U.S. generation, down from 28 percent in 2018, and is set to fall to 24 percent by 2020. By contrast, natural gas-fired power plants will account for 36 percent and 37 percent of that generation respectively in 2019 and 2020, up from 35 percent last year.   Credit-rating agencies Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global both said the closure of the Kentucky plant was a modest credit risk for Murray Energy at most.  “You can surmise that (the coal produced for Paradise 3) is not a huge amount of their production,” said Benjamin Nelson, senior credit officer at Moody’s.    Nevertheless, the decline of the coal industry has led both agencies to incorporate the closure of plants into their credit ratings for Murray Energy, which currently stand at Caa1 by Moody’s and B- by S&P.  A distressed debt exchange worth $1.7 billion between the company and its bondholders in June 2018 was labeled by Moody’s as a “limited default,” and called “tantamount to default” by S&P. A deal later in the summer to refinance some of the company’s debt, which now stands at $830 million of bonds outstanding, has helped improve the company’s outlook. Murray said he was “extremely disappointed” in the TVA decision as his company has 690 employees near the plant who face an uncertain future.

2019-02-14,"CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government stepped up a  legal battle against efforts to oust him on Thursday, while the opposition said the international community had pledged more than $100 million in humanitarian aid for the country. Venezuela’s opposition, which argues Maduro’s presidency is illegitimate because he won in a sham vote, is trying to wrest control of the OPEC nation’s oil sector from him and deliver aid to a population suffering food and medicine shortages. Maduro says this is part of a strategy to carry out a U.S.-backed coup and has vowed to remain in office, despite around 50 nations recognising opposition leader Juan Guaido as president. Maduro retains the backing of key allies Russia and China as well as control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military. Venezuela’s chief state prosecutor, Tarek Saab, said on Thursday his office had opened an investigation into new opposition-appointed directors at state-run oil firm PDVSA and its U.S. refiner Citgo, Venezuela’s most valuable foreign asset. The pro-Maduro Supreme Court then ruled that the proposed board members were prohibited from leaving the country. At least some of the people are believed to already be outside Venezuela. Saab said Guaido had “grotesquely made circus-style appointments” in order to please foreign interests and destabilise the country.  “The only directors legitimately appointed to the boards of PDVSA and its subsidiaries are those ... who have been appointed by the executive,” Saab said, according to his office’s Twitter account. As head of the National Assembly, Guaido invoked constitutional provisions last month to assume the interim presidency.  The transitional government should include members of the ruling “Chavismo” movement and military leadership, in an effort to guarantee stability for new elections, a top opposition lawmaker said. That interim government would have 13 months to hold fresh presidential elections from the date Maduro officially steps down as president, Stalin Gonzalez, the second vice president of the congress, told Reuters. “We need to give space to sectors of Chavismo that are not Maduro because we need political stability,” Gonzalez said in an interview.    The opposition, made up of a coalition of parties, plans to hold primaries in order to put forward a sole candidate for the presidential elections, he added. Chavismo is the movement founded by former President Hugo Chavez, who Maduro succeeded following Chavez’ death in 2013 from cancer. Guaido’s U.S. representative, Carlos Vecchio, spoke to an aid conference on Thursday hosted at the Organization of American States (OAS) headquarters in Washington, to urge the international community to help get assistance into Venezuela. Vecchio and his aides estimated they had received pledges of more than $100 million in humanitarian assistance from the United States and others, including previous commitments as well as new ones made at the conference. “We must open thousands of windows to bring humanitarian aid to Venezuela,” Vecchio told the conference, which was attended by diplomats and representatives from dozens of countries. Elliott Abrams, Washington’s special representative on Venezuela, said the United States was looking for ways to send in aid as he reiterated U.S. support for Guaido. “I can assure you that there will be more U.S. assistance coming in the future,” Abrams said, without giving specifics. Guaido has said humanitarian aid will enter the country on Feb. 23, setting the stage for a showdown with Maduro, who has said it is not needed and should not be let in. Guaido’s declaration was “absolutely absurd” as he had “control of nothing,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Thursday.  “In Venezuela there’s only one government – the government of President Maduro - so no one can give deadlines, especially this man,” Arreaza told reporters at the United Nations.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it wants a peaceful resolution to the crisis but has refused to rule out military intervention. Cuba accused the United States on Thursday of moving special forces closer to Venezuela as part of a covert plan to intervene. Military aircraft from the United States had flown to strategically located Caribbean islands last week, Cuba said. “It’s a new lie,” Abrams said, when asked about it at the Washington event.

2019-02-14,"(Adds government response, additional comments from chief executive) LIMA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Canadian oil junior Frontera Energy Corp is reconsidering pursuing new investments in Peru due to government delays in fixing a key pipeline, the company’s chief executive said on Thursday. Richard Herbert added that Frontera might withdraw from its main oilfield in the country if the pipeline - run by state-owned Petroperu - remains inoperative for several more months. The four-decade old pipeline is needed to transport crude from oilfields in the Peruvian Amazon, including Frontera’s Block 192, to the Pacific coast. But it has been offline since late November, when Petroperu said it was severed by members of an indigenous community in a dispute related to local elections. Frontera has lost $10 million because of the problem and is now producing “almost nothing” from Block 192, Herbert said. Petroperu declined to comment. It has previously said that the native community of Mayuriaga has blocked its workers from fixing the pipeline. Community representatives could not immediately be reached. “If we have to wait months and months, we might reach the point where we can’t tolerate more losses,” Herbert told a news conference in Lima. “It’s getting harder and harder for me to persuade Frontera’s board of directors to consider future investments in the country when we have so many problems” and other countries are becoming more attractive, Herbert said. Herbert said Frontera plans to submit a bid on an oil block in Ecuador next month and is looking at potential new investments in Colombia. Peru’s Deputy Minister of Territorial Governance Raul Molina, who has led the government’s efforts to end the conflict, said his team is close to a deal with local leaders to open passage for Petroperu to repair the pipeline. “We are absolutely committed to finding a solution,” Molina said by phone. He added that talks have taken so long because the community has a long list of demands to discuss and the government does not want to unleash a violent conflict by breaking the blockade by force. Peru is a relatively small oil player in Latin America. Frontera started operating Peru’s largest oil block, 192, in the Amazonian region of Loreto, under a 2-year service contract in 2015. The contract has been repeatedly extended to compensate for periods in which Frontera was unable to operate due to problems with the pipeline, and is now set to expire in September. Frontera, which also operates a small offshore oil block in Peru, previously said it was interested in a long-term contract for Block 192. Reporting by Mitra Taj

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.88 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,439.39, the S&P 500 lost 7.3 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,745.73 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,426.96.

2019-02-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Thursday and Brent hit the highest level this year, but gains were capped after the steepest decline in U.S. retail spending since 2009 heightened investor fears of a global economic slowdown. U.S. stocks recovered from declines triggered by bleak retail data to trade flat by afternoon, as investors focused on signs of progress in the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. Oil prices fluctuated with the equities markets as the U.S. economy’s outlook was further dimmed by other data showing an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. [.N] “Between supply issues out of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and implications for demand swirling around the market as a result of the US-China trade war ... the crude oil and distillate markets have been subjected to a tug-of-war that has kept prices severely range-bound,” said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. Brent futures ended the session up 96 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $64.57 a barrel, after hitting a 2019 high of $64.81, while U.S. crude rose 51 cents, or 0.95 percent, to $54.41 a barrel, down from a session high of $54.68.    The price of crude has gained nearly 20 percent this year, driven primarily by the prospect of a decline in oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top exporters such as Russia.     The producer group known as OPEC+ has agreed to cut crude output by a joint 1.2 million barrels per day. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut even more in March than the deal called for. “While medium-term trends pose some challenges, we still see a balanced oil supply/demand outlook this year. Brent should average $70 in 2019, helped by voluntary (Saudi, Kuwait, UAE) and involuntary (Venezuela, Iran) declines in OPEC supply,” Bank of America analysts said in a note. “Some of today’s recovery in the oil also appeared to be related to some weakening in the U.S. dollar following early strong gains,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said. The dollar dropped to session lows on Thursday morning following the U.S. retail sales report. Oil prices also drew support from a surprise increase in China’s exports in January and a sharp rise in imports of crude oil before the Lunar New Year holidays in February.     However, in physical markets, the steep rise in availability of U.S. shale oil is leading to a build in domestic inventories of crude and in refined products. Government data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude stocks last week rose to their highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017.

2019-02-14,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Security forces rounded up some 30 people on Thursday as they dispersed protesters close to Sudan’s presidential palace calling on President Omar al-Bashir to quit, witnesses said. At their first joint news conference on Wednesday, Sudan’s main opposition groups also issued a call for Bashir to step down, saying they have agreed on a “programme that would take place after the regime falls”. The government in turn threatened action against groups it accused of advocating violence.  The protests, held near daily since Dec. 19 over frustrations with economic hardships, have become the most sustained challenge to Bashir’s three decades in power. In their latest protest in downtown Khartoum on Thursday, demonstrators chanted “Peaceful, peaceful against the thieves” and “Down, that’s it!”, witnesses said.  They said security forces in plainclothes and armed with  plastic pipes rounded up protesters close to the presidential palace and drove them away on pickup trucks. Police also chased other activists through side streets as smaller rallies broke out. A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. The president and his ruling National Congress Party have shown no sign of bowing to those demands and have blamed the unrest on unnamed foreign powers. He and senior officials have used more conciliatory language in recent weeks, promising to release detained demonstrators. But activists say hundreds remain in detention.  An opposition-linked doctors’ syndicate said last week that 57 people have been killed in the protests. The government puts the death toll at 31, including two security personnel.  Security forces have regularly used teargas, stun grenades and live ammunition to break up demonstrations.    The unrest has been fuelled by a deepening economic crisis marked by high inflation and shortages of bread, petrol and cash. The Sudanese pound fell to a record low on the black market on Thursday. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, the opposition said that should Bashir go, they had agreed to hold a constitutional dialogue conference at the end of a four-year transitional governance followed by elections. The Information Ministry condemned the opposition parties, saying they had rejected dialogue and opted instead for violence to bring down the regime. “The government will take the necessary legal measures to respond to calls for violence and political and ideological terrorism and change by force,” it said in a statement. Bashir came to power in 1989 after he overthrew the elected government of Sadiq al-Mahdi, and had since won successive elections in a vote the opposition says are neither fair nor free.

2019-02-14,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A militant group in Nigeria’s oil-rich southern Niger Delta threatened on Thursday to cripple the economy if President Muhammadu Buhari is re-elected on Saturday. The Niger Delta Avengers - who want their area to get a greater share of the oil revenue it produces - said they backed opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar and his promises to devolve more power to the regions. The Niger Delta Avengers were behind a 2016 wave of violence, including attacks on pipelines and other facilities, that helped push Nigeria into recession.  The group, in a statement posted on its website, warned that if Buhari is re-elected there would be “a perpetual recession for Nigeria”. Buhari later made a televised address promising that the government would ensuring a free, fair and peaceful vote, without making any reference to the Avengers’ statement. His spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Attacks in the Niger Delta in 2016 cut Nigeria’s crude output from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd - the lowest level seen in Africa’s biggest economy in at least 30 years. That, combined with low oil prices, pushed the OPEC member state into its first recession in a quarter of a century - crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and 90 percent of its foreign exchange. Atiku, a businessman and ex-vice president representing the main opposition People’s Democratic Party, has proposed to devolve more power to regions in a policy dubbed “restructuring”.  It would enable oil-rich states in the south to retain a greater share of the revenues generated from crude production.  “We are adopting Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, as the sole candidate to be voted for by all the people of the Niger Delta as a result of his political ideology which is in tandem with our agitation for equitable and fair principles of federalism,” the group said.   The Avengers said that, if elected, Atiku should start a “restructuring of Nigeria” within six months to forestall further attacks in the Niger Delta.  “Atiku has said that restructuring will begin on the day he takes office, so he will keep his word,” Paul Ibe, a spokesman for the main opposition candidate, said in a telephone interview.     Buhari’s government held talks with the militants in 2016 and 2017 about their grievances over poverty and oil pollution in the Delta.  No substantial attacks have been carried out by any groups in the Delta region since January 2017. The country is also facing separatist movements in the southeast and Islamist militants in the northeast.

2019-02-14,"JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his plan to divide struggling state power firm Eskom into three units would minimize risks to the economy, as a fifth day of power cuts hurt businesses and drove the rand to a six-week low on Thursday. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the power in Africa’s most industrialized economy, is technically insolvent, the government said on Wednesday, warning that an urgent bailout was needed to help it manage its $30 billion debt. “Restructuring will reduce the risk of a massive Eskom that at times has been termed ‘too big to fail’, placing government in a position where all our eggs are in one basket,” Ramaphosa said in a speech to parliament. “It is not a path to privatization,” he added, promising that a financial support package for Eskom would be accompanied by a turnaround plan and that officials would consult with trade unions, which have expressed anger at the proposed split. Last week Ramaphosa - who faces a parliamentary election in May - pledged to separate Eskom into units for generation, transmission and distribution to increase efficiency and prop up the country’s most important state company.  The former union leader is under pressure to revive an economy that stagnated under his predecessor, scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma, and the Eskom crisis will test his negotiating skills with his ex-colleagues. Eskom cut 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity from the grid from 0600 GMT on Thursday, likely until 2000 GMT. That is an improvement from Monday, when it slashed 4,000 MW from the grid in its largest cut since 2014/15 because of unplanned breakdowns of some generating units, maintenance and diesel shortages. A senior Eskom official, Andrew Etzinger, said on Thursday that Eskom’s plant performance and diesel supplies had improved substantially and that its coal stockpiles were approaching their highest in around six months. That bodes well for next week, by which time Eskom hopes to have ended the power cuts, which are an emergency measure to prevent the electricity system from a total collapse. Around a third of Eskom’s 45,000 MW capacity is still offline. The outages, the worst in several years, have spooked investors days before a budget speech by the finance minister and have prompted a sharp slide in the rand and government bonds. The rand fell more than 1.4 percent versus the dollar to its weakest in six weeks on Thursday and is now down more than 4 percent this week. The cuts have left ordinary South Africans struggling to feed their families and caused traffic gridlock in major cities as traffic lights stop working. “If the power goes off for more than six hours and we have to run the generators for that long it’s going to be very expensive. We’re not going to be able to afford the diesel,” said Arno Steenkamp, a manager at a Johannesburg restaurant. “If we can’t make coffee and food it’s going to hit our sales and we might have to close,” he added. Firms in the mining sector, the backbone of the country’s economy, are looking at alternatives to reduce their dependence on Eskom and monitoring the situation closely. Eskom’s woes, which reflect the failure of successive governments to take on labor unions and tackle Eskom’s monopolistic structure, pose a potential threat to South Africa’s credit rating, with Moody’s the last of the top three ratings agencies to rate it investment grade. There is also the risk that unions could go on strike. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the biggest union at Eskom, on Thursday warned Ramaphosa’s African National Congress (ANC) not to take its members’ votes for granted at the upcoming election. Senior NUM officials are set to hold talks with Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday to express their disagreement with the plan to split Eskom, which the union fears will lead to massive job losses further down the line. Ramaphosa said in parliament that cost-cutting at Eskom would not necessarily entail job cuts.

2019-02-14,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Mills in Brazil’s center-south are likely to start harvesting the new sugar cane crop later than usual to allow cane fields to take advantage of late rains while holding excess ethanol stocks after over-producing last year, analysts and millers said. Brazil’s 2019/20 cane crop in the main center-south region officially starts in April, but mills normally enter fields in March, particularly to profit from better ethanol prices at the end of the inter-harvest period.  Ethanol stocks in the region are still at a near-record high, however, because of the mills’ strategy last year to favor the biofuel over sugar. Ethanol prices did not rise in the between-crops period as they historically do, further reducing the incentive for early harvesting. Brazil’s Sao Martinho, one of the largest companies in the sector, said around 38 percent of its annual ethanol output remains to be sold in the last quarter of the crop year, which runs from January to March. “Our expectation was for higher ethanol prices in December, January and February, which didn’t happen,” said Felipe Vicchiato, the company’s chief financial officer. Brazil is the world’s largest producer and exporter of sugar and the largest producer of cane-based ethanol, though it is second overall after the United States, which makes its ethanol from corn.     Matheus Costa, sugar & ethanol analyst at broker and consultancy INTL FCStone, also said Brazil’s ethanol stocks remain high. “If mills face difficulties to reduce those stocks, they could opt to produce more sugar than ethanol in the beginning of the new crop, or they could choose to delay the start of harvesting,” he said. Some companies, such as Louis Dreyfus-controlled Biosev, want to give cane fields time to benefit from recent rains, especially since precipitation was below average in December and January. “We are having good rains now, and there is more expected for the rest of the month. Our plan is to not start crushing in March, only in April,” Biosev’s Chief Executive Juan José Blanchard told Reuters. If rains continue into March, overall volumes for the new cane crop could improve even if mills delay processing.  Some analysts think the sugar market is already reacting to a possible delay in the new center-south crop. “The March-May spread (in New York) appreciated almost $5 in the last two weeks. What causes such a movement is the perception of a delay in the availability of sugar in the beginning of the crop,” said Arnaldo Correa, a sugar and ethanol expert at Archer Consulting.

2019-02-14,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Thursday it plans to control a group of toxic chemicals found in Americans’ drinking water but stopped short of setting limits until later this year. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Thursday said the agency planned short- and long-term steps to help states exposed to a class of common chemicals called PFAS, used in Teflon and firefighting foam. “We are moving forward with several important actions, including the maximum contaminant level process, that will help affected communities better monitor, detect, and address PFAS,” Wheeler said. The agency did not give a maximum contaminant level, a legal limit allowed in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act, for PFAS, but said it would start that process by the end of the year. Environmental groups and politicians immediately accused the EPA of dragging its feet on setting limits. “While the agency fumbles with this ‘mis-management plan,’ millions of people will be exposed to highly toxic PFAS from drinking contaminated water,” said Erik Olson, Senior Director for Health and Food at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The chemicals have been used for decades in common products and have contaminated water systems, most recently in areas around army bases in states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and West Virginia where foam containing the chemicals is used in military exercises. The chemicals are linked to cancer, liver and thyroid damage, and other health and fetal effects. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in certain states have expressed alarm over exposure to the chemicals. A draft study released last year by an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services found that the risk level for exposure to PFAS should be at least seven to 10 times lower than the threshold recommended by the EPA. The White House and the EPA had tried to keep the report from publication. Betsy Southerland, who resigned as a director in the EPA’s Office of Water in 2017 over disagreements with the Trump administration, said Thursday’s announcement did not include cleanup guidelines, which were due last fall. “It’s sort of like the movie Groundhog Day. We are back to where we were in 2018,” she said. Wheeler denied the EPA had slowed down developing the new plan, and said it was the most comprehensive cross-agency plan ever undertaken by the EPA to address an emerging chemical of concern. He said the agency had begun the regulatory process to list PFAS chemicals PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances and will issue interim groundwater cleanup recommendations for contaminated sites. The agency will also monitor PFAS in nationwide drinking water and consider PFAS chemicals for listing in the Toxics Release Inventory to help the agency identify where the chemicals are being released. Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee John Barrasso said on Thursday that the panel will hold a hearing on the EPA plan this spring. “The Environmental Protection Agency’s PFAS plan is only a first step. As I have said before, EPA must speak clearly about the risk that this class of chemicals poses to public health and the environment,” Barrasso said.

2019-02-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Global efforts to fight a “crisis” of man-made climate change could spell a faster than expected end to Norway’s oil and gas industry, the nation’s central bank governor said on Thursday. Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen also said that western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer will still derive significant income from hydrocarbons in coming years but declined to predict a timeline for any future decline. “A shift in consumption patterns and production methods towards lower emissions will reduce demand for fossil fuels. This can influence oil and gas activities in Norway,” he said in a speech to government and business leaders. “We have always known that oil and gas activities will be phased out sooner or later. Oil and gas are non-renewable resources. A stricter global climate policy may mean that this will occur sooner than foreseen earlier.” Almost 200 nations set a goal under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to phase out greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of this century to limit a rise in temperatures blamed for stoking more heatwaves, downpours and rising sea levels. The United Nations says that existing government policies are inadequate to achieve the Paris goals and need to be tightened. Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg has said Norway can keep pumping for decades and still comply with the Paris Agreement. “We are facing a climate crisis that can only be addressed by engaging in a common global effort,” Olsen said on Thursday. Investors including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign fund should manage climate risk along with other factors affecting their portfolios, he said. But he also emphasized that solutions to fight global warming must come from governments promoting change. In an interview at his office in central Oslo, Olsen said the oil industry could remain important to the Norwegian economy for a significant time to come. “But we should also be more aware, not least in light of climate change, that we need to develop other legs to stand on as well,” he added. The oil and gas industry has been a key economic engine for Norway over the past 50 years, directly or indirectly employing 10 percent of all workers and providing half its export revenue.  State-controlled Equinor is Norway’s largest oil company, while smaller players such as Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum have achieved rapid growth in recent years. “If global measures are introduced to limit warming, by putting a price tag on emissions and developing technology, it would curb fossil fuel prices,” Olsen said. “I’m careful to emphasize that the oil industry should develop based on considerations of what’s profitable. I’m warning against actively forcing a downsizing beyond that,” he added.

Bulgaria blocked transfers out of the accounts on Wednesday as part of a probe into suspected money laundering, after law enforcement officials said millions of euros were transferred into the accounts from Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA. Security officials said the bank itself was not under any suspicion of wrongdoing. Investbank said it did not have any relationships with Venezuelan banks and both incoming and outgoing transfers from the accounts were processed through different lenders in the European Union and the United States. “The funds under the trust account have been lawfully submitted in line with all regulatory requirements and in compliance with international sanctions,” the bank said in a statement. “There are no sanctioned transactions related to the State Petroleum Company of Venezuela (PDVSA)- Petróleos de Venezuela”. It did not give the value of the funds that had been transferred through the accounts, or say when the transactions occurred. A senior Bulgarian lawmaker familiar with the situation has said there are about 60 million euros ($68 million) currently in the suspect accounts.

2019-02-14,"NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The steepest decline in U.S. retail sales since 2009 in December erased broad gains in world stock markets on Thursday and pushed investors into the safety of government bonds. European shares fell 0.3 percent after earlier touching three-month highs. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115.97 points, or 0.45 percent, to 25,427.3, the S&P 500 lost 9.83 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,743.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.12 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,415.26. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.29 percent. The drop in retail spending in the world’s largest economy heightened investor fears of a global slowdown. Any optimism was further dimmed by data released on Thursday showing an unexpected increase in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week. That pushed the four-week moving average of claims to a one-year high, an indication that job growth was flattening. “The numbers were a bit of a surprise on the downside and that is critical because this is for December and it suggests that people weren’t spending enough on holiday sales shopping,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The sharp fall in spending overshadowed optimism about U.S.-China trade talks and strong earnings from Nestle, drugmaker AstraZeneca and plane giant Airbus. The euro fell near a three-month low as data showed Germany’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter, with fallout from global trade disputes and Brexit threatening to derail a decade-long expansion in Europe’s economic powerhouse. . That left the dollar near its highest since mid-December against a basket of currencies at 97.059. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 14/32 in price to yield 2.6554 percent, from 2.706 percent late on Wednesday. Russian stocks and bonds were also dumped as a rare bipartisan move from U.S. lawmakers proposed stiff new sanctions on Russian government debt as well as some banks and oil and gas firms. On China, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday trade talks were “going along very well”. Bloomberg said Trump was considering pushing back the March 1 deadline for higher tariffs on Chinese goods by 60 days. Oil prices found support as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper output cut. “Thanks to healthy oil demand growth and lower OPEC+ production ... we see the market tightening further over the coming months,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. “As such, we continue to expect Brent oil prices will move up to $70–80 a barrel over three to six months.” Reporting by David Randall

2019-02-14,"(Adds quotes and background) By Luc Cohen and Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Venezuelan opposition’s envoy to the United States accused the government of President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday of blocking humanitarian aid to the country and urged the international community to help open “thousands of windows” to let assistance in. Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido’s representative in Washington, spoke to an international aid conference hosted at the Organization of American States (OAS) headquarters in Washington as a deadlock persisted in delivering aid to the crisis-stricken South American country. Guaido invoked constitutional provisions last month to declare himself interim president, arguing that Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, and many of Venezuela’s neighbors have recognized Guaido as the country’s legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China as well as control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military. Guaido told a huge rally of supporters on Tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on Feb. 23, setting the stage for a showdown with Maduro. “They are blocking humanitarian aid that’s being sent,” Vecchio told the conference, which was attended by diplomats and representatives from dozens of countries. “We must open thousands of windows to bring humanitarian aid to Venezuela ... Here we are creating an international coalition to bring in food and medicine.” Maduro has called the aid a U.S.-orchestrated show and denies there is an economic crisis, despite a widespread lack of food and medicine and hyperinflation. An aid convoy supplied by the United States and Colombia arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta last week, where it is being held in warehouses. The United States has said it will try to channel aid to Venezuela, via Colombia and possibly Brazil. Last week, the United Nations warned against politicizing aid in Venezuela after the United States accused Maduro of blocking the delivery of food and medicine. Elliott Abrams, Washington’s special envoy on Venezuela, said last week the aid effort was being coordinated with Guaido’s team but that the aid would not be forced into Venezuela. Maduro has overseen an economic collapse that has left millions struggling for food and fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region. An estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC country since 2015, some 800,000 of whom have ended up in Colombia.

2019-02-14,"KHARTOUM, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Security forces fired teargas to disperse hundreds of protesters close to the Sudan’s presidential palace on Thursday, before plainclothes officers armed with plastic piping rounded up around 30 people, witnesses said. Police then chased activists through side streets as smaller rallies broke out across downtown Khartoum. Demonstrators chanted “Peaceful, peaceful against the thieves” and “Down, that’s it!” - their central demand for President Omar al-Bashir to step down. The detained protesters, most of them young men and women, were driven away in pickup trucks, witnesses said. A police spokesman could not be reached for comment. Union members, students, opposition activists and others, frustrated with economic hardships, have held near daily protests since Dec. 19, in the most sustained challenge to Basher’s three decades in power. The president and his ruling National Congress Party have shown no sign of bowing to those demands and have blamed the unrest on unnamed foreign powers. He and senior officials have used more conciliatory language in recent weeks, promising to release detained demonstrators. But activists say hundreds remain in detention. An opposition-linked doctors’ syndicate said last week that 57 people have been killed in the protests. The government puts the death toll at 31, including two security personnel. Security forces have used teargas, stun grenades and live ammunition to break up demonstrations. The unrest has been fuelled by a deepening economic crisis marked by high inflation and shortages of bread, petrol and cash. The Sudanese pound fell to a record low on the black market on Thursday.

2019-02-14,"YANGON, Feb 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Catholic leaders are lending their support to protesters against a Chinese-backed dam project in Myanmar, adding pressure on the government to cancel the hydro-power dam in the country’s north. Ongoing protests have brought together Catholic priests and nuns with hundreds of protesters in Myitkyina city to demand an end to the controversial project that activists say will damage the environment and force thousands off the land. The influential Archbishop of Yangon, Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, in a sharply worded statement, said the dam project on the Irrawaddy river was an “environmental disaster” that would also hurt prospects for peace in the restive region. “Myitsone dam is a death sentence to the people of Myanmar,” he said. “This river is the most sacred symbol of our nation; she is not a commodity to be bartered. For a peaceful future, Myitsone dam must be stopped,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments. Myanmar angered China in 2011 when its former quasi-civilian government suspended the $3.6 billion dam project amid environmental concerns. The archbishop’s message on the Myitsone project wields considerable influence, said Debbie Stothard, secretary general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). “The statement is significant,” she said. “While Catholics form a small percentage of the population, the cardinal’s statements on social justice seem to have a resonance,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on Wednesday. Dams in Southeast Asia have come under greater scrutiny after several recent disasters. The collapse of a hydroelectric dam in Laos in July displaced thousands of people and killed at least 27. In August, as many as 85 villages in central Myanmar flooded after a dam failed, unleashing waters that blocked a major highway and forced more than 63,000 people from their homes. Last month, a top Myanmar investment official suggested downsizing or relocating the stalled Myitsone project because of problems including an earthquake fault line under the site, and a large catchment area affecting residents. Thaung Tun, chairman of Myanmar’s investment commission, said original plans for the dam had failed to consider the impact on the community and the environment. For the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), finding a solution is critical, as China is Myanmar’s largest trade partner, and as party officials try to shore up popularity in ethnic minority areas ahead of the 2020 general election.

2019-02-14,"OSLO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Gas transmission operators of Finland, Latvia and Estonia signed an agreement on Thursday to set up a single gas transmission tariff zone for the three countries from the start of 2020. The agreement unifies entry point tariffs on the external borders of the region and removes commercial interconnection points between countries. “It will be used for transportation of the gas across Finland, Estonia and Latvia without additional charges,” the three operators — Finland’s Gasum, Estonia’s Elering and Latvia’s AS Conexus Baltic Grid — said in a statement. The deal is expected to lead to higher market liquidity by making it easier for shippers and traders to sell gas to the whole region, the companies said. Gas between the Baltic states and Finland will be piped across the Baltic Sea by Jan. 1, 2020, when a 7.2 million cubic metre per day pipeline called Balticconnector is due to start up. The pipeline is being built to link the countries and help diversify the region’s gas supplies, which largely come from Russia, by creating more links with other gas projects in Europe. The agreement reached between the three operators outlines the cost structure for transmission and how related compensation and entry revenues will be distributed amongst them.

With debts of more than $1 billion, Jet has struggled over the last year as competition intensified, the Indian rupee depreciated and high oil prices hurt margins. The airline said in a regulatory filing that its board has approved the rescue deal by the lenders, led by State Bank of India, which includes an equity infusion, debt restructuring and the sale or sale and lease back of aircraft. Vinay Dube, Jet’s Chief Executive Officer, said the airline is confident of delivering a “more strategic, efficient and financially viable airline” through the plan. The plan will also need regulatory approval from the Securities & Exchange Board of India, India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation, and the Competition Commission of India, Jet said. It did not mention any cash injections from existing shareholders such as founder and chairman Naresh Goyal and Etihad Airways, which owns 24 percent of Jet. The airline reported a fourth consecutive quarterly loss on Thursday as it sought to allay concerns of its aircraft lessors, employees and other creditors with the plan, which must be approved at a shareholder meeting on Feb. 21. Jet reported a net loss of 5.88 billion rupees ($83 million) for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 1.65 billion rupees a year earlier. The airline has outstanding dues of about $400 million, mainly to lessors and vendors, as well as debt repayments starting with roughly 17 billion rupees due by end-March, credit-ratings firm ICRA says. It also owes money to staff and had net debt of more than 80 billion rupees as of end-September. At the special meeting, Jet will seek approval to convert lenders’ debt into 114 million shares. The rescue plan also gives lenders the right to appoint nominees to the airline’s board and alter its governance structures. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad saved the Indian airline the last time it was in trouble, spending $600 million for a stake in the airline, three take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow and a majority share in Jet’s frequent flyer programme.

2019-02-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global demand for renewable power will soar at an unprecedented pace over the coming decades, BP said in a benchmark report on Thursday, while China’s energy growth is seen sharply decelerating as its economic expansion slows. Still, China is set to remain the largest energy consumer by a long stretch into 2040 although India should overtake it in terms of demand growth beginning in the next decade, the British oil and gas giant said in its 2019 Energy Outlook. China’s energy demand rose by 5.9 percent over the past 20 years, but is set to grow by only 1 percent by 2040 as its economy shifts from energy-intensive industries to services and as Beijing introduces stricter rules on air pollution. BP revised down its forecast of China’s energy demand by 7 percent from last year’s report, “reflecting the pace at which China is adjusting to a more sustainable pattern of economic growth”. Under BP’s base-case Evolving Transition scenario, global energy demand will increase by around one third by 2040, driven by rapidly expanding middle classes in Asia.  BP 2019 Energy Outlook: Energy demand - tmsnrt.rs/2UWCVPB BP 2019 Energy Outlook: Industries - tmsnrt.rs/2UW8uJi Renewables are expected to be the fastest-growing energy source with an annual gain of 7.1 percent, accounting for half the growth in global energy. Their share in primary energy is seen rising from 4 percent today to around 15 percent by 2040. Compared with the level in last year’s report, BP raised by 9 percent its 2040 forecast of demand for renewable power such as solar and wind. Renewables and natural gas, the least-polluting fossil fuel, will account for 85 percent of the growth in energy demand. “Renewables will penetrate the energy system quicker than any other fuel ever,” BP Chief Economist Spencer Dale told reporters before the release of the report. Solar power will increase by a factor of 10 by 2040 and wind by a factor of five under BP’s basic scenario. While the share of oil in world energy demand rose from 1 percent to 10 over 45 years in the early 20th century, renewables are set to reach the same share over 25 years, Dale said. BP 2019 Energy Outlook: Renewables - tmsnrt.rs/2UY8d8C In a world struggling to tackle climate change by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and to bring billions of people out of poverty, demand for electricity is set to account for around three quarters of the growth in energy. Global energy-related carbon emissions hit a historic high of 32.5 gigatons in 2017, after being flat for three years, due to increased energy demand and the slowing of energy efficiency improvements, the International Energy Agency said last year.  The unprecedented growth in renewables is, however, not sufficient to meet U.N.-backed targets set under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to curb carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, he added. Under the Evolving Transition scenario, carbon emissions will grow by 10 percent by 2040, much faster than in the past. BP expects oil demand to plateau at around 108 million barrels per day (bpd) by the mid-2030s, amid growth in electric vehicles and higher engine efficiency. Transportation continues to be the main driver of growth in oil consumption, with its share remaining stable at around 55 percent by 2040. Demand for transport services will almost double by 2040, but gains of nearly 50 percent in engine efficiency for cars and trucks mean energy consumed by the sector should grow by only 20 percent. Oil used to produce plastics is the largest source of demand growth over the period, increasing by 7 million bpd to 22 million bpd. The growth in oil supply will initially come from rapidly expanding U.S. shale production, which BP expects will grow by 6 million bpd over the next 10 years, peaking at 10.5 million bpd in the late 2020s. As U.S. shale output declines, production from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will take the lead. BP 2019 Energy Outlook: Oil consumption - tmsnrt.rs/2BL77X1 BP 2019 Energy Outlook: Electric vehicles - tmsnrt.rs/2UXatNC BP warned that an escalation in trade disputes could significantly reduce energy demand due to slowing economic growth. A 6 percent reduction in global gross domestic product in the period to 2040 versus BP’s base-case scenario would lead to a 4 percent decline in energy demand, it said.  Lower demand and slowing energy trade flows would have the biggest impact on oil and gas exporting countries such as Russia and the United States, BP said.

The United States imposed tough financial sanctions on Jan. 28 aimed at blocking Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro’s access to the country’s oil revenue. Russia is a close ally of Caracas and its oil companies’ operations in Venezuela have come into focus as the country has been plunged into political turmoil and Washington hit state oil company PDVSA with sanctions. “Before the restrictions were imposed, Litasco had operations to deliver oil products and sell oil, and there were swap operations. Today there are none,” Alekperov said at a conference in the Black Sea city of Sochi. He added that the operations were stopped immediately once the sanctions were imposed. However, Russia’s Gazprom Neft does not see major risks for its operations in Venezuela, Chief Executive Alexander Dyukov said at the Sochi conference. He said his company has not and does not supply Venezuela with oil products needed to dilute PDVSA oil. He added Venezuela had not approached Gazprom Neft to supply PDVSA with oil products.

2019-02-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s government approved on Thursday the building of a copper mine near Europe’s northernmost point despite years of opposition from indigenous Sami herders and fishermen. Norway’s decision on the copper mine has been viewed as a litmus test for the Arctic, where climate change and technology are enabling mineral and energy extraction, shipping and tourism, but threatening traditional ways of life. “The mining project will strengthen the industrial base in the north,” Industry Minister Torbjoern Roe Isaksen of the centre-right coalition government said in a statement. “It will contribute positively to the local community, with new jobs and skills.” The Nussir ASA project is expected to bring jobs and investment to the Kvalsund municipality, but the digging could damage summer reindeer pastures and a plan to dump tailings in the fjord would destroy spawning grounds for the coastal cod. “I am shocked by the government’s decision. I had hoped that the Norwegian government would have heard our arguments ... They do not take us seriously,” reindeer herder Nils Mathis Sara told Reuters. “We will definitely protest against this decision.” A group of reindeer herders will discuss whether to take legal action in an attempt to stop the mine, he said. One green group, Nature and Youth, was planning a demonstration in front of the Royal Palace in Oslo on Friday when the cabinet holds its weekly meeting with King Harald. Nussir says the area contains an estimated 72 million tonnes of copper ore - Norway’s largest reserve - and plans to invest more than 1 billion crowns (£90 million) in the mine while making only minimal intrusion in the local way of life. Local officials gave a green light in 2012, but the project has since been stuck awaiting an operating license, with big industry players paying close attention to the process, the International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry has said. Kvalsund, a village of painted wooden houses on the Repparfjord with 1,027 inhabitants, said the mine would boost a municipality which spends 40 percent of its income caring for the elderly as young people move away. Herders around the Arctic in other Nordic nations, Russia, Canada and Alaska, echo the Norwegian Sami concerns, citing threats from climate change, mining, oil spills and poaching as well as thoughtless behaviour from townspeople and tourists. Global majors, including Eni, Equinor, Gazprom, Glencore, Lukoil and Rio Tinto, are all grappling with how to square their prospecting plans with the interests of people whose views count more than in the past. Average temperatures in the Arctic regions of the world, where some four million people live, have risen more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F) since pre-industrial times, twice as fast as the world average, according to research for the intergovernmental Arctic Council.

2019-02-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders no longer expect the market to be over-supplied this year, amid optimism a full-blown U.S.-China trade war will be averted, and oil production growth will slow thanks to OPEC cuts and sanctions on Venezuela. Front-month Brent futures prices have jumped to almost $65 per barrel, up from just $50 in late December, and the highest for nearly three months. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2V4bGD1) Brent’s six-month calendar spread has swung into a backwardation of almost 70 cents per barrel, from a contango of more than $1.50 late last year, the strongest for almost four months. Crude prices and spreads are being propelled higher by an almost perfect storm of increasing economic optimism (or at least reducing pessimism), OPEC cuts and unplanned supply disruptions. In recent days, senior policymakers from both the United States and China have signalled trade negotiations are making good progress, as fear of recession makes both sides more eager for a deal. More importantly, the U.S. president has indicated the deadline for the next round of tariff increases could be extended based on recent progress even if not all issues have been resolved by March 1. Oil consumption growth is likely to slow this year from the very rapid rates reported between 2014 and 2017 but if tariff increases can be avoided oil use should continue increasing at a moderate pace. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and its closest allies in OPEC have also acted early and aggressively to reduce production which should help eliminate the incipient surplus in the market. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister has said the kingdom’s production will fall to just 9.8 million barrels per day in March from 11.1 million in November (“Saudi Arabia goes on hunt for global oil and gas”, Financial Times, Feb. 12). Saudi Arabia’s willingness to act as swing producer has more than offset the limited cuts made by other members of the organisation and its allies led by Russia. The kingdom has demonstrated its commitment to eliminating the market surplus and pushing prices higher, even if it means tolerating poor compliance by other members of the OPEC+ group. At the same time, Iran’s exports remain crimped by U.S. sanctions imposed in November, with the expectation they will be lowered further from May, when sanctions waivers are likely to become less generous. And U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA have reduced the country’s crude exports and tightened the global oil market even further. U.S. policymakers probably expected the Venezuela sanctions would have little impact on global production since they were expected to result in the rapid removal of President Nicolas Maduro. But with the Maduro administration digging in for a long confrontation, traders have been forced to reappraise the possibility of a long disruption of exports that could last weeks or even months. Production and consumption risks, concentrated on the downside at the start of the year, have therefore shifted to the upside in recent weeks. Hedge fund positioning could accelerate the rise in prices and shift to backwardation. Hedge funds and other money managers held an overall bullish position in Brent futures and options equivalent to just 234 million barrels at the start of February down from almost 500 million at the end of September. Portfolio managers’ overall bullish position has already risen by nearly 100 million barrels over the last nine weeks but remains close to the lowest level for the last three years. Funds hold just 5 long bullish contracts for every short bullish one, down from a ratio of almost 20:1 just over four months ago, so there is scope for more fund buying. Production and consumption fundamentals as well as hedge fund positioning all suggest the balance of risks in oil has shifted to the upside, but only if trade talks are successful or extended, and recession is avoided.

2019-02-14,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China’s coal imports soared in January, more than tripling from the prior month to 33.5 million tonnes, but there are compelling reasons to treat this outcome with caution, including weakness in benchmark Australian coal prices. January’s coal imports were the highest in five years, rising 228 percent from the weak 10.23 million tonnes reported for December. It’s a characteristic of commodity markets that there isn’t always a straight line between supply and demand and prices, and the resurgent buying by the world’s top importer of the polluting fuel is a case in point. It’s always worth being cautious about commodity imports around the Lunar New Year festival, as the week-long holiday in China tends to distort the data in the first two months of the year. This year the new year fell in early February, meaning there was likely some pulling forward of coal import demand as traders brought in cargoes ahead of the holidays. Analysis is further complicated by signals from the authorities in Beijing toward the end of last year, when they made it clear they wanted to keep coal imports to the same level in 2018 as they were in 2017. While this didn’t quite work, it did cause a dramatic fall in imports in December, which also may have resulted in some cargoes being delayed until January. Given there are solid reasons to be somewhat sceptical that January’s import strength represents a new uptrend for China’s coal imports, it’s hardly surprising that thermal coal prices have been slipping in Australia. The price of coal at Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, fell to $95.99 a tonne in the week ended Feb. 10, the lowest since May last year. The price is also down almost 20 percent from the seven-year high of $119.74 a tonne, hit in July last year. But while prices for Australian thermal coal have struggled in recent months, the opposite is true for Indonesian coal, with the Southeast Asian nation’s lower-energy cargoes enjoying strong demand. Indonesian coal with an energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kg, as assessed by Argus Media, rose to $34.45 a tonne in the week ended Feb. 8. The price has climbed 19.4 percent since hitting a 28-month low of $28.85 a tonne in late November. This indicates a likely shift in buyer preferences from higher-quality Australian coal to lower-quality Indonesian supplies. In China, Indonesian coal is often used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, as the low sulphur content offsets the lower energy value. The popularity of Indonesian coal in China can be seen in the vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. In January, China imported 12.3 million tonnes of Indonesian coal, the highest monthly total since Refinitiv started monitoring in January 2015. This was almost double the 6.8 million tonnes recorded in December, and also well above 8.7 million tonnes in November, the shipping data showed. Australia also boosted its shipments to China in January, with imports rising to 7.9 million tonnes from December’s 5.8 million. However, the January total was more or less in line with November’s 7.8 million tonnes and only slightly above the 2018 average of 7.24 million per month. What the shipping data shows is perhaps an emerging trend for the world’s two biggest exporters of coal, with Indonesia seemingly gaining the upper hand over Australia, at least as far as China is concerned.

2019-02-14,"(Adds quotes on Russia, updates prices) * European stocks, oil prices hit highest since November * Euro at 3-month low after Germany just skirts recession * Report Trump could push out deadline on tariffs * China exports, imports easily beat forecasts * Dollar holds firm as yen, euro and pound all ebb * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Optimism about U.S.-China trade talks and bumper earnings lifted European shares to a three-month high on Thursday, though news that Germany only dodged recession by the narrowest of margins left the euro feeling unloved. Markets were generally in a cautious mood as investors hung on for any hint of progress in the tariff talks amid reports the White House could extend the deadline for a deal. Stocks extended gains regardless. Strong results from Nestle , drugmaker AstraZeneca and plane giant Airbus lifted the pan-European STOXX 600 0.4 percent and towards its best week since early November. “Cupid continues to shoot out bullish arrows across financial markets with last week’s blip almost forgotten about for now,” Deutsche Bank said in a Valentine’s day morning note. The euro did not share the loving feeling however. It struggled near a three-month low as data showed Germany’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter, with fallout from global trade disputes and Brexit threatening to derail a decade-long expansion in Europe’s economic powerhouse. Russian stocks and bonds were also dumped as a rare bipartisan move from U.S. lawmakers proposed stiff new sanctions on Russian government debt as well as some banks and oil and gas firms. The Kremlin said it could cope with any new measures but shares in Moscow tumbled more than 2 percent amid a sharp spike in FX volatility gauges and a brisk selloff of most rouble-denominated government bonds. “We were preparing ourselves for this eventuality,” said head of EM sovereign debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments Edwin Gutierrez. “But this is understandably causing a lot of noise and the U.S. senators have certainly tightened the language (of sanctions proposals) since last year.” On China, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday trade talks were “going along very well” and, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in China, investors had been daring to hope for good news. Bloomberg said Trump was considering pushing back the March 1 deadline for higher tariffs on Chinese goods by 60 days. But expectations have been disappointed before, and the reaction in Asian share markets was guarded. Shanghai blue chips closed broadly flat, having jumped 2 percent on Wednesday to levels last seen in late September. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.15 percent, though that was off a peak last seen in early October and Japan’s Nikkei finished flat having briefly touched its highest level this year. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China risks, gained 0.4 percent to $0.7114 and S&P 500 futures added 0.15 percent having closed above its 200-moving average for the second running on Wednesday. The Aussie dollar had already got a small lift when Chinese trade data handily beat expectations in a welcome relief for the global economy. Beijing reported exports rose 9.1 percent in January from a year earlier, confounding forecasts of a fall, while imports dipped by a surprisingly slight 1.5 percent. The recent improvement in risk appetite undermined the safe haven yen though and propelled the dollar to its best levels of the year so far at 111.05. The subdued European data though, which also saw Italy confirmed in recession, pushed long-term market inflation expectations to new lows, while putting downward pressure on bond yields in the bloc. The euro was at $1.1265, not that far above the floor of a $1.1213/1.1570 trading range that has held since mid-October. Sterling was also on edge at $1.2845 ahead of another parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan. That all left the dollar near its highest since mid-December against a basket of currencies at 97.059. In commodity markets, spot gold edged up 0.18 percent to $1,308.56 per ounce. Oil prices found support as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper output cut. U.S. crude was up 56 cents, or 1 percent, at $54.42 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 97 cents to $64.50, its highest since November. “Thanks to healthy oil demand growth and lower OPEC+ production ... we see the market tightening further over the coming months,” UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. “As such, we continue to expect Brent oil prices will move up to $70–80 a barrel over three to six months.” Additional reporting by Sujata Rao in London, Wayne Cole in

2019-02-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - A court delivered a painful nip to European Union fishermen on Thursday by tightening Norway’s grip on snow crab catches in the Arctic, a ruling that may also let Oslo claw more control of oil and gas from other nations.    Fishermen from the European Union must ask permission from Oslo to catch snow crab — whose meat is a delicacy for gourmets from Canada to Japan — in Arctic waters north of Norway, the Norwegian Supreme Court said in a unanimous ruling. The court dismissed an appeal by a Latvian fishing firm and its Russian captain against fines imposed by a lower court for catching snow crab around the remote Svalbard Islands in 2017 with only an EU licence. Latvia’s Foreign Ministry said it would review the decision at a government meeting. “Norway is tightening its grip,” in the Arctic, said Oeystein Jensen, a researcher in international law at the independent Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo.  “The court clarifies that if you are going to fish, or search for oil and gas, you need permission from the Norwegian authorities,” he told Reuters. At issue was whether the snow crab was a sedentary species living on the seabed or moves around like fish, and who gets to control the stocks. The court agreed with non-EU member Norway that snow crabs are sedentary, like corals or oysters, and that as such under the U.N. Law of the Sea they are a resource belonging to the continental shelf of Norway extending hundreds of miles (kms) offshore. Had Norway lost the case, the EU could have staked a claim over the snow crab and it could have been harder for Oslo to regulate access to potential oil and gas resources beneath the Arctic seabed. “For the Norwegian coastguard this is a big relief - they can arrest any ships fishing illegally in the Svalbard area,” chief public prosecutor Lars Fause told Reuters. The Latvian firm, SIA North Star, argued that the crabs are not sedentary because they scurry around and so should be regulated under regional fisheries accords signed by parties including the European Union, Norway and Russia. It argued that it had a valid EU permit. “We’re very disappointed,” defence lawyer Hallvard Oestgaard told Reuters. He said that his client would consider whether to try to appeal to international tribunals. And SIA North Star argued that Norway is obliged under an international 1920 treaty to allow other nations access to the waters around Svalbard.  That treaty grants sovereignty to Norway but gives other signatories rights to engage in commercial activities on and around Svalbard. Russia, for instance, runs a coal mine on Svalbard.  But Oslo says rights to exploit resources around Svalbard extend only to a narrow band of just 12 nautical miles offshore. The court ruled that the Latvian catches were illegal under Norwegian law, irrespective of the Svalbard Treaty.

2019-02-14,"(Adds quotes, share price, detail) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil company Aker said on Thursday that its exploration start-up in Ghana will submit development plans to Ghanaian authorities in March and the parent will then decide whether to sell stakes via an initial public offering or other means. The subsidiary, Aker Energy, plans to develop the deepwater Pecan field off Ghana. “Depending on the approval process in Ghana, we believe the first oil is achievable in late 2020 or early 2021,” Aker’s Chief Executive Oeyvind Eriksen told Reuters during an earnings presentation. A recent appraisal had confirmed contingent resources of 450 million-550 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) at the field, Aker said. Aker Energy plans to drill another two wells in February, expected to prove between 150 and 450 mmboe of additional resources, with preliminary results expected before the development plan is submitted, Eriksen told the presentation. Aker controls oil company Aker BP, 30 percent owned by BP , which has announced plans to triple its oil production by 2025 from 155,700 boepd in 2018. Expected production from Ghana, and potential acquisitions in Norway, support the plan of Aker’s main shareholder, Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, to increase total oil output to over 1 million boepd by 2025, Eriksen said. Aker Energy operates and holds a 50 percent stake in the DWT/CTP block off Ghana, which contains several discoveries. Its partners are Russia’s Lukoil (38 percent), the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (10 percent) and Fueltrade (2 percent). Eriksen also told Reuters that Aker was still interested in mergers and acquisitions involving its oil service firms, including Aker Solutions. “We still see opportunities (for M&A)... but the downturn has been more rough for our competitors, which have been more preoccupied with managing price volatility instead of focusing on strategic decisions,” he said. He declined to say whether he expected any deals to be made this year as oil prices have recovered from a slump in the last quarter of 2018. As a result of the price fall and capital market volatility, Aker’s net asset value (NAV), its core performance indicator, dropped to 41.7 billion crowns ($4.8 billion) in the fourth quarter from 63.2 billion crowns in the third quarter. However, the company proposed to increase its dividend to 22.5 crowns per share for 2018, up from 18 crowns for 2017, as it has received a record 2.2 billion crowns in cash from its portfolio companies for the full year, and expected this figure to grow to over 3 billion crowns in 2019.

2019-02-14,"* Iran was a major buyer of Russian wheat before boosting output * Iran’s private millers still need imported wheat to export flour * Signing of contracts postponed due to lack of financing By Polina Devitt MOSCOW, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Iran, Russia and Kazakhstan are making progress on organising finance for a long-planned wheat deal that could double or triple supplies to Iran, the secretary general of Iran’s Federation of Food Industry Associations said. Talks started a year ago, but stalled due to a lack of financing. The deal involves Russia and Kazakhstan supplying wheat to Iranian millers, who in turn would supply flour to Iraq - a market dominated by Turkey and other countries. On Tuesday, Russia, Kazakhstan and Iran signed a memorandum outlining cooperation in wheat trading. It was part of wider negotiations on setting up a free trade zone between Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan and other neighbours. “In the new agreement of the three sides, it is mentioned that the buyer can use a credit line opened by a bank, so funding (that was a main concern last year) will be settled,” Kaveh Zargaran told Reuters. He did not specify the banks that can open such credit lines. “In this case, we will notice wheat transit and swaps will be increasing from Russia and Kazakhstan,” he added. Iran was one of the largest markets for Russian wheat until it slashed purchases in 2016 due to Tehran’s self-sufficiency drive. However, Iranian private millers, who are not allowed to use domestic wheat for flour exports, still need imported wheat. Iran can export flour produced from Russian wheat to neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan, Zargaran said. “In this regard, wheat imports will double or triple to Iran,” he said. Russia supplied 137,500 tonnes of wheat to Iran in the previous 2017/18 marketing year, according to SovEcon consultancy. Iran, which needs 7.5 million tonnes of feed maize (corn) a year, also plans to import 3 million tonnes of it from Russia in next Iranian year which started in March, Zargaran said. The country also needs 3 million tonnes of barley, of which 1.5 million tonnes are expected to be imported from Russia in next Iranian year, he added.

2019-02-14,"GENEVA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Puma Energy, the retail and storage arm of commodities trader Trafigura, plans to restructure and sell assets to cut its debt and improve profits, a source familiar with the matter said. Puma has hired consulting firm McKinsey under new chief executive Emma Fitzgerald who took over last month from Pierre Eladari, who had overseen rapid expansion, the source said. Although its full-year 2018 results have not been finalised, Puma expects a small net loss or profit, the source added. Geneva-based Trafigura, which owns about 49 percent of Puma, has had to put plans to list Puma on hold after a change of government in Angola complicated reducing the country’s stake, coupled with weaker profits and a high debt profile. Angola’s state oil firm and Cochan Holdings, which is run by a former Angolan general, hold the rest of Puma. A spokesman for Puma declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for McKinsey also declined to comment. Puma, which traces it roots to Argentina, has more than 3,100 fuel retail stations in Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific and last year sold its small Peruvian retail network to Spanish oil and gas group Repsol. It said in a third quarter investor presentation that it expected a near $200 million drop in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to $550 million. “No significant improvements expected until Q1 2019 on margins in Angola, market conditions in Australia, and foreign exchange rates in most of our markets,” Puma said. Angola, which is Africa’s second-largest oil producer, has struggled with lower oil prices and its Kwanza was the second worst performing currency last year. This has prompted Fitch and Moody’s to changed their credit rating outlooks for Puma last year to negative from stable. Fitch rates Puma at BB while Moody’s has the firm at Ba2. “The contribution from its Angola-based operations has been affected by the freeze on refined oil product prices imposed in March 2018 by the Angolan government in the context of its macroeconomic stabilisation programme,” Moody’s wrote. “As a result, Moody’s expects Puma’s gross profit in Angola to more than halve in 2018, against $270 million ... in 2017.” The International Monetary Fund approved a three-year $3.7 billion credit facility for Angola in early December, saying that Luanda aims to eliminate fuel subsidies by mid-2020. Puma’s net profit was around $61 million, down from $128 million the year before, as of Sept. 30 last year, while its current and non-current liabilities were nearly $6.2 billion, Trafigura’s annual results showed. Puma’s net debt by the end of its third quarter last year was just over $1.5 billion and its net debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.6, according to Puma’s results.

Markets were generally in a cautious mood as investors hung on for any hint of progress in the tariff talks amid reports the White House could extend the deadline for a deal. Stocks extended gains regardless. Strong results from Nestle , drugmaker AstraZeneca and plane giant Airbus lifted the pan-European STOXX 600 0.5 percent to put it on course for its fourth day of gains and best week since early November. “Cupid continues to shoot out bullish arrows across financial markets with last week’s blip almost forgotten about for now,” Deutsche Bank said in a morning note. The euro did not share the feeling however. It struggled near a three-month low as data showed Germany’s economy stalled in the fourth quarter, with fallout from global trade disputes and Brexit threatening to derail a decade-long expansion in Europe’s economic powerhouse. A U.S. proposing stiff new sanctions on Russian banks and oil and gas firms sent shares in Moscow tumbling more than 2 percent and ignited rouble FX volatility gauges. On China, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that trade talks were “going along very well” and, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in China, investors had been daring to hope for good news. Bloomberg said Trump was considering pushing back the March 1 deadline for higher tariffs on Chinese goods by 60 days. But expectations have been disappointed before, the reaction in Asian share markets was guarded. Shanghai blue chips closed broadly flat, having jumped 2 percent on Wednesday to levels last seen in late September. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.15 percent, though that was off a peak last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei touched its highest this year as a weakening yen boosted export stocks. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China risks, gained 0.4 percent to $0.7114 and S&P 500 futures added 0.15 percent. The Aussie dollar had already got a small lift when Chinese trade data handily beat expectations in a welcome relief for the global economy. Beijing reported exports rose 9.1 percent in January from a year earlier, confounding forecasts of a fall, while imports dipped by a surprisingly slight 1.5 percent. The recent improvement in risk appetite undermined the safe haven yen and propelled the dollar to its best levels of the year so far at 111.05. The subdued European data pushed long-term market inflation expectations to new lows, while putting downward pressure on bond yields in the bloc. The single currency was at $1.1280 above the floor of a $1.1213/1.1570 trading range that has held since mid-October. Sterling was also on edge at $1.2845 ahead of another parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan. That left the dollar near its highest since mid-December against a basket of currencies at 97.059. In commodity markets, spot gold edged up 0.18 percent to $1,308.56 per ounce. Oil prices found support as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper output cut. U.S. crude was up 56 cents, or 1 percent, at $54.42 a barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 97 cents to $64.50, its highest since November.

2019-02-14,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenya Electricity Generating Company plans to raise funds from the market later this year and it may opt to issue the country’s first green bond, its chief executive said. KenGen has a 1,631 megawatt annual capacity and it supplies 70 percent of the East African nation’s electricity. Private investors hold 30 percent of the company while the rest is held by the state. Rebecca Miano, KenGen’s CEO, said the company would go to the market once it redeems its 10-year, 25 billion shillings ($250 million) bond in October. The bond was heavily oversubscribed when it was issued in 2009. “Our finance people are burning the midnight oil to look at the possibilities,” she told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday, without giving a figure for the target amount. “The team is looking at asset backed securities, they are also looking at green bonds.” The so-called green bonds help to finance projects in the renewable energy, energy-efficiency, green transport and wastewater treatment sectors. Kenya’s capital markets regulator is set to unveil regulations for private issuance of green bonds next week, paving the way for the first issue. Although Kenya has high consumer electricity tariffs compared with countries like Egypt and South Africa, the government’s policies had boosted investment in the sector, Miano said, helping it to avoid blackouts or schedule cuts. “Kenya was among the first countries in Africa to liberalize generation and it has its own advantages. You have many players and it brings competition... you have adequate power,” she said. KenGen has shifted its strategy in recent years to focus on renewable energy in order to reduce the risk posed by its hydro generation dams, which are normally susceptible to a drop in production when the rains fail. Geothermal steam, hot underground steam found in the Rift Valley which is used to drive turbines for electricity production, accounts for nearly a third of the firm’s annual production, Miano said. “Our geothermal-led strategy is bearing fruit,” she said, adding the company was developing capacity for an extra 720 MW in the next four years to 2022. The new plants being developed are mainly in geothermal with one plant, with a capacity for 80 MW, being in wind. KenGen paid a dividend to shareholders for its year ended last June, breaking a two-year dividend drought associated with the costs of building the new geothermal plants and installing additional capacity in existing plants.  Miano said shareholders might secure additional dividends in the future. “The outlook is positive because we have projects that we are implementing that will increase our business and we do hope that the board will continue (recommending a dividend),” she said.

2019-02-14,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has selected banks to arrange its first international debt sale, which will help it finance the acquisition of a stake in Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The state oil giant has picked a group of banks including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citi, HSBC and Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank, the sources said. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have been appointed joint global coordinators and, together with the other banks, joint bookrunners, said one of the sources.  JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC declined to comment. Aramco and the other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Aramco, the world’s top oil producer, plans to issue its first international bonds in the second quarter of 2019, likely worth about $10 billion, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last month. Sources previously told Reuters the oil giant could borrow as much as $50 billion from international investors to fund the purchase of all, or nearly all, of the 70 percent stake in SABIC held by the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s top sovereign wealth fund. Based on the type of fees banks gained on previous bond deals issued in the Gulf, fees could go up to roughly $1 million for each bookrunner, should the Aramco bond be in the vicinity of $10 billion. But banks have pitched hard over the past few months for this high-profile bond mandate - not so much for the fees, but in the hope of being rewarded by Aramco with future mandates for capital markets transactions and other banking business such as foreign exchange and investment services. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, along with other banks, were working on the planned stock market listing of Aramco before the move was put on hold. The new planned listing date is 2021, Saudi officials have said. An international bond sale by Aramco will almost certainly require the company to obtain a credit rating and disclose financial information in a prospectus. Aramco has so far been reluctant to disclose many details of its finances. Concern about disclosure requirements was one reason that Aramco shelved the plan for a public offer of its shares last year. Chief Executive Amin Nasser said last month that Aramco was talking to credit rating agencies ahead of its debut on the international capital markets. Aramco expects to match the ratings of Exxon and Shell, a source familiar with the matter said, but bond market investors expect Aramco to have a similar, if not lower, rating than Saudi Arabia.

2019-02-14,"(Repeats Feb. 13 story; no change to text) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Struggling state-run power firm Eskom subjected South Africa to the worst power cuts in several years this week, after a decade of missteps when electricity sales stagnated and costs soared. The outages expose the risks to Africa’s most industrialised economy from Eskom’s virtual monopoly and the failure of successive governments to take on labour unions and leftists in the ruling African National Congress (ANC) who oppose change. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a new board at Eskom in 2018 and plans to split the utility, which expects to lose about 20 billion rand ($1.5 billion) this year and next. It doesn’t even earn enough to service its mountain of debt. Analysts say bolder steps, not just a break up, are needed to rescue a firm that supplies 90 percent of the nation’s power. But South African officials have ruled out selling Eskom and more borrowing will only bury the company deeper in debt, which leaves it up to the government to step in with a bailout. Below are the challenges Eskom faces and possible solutions. Eskom’s power station performance has deteriorated steeply in part because of delays to critical maintenance work. This week, around a third of Eskom’s 45,000 megawatt (MW) installed capacity was out of service because of plant-related problems, diesel shortages and planned maintenance. Eskom has a plan to improve performance, such as overhauling units that have been shut down for long periods and fixing design flaws at two major power projects, Medupi and Kusile. The aim is to lift the Energy Availability Factor, or the level at which capacity can be used, to 77 percent by late 2020 from below 70 percent now. But long-term neglect means there are no quick fixes. “It will take years to sort out the problems that have built up,” said Chris Yelland, a Johannesburg-based energy analyst. More than 80 percent of Eskom’s power is produced from coal dug from South African mines. But spending on primary energy, mostly coal, has more than quadrupled in the past decade, reaching 85.2 billion rand in the year to March 2018. It has also faced supply shortages. “Eskom’s coal procurement needs to be sorted out, with people brought in who understand mines and the quality of coal. Bribe-taking is still a big problem,” said Xavier Prevost, a senior analyst at XMP Consulting. Eskom’s new management acknowledges its finances have been hurt by fraud and corruption and says it has investigated hundreds of instances of alleged wrongdoing. Eskom’s supply problems were compounded by its decision to reduce investment in “cost-plus” mines, where it contributes to costs and receives a guaranteed volume and quality of coal. Eskom’s new management has reversed that policy, pledging to invest up to 12 billion rand in cost-plus mines in the next five years. It has also signed more than 40 coal supply contracts. Eskom employs 48,000 people, after hiring about 12,000 additional employees in the past decade. A World Bank research report published in 2016 said two-thirds of employees weren’t needed. Cutting jobs will be politically difficult for Ramaphosa before this year’s election, when he will have to rely on unions allied to the ANC if he wants to a decisive mandate. But analysts say it is a case of when, not if, jobs will go. Eskom has trimmed its executive management from 21 people to nine by combining roles. Eskom executives have also told investors they hope to gradually reduce staff numbers by a third, one investor has told Reuters. Eskom’s debt pile, which stood at 419 billion rand at the end of September, is perhaps its greatest challenge. Eskom has been assigned a credit rating from S&P Global of CCC+, deep into “junk” territory. The debt was largely racked up to build Medupi and Kusile, two of the largest coal-fired power stations in the world which have suffered massive cost overruns. Analysts say Eskom needs a bailout, a tough call for the government when its sovereign credit ratings are under pressure. Last year, Eskom Chairman Jabu Mabuza urged the government to take on 100 billion rand of the utility’s debt. Ramaphosa was initially cool on the idea but has since said the government would unveil measures to support Eskom’s balance sheet in a budget speech on Feb. 20. Nedbank CIB analysts estimate a bailout of 150 billion rand would be required to cover Eskom’s liquidity shortfall, while 190 billion rand would put it on a more sustainable path. Eskom has eroded its capital base by selling power for many years below production costs. That remains the case even though average power prices have risen about fourfold since 2007. The World Bank’s 2016 report found South Africa had some of the lowest electricity tariffs on the continent. Eskom has applied to energy regulator Nersa for tariff increases of 17.1 percent in 2019/20, 15.4 percent in 2020/21 and 15.5 percent in 2021/22. But Nersa tends to grant much smaller increases than Eskom demands. Nersa will respond to the latest requests by mid-March. Ramaphosa wants to split Eskom into entities responsible for generation, transmission and distribution, although they would still operate under the same Eskom holding company. Analysts say that doesn’t go far enough. “Separating within Eskom means the incentive issues and monopoly mindset will remain, and any upside from internal capital allocation being more transparent within entities may be limited,” said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex. One option would be to remove the holding structure and make the public enterprises ministry the shareholder of all three, making each unit function more independently. Another would be to break up the generation business into several smaller companies owning a mix of old and new power stations, which would compete with independent power producers to supply the cheapest electricity to the grid. Eskom is responsible for distribution in some areas of South Africa, while municipal distributors are responsible in others. And all of them face problems collecting payments. Eskom is owed more than 30 billion rand by municipalities and customers in the sprawling Soweto township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, a debt which continues to grow. “Municipalities are dragging Eskom down,” analyst Yelland said. “The distribution sector needs to be rationalised into a much smaller set of efficient, viable businesses.” $1 = 13.7369 rand

2019-02-14,"JOHANNESBURG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - South Africa suffered a fifth consecutive day of electricity blackouts on Thursday, driving the rand sharply down, as cash-strapped power utility Eskom struggles with coal shortages and breakdowns at some of its plants. The state-owned firm, which supplies more than 90 percent of the power in Africa’s most industrialised economy, started cutting power from the national grid on Sunday and intensified outages on Monday after six of its generating units unexpectedly went offline. On Wednesday, the government said Eskom was technically insolvent and needed an urgent bailout to help it manage its more than $30 billion of debt as it battles to keep its plants running. “Due to a shortage of capacity, Eskom will implement Stage 2 rotational load-shedding from 0800 (0600 GMT) today and is likely to continue until 2200,” Eskom said in a statement on Thursday. This means up to 2000 megawatts of electricity will be cut from the national power grid. On Monday the firm slashed 4,000 megawatts from the national grid, the largest cut since 2014. Locally referred to as “load-shedding”, the power cuts are an emergency measure to prevent the power system from a total collapse, Eskom says. The power crisis has spooked investors just days before a national budget, prompting a sharp slide in the rand and government bonds. The rand, which has tumbled 3 percent in three days, weakened past 14 per U.S. dollar earlier on Thursday. The Eskom crisis is a potential threat to the country’s credit rating, which is hanging by a thread with Moody’s the last of the top three agencies to rate it investment grade. President Cyril Ramaphosa  is set to give further details on his plan to split Eskom into three separate units when he responds to a parliamentary debate on his state of the nation address at 1200 GMT.

2019-02-14,"STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Commission added Saudi Arabia, Panama and four U.S. territories to a blacklist of nations it considers a threat because of lax controls on terrorism financing and money laundering, the EU executive said on Wednesday. The move is part of a crackdown on money laundering after several scandals at EU banks, but it has been criticised by several EU countries, including Britain, that are worried about their economic relations with the listed states, notably Saudi Arabia. The United States has also disapproved. The Saudi government said it regretted the decision in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency, adding: “Saudi Arabia’s commitment to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism is a strategic priority”. Panama said it should be removed from the list because it recently adopted stronger rules against money laundering. Despite pressure to exclude Riyadh from the list, the commission decided to list the kingdom, confirming a Reuters report in January.  Apart from reputational damage, inclusion on the list complicates financial relations with the EU. The bloc’s banks will have to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from listed jurisdictions. The list now includes 23 jurisdictions, up from 16. The commission said it added jurisdictions with “strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing regimes”. Other newcomers to the list are Libya, Botswana, Ghana, Samoa, the Bahamas and the four United States territories of American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Guam. The U.S. Treasury said the listing process was “flawed” and rejected the inclusion of the four U.S. territories on the list. The other listed states are Afghanistan, North Korea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia and Yemen. Bosnia, Guyana, Laos, Uganda and Vanuatu were removed.  The 28 EU member states now have one month, which can be extended to two, to endorse the list. They could reject it by qualified majority. EU justice commissioner Vera Jourova, who proposed the list, told a news conference that she was confident states would not block it.   She said it was urgent to act because “risks spread like wildfire in the banking sector”. But concerns remain. Britain, which plans to leave the EU on March 29, said on Wednesday the list could “confuse businesses” because it diverges from a smaller listing compiled by its Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is the global standard-setter for anti-money laundering.  The FATF list includes 12 jurisdictions - all on the EU blacklist - but excludes Saudi Arabia, Panama and U.S. territories. The FATF will update its list next week. London has led a pushback against the EU list in past days, and at closed-door meetings urged the exclusion of Saudi Arabia, EU sources told Reuters.  The oil-rich kingdom is a major importer of goods and weapons from the EU and several top British banks have operations in the country. Royal Bank of Scotland is the European bank with the largest turnover in Saudi Arabia, with around 150 million euros ($169 million) in 2015, according to public data.  HSBC is Europe’s most successful bank in Riyadh. It booked profits of 450 million euros in 2015 in the kingdom but disclosed no turnover and has no employees there, according to public data released under EU rules.   “The UK will continue to work with the Commission to ensure that the list that comes into force provides certainty to businesses and is as effective as possible at tackling illicit finance,” a British Treasury spokesman said. Criteria used to blacklist countries include weak sanctions against money laundering and terrorism financing, insufficient cooperation with the EU on the matter and lack of transparency about the beneficial owners of companies and trusts. Five of the listed countries are already included on a separate EU blacklist of tax havens. They are Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and the three U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam and U.S. Virgin Islands. Critics said the list fell short of including several countries involved in money-laundering scandals in Europe. “Some of the biggest dirty-money washing machines are still missing. These include Russia, the City of London and its offshore territories, as well as Azerbaijan,” said Greens lawmaker Sven Giegold, who sits in the European Parliament special committee on financial crimes. Jourova said the commission will continue monitoring other jurisdictions not yet listed. Among the states that will be closely monitored are the United States and Russia.

2019-02-14,"OSLO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Norway’s government approved on Thursday the building of a copper mine near Europe’s northernmost point despite years of opposition from indigenous Sami herders and fishermen. “The mining project will strengthen the industrial base in the north,” Industry Minister Torbjoern Roe Isaksen of the centre-right coalition government said in a statement. “It will contribute positively to the local community, with new jobs and skills.” Norway’s decision on the copper mine has been viewed as a litmus test for the Arctic, where climate change and technology are enabling mineral and energy extraction, shipping and tourism while threatening traditional ways of life. The Nussir ASA project is expected to bring jobs and investments to the Kvalsund municipality, but the digging could damage reindeer summer pastures and a plan to dump tailings in the fjord would destroy spawning grounds for the coastal cod. Nussir says the area contains an estimated 72 million tonnes of copper ore — Norway’s largest reserve — and plans to invest more than 1 billion crowns  ($115.77 million) in the mine while making only minimal intrusion in the local way of life. $1 = 8.6376 Norwegian crowns

2019-02-14,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s coal imports soared in January, more than tripling from the prior month to 33.5 million tonnes, but there are compelling reasons to treat this outcome with caution, including weakness in benchmark Australian coal prices. January’s coal imports were the highest in five years, rising 228 percent from the weak 10.23 million tonnes reported for December. It’s a characteristic of commodity markets that there isn’t always a straight line between supply and demand and prices, and the resurgent buying by the world’s top importer of the polluting fuel is a case in point. It’s always worth being cautious about commodity imports around the Lunar New Year festival, as the week-long holiday in China tends to distort the data in the first two months of the year. This year the new year fell in early February, meaning there was likely some pulling forward of coal import demand as traders brought in cargoes ahead of the holidays. Analysis is further complicated by signals from the authorities in Beijing toward the end of last year, when they made it clear they wanted to keep coal imports to the same level in 2018 as they were in 2017. While this didn’t quite work, it did cause a dramatic fall in imports in December, which also may have resulted in some cargoes being delayed until January. Given there are solid reasons to be somewhat sceptical that January’s import strength represents a new uptrend for China’s coal imports, it’s hardly surprising that thermal coal prices have been slipping in Australia. The price of coal at Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, fell to $95.99 a tonne in the week ended Feb. 10, the lowest since May last year. The price is also down almost 20 percent from the seven-year high of $119.74 a tonne, hit in July last year. But while prices for Australian thermal coal have struggled in recent months, the opposite is true for Indonesian coal, with the Southeast Asian nation’s lower-energy cargoes enjoying strong demand. Indonesian coal with an energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kg, as assessed by Argus Media, rose to $34.45 a tonne in the week ended Feb. 8. The price has climbed 19.4 percent since hitting a 28-month low of $28.85 a tonne in late November. This indicates a likely shift in buyer preferences from higher-quality Australian coal to lower-quality Indonesian supplies. In China, Indonesian coal is often used as a blending feedstock with domestic supplies, as the low sulphur content offsets the lower energy value. The popularity of Indonesian coal in China can be seen in the vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. In January, China imported 12.3 million tonnes of Indonesian coal, the highest monthly total since Refinitiv started monitoring in January 2015. This was almost double the 6.8 million tonnes recorded in December, and also well above 8.7 million tonnes in November, the shipping data showed. Australia also boosted its shipments to China in January, with imports rising to 7.9 million tonnes from December’s 5.8 million. However, the January total was more or less in line with November’s 7.8 million tonnes and only slightly above the 2018 average of 7.24 million per month. What the shipping data shows is perhaps an emerging trend for the world’s two biggest exporters of coal, with Indonesia seemingly gaining the upper hand over Australia, at least as far as China is concerned.

Bloomberg reported President Donald Trump was considering pushing back the deadline by 60 days, citing people familiar with the matter. Trump, on Wednesday, had said the talks were “going along very well” as they try to resolve the dispute ahead of the initial March 1 deadline. With Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in China for high level talks, investors had been daring to hope for good news.

Shanghai blue chips were down 0.2 percent, having jumped 2 percent on Wednesday to levels last seen in late September. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.2 percent, though that was off a peak last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.1 percent to its highest for the year as a weakening yen boosted export stocks. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.15 percent. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for China risks, gained 0.4 percent to $0.7114. The Aussie had already got a small lift when Chinese trade data handily beat expectations in a welcome relief for the global economy. Beijing reported exports rose 9.1 percent in January from a year earlier, confounding forecasts of a fall, while imports dipped by a surprisingly slight 1.5 percent. There was some hope another U.S. government shutdown would be averted as Trump edged toward backing a deal in Congress on funding for a border barrier. In currency markets, the improvement in risk appetite undermined the safe haven yen and propelled the dollar to its best levels of the year so far at 111.05. The euro took a hit of its own from dire data on European industrial output which pushed long-term market inflation expectations to new lows, while putting downward pressure on bond yields in the bloc.

2019-02-14,"* Jan crude imports off peak but holds above 10 mln bpd * Gas imports hit record as importers anticipated firmer demand * Refined fuel exports up 31.6 pct y/y By Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - China’s crude oil imports in January rose 4.8 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Thursday, with refineries building up their stockpiles ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays that fell in early February. Natural gas imports into the world’s biggest importer of the fuel rose to a monthly record of 9.81 million tonnes, exceeding the previous peak in December of 9.23 million tonnes, as state-run importers hiked volumes in anticipation of increasing heating demand. China, the world’s biggest crude oil importer, took in 42.6 million tonnes of oil in January, according to the data released by the General Administration of Chinese Customs. That works out to 10.03 million barrels per day (bpd), the third straight month that imports have exceeded the 10 million bpd mark. January imports are down from the record on a daily basis of 10.43 million bpd in November as independent processors last month reduced procurements because of smaller quota allotments for 2019. But purchases by new private refiners Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical for test operations kept import levels elevated. Northeast China-based Hengli Petrochemical aims to have all the units at its 400,000-bpd plant operating at full capacity by the end of March. Gas imports, including piped gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipped in tankers, rose to 9.81 million tonnes last month, up 26.2 percent from January 2018. Even with high inventories amid a warmer-than-usual winter, China’s LNG imports were expected to hit a record in January as state energy firms pre-arranged shipments in anticipation of stronger demand. Customs data also showed China’s refined fuel exports rose 31.6 percent in January from the same month last year to 5.42 million tonnes. State refineries, equipped with higher export quotas, are shipping out fuel in greater volumes and reaching more distant markets. Sinopec Corp unit Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Corp said on Wednesday that it had exported diesel and jet fuel to Europe for the first time.

2019-02-14,"MANILA, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Phoenix Petroleum Philippines Inc said on Thursday it is in talks with state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) for a “strategic alliance” on its proposed $2 billion liquefied natural gas hub. Phoenix, a fuel retailer, has won government approval to build an LNG regasification and receiving terminal and has tapped CNOOC Gas and Power Group Co Ltd, a unit of CNOOC and China’s largest LNG importer and terminal operator, as a partner. The Philippines is looking to import LNG to feed its gas-fired power plants as domestic gas supply from the country’s Malampaya field is set to run out by 2024 at the earliest. Phoenix, owned by Dennis Uy, a Filipino businessman with close ties to President Rodrigo Duterte, said in a statement that a Memorandum of Understanding could be signed with PNOC in the coming weeks. Phoenix said the alliance with PNOC could involve pipeline infrastructure, PNOC’s share of Malampaya gas, equity, and marketing opportunities. Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi told Reuters that PNOC, of which he is the board chairman, “was approached by some potential investors for a possible 10-15 percent participating interest” in an LNG project, but he gave no further details. “We just have to wait for further developments,” he said. Phoenix plans to break ground this year for the LNG terminal in Batangas province, south of the capital Manila, with commercial operations targeted to start by 2023. The facility will have a capacity of 2.2 million tonnes per year and has a 2,000-megawatt power plant component. Philippine power producer First Gen Corp, which operates four power plants in Batangas with a combined capacity of about 2,000 MW - all running on Malampaya gas - has also applied for a permit to build an LNG terminal. First Gen, with Tokyo Gas Co Ltd as its LNG partner, is seeking to ensure availability of gas for its power plants ahead of Malampaya’s depletion. Its application was still under evaluation, Cusi said. A third party, Australia-listed Energy World Corp, has been developing an LNG import terminal project on Pagbilao island in Quezon province since 2011, but completion has been set back by several delays. Cusi said EWC is targetting commercial operations at its LNG hub by 2021.

2019-02-14,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress named new temporary boards of directors to state-oil firm PDVSA on Wednesday, in an effort to wrest the OPEC nation’s oil revenue from increasingly isolated socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro lashed out at the congress leader, Juan Guaido, saying in an interview that he would face the courts “sooner or later” for violating the constitution, after Guaido invoked constitutional provisions last month to assume an interim presidency. Although many Western countries have recognized Guaido as legitimate head of state, Maduro retains control of state institutions and Guaido needs funds if he is to assemble an interim government. Controlling PDVSA’s U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, Venezuela’s most valuable foreign asset, would go some way to helping in that, though seizing the reins of PDVSA itself seems improbable while Maduro remains in power. “We have taken a step forward with the reconstruction of PDVSA,” Guaido said on Twitter, just after congress named the directors. “With this decision, we are not only protecting our assets, we also avoid continued destruction.” PDVSA’s crude output has slumped to 70-year lows, due to crushing debts, widespread corruption, and little maintenance of its infrastructure.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which backs Guaido, imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector on Jan. 28, aimed at curbing exports to the United States and upping the pressure on Maduro. Trump will give a speech on Venezuela at Florida International University in Miami on Monday, voicing support for Guaido and also making remarks about “the dangers of socialism,” a White House official said on Wednesday. The proposed Citgo board would be composed of Venezuelans Luisa Palacios, Angel Olmeta, Luis Urdaneta and Edgar Rincon, all of whom are currently living in the United States, plus one American director. The nominations fuel a growing duel for control between Guaido and Maduro, who has promised he will not allow Citgo to be “stolen.” The mechanics of how the new board would take over are unclear, and there are likely to be court challenges to the board’s authority, people familiar with the deliberations say. Citgo and PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests to comment. Bulgarian security officials said on Wednesday that the country had blocked transfers out of several bank accounts which have received millions of euros from PDVSA. A member of Guaido’s U.S. diplomatic team told Reuters that they now had the “capacity” to use bank accounts belonging to Venezuela’s Washington embassy, though they did not plan to do so for now. Guaido declared himself president three weeks ago, arguing that Maduro’s re-election last year was a sham. In an interview released on Wednesday by Lebanese television channel al-Mayadeen TV, Maduro said Guaido was seeking to divide the country and persuade the Trump administration to launch a foreign intervention. “This person, who believes that politics is a game and he can violate the constitution and the law, sooner or later will have to answer before the courts,” Maduro said, adding he was “absolutely sure” of this. “If the American empire dares to touch even one palm leaf in our territory, this will turn into a new Vietnam,” he said. U.S. Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday said Congress would oppose U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and challenged the credibility of Trump’s special envoy to deal with the crisis, Elliott Abrams, over his past embrace of American covert action in Latin America. The Trump administration has said it wants a peaceful resolution to the crisis but Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out military action. “I think there are a number of solutions, a number of different options, and we look at all options,” Trump said when asked about the issue on Wednesday, in an appearance at the White House with Colombian President Ivan Duque. In the meantime, the United States has said it will try to channel aid to Venezuela, via neighboring Colombia and possibly Brazil. Duque said Maduro’s refusal to let in aid amounted to a crime against humanity and called on other countries to recognize it as such. Guaido told a huge rally of supporters on Tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on Feb. 23, setting the stage for a showdown with Maduro. Maduro has called the aid a U.S.-orchestrated show and denies there is an economic crisis, despite a widespread lack of food and medicine and hyperinflation.

2019-02-14,"SYDNEY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Thursday, buoyed by hopes that potential progress in the latest Sino-U.S. tariff talks would improve the global economic outlook. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.76 per barrel at 2338 GMT, up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. They closed up 1.5 percent on Wednesday, having touched their highest since Feb. 5 at $54.60 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. They closed the previous session up 1.9 percent, after marking their strongest since Nov. 21 at $63.98 a barrel. Optimism that a trade deal could be reached between the United States and China was boosted when U.S. President Donald Trump said talks were going “very well”. “The 90-day truce (on trade) agreed in December will run out on March 1, but given the progress of the talks there could be an extension, which is why there are rising optimism that the two leaders will meet later that month,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst, OANDA. But climbing U.S. oil stockpiles weighed on prices. U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week to the highest since November 2017 as refiners cut runs to the lowest since October 2017, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories built for a fourth week in a row, rising 3.6 million barrels to 450.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 8. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast an increase of 2.7 million barrels. The global oil market will struggle this year to absorb fast-growing crude supply from outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, even with the group’s production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, the International Energy Agency said in a report on Wednesday.

2019-02-14,"* Underlying profit of $1.42 bln just misses forecasts * Dividend up 47 pct to 144 cents, beats forecasts * International firms eye stake in Scarborough gas * Shares jump 3.4 pct, outperform broader market (Adds CEO, analyst comment) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Australia’s Woodside Petroleum Ltd surprised investors with a fat dividend on Thursday after reporting a 36-percent percent rise in annual profit, underpinned by stronger oil prices. The higher-than-expected payout came after shareholders stumped up $2.5 billion to buy new shares a year ago at a time when Australia’s biggest independent oil and gas producer expected oil prices to average $65 a barrel. By the end of the year it was flush with cash as oil prices had averaged $71 and the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, run by Chevron Corp and partly owned by Woodside, performed better than anticipated. “We thought it was prudent to reward our shareholders for supporting us last year in the equity raising, given that pricing and production has been stronger than we expected when we raised that equity,” Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman told reporters on a conference call. Woodside’s shares rose as much as 3.4 percent in a broader market that was up 0.4 percent. “The dividend was the big surprise, a second-half payout ratio of about 100 percent,” RBC analyst Ben Wilson said in a note. “The increased dividend will be welcomed by some, particularly given the strong appetite for cash-flow generation and higher distribution from investors in energy companies globally, driven by increased oil price volatility,” Wilson said. The total dividend was $852 million, or 144 cents a share, compared with analysts’ forecasts of around 135 cents a share, according to Refinitiv estimates. Net profit for 2018 rose to $1.36 billion from $1.07 billion in 2017. Underlying profit was $1.42 billion, just below analysts’ estimates of around $1.45 billion. With an eye on growth, Woodside in January pledged between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion towards projects this year, with most of that flowing into early work on its Scarborough and Browse gas developments and expansion of its Pluto LNG plant in Australia, as the company aims to double LNG production by 2027. The capital raising last year was partly to help Woodside buy a 50-percent stake in Scarborough for $744 million, giving it a total stake of 75 percent. It is now looking to sell part of that by the end of this year, fielding interest from a number of international parties, Coleman said. He did not name the companies. There is speculation Saudi Aramco is one of them, after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih said in an interview with the Financial Times this week the world’s biggest oil producer was looking at investments offshore, including Australia. “Woodside as a company, and Australia as a country, could be perceived as a more manageable investment destination for Saudi Aramco’s global LNG ambitions compared to some other pre-FID (final investment decision) projects,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic.

2019-02-14,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei firms as yen slips, eyes on China stocks * Top U.S. China officials to meet for tariff talks * China trade data expected to show further weakness * Dollar gains as yen, euro and pound all ebb By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets started in a cautious mood on Thursday as investors hoped for progress in the latest Sino-U.S. tariff talks while bracing for China trade data that are expected to show further falls in both exports and imports. There was some hope another U.S. government shutdown would be averted as President Donald Trump edged toward backing a deal in Congress on funding for a border barrier. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was all but flat, having just touched peaks last seen in early October. Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.3 percent to its highest for the year so far as a weakening yen boosted export stocks. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent. Chinese stocks were grabbing attention after the Shanghai blue chips index jumped 2 percent on Wednesday to levels last seen in late September. With Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Beijing for high level talks, investors were daring to hope for good news. Trump said on Wednesday the talks with China were “going along very well” as they try to resolve the tariff dispute ahead of a March 1 deadline. “Investors are once again cautiously optimistic that progress will be made and realistically an extension of the tariff deadline will be seen as a good result,” SAID Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities. “Longer term, only evidence of a solid deal going forward will dispel the investor caution and global growth fears that have been such a feature over the last year.” Data showing U.S. consumer price inflation rose at the slowest annual pace in more than 1-1/2 years supported speculation the Federal Reserve could stay patient on rates and helped lift Wall Street. The Dow ended Wednesday up 0.36 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.30 percent and the Nasdaq 0.26 percent. In currency markets, the improvement in risk appetite undermined the safe haven yen and propelled the dollar to its best levels of the year so far at 111.04. The euro took a hit of its own from dire data on European industrial output which pushed long-term market inflation expectations to new lows, while putting downward pressure on bond yields in the bloc. The single currency was last at $1.1259 and testing the floor of a $1.1213/1.1570 trading range that has held since mid-October. Sterling was also on edge at $1.1846 ahead of another parliamentary vote on British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan. All of which left the dollar firm on a basket of currencies at 97.243, near its highest since mid-December. The dollar’s gains kept gold restrained at $1,307.15 per ounce. Oil prices found support as top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would cut crude exports and deliver an even deeper cut to its production. U.S. crude was last up 10 cents at $54.00 a barrel. Brent crude futures were yet to trade at $63.61.

2019-02-14,"(Reuters) - SunPower Corp is seeking a strategic partner for its solar panel manufacturing business, an arrangement that could allow it to expand the U.S. factory it acquired last year, Chief Executive Tom Werner said on Wednesday. A partnership could involve the sale of a minority stake in the manufacturing business or a customer investment that would allow preferential access to its products, among other options, Werner said. The investment would allow SunPower to accelerate deployment of its next-generation solar technology and could allow it to do more at the Hillsboro, Oregon factory that it acquired last year as it sought to stem the impact of Trump administration tariffs on foreign-made panels. SunPower makes most of its products overseas but bought the Oregon factory last year at the same time it was seeking an exemption from the 30 percent tariffs, which it was ultimately granted. “We are out fundraising, looking for strategic partners, and depending on the degree of success of that Hillsboro could stay the same or expand faster,” Werner said in an interview. SunPower, which is based in San Jose, California but is majority owned by France’s Total, has about 250 employees at the facility in Oregon.  The company’s panels are among the most efficient in the industry at transforming sunlight into electricity. But prices on solar modules are falling rapidly and manufacturers must keep investing in their technology to stay competitive. This is particularly true for companies producing panels in the United States, where costs are higher.  “We have to keep investing and keep pushing the technology,” Werner said. “Things are changing rapidly in solar, and we know that rapidly means more aggressive pricing and incremental efficiency improvements.” Other solar panel producers including JinkoSolar, LG and Hanwha Q Cells have made similar investments in U.S. factories that will ramp up this year. SunPower has restructured its business over the last two years to reduce debt and cut costs. Its two key segments - North American residential and commercial solar, and panel manufacturing and overseas installation activities - now operate largely independently. The company said on Wednesday that its financial performance would improve throughout 2019 due to record commercial bookings in the fourth quarter of last year. The company will also benefit this year from its exemption from the U.S. tariffs.
