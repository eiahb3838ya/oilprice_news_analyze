2018-07-01,"TUNIS, July 1 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday that a port blockade by eastern authorities could result in losses estimated at 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and daily revenue of $67.4 million. Operations at the ports were blocked after the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) announced last Monday that it would no longer let the Tripoli-based NOC export from them. The standoff is part of a broader conflict in Libya and has raised the prospect of a prolonged output drop from the OPEC member, which had recently been pumping more than one million bpd. Two terminals, Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, were shut by fighting involving the LNA last month. The NOC had said blockades would likely oblige it to declare force majeure at two other terminals, Hariga and Zueitina, on Sunday, but it has yet to do so. The LNA also controls a fifth port, at Brega. However, it warned in a statement that if force majeure was declared this would “have significant short and long term consequences for NOC affiliate companies, the national economy and the Libyan people”. In addition to the crude oil losses, the NOC said output of natural gas used for local power supplies and oil and gas field operations would fall by 710 million standard cubic feet per day, and that more than 20,000 bpd of condensate would be lost. “The power generation at the Zueitina and North Benghazi power stations will be badly affected,” the NOC said. “The corporation is already facing a deficit in the fuel import budget and will not be able to compensate the lost gas due to the shutdown by importing more liquid fuel from abroad.” To keep power plants operational, the NOC said it would have to burn valuable condensate, “resulting in significant negative environmental impact”. Displacing high-wax crude from the Abu Attifel to Zueitina pipeline would require one million barrels of water and additional chemicals, and Waha Oil Company pipelines could be corroded by the stoppage, the NOC said. Once stored crude was used, refineries at Brega, Sarir and Tobruk would be forced to close, the statement said. Reporting by Aidan Lewis

2018-07-01,"LONDON(Reuters) - The leader of Saudi Arabia has assured U.S. President Donald Trump that the Kingdom can raise oil production if needed and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool down oil prices to compensate for falling output in Venezuela and Iran. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said Saudi Arabia had agreed to increase output by up to this amount, although a subsequent statement from the White House rowed back on this assertion. Either way, the kingdom, OPEC’s biggest member, can barely raise output by 1 million bpd to 11 million bpd and even that would be difficult, according to industry analysts who forecast a further oil price rally due to a lack of new supply. OPEC 's race to balance crude oil supply and demand - reut.rs/2tJQ2sl Below are comments from some leading OPEC analysts: PIERRE ANDURAND, hedge fund manager “I guess the Saudis want to give the confidence to Trump to go very hardcore on Iran. Exports to zero or an attack. It will be interesting to see what the Saudis can really do and for how long. It seems that Iranian regime change is priority number one for the Saudis.” AMRITA SEN, Chief Oil Analyst at Energy Aspects “We will be in unchartered territory. While Saudi Arabia has the capacity in theory, it takes time and money to bring these barrels online, possibly up to 1 year”. GARY ROSS, head of global oil analytics at S&P Global “The Saudis do not have 2 million bpd of spare capacity as it would imply production of 12 million bpd. They can likely produce a maximum of 11 million and even that will be running their system at stress levels,” said Ross. He added that with a potential output fall of up to 1.5 million bpd in Iran and further outages in Venezuela and Libya, the world could be short of 2 million bpd of oil output without an increase in Saudi output by the end of the year. OLE HANSEN, head of commodities research at Saxo Bank “We are seeing another strong signal from the two of the world’s three largest producers to cap the price upside in oil. With Russia agreeing to this we are seeing political interference in the setting of oil prices on the rise. Saudi Arabia agreeing to such a request basically raises the risk that OPEC has played out its role with Saudi, Russia and the U.S. are now setting the agenda.” “I do not believe that Saudi can increase production to 12 million bpd but they can increase exports by digging into their reserves.” “It does however also increase Middle East tensions and with Iran controlling the Strait of Hormuz there is a risk that this could escalate to a point where 2 million bpd would not be enough.” “In the short-term, however, a busy night on Sunday can be expected, with traders and funds getting caught on the long side. Not least in WTI, where we saw a collapse in the gross short last week while the net-long jumped by 25 percent and the long/short ratio hit a 7-year high.” GIOVANNI STAUNOVO, commodity analyst at UBS  “While U.S. President Trump’s tweet is very clear on how much oil he intends to see from Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Press Agency statement was more vague - no volume increase reference.” “The statement seems to suggest the Kingdom stands ready, but first wants to see larger disruptions materializing.”  “A 2-million-bpd Saudi production increase would move the Kingdom’s oil production into unchartered territory and would wipe out completely the kingdom’s spare capacity.” “Prices are likely to become more volatile over the coming months, caught between two narratives: Oversupply concerns and dwindling spare capacity/oil market tightness concerns.”   Reporting by Amanda Cooper, Rania el Gamal, Ahmad Ghaddar, Dmitry Zhdannikov, editing by Louise Heavens, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-saudi-trump/update-1-can-saudi-arabia-pump-much-more-oil-idUKL8N1TX0PE,01 Jul 2018,"The leader of Saudi Arabia has

2018-07-01,"BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump lashed out at OPEC with a warning to stop manipulating oil markets and piled pressure on close U.S. allies in an interview that aired on Sunday with a threat to sanction European companies that do business with Iran. The president, in an interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” also said he would not complete a new NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico until after the November congressional elections. Trump, who is spending the weekend at his golf property in New Jersey, said in a tweet on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had agreed to produce more oil. The White House later walked back the president’s comments, saying the king said his country can raise oil production if needed. Oil prices rose on Friday on worries that U.S. sanctions against Iran would take away significant volumes of crude oil from world markets while oil demand worldwide increases.  Rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump ahead of the November elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the economy. On Fox, Trump directed blame at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is a member. Asked if someone was manipulating oil markets, Trump said: “OPEC is and they better stop it because we’re protecting those countries, many of those countries.” The president also had tough words for other U.S. allies. Earlier this year, to the chagrin of European partners, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement secured by world powers. He said in the Fox interview that European companies would face sanctions if they traded with Iran now. “Of course. That’s what we’re doing, absolutely,” he said. Trump will leave for a trip to Europe later this month for a meeting with NATO allies, whom he has criticized sharply for paying too little for their joint defense.  Trade tensions are likely to overshadow that trip. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in response to what he calls unfair trade practices from Europe, Canada, and other allies around the world, who have responded with retaliatory sanctions in kind. On trade, the president said in the Fox interview that he was not happy with the North American Free Trade Agreement and would not agree a new one until after the November elections. “I want to wait until after the election,” he said.

2018-07-01,"* Markets up on oil surge * Expected GCC support for Bahrain adds momentum * Saudi REITs best performers boosted by retail buyers * Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair drops on profits * Eshraq Properties shines in Abu Dhabi By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, July 1 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets closed in positive territory on Sunday, boosted by a surge in oil prices, an increase in retail investors and encouraging news on Bahrain’s financial prospects. Oil prices surged last week on concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets at a time of rising global demand. Bahrain’s bonds and currency rebounded from multi-year lows late last week after Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates said in a joint statement that they would announce soon measures to support its economy. The Bahraini index closed 0.2 percent up on Sunday. It climbed 0.9 percent since last week’s announcement from the country’s regional allies. The Saudi index gained 0.3 percent, with petrochemical companies rising on the back of higher oil prices, and with real estate investment trust funds posting large gains of up to 10 percent. The best performer was Al Jazira Mawten REIT, up 9.9 percent, followed by Taleem REIT Fund, which jumped 9 percent. A fund manager said an increase of retail investors participating in the Saudi market over the last week could have pushed REIT valuations up, given that REIT stocks are generally speculative and attract high-yield seekers. Lifted by surging oil prices, petchem companies such as Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. and Sahara Petrochemical Co. gained 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. The worst performer was Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair Co. , with stocks in the Saudi retailer plunging 6.4 percent after the company reported its annual financial results late last week. Net profit for the year ending on March 31 2018 declined 76 percent, to 103.5 million riyals from 425.3 million riyals the previous year, it said. Stock exchanges were up across the region, with the Dubai index and the Abu Dhabi index up 1.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. In Abu Dhabi, Eshraq Properties jumped 6.7 percent. The company said last week it was seeking to deploy “excess liquidity” in investments across the United Arab Emirates, after dropping merger plans with Abu Dhabi developer Reem Investments. It also said it has no exposure to Dubai’s private equity Abraaj Group. In Dubai, most stocks were up but trading volume was concentrated on Drake & Scull (DSI), which shed 0.7 percent after some gains earlier on Sunday. Over the past two months, shares in the contractor have been dropping, going down to their lowest level ever, as retail investors offloaded them amid concerns about DSI’s business outlook and an investigation into its former management team. The company said in a bourse filing last week that the recent sell-off of its shares was not related to any major news. Outside of the Gulf, the Egyptian exchange was closed because of a national holiday. * The index climbed 0.3 percent to 8,340 points. * The index gained 1.5 percent to 2,864 points. * The index jumped 1.3 percent to 4,621 points. * The index rose 1 percent to 9,114 points. * The index added 0.2 percent to 4,915 points. * The index increased 0.2 percent to 1,314 points. * The index plunged 4.9 percent to 4,347 points. * The index was unchanged as the market was closed.

2018-07-01,"SEOUL (Reuters) - State-run utility Korea Electric Power Corp (015760.KS) (KEPCO) had been shortlisted to bid for a nuclear project in Saudi Arabia along with the United States, France, China and Russia, South Korea’s energy ministry said on Sunday.   “We were informed by our Saudi counterpart, King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, that KEPCO was shortlisted for a nuclear project in Saudi Arabia,” the ministry said in a statement.  The statement said the winner of the tender was expected to be chosen in 2019.   Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil producer, plans to build two nuclear plants to diversify its energy supply and has been in talks with companies from South Korea, the United States, Russia and China for the tender.  In May, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met South Korean Energy Minister Paik Un-gyu in Seoul. Falih told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event that he was “optimistic” about South Korea being on the tender shortlist.    South Korea, the world’s fifth-biggest nuclear power user, is seeking to export its nuclear reactors abroad.  In 2009, a South Korean consortium led by KEPCO won an $18.6 billion (14.08 billion pounds) deal to construct four nuclear plants in the United Arab Emirates, the country’s ever nuclear export success.  KEPCO was also selected as a preferred bidder in December last year for Toshiba’s NuGen nuclear project in Britain and the Korean company planned to talk with Toshiba to buy a stake in the project.

2018-07-01,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s economy began to recover in the first quarter of 2018 after shrinking for the first time in eight years during 2017, official data showed on Sunday, and the recovery looks set to accelerate in coming months with a rise in oil production. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew 1.2 percent from a year earlier in the first three months of 2018, the government’s statistics agency said. GDP had dropped from a year earlier in every quarter of 2017 as a global price-supporting agreement among oil exporting countries caused Saudi Arabia to cut back its crude output. For the whole of 2017, GDP shrank 0.7 percent. The impact of the oil deal faded at the start of 2018 after Saudi Arabia completed the required cuts. This allowed the oil sector, which comprises over 40 percent of the economy, to grow 0.6 percent from a year ago in the first quarter — a big contrast to its 4.3 percent decline in the last quarter of 2017. In the next several months, Saudi oil production is set to expand. Global producers agreed last month to boost output by a combined 700,000 to 1 million barrels per day, and as the world’s biggest crude exporter, Riyadh may account for the lion’s share of the increase. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman had agreed to boost output by as much as 2 million bpd to offset anticipated losses in production by Iran, which faces U.S. sanctions, and Venezuela.  Analysts think such a big jump is very unlikely. But Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said she was conservatively assuming a rise in average Saudi output of 500,000 bpd in the second half of 2018, which would be a year-on-year increase of about 5 percent.  Supply disruptions elsewhere in the world could cause Riyadh to lift output even more, Malik added, predicting overall Saudi GDP growth of 2.1 percent this year, led by the oil sector. Many non-oil businesses in Saudi Arabia are struggling under the weight of austerity steps designed to cut the government’s big budget deficit. A 5 percent value-added tax was imposed at the start of 2018 and domestic fuel prices were increased. As a result, Malik predicted only modest non-oil GDP growth of 1.8 percent this year, up from 1.0 percent in 2017. “To some degree we’re likely to return to Saudi Arabia’s old model of growth this year, with rising oil exports feeding through into the rest of the economy,” she said. “Structural reforms to create other sources of growth may have an impact in coming years, but don’t look like they’ll be in time to have an effect this year.” The non-oil sector grew just 1.6 percent from a year ago in the first quarter of 2018, only slightly faster than 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. Within that category the private sector, which authorities hope will create new jobs to bring down an unemployment rate of nearly 13 percent among Saudi citizens, inched up just 1.1 percent, faster than 0.4 percent in last year’s fourth quarter. The construction industry shrank 2.4 percent from a year ago in the first quarter, showing builders continued to struggle with state spending curbs and corporate caution that have reduced the number of big new projects in the past few years. The wholesale and retail sectors plus restaurants and hotels shrank 0.5 percent, suggesting Saudi consumers curbed their non-essential spending because of the new tax. An exodus of hundreds of thousands of foreign workers from Saudi Arabia due to the weak economy is also hurting consumer demand.

2018-07-01,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will allow private companies to export crude oil, part of a strategy to counter U.S. sanctions, and is urging fellow OPEC members, including regional rival Saudi Arabia, not to break output agreements, state media and officials said on Sunday. Iran is looking at ways to keep exporting oil as well as other measures to counter sanctions after the United States told allies to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November. “Iranian crude oil will be offered on the bourse and the private sector can export it in a transparent way,” First Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri told an economic event in Tehran broadcast live on state television. “We want to defeat America’s efforts ... to stop Iran’s oil exports,” he said.  “Oil is already being offered on the bourse, about 60,000 barrels per day, but that has been only for exports of oil products,” Jahangiri said. Iran has an oil and petrochemicals bourse as part of its mercantile exchange. Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh sent a letter to OPEC asking its members to adhere to the group’s agreement reached last month to collectively raise output and “refrain from any unilateral measures” that could undermine the unity of the producer group. Referring to reports that Saudi Arabia may increase its oil exports to replace Iranian oil in world markets, Jahangiri said: “Anyone trying to take away Iran’s oil market (share) would be committing great treachery against Iran and will one day pay for it.”      The leader of Saudi Arabia promised U.S. President Donald Trump that he can raise oil production if needed and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity, the White House said on Saturday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on June 23 to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost, but giving no specific numbers. “Any increase in the production by any member country beyond commitments stipulated in OPEC’s decisions ... would constitute breach of the agreement,” Zanganeh wrote in his letter, seen by Reuters and also reported by state media on Sunday.  Iran had been pushing hard for oil producers to hold output steady as U.S. sanctions are expected to hit its exports.

2018-07-01,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has asked fellow OPEC members to “refrain from any unilateral measures”, warning that would undermine the unity of OPEC, following reports that Saudi Arabia has raised its oil production to a record high this month.  As Tehran seeks ways to counter U.S. sanctions that would restrict its exports and eat into its market share, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh wrote to his UAE counterpart, Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018, urging him to remind OPEC members to adhere to last month’s agreement. “Any increase in the production by any member country beyond commitments stipulated in OPEC’s decisions ... would constitute breach of the agreement,” Zanganeh wrote in the letter seen by Reuters and reported by Iranian state media.  “I hereby request your excellency to remind OPEC member countries to adhere to their commitments ... refrain from any unilateral measures undermining the unity and independence of the OPEC,” he added. OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on June 23 to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost, but giving no specific numbers. OPEC and non-OPEC countries said they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. That would be roughly 1 million barrels per day of crude oil output increase according to OPEC officials. But since then sources familiar with Saudi oil thinking have briefed the market about an imminent rise in Saudi output to a record. Last week, a source told Reuters that Saudi output would rise to 11 million bpd in July, a whole 1 million bpd above May.  Iran had been pushing hard for oil producers to hold output steady as U.S. sanctions are expected to hit its exports. But Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, was keen to raise output to meet calls from U.S President Donald Trump and major consumers such as India and China to help cool oil prices and avoid shortages, according to Saudi officials including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih. Non-OPEC Russia, meanwhile, was under pressure from its own energy companies to lift caps on output and fight a steep rise in domestic fuel prices that was hurting President Vladimir Putin’s popularity, Russian sources have said. In the end, Saudi Arabia and Russia pushed through a rise of about 1 million bpd at the Vienna meeting. Washington said last week it was asking customers in Asia and Europe to reduce Iranian oil purchases to zero from November, and that it will not grant any waivers to sanctions. In his letter, Zanganeh said that unilateral decisions by some OPEC members were weakening the exporting group and that OPEC should not let others take political measures against the group’s unity and independence. “Any unilateral production increase beyond member countries’ commitments under the OPEC’s decisions would prompt U.S. to take actions against Iran,” he wrote.  “OPEC decisions by no means warrant any action by some of its member countries in pursuit of the call for production increase by the U.S., politically motivated against Iran and publicly declared.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-iran/iran-urges-opec-members-to-refrain-from-unilateral-actions-idUKL8N1TX06N,01 Jul 2018,"Iran has asked fellow OPEC members

2018-07-01,"WASHINGTON/RIYADH (Reuters) - The leader of Saudi Arabia promised President Donald Trump that he can raise oil production if needed and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity, the White House said on Saturday, rowing back on an earlier Trump tweet that appeared to suggest the Saudis had agreed to boost output by that amount. Trump told King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud that the oil market could need more supply when the men spoke on Friday, the White House said. The Saudi leader said he was ready to raise output if needed, the White House said in a statement. “King Salman affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance,” read the statement. However, a source familiar with Saudi Arabia’s production plans told Reuters earlier in the week of the kingdom’s intention to increase output by 200,000 bpd this month. Saudi Arabia along with other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC nations, including Russia, had agreed on June 22 to boost production by a combined 700,000 to 1 million barrels a day, so any 2 million bpd-increase would be at least double market expectations.  The White House statement undercut a tweet by Trump earlier in the day when he wrote that Saudi Arabia had definitely agreed to produce more oil. “Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference ... Prices to high! He has agreed!” Trump tweeted. In the tweet, Trump said the extra Saudi oil would help offset a decline in supply from Iran, after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May and moved to reimpose oil sanctions.  Trump was not specific on whether the additional 2 million barrels was a per-day figure - but worldwide daily demand is nearing 100 million bpd. Saudi state media reported that during the call, the Saudi king and Trump emphasized the need to preserve oil market stability and efforts of oil-producing countries to compensate for any potential shortage.  The statement reported by Saudi media did not mention any intention by Saudi Arabia to raise production by 2 million bpd. Saudi oil officials did not comment. The source familiar with the kingdom’s plans told Reuters last week that Riyadh plans to boost output in July to 11 million bpd, the highest in its history, up from 10.8 mln in June. Saudi Arabia has a maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd, but it has never tested that level of production.  “We will be in uncharted territory. While Saudi Arabia has the capacity in theory, it takes time and money to bring these barrels online, up to one year,” said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was trading around $79 a barrel on Friday, and a Reuters poll showed prices look to remain strong for the rest of this year due to supply disruptions in countries including Libya and Venezuela and as the extra oil from OPEC fails to meet rising demand.   Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih met with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Thursday to discuss energy security. The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November when the United States re-imposes sanctions against Tehran, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six major powers, against the advice of allies in Europe and elsewhere. U.S. officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions once they are re-imposed, with the aim of pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement. State Department officials said this week the United States is prepared to work with countries on a case-by-case basis to help them reduce imports of Iranian oil and suggested some exemptions were possible. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused Washington of trying to turn Iranians against their government. “They bring to bear economic pressure to separate the nation from the system ... but six U.S. presidents before him tried this and had to give up,” Khamenei was quoted as saying on Saturday by his website Khamenei.ir, referring to Trump. Iran’s rial currency has lost up to 40 per cent of its value since last month, when Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, accused the United States and Saudi Arabia of trying to push up oil prices and said both countries are acting against the foundation of OPEC. “If this happens, (it) means Trump is asking Saudi Arabia to walk (away) from OPEC,” he told Reuters. “The market will go up to $100 I am sure as Saudi Arabia said they will plan an increase for July. ... This was managed between the two to rob the pocket of rest of the world,” he said.

2018-07-01,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s biggest supermarket chains are scrambling to combat “bag rage” as frustrated shoppers vent their anger over the removal of single-use plastic bags.    One man put his hands around a supermarket worker’s throat, the West Australian newspaper reported, while grocery stores are putting on more staff to help customers get used to the change. The removal of single-use plastics is part of a national push to reduce waste. As of July 1, major retailers in all but two Australian states will be fined if they supply single-use plastic bags.    National supermarket chain Coles, owned by Wesfarmers, on Sunday removed single-use plastic bags from its stores, shortly after rival Woolworths banned the bags on June 20. Consumer complaints forced Woolworths to backflip on charging customers 15 Australian cents (11 U.S. cents) for a reusable plastic bag, with the retailer now offering them free until July 8. “They just want a little extra help from us to get through the transition,” said Claire Peters, Woolworths managing director, in an emailed statement. After seeing the backlash at its rival, Coles said it would open every checkout lane on Sunday to reduce queue lengths as staff explain the changes to customers. “We are taking a proactive step,” a Coles spokesperson said in an emailed statement.  The union that represents Australian shop assistants has launched a public awareness campaign on the issue. “While we understand that some customers may be frustrated by this change, there is absolutely no excuse for abusive or violent behavior towards retail staff,” said Gerard Dwyer, national secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association, in a statement on the union website. The union conducted a survey earlier this week and of 132 members who responded, 57 said they suffered abuse due to the plastic bag ban.  More than 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans each year, according to United Nations Environment Programme figures. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have so far taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption.
