2019-02-17,"BOGOTA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. delegation including Senator Marco Rubio visited the Colombian border city of Cucuta on Sunday, where humanitarian aid is being stockpiled for planned delivery to economically crippled Venezuela next week. While Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is refusing to allow in the food, medicine and other supplies, opposition leader and self-declared president Juan Guaido has vowed to move hundreds of tonnes of the aid into the country on Feb 23. Guaido, who argues that Maduro’s 2018 re-election was a sham, invoked constitutional provisions to declare himself the country’s leader last month. Most Western countries and many of Venezuela’s neighbors have recognized Guaido as the legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China and control of Venezuelan state institutions including the military. Guaido has said he will announce details of how he plans to get the aid into the country from Colombia, Brazil and Curacao on Monday, despite Maduro’s opposition. The Feb. 23 deadline sets the stage for a showdown with Maduro, who has said the aid is not needed. Maduro calls the aid a U.S.-orchestrated show and denies any crisis despite many Venezuelans’ scant access to food and medicine. It is unclear whether the military will allow aid to cross the border. Rubio of Florida is considered to have played a major role in convincing U.S. President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, to ratchet up pressure on Maduro. The senator has long been a harsh critic of the Venezuelan leader, who he regularly refers to as a dictator on social media, and has urged support for Venezuela’s opposition. Standing near a pedestrian bridge on the border between the two countries as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters chanted and waved flags, Rubio said the United States and the world would not abandon Venezuelans. “One thing is to see human suffering, another is to see it up close and personal and to meet the people and hear their stories,” he said. “What is happening in Venezuela is a man-made crisis of epic proportions. A criminal regime that is willing to starve and kill its own people before it gives up power.” The delegation, including Carlos Trujillo, the U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States and U.S. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, visited tents providing medical care to migrants and the warehouse where aid is being stored.

2019-02-17,"SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - The Haitian government vowed to deepen the investigation into alleged corruption in the PetroCaribe oil programme and to reduce its expenses, seeking to meet some of protestors’ demands as demonstrations roil the country. During a televised address on Saturday night, Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant announced nine measures aimed at alleviating the country’s economic crisis. Ceant said the government will reduce its expenses by 30 percent, meet with the private sector to try to raise the minimum wage and appoint a new director to intensify the investigation into alleged corruption by PetroCaribe. “I and the members of the government listen to (the opposition’s) voice, we hear his cry, we understand his anger and indignation,” Ceant said. Since Feb. 7, thousands of demonstrators have called for President Jovenel Moise and Ceant to resign and for an independent probe into the whereabouts of funds from the PetroCaribe agreement, an alliance between Caribbean countries and Venezuela. The agreement’s preferential terms for energy purchases were meant to help free up funds to aid development in Haiti, which has been hammered by natural disasters and is ranked as the poorest in the Americas, according to the World Bank. Ceant warned that the protests risked touching off a humanitarian crisis. “The population suffers a lot, because blocked roads cannot deliver water to drink, food, gasoline. It is almost impossible to have electricity,” said Ceant, who had previously kept silent during the protests, which have reportedly killed several people and injured many more. Since the protests broke out, several foreign governments, including the United States and Canada, have urged citizens to avoid travel to Haiti. Demonstrations are expected to resume this week. To address the economic crisis, the government will trim expenses by reducing trips abroad and the hiring of advisers, Ceant said. The government will also do more to seek foreign investment to reenergize the economy, he added. Moise also urged dialogue between government and the opposition during a speech on Thursday. In a statement issued on Saturday, the Economic Forum of the Private Sector, a Haitian business group, welcomed the government’s calls for dialogue but said the crisis was the result of Moise’s “lack of leadership.” Reporting by Ezequiel Abiu López; writing by Julia Love; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/haiti-politics/haiti-vows-to-trim-expenses-and-investigate-petrocaribe-amid-protests-idUKL1N20C08F,17 Feb 2019,"The Haitian government

2019-02-17,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday said Saudi Arabia has signed investment agreements worth $20 billion (£15.5 billion) during his high-profile visit to Pakistan, where tensions were flaring up with nuclear-armed rival India. Kicking off his tour of South Asia and China with a far higher Pakistan investment than expected, the crown prince said the $20 billion figure represents only the start of an economic tie-up that would bring the historic Muslim allies even closer. “It’s big for phase 1, and definitely it will grow every month and every year, and it will be beneficial to both countries,” said the crown prince. “We have been a brotherly country, a friendly country to Pakistan. We’ve walked together in tough and good times, and we (will) continue.” But Prince Mohammed’s visit is at risk of being overshadowed by Pakistan’s growing tensions with India. Earlier this week a suicide bomber killed 44 Indian paramilitary police in the disputed Kashmir region. New Delhi has accused Pakistan of having a hand in the bombing and vowed to punish Islamabad, which denies involvement.  Cash-strapped and in need of friends, Pakistan welcomed the crown prince with open arms and in grandiose fashion, including sending fighter jets to guide his incoming plane once it entered Pakistani airspace. Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan’s army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa greeted Prince Mohammed on the red carpet of a military airport in the garrison town of Rawalpindi, before Khan personally drove the crown prince to the capital Islamabad. “Saudi Arabia has always been a friend in need, which is why we value it so much,” said Khan, while seated next to Prince Mohammed. “I want to thank you for the way you helped us when we were in bad situation.” Saudi Arabia has in recent months helped keep Pakistan’s economy afloat by propping up its rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves with a $6 billion loan, giving Islamabad breathing room as it negotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. Islamabad has shown appreciation by treating Prince Mohammed’s trip as the biggest state visit since Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, soon after Beijing announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on infrastructure in Pakistan as part of China’s global Belt and Road initiative.  The tour is seen as a attempt by the crown prince to rebuild his reputation after the murder of Saudi critic and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, analysts say. Many in the West blamed Prince Mohammed for the killing, which triggered the kingdom’s biggest political crisis for a generation. He has denied being involved.  He had also planned to visit Indonesia and Malaysia during the tour, but those trips have been postponed, according to Malaysian and Indonesian officials. In Pakistan, most of the agreements signed focused on energy projects, including a $10 billion refinery and petrochemicals complex in the coastal city of Gwadar, where China is building a port. Memorandums of understanding were also signed for investments in minerals and agriculture, Khan said. The two nations’ relationship has in the past centred on oil-rich Saudi Arabia backing Pakistan’s economy during difficult periods, and in return Pakistan’s powerful army lending support to Saudi Arabia and its royal family. As the guardians of most holy sites in the birthplace of Islam, the Saudi royal family carries vast religious clout in Pakistan, a staunchly conservative and mainly Muslim nation of 208 million people. “What is happening in this relationship is a renewal of Pakistan’s commitment to help protect the royal family and the order as it exists in Saudi Arabia,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, Senior Fellow at Tabadlab, a Pakistani think tank focused on global and local public policy. “On the flip side, there is reassurance that Saudi Arabia will not only continue to serve as a strategic friend who will help shore up Pakistan’s finances when needed, but it’s also going to become a participant in the wider investment in Pakistan.” Prince Mohammed was also set to meet representatives of the Afghan Taliban militant group to discuss peace negotiations to end the 17-year civil war in Afghanistan, Pakistani government and militant sources said. But that was unlikely after the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group’s planned meetings with Khan and U.S. officials in Islamabad were called off.

2019-02-17,"(Adds details, quotes, background) PARIS, Feb 17 (Reuters) - French nuclear electricity generation is unlikely to surpass 405 terawatt hour (TWh) annually in the years ahead due to planned shutdowns of some nuclear reactors, Jean-Bernard Levy, chief executive of utility EDF said on Sunday. France plans to halt power generation at some of its aging nuclear reactors to reduce dependence on atomic energy and develop power from renewables sources. The 1,800 megawatt Fessenheim nuclear power plant, France’s oldest, is expected to be decommissioned by 2022. EDF operates France’s 58 nuclear reactors, which account for over 75 percent of the country’s electricity needs. It has set a target to produce 420 TWh a year, but said on Thursday that production this year would be 395 TWh, compared with 393 TWh last year. Levy said in an interview with French newspaper Les Echos that EDF’s revenue growth would remain limited if the Arenh mechanism - under which it sells nuclear electricity to rivals in the French market - remains unchanged. Under the Arenh mechanism, EDF sells 100 TWh of its annual output to rivals at a fixed price of 42 euros ($47) a megawatt hour (MWh). In the November auction window, alternative power providers in the French electricity market requested 132.93 TWh of EDF’s nuclear power generation for 2019. Levy said the current level of Arenh mechanism should be raised, and a floor price introduced to ensure EDF’s profitability, while a ceiling price should also be put in place to protect consumers from volatility. EDF has said the current price is too low and the mechanism is one-sided as its competitors only use it when it is advantageous to them. “The price at which we are required to sell our electricity to our competitors has not changed in eight years,” Levy said. “It helps to cover current costs but not to make our investments.” “Our competitors buy from the market when prices are lower than the Arenh, and from the Arenh when prices rise, depriving us of the rise in prices. This injustice must end,” he added. European wholesale power prices have traded above the Arenh level since May 2018, buoyed by the related increase in carbon emission permits, coal and gas prices, increasing demand from the Arenh window. The French year-ahead electricity contract for 2020 delivery settled at 49.10 euros/MWh on Friday. The contract hit a high of 57 euros/MWh in January. The French government is preparing a review of the mechanism, which is expected to be more favourable to EDF. $1 = 0.8855 euros

2019-02-17,"ABUJA (Reuters) - While most Nigerians took the delay in a presidential election in their stride on Sunday, after similar postponements in 2011 and 2015, one presidential candidate and civil society groups expressed concern that the vote could now be compromised. Authorities postponed Saturday’s election by a week just hours before polls had been due to open. The vote pits President Muhammadu Buhari, in power since 2015, against former vice president Atiku Abubakar. Previous elections in Africa’s biggest democracy and top oil producer have been marred by vote rigging, voter intimidation and post-election violence. Kingsley Moghalu - one of the best-known candidates aside from Buhari and Atiku - and civil society groups said there was uncertainty over the extent to which ballot papers and result sheets may have been exposed. “There is the risk of manipulation,” said Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the central bank, whose campaign has focussed on reviving the economy. “Even if there was a need to postpone the election it could have been done in a much tidier way that would not have exposed the process to these kinds of risks,” he said.  They fear the paperwork that was distributed only to be recalled hours before polling was due to begin could be used to falsify information to enable vote rigging in some areas. Voters at one church in the capital Abuja appeared largely unfazed on Sunday. The last two presidential elections, in 2011 and 2015, were also delayed over logistics and security issues. “Are people demoralised? Absolutely, definitely - but we are also a resilient people. Whatever it takes, they’ve shifted it to next week, we are ready to go back to vote,” said banker Doyin Coker at the church. Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the electoral commission, said the postponement was due to logistical factors. He denied political pressure had played any part. Clement Nwankwo, convener of the Situation Room, which represents more than 70 civil society groups, said there had been a few reports from some of the organisation’s 9,000 observers of “instances in which the ballots have been exposed”, although he said the scale of the problem was not clear. “There is concern over whether materials that have travelled are safe from partisan abuse. It would be an issue of how much manipulation this could mean,” said Nwankwo. He said civil society groups were due to hold a meeting with Yakubu on Monday to address this and other issues over the delay.  In Abuja on Sunday, church pastor Wilson Adebge said he and others would remain patient until the vote is over.  “If they keep postponing and cancelling, we would keep getting ready until the day they vote,” he said.

2019-02-17,"JAKARTA, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s two presidential candidates pledged on Sunday to achieve energy self-sufficiency by boosting the use of bioenergy, particularly fuelled by palm oil, to cut costly oil imports by Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, has been pushing for all diesel fuel used in the country to contain biodiesel to boost palm consumption, slash fuel imports, and narrow a yawning current account gap. In a televised election debate, President Joko Widodo said if he won a second term the government planned to implement a B100 programme, referring to fuel made entirely from palm oil, after last year making it mandatory to use biodiesel containing 20 percent bio-content (B20). “We hope 30 percent of total palm production will go to biofuel. The plan is clear, so we will not rely on imported oil,” Widodo said, adding that Indonesia’s crude palm oil production had reached 46 million tonnes a year. Agreeing on the importance of bioenergy for self-sufficiency, his opponent Prabowo Subianto said if elected he would also “boost the use of palm oil, palm sugar, cassava and ethanol from sugar (cane)”. The challenger did not elaborate on his bioenergy plan, but his campaign team has proposed using millions of hectares of degraded land to cultivate palm sugar to produce energy. Widodo’s government has previously said it would offer incentives for developers of B100, which the net oil importer hopes can replace fuel imports within three years. Indonesia’s state energy company PT Pertamina has signed an agreement with Italian oil company Eni to develop a refinery in Indonesia that would produce fuel completely derived from crude palm oil (CPO). Oil imports have contributed to Indonesia’s widening current account deficit and the volatility of the rupiah currency. The government claimed that its biodiesel programme would save billions of dollars in diesel fuel imports. Although retired general Prabowo agreed with Widodo on several points during the debate, he said Indonesia’s “land and water, and the resources within” must be controlled by the government. “We are of the view that the government must be present in detail, thoroughly, firmly and actively to correct inequalities in wealth,” he said. The challenger said the proportion of small farmers’ holdings in the country’s palm plantations should also be larger. Smallholders currently account for roughly 40 percent of Indonesia’s 12 million hectares of palm oil plantations. Both candidates expressed support for greater control of Indonesian natural resources. President Widodo hightlighted Pertamina’s takeover of stewardship of major oil and gas blocks from foreign operators, and an agreement for a state company to purchase a 51 percent stake in the giant Grasberg copper mine from Freeport McMoRan.

2019-02-17,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia signed a preliminary agreement on Sunday with France’s Naval Group to build warships in the kingdom, as part of its efforts to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities. Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), the kingdom’s state defense company, made the announcement at the IDEX military exhibition in Abu Dhabi, a show piece event for Saudi Arabia’s close ally the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, among the top five defense spenders in the world, has been fighting a costly war in Yemen since 2015 in support of the internationally recognized government against the armed Houthi movement. The latest agreement includes building warships, frigates, corvettes and related items in Saudi Arabia through a majority SAMI-owned joint venture with the French firm, SAMI Chief Executive Andreas Schwer told reporters. “Through design, construction, and maintenance activities the joint venture will contribute significantly to further enhance the capabilities and readiness of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces,” he said. Saudi Arabia set up SAMI in 2017 to develop manufacturing capabilities with the aim of producing half of the country’s required military equipment domestically by 2030. The localization of Saudi Arabia’s military needs is part of efforts led by de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify away from an oil-based economy.  Neighbor UAE has heavily invested in developing its own manufacturing capabilities and has military and civilian contracts with several foreign companies.  SAMI signed an agreement with Abu Dhabi state-fund Mubadala on Saturday to co-invest in manufacturing, maintenance, and engineering. Military deals with Saudi Arabia have come under renewed scrutiny since the October killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  Germany halted arms exports to Saudi Arabia over what it said was the uncertainty surrounding the murder.  Paramount Group Chairman Ivor Ichikowitz told Reuters that had created a “huge opportunity” for those outside of Europe such as his South African defense firm. “I think some of them may be quite short sighted but quite honestly that is their problem and we are quite happy to be continuing,” he said. Paramount has held talks with the Saudi Arabian government to establish production facilities in the kingdom. The U.S. Senate, in a largely symbolic gesture, voted in December to end U.S. military support for the war in Yemen and blame the Saudi crown prince for the murder of Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia denies its crown prince was involved.

2019-02-17,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday inaugurated a new domestically-built submarine armed with cruise missiles at a time of rising tensions with its arch-enemy the United States. “From this moment, the Fateh Submarine joins Iran’s naval force with my order,” Rouhani said in a ceremony broadcast live on the state-run English-language Press TV.   The Fateh “Conqueror” submarine weighs 600 tonnes, Press TV said, adding that it “enjoys state-of-the-art weaponry, including torpedoes, naval mines and cruise missiles that could be launched from a submerged position”.  U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear  agreement between Iran and six powers last May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq. Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international pressure and embargoes that have barred it from importing many weapons. “Our defence power is solely defensive...Our enemy’s pressure and sanctions imposed on Iran have instigated our progress,” Rouhani said in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas.  Last year, Iran’s navy launched a domestically-built destroyer, which state media said has radar-evading stealth properties. Iran says it has missiles with the range of up to 2,000 km (1,250 miles), which puts Israel and U.S. military bases in the region within reach.

2019-02-17,"* South Africa’s state power firm in crisis * Unions say renewables deals compound its problems * President trying to appease critics before election (Adds detail, quotes, context) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 17 (Reuters) - South Africa wants to talk to independent power producers (IPPs) about lowering the price Eskom pays for electricity from older renewable energy projects, a senior minister told Reuters, as the state utility struggles to emerge from a financial crisis. Eskom supplies more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power but is drowning in debt after a decade of decline. It implemented power cuts for five consecutive days last week because of breakdowns at its creaking fleet of mainly coal-fired power stations. Labour unions and some conservative sections of the ruling African National Congress blame Eskom’s financial woes on 20-year agreements it signed to purchase power from renewable energy projects launched in 2011 and 2012. The power prices Eskom pays for later renewables projects are considerably lower because technology and finance costs in the renewable energy sector fell by the time they were agreed. “The simple assurance is that this is not about scrapping a contract. This is about exploring possibilities that are created by the rapid fall in costs in the renewable sector, whether that’s solar or wind,” Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said in an interview. “There are players in the renewables industry who are saying let’s talk.” Gordhan said he wanted to reassure IPPs that the South African government would be careful about how it handled any negotiations over power prices. “We are a law-abiding country. ... We need to look after the interests of everyone concerned,” he said. Gordhan, an important ally of President Cyril Ramaphosa, said the government wanted to “balance out” prices agreed during bid windows one and two of the country’s renewable energy programme - launched in 2011 and 2012 - with lower prices in later bid windows. Ramaphosa - who is trying to appease critics before a parliamentary election in May - has promised to support Eskom’s balance sheet and split the utility to make it more efficient. But some analysts say bolder steps are needed to rescue the power firm, the largest on the African continent. Eskom expects to make annual losses of around 20 billion rand ($1.4 billion) this year and next and does not earn enough to service its 419 billion rand debt mountain. $1 = 14.0700 rand

2019-02-17,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran is ready to work with all of its neighbours to secure peace in the Middle East in the face of U.S. and Israeli aggression, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, in his latest attempt to weaken ties between regional rival Saudi Arabia and America.  Iran and Saudi Arabia have been fighting proxy wars for years, backing opposing sides in conflicts in Syria and Yemen. But pressure is building on Tehran after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed sanctions. Saudi Arabia welcomed the move.   “Iran is ready to work with regional states to preserve security in the Middle East,” Rouhani said in a public speech in the southern Hormozgan province, broadcast live on state TV. “We want to establish brotherly ties with all countries of the region ... Iran has never started any aggression in the region.” “Those regional states that believe Israel and America can establish security are wrong. We, the Muslims, should ensure the regional security,” Rouhani said, to chants of “Death to America,” and “Death to Israel”. Rouhani’s previous overtures to Saudi Arabia, such as after his election in 2013 and efforts by his Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in 2017, have had no success, and some analysts were sceptical his latest attempt would be different. “Considering the ongoing hostility, there is no possibility of a dialogue between the arch enemies,” said Tehran-based analyst Hamid Farahvashian. Iran accuses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of supporting militant Sunni groups that carry out attacks against Iranian forces, including a suicide bombing on Wednesday in Iran’s southeastern province that borders Pakistan.   Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 27 members of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps. The Revolutionary Guards have threatened Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Pakistan with retaliation. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Pakistan deny backing the militants. Iran’s foreign ministry on Sunday summoned Pakistan’s ambassador to protest about Wednesday’s attack.

2019-02-17,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia and Djibouti have signed a deal to build a pipeline to transport Ethiopian gas to an export terminal in the Red Sea state, officials said. Ethiopia found extensive gas deposits in its eastern Ogaden Basin in the 1970s. China’s POLY-GCL Petroleum Investments has been developing the Calub and Hilala fields there since signing a production sharing deal with Ethiopia in 2013. The agreement between Djibouti and Ethiopia comes more than a year after POLY-GCL signed a memorandum of understanding with Djibouti to invest $4 billion to build the natural gas pipeline, a liquefaction plant and an export terminal to be located in Damerjog, near the country’s border with Somalia. It was envisaged that production would start last year, but the Ethiopian government said that was now likely to happen in 2020.  Djibouti’s Energy Minister Yonis Ali Guedi told Reuters late on Saturday the deal hammered out “key terms that will serve as a basis” for related concession contracts.  “It is the most expensive project ever built in the Horn of Africa region,” he said. “The two parties have reached an agreement in principle to allow them to benefit from the project in an equitable manner.” POLY-GCL is a joint venture between state-owned China POLY Group Corporation and privately owned Hong Kong-based Golden Concord Group. Africa’s eastern seaboard could soon become a major global producer of liquefied natural gas, with other planned projects based on big gas finds made in Tanzania and Mozambique.

2019-02-17,"ISLAMABAD, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in Pakistan on Sunday at the start of his tour of South Asia and China, but the visit risks being overshadowed by escalating tensions between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan. The trip comes days after a suicide bomber killed 44 Indian paramilitary police in the disputed Kashmir region. New Delhi has accused Pakistan of having a hand in the bombing and vowed to punish Islamabad, which denies involvement. Cash-strapped and in need of friends, Pakistan is welcoming the crown prince with open arms for a visit during which he is expected to sign investment agreements worth more than $10 billion. Saudi Arabia has in recent months helped keep Pakistan’s economy afloat by propping up its rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves with a $6 billion loan, giving Islamabad breathing room as it negotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. Analyst say the crown prince’s trip is being treated by Islamabad as the biggest state visit since Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, soon after Beijing announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on infrastructure in Pakistan as part of China’s global Belt and Road initiative. The visit marks a deepening in ties between allies whose relationship has in the past centred on oil-rich Saudi Arabia backing Pakistan’s economy during difficult periods, and in return Pakistan’s powerful army lending support to Saudi Arabia and its royal family. As the guardians of most holy sites in the birthplace of Islam, the Saudi royal family carries vast religious clout in Pakistan, a staunchly conservative and mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people. “What is happening in this relationship is a renewal of Pakistan’s commitment to help protect the royal family and the order as it exists in Saudi Arabia,” said Mosharraf Zaidi, Senior Fellow at Tabadlab, a Pakistani think tank focused on global and local public policy. “On the flip side, there is reassurance that Saudi Arabia will not only continue to serve as a strategic friend who will help shore up Pakistan’s finances when needed, but it’s also going to become a participant in the wider investment in Pakistan.” Pakistan is shutting down its airspace and has stepped up security in Islamabad for the crown prince, who is set to become the first guest to stay at the Prime Minister’s House. Pakistan’s new populist premier, Imran Khan, has refused to use the residence in a bid to save taxpayers’ money. Pakistani hopes for further investment opportunities from Saudi Arabia were dealt a blow on Saturday when the government announced that the Pak-Saudi Business Conference had been “postponed”. Pakistani officials have already flagged up that Saudi Arabia will announce eight investment agreements, including a $10 billion refinery and petrochemicals complex in the coastal city of Gwadar, where China is building a port. But the crown prince’s arrival comes amid a vow by India to isolate Pakistan internationally following the deadliest attack in Kashmir in decades. New Delhi is demanding Islamabad act against the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant group, which it says has the backing of the Pakistani state, over the bombing. Islamabad denies playing a role and has called for an investigation. In Islamabad, the crown prince is expected to meet Khan and Pakistan’s army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa. He is also likely to meet representatives of the Afghan Taliban militant group to discuss peace negotiations to end the 17-year civil war in Afghanistan, Pakistani government sources say.
