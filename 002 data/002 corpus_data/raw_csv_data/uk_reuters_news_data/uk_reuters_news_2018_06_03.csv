2018-06-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iraq and Iran have begun exchanging crude oil, the Iranian oil ministry’s news agency SHANA said on Sunday, in a deal that will  position Tehran to expand its interests in its most important Arab ally in the face of growing pressure from Washington. Crude from the Kirkuk field in northern Iraq is being shipped by truck to Iran. Tehran will use the oil in its refineries and will deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports, on the Gulf. After helping Iraq stifle a Kurdish push for independence last year, OPEC producer Iran positioned itself to take control of oil exports from the region’s giant Kirkuk field. Baghdad agreed for the first time to divert crude from Kirkuk province, which it retook from the Kurds, to Iran, where it will supply a refinery in the city of Kermanshah. The pact is likely to create unease in Saudi Arabia, which along with its ally the United States accuses Iran of trying to dominate the Middle East. Tehran denies the allegations. Iran is locked in a proxy war with Saudi Arabia that has fuelled instability in the region. As well as Iraq, it has been extending its influence in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Faced with the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Tehran is expected by analysts to focus on preserving its interests in neighbouring Iraq, where it is competing for influence with Washington.  Iran also faces a challenge from Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. The nationalist’s bloc secured a stunning victory in last month’s election by tapping growing public discontent with Iran’s sway in Iraq, and appealing to the poor.  Between 30,000 and 60,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Kirkuk crude will be delivered by the tanker trucks to Darreh Shahr in southwestern Iran, SHANA said. Iraq and Iran plan to build a pipeline to carry the oil from Kirkuk to avoid having to use trucks.  The swap deal allows Iraq to resume sales of Kirkuk crude, which have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the fields from the Kurds in October 2017. Even though talks between Baghdad and Tehran have been conducted between oil ministry officials and Chamber of Commerce, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards are well positioned. Those dealings are overseen by the desk responsible for Iran’s investments in Iraq at the president’s office and are run by the powerful force.

2018-06-03,"NAIROBI, June 3 (Reuters) - Kenya has launched a pilot scheme to export crude oil via Mombasa as part of efforts to capitalise on the country’s oil reserves. The East African country discovered commercial oil reserves in its Lokichar basin in 2012 and a 800-km (500-mile) pipeline is due to be built before production starts up in 2021/22. The national government and the regional administration of the northwestern Turkana region agreed last month on revenue sharing that will come into force when production reaches full capacity by 2022. That agreement paved the way for the passage of a law on petroleum production, which will enable Tullow Oil - which operates the Kenyan fields - to start shipping oil that has been held in storage tanks for a year. “The benefits of the project will be shared and no one will be left behind,” Deputy President William Ruto said at the launch of the export initiative under which 2,000 barrels will be transported to Mombasa by road for shipment each day. Tullow has hired Wood Group to design the pipeline needed to bring crude from Lokichar’s onshore fields to a port in Lamu along the Indian Ocean coast. The cost of the pipeline is estimated at $1.1 billion, with a further $2.9 billion needed for upstream operations, the company says. Tullow has said the Amosing and Ngamia fields in the basin have estimated contingent resources of about 560 million barrels, with plateau production potentially reaching 100,000 barrels per day.

2018-06-03,"(Clarifies U.S.-Qatar deal signed in January in paragraph 5) * CEO says high oil prices could lead to less capacity * Says doesn’t expect higher fares in near term * No change to relationship with Gulf carriers yet, CEO says By Victoria Bryan SYDNEY, June 3 (Reuters) - American Airlines warned airline passengers may eventually face higher ticket prices if oil prices remain high, prompting carriers to remove seats from the market. Oil prices have risen around 50 percent compared to the levels seen last year and that is putting pressure on airline profits. “If it becomes clear this is the new normal you would see over time less capacity and growth in the industry and therefore higher prices, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in the near term,” CEO Doug Parker told reporters on the sidelines of the annual IATA meeting of airline executives in Sydney. IATA, which represents about 280 airlines comprising 83 percent of global air traffic, has said that on Monday it will revise down its forecast for industry profitability this year due to higher oil, infrastructure and labour costs. The United States last month agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates and in January with Qatar to resolve claims from the three largest U.S. carriers that Gulf airlines had received unfair government subsidies. Parker said he was pleased with the result of the talks but needed to see more from the Gulf carriers before American Airlines could consider partnerships with them. “We haven’t had enough time to make sure that those resolutions have the effect that we hope for, so we shall see,” he said. Qatar Airways had plans to buy a stake in American Airlines last year, but reversed that decision, saying an investment did not meet its objectives. American Airlines executives had opposed the share buy. When asked on Sunday whether he would be open to investments from Gulf airlines further down the line, Parker said American Airlines did not need such transactions. He added, however: “We are open to investments from everybody.” Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Tim Hepher and Dale

Saudi Arabia is the world’s top oil exporter. Prospects that it and top producer Russia could boost output have put downward pressures on prices. “Prime Minister May and the crown prince noted the importance of stability in the oil markets, which they said was in the interests of both consumers and producers,” a statement said. They spoke by telephone on Saturday. The two, who met in London earlier this year, also discussed nuclear deal between global powers and Iran, which Britain is committed to despite a U.S. decision to withdraw. “The Prime Minister emphasised the UK’s commitment to (it)... as the best means of preventing Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon,” May’s office said.  “But they agreed on the need to tackle Iranian destabilising activity in the (Middle East) region.

2018-06-03,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Some 80 pieces of plastic rubbish weighing eight kg (17 lb) were found in the stomach of a whale that died in Thailand after a five-day effort to save it, a marine official said on Sunday. The pilot whale was discovered on Monday in a canal in the southern province of Songkhla and received treatment from a team of veterinarians.  The whale spit out five plastic bags on Friday and later died, the Marine and Coastal Resources Department said on its website. An autopsy found another 80 bags and other plastic items weighing eight kg in the whale’s stomach. “This plastic rubbish made the whale sick and unable to hunt for food,” the department said. Jatuporn Buruspat, head of the department, said the whale probably thought the floating plastic bags were food. Pilot whales mainly feed on squid, but are known to eat octopus and small fish when squid are not available, according to the American Cetacean Society, a whale conservation group. Jatuporn said his department planned to raise public awareness of the problem on World Oceans Day on June 8. “We will use the whale case and invite all sectors to show their intentions on how to reduce the use of plastic in Thailand,” he told Reuters. Thais use huge numbers of plastic bags but authorities have launched campaigns to try to encourage people to use fewer and to introduce reusable bags. Globally, eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, the United Nations Environment Programme said in December.

2018-06-03,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - National Guard troops, police and firefighters ushered the last group of evacuees from homes on the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island early on Saturday, hours before lava from the Kilauea volcano cut off road access to the area, officials said. A stream of lava as wide as three football fields flowed over a highway near a junction at Kapoho, a seaside community of rebuilt after a destructive eruption of Kilauea in 1960. The lava flow left Kapoho and the adjacent development of Vacationland cut off from the rest of the island by road, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense agency. Also, lava destroyed a freshwater lake, boiling away all of the water in it, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported late Saturday, local time. “Lava entered Green Lake within Kapoho Crater, producing a large steam plume ... A Hawaiian County Fire Department overflight reported that the lava filled the lake and apparently evaporated all the water,” the report said. Authorities since Wednesday had been urging residents of the area to leave before lava spewing from a volcanic fissure at the eastern foot of Kilauea reached the area.  The final phase of the evacuation was carried out late on Friday and early Saturday by fire and police department personnel, with help from the Hawaii National Guard and public works teams, county civil defence spokeswoman Janet Snyder told Reuters by email. An estimated 500 people live in the Kapoho area, but Snyder said it was not immediately clear how many residents, if any, chose to stay behind. Another 2,000 people have already been evacuated from Leilani Estates, an area further west where dozens of homes have been devoured or cut off by rivers of lava streaming over the landscape since May 3. For those whose homes have been unscathed, the prolonged strain of uncertainty has grown increasingly difficult. “We’re waiting for Pele to make the decision,” said Steve Kirkpatrick, a retired mailman and 14-year resident of Leilani Estates, referring to the volcano goddess of Hawaiian myth.  His home was still intact but in harm’s way.  “You go for three weeks and you think everything is fine, and then you can still lose your house,” Kirkpatrick told Reuters as he and his wife, Kathy, ventured back to their community to help friends move out. “As the lava expands, so has the anxiety,” she said, the low, jet-like sound of lava spouting from the ground audible in the distance. Lava was not the only challenge posed by the eruption. Toxic sulphur dioxide gas emissions have created an additional hazard. So too have airborne volcanic glass fibres, called “Pele’s hair,” wispy strands produced by lava fountains and carried aloft by the wind. One resident, Nancy Avery, said the glass strands hurt like paper cuts, slicing into her fingers and feet, toes exposed because she wore only sandals. She tried to pick up a strand but, “It just kind of melted into my skin and cut me. It’s so sharp, it feels like the glass is still in there.” The lava itself, extruded from about two dozen fissures that opened on the slope of Kilauea’s “eastern rift zone” earlier this month, has also knocked out telephone and power lines and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant. Lava burnt two buildings at the plant, a substation and a warehouse that stored a drilling rig, officials said. The latest upheaval of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, comes on the heels of an eruption cycle that began in 1983 and continued almost nonstop for 35 years, destroying more than 200 dwellings and other structures. The current activity has been accompanied for weeks by daily explosions of gas and volcanic rock from Kilauea’s summit crater as well as earthquakes.  But the summit has quieted down over the past few days, as tons of rubble shaken loose from the interior walls of the crater have fallen into the void and plugged up the bottom of the vent. Scientists are unsure whether the blockage will eventually end eruptions at the summit or lead to a buildup of pressure that could cause a much bigger explosion.

2018-06-03,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Dutch airline KLM is seeing healthy demand over the next few months, the key summer period for European carriers, its chief executive said, and a recent fleet renewal programme will help it combat higher oil prices. “Looking at where we are in terms of loads and traffic, we see healthy demand in Europe and on long haul,” Pieter Elbers told Reuters ahead of the annual International Air Transport Association meeting in Sydney on Sunday.  He declined to comment on yields for summer bookings. An updated industry profit forecast to be issued on Monday by IATA will be lower as the cost of oil, infrastructure and labour rises, the association said earlier this week. Elbers said a fleet renewal programme will help the carrier, part of the Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA) group, with new Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliners coming in, 747 jumbo jets being phased out and its ageing fleet of Fokkers being replaced by new Embraer (EMBR3.SA) jets. “With these initiatives we are preparing for a situation with higher fuel prices,” he said.   But the airline has no plans to change its jet fuel hedging policy.  Air France-KLM is 59 percent hedged for 2018, according to first-quarter results, and analysts have highlighted that with it being less hedged than European rivals, its earnings are more vulnerable to rising oil prices. That hedging rate of 59 percent for this year is up slightly compared with 55 percent at the end of last year’s first quarter. Elbers said his focus remained on KLM after strikes and union unrest at French sister company Air France prompted the departure of group CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac last month. Elbers is one of three executives in charge while the Air France-KLM group seeks a new CEO. Brexit remains a concern for KLM, however, with the Dutch serving 18 UK destinations from its Amsterdam hub, more than rival British Airways (ICAG.L) serves from London Heathrow.  “Brexit is creating some uncertainty economically and that could affect our business,” he said.

2018-06-03,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The shipping industry will this year scrap the largest number of oil tankers in over half-a-decade, driven by weak earnings, firm prices for scrap steel and the need to prepare fleets for strict new environmental regulations. The surge in scrapping underscores how the sector is grappling with one of its worst-ever crises, hit hard after rates for transporting oil plunged to multi-year lows in the wake of excess tanker supply and tepid demand as OPEC production cuts bite. “The tanker markets are definitely in a trough at the moment, with one of the worst years in a decade in terms of freight rates and returns,” said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at ship broker Banchero Costa in Singapore.   The tough operating conditions are expected to persist  until at least the second-half of 2019, analysts and industry sources said.    For graphic on oil tanker rates languish near record lows amid vessel oversupply click reut.rs/2L9bdKN Estimates on the number of tanker demolitions vary between the four shipping analysts that Reuters spoke to, with the most conservative standing at a seven-year high in 2018.    About 10.3 million deadweight tonnes (DWT) have been sold for demolition from January to April this year, compared with 11.2 million DWT for the whole of 2017 and 2.5 million for 2016, said Erik Broekhuizen, head of tanker research and consulting at ship broker Poten & Partners Inc.  “OPEC production cuts are hurting the market, and as long as they are in place, the tanker market will remain challenged,” he said, adding that scrapping had picked up for large vessels in particular. Since early 2017, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other non-OPEC crude producers have curbed exports to fight a global oil glut.  The imposition of new U.S. sanctions against Iran looks set to further reduce oil flows later in 2018, although Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed potentially raising output to fill the subsequent void.     For graphic on oil tanker demolitions by type, year click reut.rs/2L4DDFq More stringent environmental regulations to be implemented by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2020 will make operating old ships uneconomical, said Leszczynski at Banchero Costa. Limited interest in using tankers to store oil, which has historically been a profitable option for shipowners during lulls in shipping volumes, is also curbing overall demand, analysts said.  Scrap steel prices in Shanghai, China - the world’s top consumer and producer of the material - have meanwhile nearly doubled from a year ago due to shutdowns of inefficient steel mills amid a widespread crackdown on industrial emissions. Firms that have recently sent ships for scrapping include India’s Essar Shipping Ltd (ESPL.NS) and Oslo-listed Frontline Ltd (FRO.OL). The latter last month reported better earnings than analysts had expected, partly due to its increased scrapping. For graphic on VLCC oil tanker 'Raphaela' beached for scrapping near Karachi, Pakistan click reut.rs/2JiDTnf The ships being scrapped are also getting younger, with the average age falling to 19.5 years in the first quarter of this year, compared with 2017’s average of 22 years, said Rajesh Verma, an analyst with shipping consultancy Drewry.  Most of the vessels are being scrapped in Bangladesh and India, although Pakistan has also returned to the demolition market after an 18-month ban, analysts said.      The uptick in demolition rates has come despite increased opposition from European regulators due to environmental concerns.    Despite the high scrap rate, tanker earnings will continue to be hit as fleet-growth is still too high, analysts said.  For graphic on oil tanker fleet by type & year click reut.rs/2Jd6VET Banchero Costa’s Leszczynski expects the crude tanker fleet to expand 3.3 percent this year, following growth of 4.6 percent last year and 5.8 percent in 2016.     With tanker rates still a long way from being profitable, there’s little prospect of a broad industry improvement until the second half of 2019 at the earliest, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at industry lobby group BIMCO. “Any recovery in rates in the tanker market will be hinged on the extent of scrapping in the coming years ... we expect rates to start recovering in the second half of 2019 if scrapping remains strong,” said Verma at Drewry.
