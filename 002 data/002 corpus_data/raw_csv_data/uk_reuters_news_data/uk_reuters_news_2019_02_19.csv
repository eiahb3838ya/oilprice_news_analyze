2019-02-19,"LIMA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Peru on Tuesday launched a new, “sustained” effort to uproot illegal gold mining in one of the Amazon’s most biodiverse corners, sending 1,500 police and military officers to the region after deforestation from wildcat mining hit a new high last year. The government of President Martin Vizcarra said it was suspending civil liberties and tasking the armed forces with restoring the rule of law in districts rife with illegal mining in Madre de Dios, or Mother of God, a low-lying rainforest region known for its high biodiversity, carbon-rich forests and indigenous tribes that shun contact with outsiders. The state of emergency will be in place for 60 days, the defense ministry added in a statement. If successful, the operation would mark the first time Peru has been able to stop an illegal industry responsible for releasing tonnes of mercury into the environment as well as supporting sex trafficking and child labor in mining camps. The crackdown might also impact the production and shipment of gold from Peru, the world’s sixth-largest producer, as illegal ore often makes its way into the legal supply chain through middlemen and shell companies. Previous crack-downs in Madre de Dios have spawned contraband smuggling into Bolivia. High gold prices during the 2009-2010 global financial crisis fueled an illegal gold rush in Madre de Dios that has continued to expand. “It’s been growing for better part of a decade,” said Luis Fernandez, a Wake Forest University ecologist who has been studying the issue since 2007. “In every town there are little shops that buy gold from miners that emit levels of mercury from coal-fired power plants,” Fernandez said. “We’re just starting to learn what the impacts will be on the population.” Wildcat miners in Madre de Dios are often tipped off about government plans to destroy illegal mining camps in the jungle, allowing them to hide expensive machinery and flee. They then regroup once security forces leave the region. Environmentalists say criminal groups that finance the mining are now better organized and more violent than ever. In 2018, deforestation from wildcat mining in southern Peru, where Madre de Dios is located, peaked at 9,280 hectares (22,931 acres), topping the previous high of 9,160 hectares in 2017, according to a January report by Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which uses satellite images to track deforestation for the NGO Amazon Conservation. The defense ministry said the current operation, which it dubbed “Mercury 2019,” will be an “unprecedented” and “sustained” crackdown on illegal mining. Three temporary military bases with 100 military officers in each are being set up in the region to oversee efforts, it said.

2019-02-19,"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc posted its strongest holiday quarter in at least a decade on Tuesday, boosted by higher grocery and e-commerce sales, and said it saw no signs of weakness in U.S. consumer spending despite recent signs of a slowdown.  Online sales jumped 43 percent in the quarter helped in particular by the expansion of Walmart’s online grocery pickup program to more than 2,100 stores by year end. Shares of the world’s largest retailer rose 2.2 percent on Tuesday in a broadly flat market, putting them up 9.7 percent so far this year.  Walmart and rival Target Corp’s unexpectedly strong growth in holiday sales reflected the health of the U.S. consumer as spending remained robust due to a strong labor market and cheaper gasoline prices. “We still feel pretty good about the consumer. We haven’t seen much of a change,” Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters. “The data we are seeing still looks pretty healthy. Gas prices are down year over year, which helps.” Investors and Wall Street analysts have been expecting U.S. spending to slow this year, against a backdrop of rising debt, trade tariffs and economic uncertainty. Walmart’s results settled nerves, but some doubts remain.  “There are definitely some storm clouds on the horizon,” said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns Walmart shares. “A big example would be delinquent loans in the auto sector which are rising ... the consumer may be on hard times and in 2008 that was the prelude to the global economic slowdown.” U.S. retail sales recorded their steepest drop in more than nine years in December, the government reported last week, as receipts fell across the board, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018. However, overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season hit a six-year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard report in late December. Walmart sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent, excluding fuel, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. The gain exceeded analysts’ expectations of 2.96 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sales were boosted by federal officials distributing food stamp aid early during the partial government shutdown. The demise of retailer Toys R Us also helped Walmart gain toy market share, the company said. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.41 per share, beating expectations of $1.33 per share, according to Refinitiv. But the retailer’s gross margins declined for the seventh consecutive quarter due to higher transportation costs and e-commerce investments. Walmart’s 43 percent rise in online sales matched the previous quarter’s increase, and the company credited a broader assortment on its website and improved delivery, as well as store pickup of online grocery orders. Higher online grocery sales helped it expand market share in the category, Walmart said. It will have the store pickup service at 3,100 stores by next January.  Walmart will offer grocery deliveries to about 800 more stores by the end of the year, bringing the total to 1,600 stores.  But the company reiterated that it expected e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call the company was focused on getting return customer visits and strengthening product assortment.  Grocery sales currently make up 56 percent of total revenue for the retailer. Amazon.com Inc is trying to crack the food category, especially since it bought organic supermarket chain Whole Foods.  Walmart is partnering with third-party couriers and working with so-called gig, or freelance, drivers, who are cheaper than full-time employees, to push down costs, Reuters recently reported.  Google-backed Deliv, a Walmart delivery partner in Miami and San Jose, ended its relationship with the retailer, Reuters reported last week. The U.S. retailer, which overtook Apple Inc to become the third largest e-commerce retailer last year, is likely to capture a 4.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market, behind eBay Inc and Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer. Walmart repeated its forecast that fiscal year 2020 earnings per share would decline in the low single digits in percentage terms, compared with last year. Excluding the acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, it sees an increase in the low- to mid-single-digits. McMillon said the company was disappointed in India’s revised e-commerce regulations, which ban companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and also bar them from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms. He said the Indian government didn’t consult with Walmart and other U.S. companies before it changed the rules. “We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field,” he said.     Walmart expects fiscal year 2020 comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, excluding fuel and online sales growth of 35 percent. Total revenue increased 1.9 percent to $138.8 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $138.65 billion. Walmart has recorded 18 quarters, or over four straight years of U.S. comparable sales growth, unmatched by any other retailer. The stock rose 3.7 percent to $103.68. Target and Costco Wholesale Corp were both up more than 1 percent.

2019-02-19,"(Reuters) - Concho Resources Inc reported quarterly profit that missed Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, sending shares of the shale firm lower in after-hours trading.     Oil and gas firms have been under pressure from investors to pull back on spending and deliver higher returns. Concho said in a news release that “capital discipline and moderating activity” would help it generate more cash this year. Concho Resources’ net income rose to $1.5 billion, or $7.55 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $267 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.9 billion for the quarter, but the company reported revenue of $1.07 billion. Concho’s stock fell $6 to $115 in after-hours trading on Tuesday. During the regular session the stock dropped 1.6 percent to $121.00.  Total production rose to 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the quarter, from 211,000 boe/d in the same period the year prior. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 94 cents per share, below Wall Street’s forecast for $1.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Concho dialed back its 2019 spending plans to around $2.9 billion. It had previously announced plans to spend $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year. The Midland, Texas-based Concho is focused on the Permian Basin, the largest and busiest U.S. shale field, where producers this month are expected to pump 4 million barrels of oil per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Last year, Concho purchased smaller rival RSP Permian Inc in an all-stock deal worth about $9.5 billion. The company will hold a call with analysts on Wednesday morning.

2019-02-19,"(Recasts with NOC to reopen oilfield only after inspection) BENGHAZI, Libya, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Libyan state oil firm NOC will reopen the El Sharara oilfield, the country’s biggest, only after an inspection to establish security, a spokesman said on Tuesday. The comments came shortly after officials for eastern Libyan forces said they handed over control of the field to an oil security force to encourage NOC to restart production that has been halted since December. Control over the oilfield has been claimed by different forces since tribesmen and state guards seized it in December, making financial and other demands. NOC declared force majeure, a waiver on its contracts. “NOC has sent an inspection team to assess security at Sharara and to verify that all armed militia have left the field prior to force majeure being lifted,” the spokesman said by text message. A no-fly zone imposed by the eastern military meant this could take some days, he said, adding that the zone indicated a “serious continuing threat level.” The eastern military has said it will not allow flights to southern Libya without its permission. “We call on NOC to lift force majeure,” said Naji al-Maghrabi, the eastern-based commander of the state oil guards appointed to protect the field, in a statement posted online. A spokesman for the eastern military confirmed the handing over of the field to the oil force. There was no immediate comment from NOC. It was not immediately clear if handing over security to guards under the control of an eastern-based commander would meet NOC’s demands. The eastern forces launched an offensive in mid-January to secure the southern oilfields, which include El Sharara.

TransCanada had shut an arm of Keystone from Steele City, Nebraska to Patoka, Illinois on Feb. 6 after leaking 43 barrels of crude oil. The shutdown restricted the flow on the 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline system, a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Midwest.

2019-02-19,"(Adds premier’s comment, background on shipments) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s oil-producing province of Alberta has leased 4,400 rail cars in a multibillion-dollar move to clear a glut of crude that depressed prices, Premier Rachel Notley said on Tuesday. Notley said Alberta would start putting cars into service in July so it can buy and sell oil itself. Canadian National Railway Co and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd will haul a combined initial volume of 20,000 barrels per day that will reach 120,000 bpd by mid-2020. Alberta’s rail investment is part of a rescue package for an oil industry struggling with high costs and the exit of some foreign majors. Pipelines have become congested because of environmental opposition that has stymied expansion. The provincial government took the rare step in January of ordering oil production cuts. “Rather than produce less, we have to find ways to move more,” Notley said in Edmonton. The three-year plan will cost Alberta C$3.7 billion ($2.80 billion), consisting of buying oil, leasing cars and purchasing rail and loading services. Alberta expects to earn gross revenues of C$5.9 billion ($4.5 billion) from reselling oil and higher royalties to produce net revenues of C$2.2 billion. Shares of CN and CP gained nearly 1 percent in Toronto. CN expects to handle 60 percent of Alberta’s barrels, Chief Executive J.J. Ruest said in a statement. The Alberta government said in November, when Canadian oil fetched near record-large discounts to U.S. oil, that it was seeking train capacity. It has also provided incentives for petrochemical and partial-upgrading plants. Canadian crude-by-rail volumes hit record highs last year, but declined in 2019 after production cuts made rail shipments less economic. Imperial Oil said it was forced to cut its own rail shipments to “near zero,” illustrating the potential for unintended consequences when governments intervene. Economic conditions were already improving for rail shipments, Notley said. Rail shipments are seen as a relief valve for oil when pipelines are full, but they are generally more expensive and less safe. A CN oil train derailed on Saturday in Manitoba. Notley’s New Democratic Party government faces a stiff spring election challenge from the United Conservative Party (UCP). UCP energy critic Prasad Panda said the party was reviewing the rail plan. Three-quarters of the cars will be the DOT-117J model, featuring thicker steel than some types. The rest will be DOT-117R cars retrofitted to meet some DOT-117J standards, but a type that BNSF Railway Co is phasing out after a derailment in Iowa last year.

2019-02-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise 84,000 barrels per day (bpd) in March to a record of about 8.4 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Tuesday. The largest change is forecast in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where output is expected to climb by 43,000 bpd to a record 4.024 million bpd in March. A shale revolution has helped boost the United States to the position of world’s biggest crude oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Overall crude production has climbed to a weekly record of 11.9 million bpd. Production increases in the Permian, the biggest oilpatch in the United States, and the Bakken has led overall output increases in the country over the past year. In North Dakota’s Bakken region, shale production is estimated to rise about 13,000 bpd to a record 1.45 million bpd in March. In the Eagle Ford region, output is expected to edge higher by 9,000 bpd to about 1.44 million bpd, which would be the highest monthly output since Jan 2016.     Meanwhile, U.S. natural gas output was projected to increase to a record 77.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in March. That would be up more than 0.8 bcfd over the February forecast and mark the 14th consecutive monthly increase. Gas production was about 65.5 bcfd in March last year. The EIA projected gas output would increase in all the big shale basins in March. Output in the Appalachia region, the nation’s biggest shale gas play, was set to rise over 0.3 bcfd to a record high of 31.6 bcfd in March. Production in Appalachia was 26.9 bcfd in the same month a year ago. The EIA said producers drilled 1,453 wells and completed 1,246 in the biggest shale basins in January, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up by 207 at a record high of 8,798, according to data going back to December 2013.

Washington’s sanctions on oil out of Venezuela, a top supplier of sour crude to the United States, has helped support U.S. futures prices, said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “Some of those sour grades are lifting the WTI... That seems to be the situation short term,” Flynn said.          In the bigger picture, “I think the market is looking for an excuse to follow through on the breakout, but there are still a lot of questions surrounding the U.S.-China trade deal” and the global economy, he said. A fresh round of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the United States and China began on Tuesday in Washington, with higher-level discussions planned for later in the week.  Traders said they were cautious about taking large new positions before the outcome of the talks.      In a red flag about the economic outlook, Europe’s biggest bank HSBC warned it may delay some investments this year as it missed 2018 profit forecasts due to slowing growth in China and Britain. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last week lowered its forecast for growth in world oil demand in 2019 to 1.24 million barrels per day. Some analysts believe it could be weaker. “Given a continuously uncertain economic picture, our already relatively bearish outlook for 2019 of below 1 million bpd in global oil demand growth may be subject to further downwards revisions,” analysts at JBC Energy wrote. To stop a build-up of inventories that could weigh on prices, OPEC+, which includes members of the producer group and allies like Russia, began a new supply cut of 1.2 million bpd on Jan. 1. The cuts have helped crude rise more than 20 percent. Russian President Vladimir Putin and King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, said they supported continued coordination on the global energy markets, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. Investors said the statement eased doubts that Russia would stick to the pact. U.S. sanctions against exporters Iran and Venezuela have also supported oil prices. Venezuela is a major crude supplier to U.S. refineries. Iran’s exports, while down steeply since sanctions began in November, have risen in early 2019, according to tanker data and sources.

2019-02-19,"PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela on Tuesday shut the maritime border with nearby Dutch Caribbean islands ahead of an opposition effort to bring in humanitarian aid from foreign territories including neighbouring Curacao despite the protests of President Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has rejected offers of foreign aid, denying there are widespread shortages and insisting that the country’s economic problems are the result of sanctions by Washington. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has been recognised by dozens countries as the legitimate head of state, has said that food and medicine provided in part by the United States will enter Venezuela by land and sea on Saturday.  The closure blocks movement of boats and aircraft between the western Venezuelan coastal state of Falcon and the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, said Vice Admiral Vladimir Quintero, who heads a military unit in Falcon. He did not provide a reason.     Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curacao’s government, which has agreed to receive aid for Venezuela without being involved in its delivery, said in a statement that the closure was meant “to prevent humanitarian aid from getting in.” “Curacao will not force in the aid, but it will continue to function as a logistical centre,” it said. The United States has sent tons of aid to Colombia’s border with Venezuela. Maduro has mocked the effort as a “cheap show” by the United States, insisting Washington should help his government by lifting crippling oil sector sanctions. Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino in a televised broadcast on Tuesday said Venezuelan troops would remain stationed along the country’s borders to prevent territorial violations. Padrino, flanked by a cadre of top-ranked military officials, said opposition leaders would have to pass over “our dead bodies” to impose a new government. Guaido, who invoked articles of the constitution to assume the interim presidency, denounces Maduro as illegitimate. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday warned members of Venezuela’s military who remain loyal to Maduro that they would “find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out.” Padrino said officers and soldiers remained “obedient and subordinate” to Maduro.  “They will never accept orders from any foreign government. ... They will remain deployed and alert along the borders, as our commander in chief has ordered, to avoid any violations of our territory’s integrity,” Padrino said.  Maduro, who won a second term last year in an election that critics have denounced as a sham, retains the backing of Russia and China and control of Venezuelan state institutions. Leaders of several Latin American nations plan to travel to Colombia’s border with Venezuela on Friday ahead of the delivery of aid, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Tuesday, adding that he had accepted an invitation from Colombia’s president, Ivan Duque. It was not immediately clear which leaders would attend. Most Latin American countries now recognise Guaido as president, though Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua still support Maduro. Billionaire businessman Richard Branson is backing a “Live Aid”-style concert on Friday in the Colombian border city of Cucuta with a fundraising target of $100 million to provide food and medicine for Venezuela. Maduro’s government has announced two rival concerts just across the border.

2019-02-19," (Corrects ninth paragraph of Feb. 7 story to say Brazilian prosecutors alleged bribes were paid to Petrobras insiders, not to the company itself) By Gary McWilliams (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating a former U.S.-based  oil trader for Brazil’s Petrobras already charged in his home country with taking part in a corruption scheme involving commodity companies Vitol SA, Glencore PLC  and Trafigura AG, according to people familiar with the matter. It was the first confirmation that U.S. investigators have joined a new phase of Brazil’s “Car Wash” corruption probe, which has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America. The U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York is talking to Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, a Houston-based oil trader wanted on charges in Brazil for accepting millions of dollars in kickbacks for himself and others, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Berkowitz, 39, is cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation and could face charges in the United States, one of the people said, although he has not been currently charged. Berkowitz could not be reached for comment through associates, phone or emails, and it was not immediately known what law firm was representing him.  Brazilian prosecutors said executives of the commodities companies, including some in the United States, were involved in improper payments to executives at state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA, and that Berkowitz and others worked directly with those firms.  Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura and others collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras officials to secure advantages in deals, Brazilian prosecutors said.  The New York case signals prosecutors there are examining the U.S. arms of Vitol and others implicated by Brazilian officials, as some of those funds moved through U.S. and European banking systems.  Bribes paid to Petrobras insiders moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, Brazilian authorities have said, opening an avenue for U.S. prosecutors to probe for violations of U.S. money laundering laws.  In December, Mike Loya, the Houston-based head of Vitol’s U.S. operations, was named in Brazilian charging documents against Berkowitz and others of having full knowledge of the trading scheme. Loya has not been charged. He did not reply to requests for comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bini is handling the case, the people said. Reached by phone, Bini declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment. Federal prosecutors in Brazil declined on Thursday to say if they were collaborating with the U.S. Justice Department on the case.  Investigators from New York’s Eastern District office have worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian prosecutors on the Car Wash probe in the past. In late 2016, they jointly negotiated with construction firm Odebrecht that resulted in a $2.6 billion fine and access to company executives who could provide testimony about decades of bribes paid across Latin America. Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore declined to comment on the U.S. investigation. Vitol and Glencore reiterated past statements that they are cooperating with Brazilian authorities, and Trafigura said it takes the allegations seriously. All have been suspended from business dealings with Petrobras.    Brazil issued an Interpol red notice in early December calling Berkowitz a fugitive from prosecution and requesting his detention. The U.S. Marshals office in Houston said this month it has not received a request to arrest Berkowitz.  U.S. authorities two months ago arrested Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade, a Brazilian businessman, over allegations he funneled bribes to Petrobras officials from Vitol and others, according to Brazilian court documents.  Andrade, Berkowitz and nine others were charged in Brazil in December with allegations they funneled business to Vitol and other trading firms between 2011 and 2014. Andrade could not be located to request comment.

A gauge of global stock markets rose modestly, with an advance in Walmart helping to lift Wall Street equities, although gains were hemmed in by concerns in Europe a car tariff could hurt the region’s exports to the United States. Worries over a possible global economic slowdown buoyed gold prices. The World Trade Organization warned of sluggish trade as a leading indicator of world merchandise trade hit its lowest reading in nine years. A new round of talks between the United States and China to resolve an extended trade spat will take place in Washington on Tuesday, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week, following a round of negotiations in Beijing last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 25,856.08, the S&P 500 lost 0.1 points, or 0.00 percent, to 2,775.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.93 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,481.34. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.23 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.07 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.03 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.10 percent. Gold prices surged to a near 10-month high, driven by concerns over slowing global growth. Adding to recent weak data from the United States, Japan and China, an ECB official signaled interest rates would remain at current levels until monetary policy goals are met. Spot gold added 0.9 percent to $1,338.21 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.44 percent to $1,341.20 an ounce. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday the central bank was ready to ramp up stimulus if the stronger yen derails the path towards its 2 percent inflation target. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 110.61 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3028, up 0.83 percent on the day. The dollar index, tracking the U.S. unit against six major currencies, fell 0.27 percent, with the euro up 0.18 percent to $1.1328. “We are hoping to hear more positive news on trade,” said Dean Popplewell, chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. “The dollar should come under pressure as it loses some safe-haven appeal.” The Swedish crown pared losses against the dollar after hitting a more than four-year low after inflation data came in decidedly weak just two months after a milestone rate hike. The crown lost 0.74 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 9.32. U.S. crude rose 0.07 percent to $55.63 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.92, down 0.87 percent.

2019-02-19,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - EPA acting administrator Andrew Wheeler rejected a proposal from his staff that would have reduced the ambition of the nation’s biofuel policy over the next three years, arguing the targeted range it included for annual ethanol consumption was too low, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The decision, made in December as part of the EPA’s effort to reset targets set by Congress in 2007 closer to market reality, has become a source of concern among the oil industry’s Republican legislative backers, some of whom have threatened to withhold support for Wheeler’s confirmation as permanent EPA head over his views on ethanol.  The issue represents the latest flashpoint in the ongoing clash between Big Oil and Big Corn over the nation’s biofuel policy, which has complicated President Donald Trump’s relationship with the two rival constituencies that helped sweep him to the White House in 2016. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into their gasoline and diesel each year or buy credits from those that do.  The corn industry is constantly pushing for targets to go up to ensure a robust market for growers, while the oil industry wants them to decline because biofuels compete with petroleum and compliance costs them money. Wheeler rejected a staff proposal presented in December that suggested the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation’s fuel could be cut from the current level of 15 billion gallons annually to as low as 14.3 billion over the final three years of the RFS program ending in 2022, a figure that had been sought by the oil industry, according to two of the sources. EPA staff made the proposal in the form of a range of 14.3 billion to 15 billion, the two sources said. Wheeler, who has been running the agency on an interim basis since his predecessor Scott Pruitt resigned in July, dismissed the proposal saying the 14.3 billion gallons at the bottom of the range was too low and would guarantee outrage from corn-state lawmakers, one of the sources briefed on the matter said. A second source familiar with the matter said Wheeler had rejected the 14.3 billion number because it was not clear if agency staff had considered the potential impact of a soon-to-be published EPA proposal to lift a summer ban on sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline called E15, which could boost the market for the corn-based fuel. Asked about the exchange, the EPA’s assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, last week said: “We’ve talked to Wheeler about what we should do in the reset but no final decisions have been made.” He added the work on the reset continued. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said on Friday: “EPA is still developing options regarding a reset proposal, and no final decisions have been made.”  Five Republican senators from oil states, led by Ted Cruz of Texas, sent a letter to Wheeler dated Feb. 11 asking him about his biofuels policies, and saying their support for his confirmation could hinge on his responses.  Trump nominated Wheeler in January but he still faces a senate vote, likely to take place at the end of February.  Two sources told Reuters the senators were particularly concerned about Wheeler’s rejection of the initial staff proposal on biofuel volume targets.  Officials from the senators’ offices did not respond to requests for comment explaining their concerns. The senators were also concerned that Wheeler had signaled in several recent meetings the agency could issue fewer exemptions to the nation’s biofuel laws to small refineries than under Pruitt, according to the sources. Pruitt’s expanded use of the waivers, which are intended for small refining operations under financial strain, angered farmers and their legislative backers by exempting some 2.25 billion gallons of ethanol from the U.S. mandates. But it also saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars by driving down the cost of compliance credits.   One justification Wheeler could use for providing fewer waivers is that the lower credit prices have reduced the financial burden on refiners. But in recent weeks, refiners like Valero Energy Corp and HollyFrontier have been buying more of them than usual, three brokers told Reuters, a sign that they expect a rebound. In their letter to Wheeler, the senators asked him if he would continue providing waivers “fully in accordance with the statute and case law.” The senators have also been worried by Wheeler’s meetings with biofuel trade groups and corn-state senators, according to one of the sources briefed by the senators’ staff.  A Reuters analysis of Wheeler’s public schedule shows he has met regularly with representatives of both sides of the debate, but has held several more meetings with corn backers than refining industry supporters since taking over in July. EPA spokesman Michael Abboud has said that Wheeler “is happy to meet with those who actually request meetings.” (This version of the story corrects title for EPA official Bill Wehrum to EPA assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation in 10th paragraph) Additional reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-epa-biofuels/corrected-republican-backlash-against-trump-epa-pick-fueled-by-biofuel-reset-idUKL5N20A5D1,19 Feb 2019,"EPA acting

2019-02-19,"(Reuters) - U.S. Silica Holdings Inc reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday, driven by increased supply of sand to industries such as glass and construction as its main frac sand business slows. The company’s shares rose as much as 8 percent as sales at its industrial and specialty products unit more than doubled to $113.8 million in the fourth quarter. That more than made up for a 20 percent drop in revenue to $243.5 million from its traditional business of supplying sand for use in fracking, as oil producers hold back on well completions. “We expect to continue with our strategic plan to substantially grow our industrial segment,” Chief Executive Officer Bryan Shinn said on a conference call with analysts. In 2019, the company expects 75 percent of profitability to be driven by its industrials unit and Sandbox, which provides transportation and storage facilities for proppant used in fracking in the oil and gas industry. In December, the company also said it would increase prices of silica sand products from the unit between 2 percent and 9 percent. The rise in prices, applied to shipments that started from Jan. 1, are part of the efforts by the company to offset production and investment costs. Oil and gas sand proppant sales were hurt by pricing pressure from a combination of low demand and additional local sand capacity coming on line in the Permian, the company said. The company forecast sand volumes to be kind of “flattish” compared with the fourth quarter. Excluding items, the miner recorded a loss of 4 cents per share, smaller than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 7 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.

2019-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - After centuries of selective breeding of animals and plants to maximize yields in agriculture, bugs are getting the same treatment, as demand for insect protein grows. British start-up Beta Bugs is breeding high performance strains of black soldier fly for the insect feed sector, and is selecting traits like growth rate, protein content, fat composition and even temperature tolerance according to clients’ needs. Most animal feed is made from soy which is blamed by some for deforestation as farmers try to meet increasing global demand for the crop. This has led to the search for more sustainable sources of protein.  “There are insect farms around Europe, around the UK, even elsewhere in the world which are using food waste and waste streams to rear insects such as the black soldier fly which they can then feed to fish, chickens and pigs.” “We’re looking at it from the genetic side. How do we make the best fly and the best bug possible for use in these farms?” founder and managing director of Beta Bugs, Thomas Farrugia told Reuters. The company breeds certain strains of fly, resulting in highly optimized insects. The feed is made from fly maggots.  “You can cram decades worth of genetic progress that has been made in every other animal into a few years for insects,” said Farrugia. Beta Bugs says it wants to stimulate the growth of a new and environmentally beneficial industry by bringing real benefits directly to farms.

2019-02-19,"EILAT, Israel (Reuters) - A rubbery sea creature with an irritating habit of clinging to ships and invading beaches could help measure plastic pollution as it can filter tiny particles from the ocean and store them in its soft tissue. Israeli researchers have found that ascidians - round, palm-sized animals also known as sea squirts can thrive in dirty industrial areas and pristine waters alike, allowing them to detect and analyse waste and its impact in various regions.     A staggering amount of plastic flows into the ocean each year. The United Nations says it is as if a garbage truck full of plastic was dumped into the water every minute, a rate some estimates show could lead to oceans carrying more plastic than fish in 30 years. But the long-term impact of the waste, particularly tiny pieces called microplastic, is still not fully understood. “[Sea squirts] just sit in one place all their life and filter the water, like a pump,” said Gal Vered of Tel Aviv University, and who co-published the researchers’ findings in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin. “They can really give us a picture of what the whole reef, the whole ecosystem felt during its life.”  As a bonus, sea squirts are related in evolutionary terms to  human beings. So studying them and the plastic inside them could be more insightful than looking at creatures like fish or clams. “Although we don’t look alike at all, we have similar systems,” said Noa Shenkar, of Tel Aviv University’s zoology department and museum of natural history. Plastic never disappears. Over time it breaks down into microplastics, ranging from the size of a grain of rice on down. They mix with tiny plastic beads found in products like cosmetics and cleaners that were flushed away. These are eaten by wildlife, filling their bellies, exposing them to chemical additives and, potentially, entering the food chain, said Vered.  Vered searched piers and rocks in the Red Sea resort of Eilat, eventually finding a cluster of sea squirts on a brick. Back in her lab, a gentle push on one squirt’s belly saw the creature let loose the eponymous squirt of water. Invisible to the naked eye are the microplastics, perhaps once part of a bag or bottle, and that were found at all the sites they tested along Israel’s coasts. “We as humans invented a material that can last for hundreds, thousands of years, and then we use it as a single-use product. It’s quite a paradox,” she said.

2019-02-19," (This Feb. 14 story corrects the figure in the second paragraph to 200,000 tonnes per month - not per year) By Alexander Ershov, Olga Yagova and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - A clash between trading house Vitol and Azerbaijan’s SOCAR over Caspian Sea oil shipments is forcing Turkmenistan to slash exports of crude due to a lack of tankers. Turkmenistan typically exports about 200,000 tonnes of oil per month via the Caspian to world markets, mainly from fields operated by the UAE’s ENOC and Italy’s Eni, but flows have halved in recent weeks, six traders involved in operations said. That happened after Turkmen producers decided to export oil via Russia with the help of Swiss trader Vitol and ditch the previous Azeri route, operated by state-owned SOCAR. The reasons behind the change are not fully clear but trading sources attributed it to pricing disagreements. Three trading sources said SOCAR had raised tariffs, while one source said Vitol had offered lower tariffs. “The only problem was that Vitol was lacking tankers,” one of the sources involved in operations said. Vitol said it would not comment on commercial activity or trading. SOCAR, ENOC and the Turkmen Energy Ministry declined to comment. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft did not respond to a request for comment. Eni said it had not been forced to reduce exports or production and that “the situation was stable”. Russian Energy Ministry data shows that no exports of Turkmen oil occurred via Russia in January. In February, only 80,000 tonnes will be loaded from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.  Eni declined to say why its production and exports were stable after such a drop in shipments or whether it was stockpiling oil in Turkmenistan. SOCAR controls the Caspian’s largest fleet of small and mid-sized tankers, which used to ship Turkmen oil to Baku. From there, it was loaded into the BTC pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. In Turkmenistan, ENOC’s Dragon Oil is developing the Cheleken oilfield, with annual output of some 2.4 million tonnes. Eni produces nearly 300,000 tonnes per year from the Okarem field. In 2018, crude from Dragon Oil was exported via BTC through SOCAR. Eni also sold volumes to Vitol, which in turn resold it to SOCAR. Under new long-term deals for this year, Dragon and Eni chose Vitol to export oil to the Russian port of Makhachkala, where Transneft is taking it to Novorossiisk. Upset by the development, SOCAR refused to let Vitol use its tankers, the six traders said. “Everyone is free to defend their commercial interests,” said a source at SOCAR when asked about tankers. Vitol has secured several tankers, but these will be able to transport only around 120,000 tonnes a month until the Russian river-canal system becomes ice-free and opens to navigation in April, trading sources said. Shipments can then increase. The Caspian tanker shortage was such that Vitol had to charter old ships, including the Grigoriy Bugrov, a 44-year-old vessel that sank in 2011 and was later repaired. “These vessels were chartered on an exceptional basis and only after physical inspection by an experienced professional. Vitol is extremely mindful of its responsibilities in respect of customers, stakeholders and the environment,” Vitol said when asked about the Bugrov tanker. The slowness of crude exports has forced Turkmen producers to stockpile oil throughout January and February, the six trading sources said. “Storage tanks are full so the Turkmens now face the risk of suspending some production,” a market source familiar with the matter said. Despite their modest volumes, Turkmen oil exports have always been a high-stakes, high-margins game. Oil is bought in Turkmenistan at a discount of several dollars per barrel to the dated Brent benchmark.  Crude is then sold in the Mediterranean at a premium to dated Brent as Azeri BTC - in case of shipments via Azerbaijan - or as Siberian Light, which also normally trades at a premium to dated Brent if it flows via Russia’s Novorossiisk. “Losing Turkmen crude means lower exports via BTC and lower crude quality,” a trader with a European refiner said.  For Russia, getting Turkmen volumes does the opposite - it helps improve the quality of oil in the pipeline system. Azeri BTC crude oil loadings are scheduled to fall some 10 percent in March versus February. The situation regarding quality was not critical, the SOCAR source said. “Negotiations about getting oil from Turkmenistan are not over ... We hope there is a chance that we will get some Turkmen oil volumes,” the SOCAR source added.

2019-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy lost a lot of momentum during the fourth quarter and suffered a serious wobble in December, which should give policymakers pause before doing anything that could unsettle fragile sentiment further. Freight movements by road, rail, air, barge and pipeline fell more than 3 percent in December compared with November, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). Freight shrank by the most in any one month since March 2009 and was just 1.4 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier, the weakest performance for more than two years. Road freight slumped more than 4 percent in the final month of 2018, according to data sourced from the American Trucking Associations (“December 2018 freight transportation services index”, BTS, Feb. 13). Truck freight has been losing momentum since the middle of last year but the drop in December was the worst for nearly seven years. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2GVTxDc) Separately, loaded container movements through the major gateways of Los Angeles and Long Beach slowed sharply, according to container counts from the port operators. Faltering freight volumes are consistent with other data showing the manufacturing sector hit a soft patch towards the end of last year. Manufacturing output hit a cycle high in October but fell in each of the three following months and was down more than 3 percent by January (“Industrial production and capacity utilization”, Federal Reserve, Feb. 15). Purchasing managers also reported an abrupt deceleration in the rate of expansion, with the Institute for Supply Management’s composite business activity index registering its worst decline in December since the financial crisis. In recent months, some observers have commented on the apparent disconnect between plunging financial markets, wobbling business surveys, and solid economic data. In retrospect, however, the data is all coherent. The drop in U.S. equity valuations and flattening of the yield curve in the fourth quarter are consistent with hard economic data showing a rapid cooling in the economy late in 2018. The critical question is whether the slide in freight and manufacturing activity near the end of last year turns out to be a brief soft patch or heralds a more sustained period of weakness - even a recession. Equity prices rallied strongly in January and the Institute for Supply Management’s composite activity indicator reversed some of the losses the month before, both of which suggest the economy will continue to expand. But both remain well below their pre-October highs and the yield curve has not steepened significantly, which point to a more sustained loss of momentum and an elevated risk of recession. Taken together, the available financial and real economic data suggests an economy poised between continued growth at a slower rate or the onset of a recession. Like expansions, recessions are driven by positive-feedback mechanisms which amplify the effect of an initial disturbance, often quite a small one, so the next few months will be critical. In the circumstances, the U.S. economy can ill afford any more negative shocks, and that includes an escalation of the trade battle with China.

2019-02-19,"* South African state power firm in crisis * Power plant breakdowns, debt burden to blame * Unions disagree with government over solution * Minister says new generation capacity needed (Adds more Radebe comments, unions) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 19 (Reuters) - South Africa needs to invest more to rebuild confidence in its ability to supply power, its energy minister said on Tuesday, after its state-run power firm was forced to implement some of the worst blackouts in years. Problems at cash-strapped national power firm Eskom have shaken belief in South Africa’s ability to power the continent’s most industrialised economy, and hit business including in key sectors like mining. President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised to split Eskom into three entities to make it more efficient, but labour unions and some within the governing African National Congress party view his plan with suspicion as it could loosen the state’s grip over the power sector. “We have to instil confidence in our ability to provide reliable power,” Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said at a conference in Johannesburg, adding Ramaphosa’s efforts to entice investment could otherwise be undermined. “Deteriorating Eskom plant performance driven by old generation infrastructure confirms that we are now in need of more investment in new generation capacity,” he said. Years of mismanagement and governance problems at Eskom have left the company, which supplies 90 percent of South Africa’s power, saddled with debt and ailing power plants, a situation Radebe described as “untenable”. Ramaphosa has been at pains to revive troubled state firms, which weigh on confidence in government finances and the economy, but the extent of their difficulties and disagreements over the way forward mean progress has been slow. South Africa’s largest trade union federation COSATU said on Tuesday a meeting with Ramaphosa and senior ministers including Radebe over the plan to divide up Eskom had failed to resolve differences over the policy. “There was no breakthrough in the impasse over the unbundling of Eskom. We still need more detail,” COSATU spokesman Sizwe Pamla said. The last time unions launched major strikes at Eskom, midway through last year, power production quickly suffered. Radebe also said on Tuesday an updated version of the country’s long-term energy plan would be ready next month, later than initially planned. Asked whether the government was looking to renegotiate the terms of older renewable energy projects, as another minister suggested this week, Radebe said the government would hold a news conference on its policy on independent power producers in the coming days.

World markets were struggling to stay positive after a slow but buoyant start to the week and with the talk of tariffs in Europe also coming ahead of fresh Sino-U.S. trade talks in Washington later. Wall Street futures were pointing around 0.2 percent lower after Europe’s main bourses gave up an early fight to spend the day in the red after Asia had also barely got out of first gear overnight. Bank shares had been hit by a mix of weak results from the region’s biggest and most global institution HSBC and by some weak euro zone data that also painted gloomy pictures for Germany and Italy’s economies. Currency dealers had plenty to keep them busy too. The yen had slipped to 110.70 per dollar after Japan’s central bank governor had said it could redeploy stimulus if the yen’s relative strength this year hurt the economy and inflation prospects. The euro was slipped back under $1.13 after more talk of ultra-cheap ECB bank loans, while Sweden’s crown dived to a 2-year low against the dollar as inflation data came in decidedly weak just two months after its milestone rate hike. “Stokkie (dollar vs Swedish crown) is off to the races,” said TD Securities’ head of global research, Richard Kelly. “You had especially weak inflation and as you see (from the yen and euro) it comes against this backdrop of central banks becoming more dovish again,” although he also said that bond markets has seen far less reaction to the Swedish data. Most other currencies were in familiar ranges. Sterling was stuck at $1.2920, with the ongoing Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union overpowering strong employment and wage data, while the Australian dollar held at just over $0.71. The precious metals market was more animated, with palladium surging to a record high of $1,481 per ounce as stricter auto emissions standards are seen increasing demand for the metal in new catalytic converters. Gold managed a new 10-month high of $1,329 too and OPEC supply cuts left U.S. WTI oil at its highest since mid-November at $56.02 even as Brent futures inched back 29 cents to $66.21 “The market is slowly regaining its bullish footing, subject to the perception of economic risks tied to U.S.-China trade talks,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow were a shade weaker as traders returned from a long weekend break to a busy day of U.S. earnings and U.S.-China trade deal guess work. The World Trade Organization set the tone as its quarterly indicator of world merchandise trade slumped to its lowest reading since the fallout of the financial crisis nine years ago. In a brighter spot, shares of the world’s biggest traditionally retailer Walmart jumped 4.6 percent in premarket dealing after reporting an estimate-beating jump in holiday quarter sales. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei ended up 0.1 percent after holding flat for most of the day. Australian shares climbed 0.3 percent to a 4-1/2 month peak, after gaining over 8 percent so far this year, partly on expectations the central bank could ease policy to temper pressure on growth. Chinese shares ended in the red though after surging in the previous session, with the blue-chip index off 0.2 percent. HSBC’s slump had come as it warned of slowing growth in its two home markets of China and Britain too. The results spoke to a wider problem for European banks, which are struggling to return to growth after a decade of post-crisis restructuring due to a worsening global economic outlook. Trade talks were also dominating headlines again with a new round of negotiations between the United States and China expected in Washington on Tuesday, and follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week. Reports of progress in the talks have kindled hopes among investors that the two countries can reach a compromise in their trade war by a March 1 deadline, although few details from the talks have emerged. President Donald Trump said last week he might extend the deadline, which would stop an immediate increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. Reflecting changing sentiment, Chinese shares have risen rapidly so far this month, with MSCI’s China A shares index up 6.5 percent, by far the best performance among major markets despite China’s weakening economy. Additionally, investors are now seen returning to riskier asset markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled this year it could halt rate hikes in light of U.S. economic softness. “In the last week, it seems like global central banks have started a possible process of monetary easing,” Bank of America-Merrill Lynch strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note. “If (currency moves) are having an impact on the economy and prices, and if we consider it necessary to achieve our price target, we’ll consider easing policy,” Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had said in his country’s parliament.

2019-02-19,"BARCELONA, Feb 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Scientists and companies working to grow meat from animal cells will need to minimise energy use and avoid fossil fuels if claims that cultured meat is better for the climate than real meat are to hold true, researchers said. Cultured meat production with high energy inputs could spur global warming more in the long-term than some types of beef cattle farming if the world shunned a low-carbon path, said a study published on Tuesday by the UK-based Oxford Martin School. Lead author John Lynch, a researcher at the University of Oxford, said reducing beef consumption would help curb climate change, as methane emitted by cattle is a potent heat-trapping gas. But how best to replace conventional meat remained unclear. “We have to dig into the details a bit more to know if the substitutes would be as beneficial as claimed,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It just comes down to how much energy demand would be to produce a kilogramme of meat.” Lynch said companies promising to bring lab-grown “clean” meat to the mass market, many of them based in the United States and Israel, had yet to release information on their planned large-scale production processes. The website of one high-profile firm, Memphis Meats, which produced the world’s first cell-based meatball in 2016 followed by poultry in 2017, says its meat, cultivated “at scale”, would use significantly less land, water, energy and food inputs. “Our process will produce less waste and dramatically fewer greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that the planet will be the ultimate beneficiary of our product,” it adds, without giving details of how that would be achieved. Memphis Meats has received investment from business tycoons Bill Gates and Richard Branson, as well as multinational corporations Cargill and Tyson Foods. David Welch, director of science and technology at The Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that supports early-stage companies producing “clean” meat, said it would likely be another five to 10 years before cultured meat products were commercially available to consumers. Development work was still being carried out in labs, with production facilities yet to be set up, he added. The Oxford Martin School study said research on greener ways of producing cultured meat was a priority at this nascent stage. Its study used four hypothetical cultured meat production methods, concluding the most energy-efficient would not warm the planet more than farming beef in the long term, even without decarbonisation of the global energy system. “If the real (clean meat) production processes are like that one, then there is no problem,” said Lynch. Livestock are responsible for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. The Good Food Institute plans this year to carry out an in-depth study of the environmental effects of cultured meat production with companies, to deepen understanding of the risks and benefits, including for land, water and the climate. The Oxford research highlighted a huge difference in the amount of time for which different greenhouse gases influence the climate. Methane, released from cattle manure and flatulence, is more dangerous in the short-term but fades fast. “Per tonne emitted, methane has a much larger warming impact than carbon dioxide - however, it only remains in the atmosphere for about 12 years whereas carbon dioxide persists and accumulates for millennia,” said study co-author Raymond Pierrehumbert, a physics professor at the University of Oxford. As a result, the researchers found over a 1,000-year period, production of cultured meat could hike global warming more if the process depended heavily on high-carbon energy. Another important factor was land use, they said. For example, clearing forest land for cattle-grazing could greatly increase the carbon footprint of beef production, while growing meat in urban laboratories could free up land for storing carbon in vegetation or other ways. A separate paper from London-based think tank Chatham House said on Tuesday cultured meat had the potential to contribute to the emissions-reduction goals of the European Union, but policy makers would need to promote clear regulation and invest public funds in research, development and commercialisation.

2019-02-19,"BAKU (Reuters) - BP plans to ramp up production at Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz gas field and keep output flat at the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfields this year, a senior regional official at the British oil major said. A BP-led consortium said last week that it produced on average 584,000 barrels per day of oil at ACG last year, a total of 29 million tonnes, almost unchanged from 2017 volumes. Natural gas production from the Shah Deniz offshore field was 11.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) and condensate output came to 2.5 million tonnes, up from 10.2 bcm of gas and 2.4 million tonnes of condensate in 2017. “We expect flat oil production from ACG and a rise in gas production at Shah Deniz in 2019 as we will continue to ramp up production on Shah Deniz throughout this year and ... in the next few years,” Bakhtiyar Aslanbayli, BP’s vice president for Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, told Reuters. He said the giant ACG oilfields, which have so far produced 3.5 billion barrels of oil, had the potential to yield another 3 billion barrels. BP and Azerbaijan in 2017 extended to 2050 their agreement to develop the ACG fields, a deal dubbed by the Azeri government as “the contract of the century” when first signed in 1994. The arrangement was initially due to run until 2024. Aslanbayli said a final investment decision regarding exploration and production on the east and central Azeri field envisaged by the extended contract would be made in the first half of this year. Aslanbayli said the BP-led consortium planned two maintenance shutdowns of platforms at the central Azeri and west Chirag oilfields this year for a couple of weeks each, but both events were envisaged in production forecasts. He said the first gas from the second stage of Azerbaijan’s giant Shah Deniz field would be delivered to markets in Europe on time, in 2020. “We are quite confident that we will be able to deliver gas from Shah Deniz II to Europe next year as it was planned,” he said. The Shah Deniz I field has been pumping gas since 2006, while output from Shah Deniz II is expected to reach 16 bcm of natural gas per year, with 10 bcm earmarked for Europe and 6 bcm for Turkey. Aslanbayli said the capacity of pipelines along the Southern Gas Corridor running from Azerbaijan to Europe could be expanded if and when additional volumes of gas become available.     “That could be new sources of supply from Azerbaijan, from other fields,” he said. He called the Shafag-Asiman gas field “promising” and said BP planned to drill the first exploration well there this year. “If everything is as promising as we expect, the Shafag-Asiman will actually have huge gas resources, which could be definitely comparable to Shah Deniz,” he said. He added that the company would drill two exploration wells in shallow waters off the Absheron peninsula and conduct testing exploration drilling on the Gobustan onshore oilfield later this year.

2019-02-19,"OSLO (Reuters) - An unexplored 7,000 square kilometre (2,700 square mile) swathe of the British North Sea, previously thought to contain empty chambers left by three extinct volcanoes, may hide oil and gas instead, the University of Aberdeen said on Tuesday. For decades it was assumed that the Rattray volcanic province off northwest Scotland contained old magma chambers, ruling out the possibility of oil and gas discoveries.  However, the university’s geologists now say these “phantom volcanoes” never existed at all. The study’s findings raise the prospect of future discoveries in the area, which has been left untouched over 50 years of exploration activity in the North Sea, said the university. “What we found has completely overturned decades of accepted knowledge,” Aberdeen University’s Dr Nick Schofield said in a statement. “This gives us back a huge amount of gross rock volume that we never knew existed, in one of the world’s most prolific regions for oil and gas production.”  Schofield said the team of geologists, including two colleagues from Heriot-Watt University and the University of Adelaide, had reassessed the area by combining 3D seismic data from Norway’s Petroleum Geo-Services with well data. “There is a huge area under there that hasn’t been looked at in detail for a long time, because of the previously incorrect geological model,” Schofield said. Exploration in the area may be challenging, said the geologists, but technology is improving and there are still big discoveries being made in the North Sea, such as the ones in the Central Graben and Viking Graben areas. “As the old saying goes, often the best places to look for oil are in places near to where you’ve already found it,” said Schofield. “The North Sea is a prime example of that.” The volcanoes were thought to have been formed millions of years ago, during seismic activity under the North Sea that almost created an ocean between Britain and Europe - an episode geologists have described as a failed “Jurassic Brexit” attempt.

2019-02-19,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union agreed on Tuesday to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new trucks and buses by 30 percent by a 2030 deadline as part of its commitment to cut its output of greenhouse gases. The European Parliament and the Council, which represents the 28 EU member countries, struck a compromise in the early hours that will reduce average CO2 emissions compared with 2019 levels, the European Commision said in a statement. There is also an interim 15 percent reduction target for 2025 and incentives for manufacturers to make low and zero-emission trucks. The 2030 target is also subject to a review in 2022. “For the first time binding CO2-reduction targets for trucks at the EU-level, including a clear stimulus for zero and low-emission trucks,” Bas Eickhout, a Greens lawmaker who had negotiated on behalf of the European Parliament, said on Twitter.  The EU currently has no limits on emissions from heavy-duty vehicles, unlike the United States, China, Japan and Canada. Trucks account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. The EU agreed in December on targets for cutting emissions from cars and vans. Curbs on the transport sector, the only one in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord. Germany is home to Europe’s largest truck manufacturer, Daimler, as well as Volkswagen’s MAN. Other producers in Europe include Volvo, Italy-based Iveco, Paccar and Scania, also part of Volkswagen. Environmental campaigners say that trucks, while making up less than 5 percent of vehicles on the road, account for 22 percent of vehicle emissions.  The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said EU countries must improve charging and refueling infrastructure, which was non-existent for electric and hydrogen trucks and “very low and patchy” for trucks powered by natural gas. It believes the potential for electrification is far lower than for cars, particularly for long-haul transit, and questions whether transport operators will really want to buy zero-emission trucks. The provisional deal reached on Tuesday will need support from the Council and be subject to a vote in parliament.

2019-02-19,"* Big-ticket projects boost image of Macky Sall as he seeks re-election * Critics concerned by President’s authoritarian stance * Weakened opposition not expected to put up a fight By Sofia Christensen DAKAR, Feb 19 (Reuters) - President Macky Sall is the strong favourite to win Senegal’s election on Sunday, boosted by a modernising first term that propelled economic growth although critics accuse him of jailing his rivals for political gain. Sall, 57, is facing only four contenders in the first round of voting - the smallest presidential field since 1988 - after two of Senegal’s best-known opposition figures were ruled out because of corruption convictions. Rights groups say this represents a crackdown on dissent in a country long seen as West Africa’s most stable democracy, which has seen peaceful transitions of power via the ballot box since independence from France in 1960. But many voters and foreign backers applaud Sall for boosting economic growth to over six percent, one of the highest rates in Africa last year. The growth was driven in part by a series of infrastructure projects including a new airport, 221 km (137 miles) of multi-lane motorways, a wrestling stadium and an express train that will connect the capital to a new city that has begun to rise from the semi-desert outside Dakar. Billboards of Sall in a suit dot Dakar’s main coastal road and tout his achievements as the “Builder of Modern Senegal”. “We are happy,” said fisherman Diabel Mbeguere, pulling his brightly-painted wooden boat onto Dakar’s Yoff beach after a day at sea. “There are highways here now, many things the president has done.” “Electricity used to be a big problem,” he added. Long power cuts that used to blight urban Senegal are rarer under Sall. Thousands of villages have gained access to electricity for the first time too, although more than half remain without power, according to the International Monetary Fund. Opinion polls are banned in the run-up to elections, but a widely cited survey conducted by a Senegalese data company in November gave Sall 45 percent support. None of the other candidates had more than 16 percent. His main challengers are former prime minister and third-time runner Idrissa Seck, 59, and 44-year old political rookie Ousmane Sonko, who is popular among Senegalese youth. It is not yet clear how voting will be affected by the exclusion from the race of presidential hopefuls Khalifa Sall, a popular ex-mayor of Dakar who is no relation to Macky, and Karim Wade, the son of former President Abdoulaye Wade. Under Senegalese law, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade are barred from running as they were jailed for graft and corruption in 2018 and 2015 respectively. The opposition says this was a strategy to boost the president’s chances of winning, a charge the ruling party denies. Sall and Wade denied the charges. Khalifa Sall has urged his supporters to vote for Seck, with whom he forged an alliance from behind bars earlier this month. Meanwhile Karim Wade’s father Abdoulaye says the vote is rigged and told supporters during a political meeting this month to take out the electoral roll and “douse it with petrol”. His comments have been criticised by other opposition candidates and civil society groups and election day is not expected to be disrupted by widespread protests. Even so, frustration with the incumbent is palpable among the educated youth, who struggle to find jobs in an economy based on exports of fish, phosphates and cement, and where more than half the population works in agriculture. “Macky Sall promised to create 500,000 jobs for young people, but this never happened,” said 29-year old Romuald Preira, who recently completed a law degree at Dakar’s Cheikh Anta Diop university. “I can’t even find a small job or an internship, and I’m not the only one.” In response to a social media campaign, a televised debate between candidates is scheduled to take place on Thursday. The event is a first for Senegal, but Sall has refused to take part. More than 6.5 million people are registered to vote, with polls opening on Sunday at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and closing at six (1800 GMT). If no candidate secures a majority in the first round, the top two will face each other in a second round on March 24.

2019-02-19,"(Adds details, quote) By Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - India’s thermal coal imports could rise by about 10 percent in 2019 due to rail transport problems and other logistical bottlenecks, an executive at the country’s largest coal trader Adani Enterprises said on Tuesday. Thermal coal imports rose in 2018 after two years of decline, despite moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to cut the country’s imports in a bid to reduce the trade deficit. Rajendra Singh, chief operating officer for coal trading at Adani Enterprises, said thermal coal imports this year could total 174 million-177 million tonnes. “We expect a 10 percent increase in imported coal because of an immediate gap in supply from Coal India and power demand and demand from other sectors,” Singh said at the Coaltrans conference. Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, and over three-fifths of its thermal coal imports come from Indonesia, while over a fifth is imported from South Africa. India’s 2018 thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years, adding to India’s trade deficit and hurting the valuation of the rupee, the worst performing major Asian currency in 2018. The Adani Group, which handles about a third of India’s imported coal, expects “rail transportation challenges” to lead to a “reasonable rise in imports” until fiscal year 2021 when they will stabilise. Singh said he expects small and medium scale industries such as the sponge iron industry, tile manufacturers, cement producers and textiles to contribute to higher demand for seaborne coal, adding that an industrial shift from petcoke to coal was fuelling higher imports. Petcoke, or petroleum coke, is a refinery byproduct which is a dirtier alternative to coal. Its usage has been banned in some parts of the country, and policy flip-flops over its usage have led to a fall in demand for the fuel. State-run Coal India Ltd, which accounts for four-fifths of India’s coal production, supplies largely to power plants rather than small and medium-scale industries. Smaller scale industries have used imported coal in a big way, and while higher coal imports may be bad news for India’s trade deficit, they are a boon for international miners and global commodity merchants.

2019-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s exports of crude oil were higher than expected in January and are at least holding steady this month, according to tanker data and industry sources, as some customers have increased purchases due to waivers from U.S. sanctions. Shipments are averaging 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, Refinitiv Eikon data showed and a source at a company that tracks Iranian exports said. They were between 1.1 and 1.3 million bpd in January, higher than first thought. A high rate of Iranian shipments would weigh on oil prices and work against a global push to cut supply in 2019 led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC member Iran negotiated an exemption from the production-cutting pact. “We think people are taking more ahead of the deadline,” said the industry source who tracks Iranian exports, referring to the scheduled end of U.S. sanctions waivers in May. Increased exports from the Islamic Republic might prompt renewed U.S. efforts to clamp down on flows. However, this would run the risk of driving up oil prices as Washington is also seeking to curtail exports from another foe, Venezuela. Iran’s exports have become more opaque since U.S. sanctions on the country’s oil sector took effect in November. While most agree they have dropped steeply, views on flows can differ by as much as several hundred thousand barrels per day - enough to affect prices. The February shipments are up from January’s 1.1 million bpd, according to Refinitiv. The industry source estimated January exports at 1.3 million bpd, close to February’s level. In any case, the January figures are higher than initial estimates. Some had predicted Iranian crude exports would stay below 1 million bpd last month, a similar rate to that in December. A source at a second company that tracks Iranian exports said shipments in the first 10 days of February were above 1.1 million bpd and on a rising trend - higher than the source expected. Washington gave waivers to eight buyers - including China, India, Japan and South Korea, which were all purchasing Iranian crude in February, according to Refinitiv. The rise in shipments raises the prospect of less generous waivers, should Washington renew such exemptions when those in place expire. The U.S. special representative for Iran said last month there would be a much deeper reduction in Iranian exports. Shipments have dropped steeply from at least 2.5 million bpd in April 2018, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. Tehran has vowed to keep exporting oil despite U.S. efforts to reduce its shipments to zero.

2019-02-19,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new round of talks between the United States and China to resolve their trade war will take place in Washington on Tuesday, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week, the White House said. The talks follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world’s two largest economies. The talks are aimed at “achieving needed structural changes in China that affect trade between the United States and China. The two sides will also discuss China’s pledge to purchase a substantial amount of goods and services from the United States,” the White House said in a statement. The higher-level talks will start on Thursday and be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, a strong proponent of pressing China to end practices that the United States says include forced technology transfers from U.S. companies and intellectual property theft. China, which denies that it engages in such practices, confirmed that Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Thursday and Friday for the talks. The White House said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and trade adviser Peter Navarro would also take part in the talks. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion (£155 billion) in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1. Trump, who suggested last week that he could extend the deadline for the talks, reiterated in a speech on Monday that the negotiations had been fruitful. “We’re making a lot of progress. Nobody expected this was going to be happening,” he told a crowd in Florida. Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told a visiting U.S. business delegation that everyone was “paying attention” to the talks. “If our two countries can respect each other and cooperate it will not only be the right choice for us but it is also the common hope of international society,” Wang told the group, which included U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Myron Brilliant and former U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury Robert Kimmitt. Brilliant said that in the last year or so there had been “serious discussions about economic issues”.  “We are hopeful that the two sides will reach a comprehensive, bold and significant trade agreement that will be enduring and long-lasting.

2019-02-19,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Environmentalists urged EU policy makers on Tuesday to take a tougher stance on air pollution from coal power plants in the Western Balkans, blaming the fumes for 3,900 deaths across Europe each year. The 16 Communist-era plants with 8 gigawatts (GW) capacity emitted the same amount of sulfur dioxide in 2016 as 250 coal-fired plants with 30 times more capacity in the rest of the European Union, five environmentalist groups said in a report. Lignite, the most polluting coal, is widely available in the region, providing a cheap energy resource and the major source of energy for Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro. The countries are members of the Energy Community, which had a commitment to implement EU rules to curb pollution by 2018. But investments in new power plants or technology to cut emissions have largely been delayed, the report said. “Air pollution knows no borders and is still an invisible killer in Europe,” said Vlatka Matkovic Puljic, senior health and energy officer at HEAL and the report’s lead author. “It is high time that EU policy-makers step up efforts to clean up the air and decarbonise the power sector,” she said. The report said the West Balkan power plants caused pollution across the EU and beyond that caused healthcare costs of up to 11.5 billion euros ($13.02 billion) a year. The region plans to add 2.7 GW of new coal plant capacity in the next decade, mainly financed by Chinese banks, the report said, adding that most plants would not meet the EU’s pollution control rules. Governments in the region say they need to expand coal power generation to meet rising demand and ensure energy security and say that new coal plants would emit less greenhouse gases. The report called for stricter rules to be imposed on the Energy Community and said the European Commission should make meeting those regulations a requirement for joining the EU. For now, the countries in the Energy Community do not face any penalties if targets are not met. “Rather than investing in yet more outdated coal power plants, Western Balkan leaders need to ... increase the share of sustainable forms of renewable energy,” said Ioana Ciuta, Energy Coordinator at CEE Bankwatch, one of the five groups behind the report.

2019-02-19,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court on Tuesday ruled in favour of Volkswagen in a case brought by a customer seeking compensation for having bought a diesel car affected by emissions cheating, but the plaintiff’s lawyer plans to appeal. A lower court in Brunswick near Volkswagen’s Wolfsburg headquarters denied compensation in the case. Volkswagen said it welcomed the ruling, but the plaintiff’s lawyer said he would appeal the ruling at the Federal Court of Justice, Germany’s highest court.  The case could become the first against VW to be decided by the Federal Court, potentially setting a precedent for customers affected by the diesel scandal. VW customers have filed thousands of lawsuits across Germany seeking compensation after buying cars affected by emissions cheating software. So far, VW and affiliated traders have won 22 rulings by lower appeals courts. The plaintiff in the this case was supported by myRight, a consumer body which has organised a group action against Volkswagen. “myRight now is in the finals against VW”, said myRight founder Jan-Eike Andresen. The consumer body, which cooperates with U.S. law firm Hausfeld, currently represents 45,000 plaintiffs who want compensation for their diesel vehicles. Altogether, more than 400,000 German diesel customers have participated in a joint legal action against Volkswagen. A Federal Court of Justice ruling on the case, legally assessing Volkswagen’s responsibility and potential obligation to pay compensation towards car owners, would bind all other German jurisdictions.  VW has said about 11 million diesel cars worldwide were fitted with software that could cheat emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes. The German carmaker has agreed to pay billions of dollars in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers.

2019-02-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Northern Europe will experience above normal temperatures for the better part of March to May, with most of the continent enjoying a generally warm and wet spring, The Weather Company said on Tuesday.  “As we look ahead to spring, we feel that the biggest risks for colder weather, relative to normal, are still in March, and especially across northern/eastern sections,” said Todd Crawford, chief meteorologist at The Weather Company. “Beyond March, most of our model outputs suggest a generally warm/wet spring in most locations, especially across the northern half of Europe, as mobile westerlies impinge upon the continent,” he said. Scandinavia will experience the warmest spring, added the Weather Company.

World markets were struggling a bit for direction after a slow but buoyant start to the week and with a fresh round of Sino-U.S. trade talks, this time in Washington, being held later. Stocks traders were largely happy to keep their powder dry. Europe’s main bourses spent most of their first hour dithering before eventually heading lower after a subdued Asian session had seen most markets there barely get out of first gear. Currency dealers had at least a bit more to keep them busy. The yen had slipped to 110.70 per dollar after Japan’s central bank governor had said it could redeploy stimulus if the yen’s relative strength this year hurt the economy and inflation prospects. The euro was just above $1.13 after more talk of ultra-cheap ECB bank loans, while Sweden’s crown dived to a 2-year low against the dollar as inflation data came in weak just two months after a rise in interest rates. “Stokkie (dollar vs Swedish crown) is off to the races,” said TD Securities’ head of global research, Richard Kelly. “You had especially weak inflation and as you see (from the yen and euro) it comes against this backdrop of central banks becoming more dovish again,” although he also said that bond markets has seen far less reaction to the Swedish data. Most other currencies were stuck in familiar ranges. Sterling was flat at $1.2923, with the ongoing Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union overpowering strong employment and wage data, while the Australian dollar held at $0.7112. The precious metals market was more animated, with palladium surging to a record high of $1,471.0 per ounce as stricter emissions standards are seen increasing demand for the auto catalyst metal. Gold held around $1,323.66 per ounce after earlier rising to a near 10-month high of $1,327.64 too. Oil prices were mixed, with Brent futures off 29 cents at $66.21, although that was not far from Monday’s $66.83 which was the highest since mid-November. U.S. crude futures added 21 cents to $55.8. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow were a shade weaker ahead of a busy day of U.S. earnings, including from the world’s biggest retailer Walmart which is expected to report a 1.8 percent increase in revenue. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei nudged up 0.1 percent after holding flat for most of the day. Australian shares climbed 0.3 percent to a 4-1/2 month peak, after gaining over 8 percent so far this year, partly on expectations the central bank could ease policy to temper pressure on growth. Chinese shares slipped into the red though after surging in the previous session, with the blue-chip index off 0.2 percent. HSBC - Europe’s biggest bank - saw its shares fall 3 percent as it missed forecasts due to slowing growth in its two home markets of China and Britain. The results spoke to a wider problem for European banks, which are struggling to return to growth after a decade of post-crisis restructuring due to a worsening global economic outlook. Trade talks were also dominating headlines again with a new round of negotiations between the United States and China expected in Washington on Tuesday, and follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week. Reports of progress in the talks have kindled hopes among investors that the two countries can reach a compromise in their trade war by a March 1 deadline, although few details from the talks have emerged. President Donald Trump said last week he might extend the March 1 deadline, which would stop an immediate increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. Reflecting changing sentiment, Chinese shares have risen rapidly so far this month, with MSCI’s China A shares index up 6.5 percent, by far the best performance among major markets despite China’s weakening economy. Additionally, investors are now seen returning to riskier asset markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled earlier this year it could halt rate hikes in light of U.S. economic softness. “In the last week, it seems like global central banks have started a possible process of monetary easing,” Bank of America-Merrill Lynch strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note. “If so, this would be very positive for Asia/EM stocks,” Kapur added.

2019-02-19,"BERLIN, Feb 19 (Reuters) - A German court on Tuesday ruled in favour of Germany’s biggest carmaker Volkswagen in a case brought by a customer seeking compensation for having bought a diesel car affected by emissions cheating, a spokeswoman said. The ruling clears the way for an appeal before Germany’s highest court, the BGH, which could set an important precedent for customers affected by the diesel scandal. “We welcome today’s ruling”, Volkswagen said in a statement. VW customers have filed thousands of lawsuits across Germany seeking compensation after buying cars affected by emissions cheating. According to Volkswagen, there have been 22 rulings by German courts of appeal so far on customer cases related to the diesel scandal, all of which either Volkswagen or affiliated traders have won. The plaintiff in Tuesday’s ruling, supported by myRight, a consumer body which also organised a group action against Volkswagen, will appeal the ruling at the BGH, myRight said.

2019-02-19,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China wants to deepen “strategic trust” with Iran, the Chinese government’s top diplomat told Iran’s foreign minister on Tuesday, days before Saudi Arabia’s crown prince visits Beijing, underscoring China’s difficult Middle East balancing act. China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil, but it has been trying to raise its profile, especially in the Arab world.  Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited Beijing in 2017, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrives in China later this week. However, China has had to walk a fine line, as it also has close ties with Saudi Arabia’s regional foe, Iran. Meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at a state guest house in Beijing, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said he had watched Zarif’s Sunday speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he had accused Israel of looking for war. “I saw on television how you defended the rights of Iran loud and clear at the Munich Security Conference. I think an audience of hundreds of millions of Chinese also watched what you said and you are a famous person now,” Wang said, in brief remarks in front of reporters.  “I would like to take this opportunity to have this in depth strategic communication with my old friend to deepen the strategic trust between our two countries and to ensure fresh progress of the bilateral comprehensive and strategic partnership,” he said. China set great store on, and looks forward to, Iran playing an even more constructive role in regional affairs, Wang added, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement. It did not elaborate. Zarif is in Beijing accompanying a delegation that includes Iran’s speaker of parliament, Ali Larijani, and Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh. Iran was China’s fourth-largest oil supplier last year. “Our relationship with China is very valuable to us. We consider the comprehensive strategic partnership between Iran and China as one of our most important relations,” Zarif said, also in remarks in front of the media. Washington’s major European allies opposed last year’s decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, which includes China and Russia, under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for it n accepting curbs on its nuclear programme.

2019-02-19,"BEIJING/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Chinese coal traders have stopped ordering Australian coal as clearing times through China’s customs have doubled to at least 40 days, according to major buyers in China and international coal merchants, resulting in a sharp fall in Australian prices. The traders and a broker said only cargoes from Australia, the biggest supplier of the fuel to the world’s top consumer, were affected. “We have stopped ordering coal from Australia because it is unknown how long the restriction will last,” said a manager at a Shanghai-based trading company who usually buys around 400,000 tonnes of Australian coal every month. Customs clearance typically takes five to 20 days. Now it can be as much as 45 days, said the manager, asking not to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media. The world’s biggest coking coal exporter, BHP Group, played down any suggestion the customs delays had any connection to recent Beijing-Canberra diplomatic tensions. “I don’t believe for one moment this is linked to some of the higher level issues of relationships between China and the rest of the world,” BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said, speaking during a post-earnings conference call. He said the delays were not targeted against Australia, and reflected China’s effort to balance domestic production versus imports. International traders confirmed the delays. “Yes, the Chinese ports are holding up all thermal shipments ex Australia for 40-60 days...My clients are only buying spot Indonesian coal,” said an Australian coal trader, who asked not to be named due to company policy. A coal broker at China’s state-backed mining group Minmetals said he had asked clients to put Australian imports on hold. The delays have been a large contributor to slump in Australian coal prices.  Spot cargo prices for thermal coal exports from Australia’s Newcastle terminal have fallen by more than a quarter from their 2018 peaks, to below $90 per barrel amid ample supply and tepid demand, especially from China. It was not clear why China had stepped up checks on Australian imports, but tension between Beijing and Canberra has grown in recent months over issues of cyber security and China’s influence in Pacific island nations.  China’s General Administration of Customs did not respond to a request for comment. There was no immediate response from the Foreign Ministry to a faxed request for comment. Authorities at some ports notified importers verbally this month that Australian thermal coal, but also coking coal would take longer than usual to clear, the Shanghai-based manager said. A Beijing-based coal trader and a purchasing manager at a coke plant received similar notifications. None of the buyers were aware of the reason. Australian Newcastle coal price: tmsnrt.rs/2EjeCGl China has curbed coal imports in the past to support domestic coal miners and reduce consumption to tackle air pollution. It restricted Indonesian coal imports in 2017, citing high impurities and low energy efficiency. This time round, the restrictions seem targeted at Australia. “Chinese demand for Indonesian coal remains strong,” said a merchant specializing in supply from the Southeast Asian country. Reuters reported in January that dozens of ships carrying coal and iron ore, mostly from Australia, were waiting to unload outside ports due to possible customs delays. The most-active thermal coal futures on China’s Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange hit 594 yuan ($87.79) a tonne on Monday, just shy of the three-month peak of 595.6 yuan, although the contract closed down 1 percent 583.8 yuan a tonne. Traders in China and also on international markets said demand for Indonesian and also Russian coal was rising to make up for the shortfall in Australian supply. Refinitiv ship tracking data showed coal shipments departing from Australia’s Newcastle port to China fell 30 percent last month compared with December to 18.19 million tonnes. As of Monday, shipments scheduled to leave in February were 12.78 million tonnes.

2019-02-19,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The most difficult part in trade negotiations between Europe and the United States is starting now and talks should focus on reducing tariffs on industrial goods to increase the chances of a deal, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Tuesday. A confidential U.S. Commerce Department report sent to President Donald Trump over the weekend is widely expected to clear the way for him to threaten tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported autos and auto parts by designating the imports a national security threat. “For some weeks and months now, we’re observing with concern that the U.S. is tightening its trade policies, that tensions are increasing,” Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio. “The impact can already be seen in the world economy, global growth has slowed,” Altmaier said. Asked about the risk of higher U.S. car tariffs, Altmaier said he did not buy the argument that imported cars would threaten the national security of the United States. Altmaier, a confidant of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that reducing tariffs on cars and other manufactured goods should be the main focus of the ongoing trade talks. “We are not yet where we want to be. We might have made one-third of the way and the most difficult part will be now,” Altmaier said. Altmaier added that he was in favour of reducing import tariffs for cars to the same level in the U.S. and Europe, “ideally to zero percent”. The trade talks will also be high on the agenda during a meeting of Altmaier with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire in Berlin later on Tuesday. Both ministers are expected to narrow differences on how far the negotiation mandate of the European Commission in the talks with the U.S. should go and which areas should be excluded. France is reluctant to open up its agriculture sector to U.S. imports and Altmaier said he was fine with excluding the issue in the trade talks. “Agriculture is a very sensitive topic, so we don’t want to talk about this in the current situation,” Altmaier said. Altmaier and Le Maire are expected to hold a news conference after the talks. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a German newspaper that Trump had promised him he would not impose additional import tariffs on European cars for the time being. If Trump imposed tariffs on European cars, however, the EU would react immediately and not feel obliged to stick to its promise to buy more soybeans and liquefied gas from the United States, Juncker added.

2019-02-19,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search is confident its partners ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA will be ready to sign off on two big projects in 2020 that together will double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea. Oil Search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant would be approved in 2019, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago. “It was a very tough year in Papua New Guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake,” Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten said. The quake killed more than 100 people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world’s poorest countries, destroyed homes, roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities. It also stoked long-running antagonism against the PNG LNG project, as the country’s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities.   Some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake. “In that context, we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities, I think, have been really well addressed,” Botten told Reuters after the company reported its annual results. Total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early April on its Papua LNG project, and Exxon Mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its PNG LNG plant and development of a new gas field, P’nyang, Botten said. Total’s Elk and Antelope fields, new gas from PNG LNG fields and P’nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at PNG LNG, roughly doubling its output to 16 million tonnes a year, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts. “I’m very confident that a 2020 final investment decision is very achievable,” Botten said. Oil Search, which has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, posted a 13 percent rise in annual profit, boosted by higher prices for its LNG and oil, which offset a loss of output after the earthquake. Net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to $341.2 million from $302.1 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts’ forecasts around $360.83 million, according to Refinitiv data. Oil Search raised its full year dividend to 10.5 cents from 9.5 cents in 2017. Oil Search’s shares fell 1.5 percent in a slightly firmer broader market. Production is expected to return to pre-quake levels in 2019 and unit production costs are forecast to fall 15-20 percent on the back of higher production, it said.

2019-02-19,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Ice and snow sculptures carved by nearly 10,000 artists in the city of Harbin have melted during a sudden warm spell, forcing the earliest closure of the main venue at China’s biggest winter festival.  Daytime temperatures have poked above freezing in northern China’s warmest week this winter, prompting the closure of the Harbin Ice and Snow World after Sunday, more than 10 days ahead of schedule. “Of course, we do have a sense of crisis,” a park official said, adding that it was closed for safety reasons because the sculptures had started to melt. The winter park in Harbin, a northeastern city known for its bitterly cold weather, had attracted more than one million visitors since it opened on Dec. 23.  Some visitors who made bookings to marvel at mini ice replicas of the Colosseum and the Milan Cathedral were disappointed by the early closure. Last year the park shut on March 10.  “Why didn’t you inform us in advance,” a tourist wrote in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog popular in China. “I’ve booked my train ticket and hotel, and now you are closed.” Park tickets have been refunded, said the park official. The Harbin winter festival has drawn millions of visitors from around the world every year since its inception in the early 1980s. It is a key source of tourism revenue for Harbin, a landlocked city in the province of Heilongjiang. The Harbin Ice and Snow World first opened in 1999.

Most other currencies were stuck in familiar ranges.

2019-02-19,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Rajendra Jadhav MUMBAI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Opposition from farmers has prompted India’s western state of Maharashtra to move the location for what would be the country’s biggest oil refinery, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said. Stare-run oil companies and Saudi Aramco have teamed up to build the $44 billion refinery, which is aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies while meeting Saudi Arabia’s need to secure regular buyers for its oil. But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood. After their protests, land acquisition has been stopped for the refinery at the proposed site at Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Mumbai, Fadnavis said on Monday. The refinery will be built at a place where local population won’t oppose the project, he said in a press conference, without identifying a new location. Fadnavis, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the announcement after forging an alliance with regional party Shiv Sena for the upcoming general election. The location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties, with Shiv Sena opposing the refinery. The announcement comes as Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit. The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing. RRPCL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless. “The company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast,” Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPCL, told Reuters. Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for its livelihood. In 2008, for example, India’s Tata Motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers.

Investor confidence was bolstered by mild gains in European stocks as U.S. markets were shut on Monday for a public holiday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a shade firmer, while Japan’s Nikkei was almost flat. Chinese shares were little changed, too, with the blue-chip index up 0.1 percent after surging in the previous session. Reports of progress in trade talks between the United States and China have prompted investors to be mildly optimistic that the two countries can reach a compromise by March 1 that will de-escalate their dispute or at least avoid a sharp hike in tariffs, although few details from the talks have emerged. A new round of talks between the United States and China to resolve their trade war will take place in Washington on Tuesday, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week, the White House said on Monday. President Donald Trump said last week he might extend the March 1 deadline, which would stop an immediate increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent. Reflecting changing sentiment, Chinese shares have risen rapidly so far this month, with MSCI’s China A shares index up 6.5 percent, by far the best performance among major markets despite China’s weakening economy. Additionally, investors are now seen returning to riskier asset markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve signalled earlier this year it could halt rate hikes in light of U.S. economic softness. “In the last week, it seems like global central banks have started a possible process of monetary easing,” Bank of America-Merrill Lynch strategist Ajay Singh Kapur said in a note. “If so, this would be very positive for Asia/EM stocks,” Kapur added. “Central bank balance sheets are the most important driver of stock prices, in our view, by lowering risk premia, and cutting off deflation risk.” In currency markets, the euro and other risk-sensitive currencies remained underpinned by hopes on U.S.-China trade talks though most currencies were stuck in familiar ranges. The euro changed hands at $1.1304, off Friday’s three-month low of $1.1234. A run of soft European economic data, including Germany’s GDP figures, has weighed on the common currency. Comments from European Central Bank’s Olli Rehn on Sunday have fanned speculation the European Central Bank would launch another round of Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) to support bank lending. The dollar stood at 110.49 yen, stepping back from Thursday’s seven-week peak of 111.13. Sterling was slightly weaker at $1.2905, with an eye on Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union. The precious metals market was slightly more lively, with palladium surging to a record high of $1,462.5 per ounce as stricter emissions standards are seen increasing demand for the autocatalyst metal.

2019-02-19,"(Adds details on removals, background) By Marianna Parraga Feb 18 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp has removed at least three top executives close to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, in a move to cement management control under a new board of directors. The U.S. refining arm of Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA has been thrust in recent weeks into the center of a political battle between an opposition leader and self-declared president backed by many Western nations, including the United States, and Maduro, a socialist whose re-election last year they consider illegitimate. Monday’s departures appeared to shift control of Citgo’s day-to-day operations to officials expected to recognize a new board of directors appointed last week by the opposition-controlled congress, led by self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido. Citgo Vice Presidents Frank Gygax, Nepmar Escalona and Simon Suarez, all of them Venezuelans promoted by Citgo Chief Executive Asdrubal Chavez from 2017 to 2018, were escorted out of Citgo’s Houston headquarters on Monday by human resources staff, the people said. It was not immediately clear if the executives were fired, forced to resign or if they retired. Chavez, a cousin of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, has been running Citgo from the Bahamas since last year as the U.S. government denied his visa petition to work from Houston. Other Venezuelan members of the oil refiner’s board are also working with him from the Caribbean office. Citgo is the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and runs plants in Illinois, Texas and Louisiana that provide about 4 percent of U.S. refining capacity. It also operates fuel pipelines and terminals, and supplies fuel to a retail network of 5,500 gas station across 29 U.S. states. The company has been hurt by U.S. sanctions imposed on Jan. 28 to curtail Maduro’s access to oil revenue. Citgo, the largest U.S. buyer of Venezuelan crude, can continue importing PDVSA’s oil only if the sale proceeds go to banks accounts controlled by Guaido. Citgo’s new board of directors is led by Venezuelan Luisa Palacios, four veteran oil executives and current Vice President of Strategy and Compliance Rick Esser. The new members have yet to take office in Houston. A fourth top Citgo official, General Auditor Eladio Perez, also was removed from his office on Monday, according to one of the people. Citgo’s manager for corporate social responsibility and legislative affairs, Larry Elizondo, declined to comment on Monday, saying he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. A Citgo spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment. Escalona, Suarez and Perez could not be immediately reached for comment. An assistant for Gygax said she was unaware of the decision. Earlier on Monday, a Citgo unit on the Caribbean island of Aruba, said a project to refurbish and reopen a 209,000-barrel-per-day idled refinery rented by the company since 2016 was put on hold and remaining employees would be laid off by Feb. 27 because of sanctions.

2019-02-19,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) continued their downward spiral this week, hitting a 17-month low as the market moved further away from the peak winter-demand period and inventories remained high in the region.  Spot prices for March delivery to Asia fell to $6.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week, down 20 cents from the previous week to their lowest since Sept. 8, 2017, trade sources said.  April prices are estimated at about $6.30 per mmBtu, the sources said.  Demand in China remained tepid as many factories there were still shut for Lunar New Year celebrations, trade sources said. The Lunar New Year fell on Feb. 5 and 6 this year, but the festival typically lasts for about two weeks.  While temperatures in Beijing and Shanghai briefly dipped below normal levels, they are expected to rise next week, weather data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.  “It snowed in Beijing but it’s not that cold still, plus the factories are still shut, so the inventory levels are still quite high,” a China-based trade source said.  Several unplanned outages failed to lift prices, indicating just how weak demand is currently, trade sources said.  Loadings of LNG cargoes at Malaysia’s Bintulu export plant, operated by Petronas, were delayed this week due to lower production, sources have said.  But the delay was due to minor glitches at the plant which have since been resolved, one of the sources said.  In Australia, at least one train was down briefly at Chevron Corp’s Wheatstone LNG plant but operations have resumed since, sources said. Chevron declined to comment.  Train 3 of Chevron’s Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia is still down after it was shut in mid-January following a mechanical issue, sources said. All sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. Woodside Petroleum’s Pluto LNG facility has also resumed full output after a brief outage.  With prices falling, there is also less incentive for producers to keep output at high levels, an industry source said.  LNG exports from U.S. LNG terminals are returning to normal after loadings were delayed earlier this month when natural gas flows to terminals fell to their lowest level in almost a year due to maintenance work and a fog along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Supply remained ample in Asia with Kuwait Petroleum Corp and Indonesia’s Donggi-Senoro LNG export plant offering cargoes for March and April.  Indonesia’s Pertamina sold four cargoes it had offered for March 2019 to early 2020 from its Bontang plant, although price and buyer details could not immediately be confirmed.

2019-02-19,"SYDNEY, Feb 19 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices hit a three-month high on Tuesday, buoyed by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $55.95 per barrel at 0034 GMT, up 36 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. Earlier in the session, they marked their strongest since Nov. 20 at $56.33 a barrel. Prices had risen 2.2 percent on Friday, the last trading session due to a U.S. public holiday on Monday. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. They closed Monday up 0.4 percent, after touching their highest since Nov. 20 at $66.83 a barrel. “OPEC and other major producers have done their part to stabilise prices by limiting output,” said Alfonso Esparza, senior market analyst, OANDA. “Disruptions in crude supply have also taken prices higher despite the United States ramping up production levels and softer global demand.” Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports in Dec fell to 7.690 million barrels per day (bpd) from 8.235 million bpd in Nov, official data showed on Monday.
