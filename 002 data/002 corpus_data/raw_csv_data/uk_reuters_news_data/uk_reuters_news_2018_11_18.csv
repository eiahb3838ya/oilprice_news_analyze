2018-11-18,"(Repeats story published late on Sunday, no change to text) * Leaders fail to agree on communique for first time in APEC history * Meeting marked by competing visions from U.S., China * U.S.-led plan for PNG seen as alternative to China energy proposal By Philip Wen, Jonathan Barrett and Tom Westbrook PORT MORESBY, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders failed to agree on a communique at a summit in Papua New Guinea on Sunday for the first time in their history as deep divisions between the United States and China over trade and investment stymied cooperation. Competition between the United States and China over the Pacific was also thrown into focus with the United States and its Western allies launching a coordinated response to China’s Belt and Road programme. “You know the two big giants in the room,” Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said at a closing news conference, when asked which of the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group could not agree. O’Neill, who was chairman of the meeting, said the sticking point was over whether mention of the World Trade Organization and its possible reform should be in the Leaders’ Declaration. “APEC has got no charter over World Trade Organization, that is a fact. Those matters can be raised at the World Trade Organization.” The multilateral trade order that APEC was established in 1989 to protect is crumbling as Chinese assertiveness in the Pacific and U.S. tariffs strain relations in the region and divide loyalties. A Leaders’ Declaration has been issued after every annual APEC leaders’ meeting since the first in 1993, the group’s website shows. O’Neill said that as APEC host, he would release a Chairman’s Statement, though it was not clear when. U.S. President Donald Trump did not attend the meeting and nor did his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence attended instead of Trump. Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived to great fanfare on Thursday and was feted by PNG officials. He stoked Western concern on Friday when he met Pacific island leaders to pitch his Belt and Road initiative. The United States and its allies, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, countered on Sunday with a $1.7 billion plan to deliver reliable electricity and the internet to PNG. Wang Xiaolong, a senior economic official with China’s APEC delegation, said of the failure to agree on a joint statement that it was “not exactly a sticking point between any particular two countries”. Most members affirmed their commitment to preserving the multilateral trading system and supported a robust and well-functioning WTO, he said. “Frankly speaking, we are in a very early stage of those discussions and different countries have different ideas as to how to take that process forward,” Wang said. One diplomat involved in the negotiations said tension between the U.S. and China, bubbling all week, erupted when the Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, objected during a leaders’ retreat to two paragraphs in a draft document seen by Reuters. One mentioned opposing “unfair trade practices” and reforming the WTO, while another concerned sustainable development. “These two countries were pushing each other so much that the chair couldn’t see an option to bridge them,” said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. “China was angered that the reference to WTO blamed a country for unfair trade practices.” Pence said in a blunt speech on Saturday there would be no end to U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods until China changed its ways. On Sunday, as he left the PNG capital of Port Moresby, he listed U.S. differences with China. “They begin with trade practices, with tariffs and quotas, forced technology transfers, the theft of intellectual property. It goes beyond that to freedom of navigation in the seas, concerns about human rights,” Pence told reporters. Pence also took direct aim at Xi’s signature Belt and Road initiative, saying in his speech countries should not accept debt that compromised their sovereignty. “We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road,” he said. The Belt and Road plan was first proposed in 2013 to expand land and sea links between Asia, Africa and Europe, with billions of dollars in infrastructure investment from China. APEC host PNG is home to 8 million people, four-fifths of whom live outside urban areas and with poor infrastructure, and found itself feted by superpowers. Xi opened a Beijing-funded boulevard, while Pence talked of a 400-year old King James Bible in the PNG parliament that he had played a role in bringing to the country. Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, has for decades enjoyed largely unrivalled influence among Pacific island nations. China has recently turned its attention to the region with a raft of bilateral financing agreements to often distressed economies. PNG Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato said his country did not need to pick sides. “For us, we welcome Chinese investment, we welcome U.S. investment. Our foreign policy is to be friends of all, enemies of none.” (Reporting by Philip Wen, Charlotte Greenfield, Jonathan Barrett and Tom Westbrook in PORT MORESBY; Editing by John Mair, Robert Birsel)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/apec-summit/rpt-refile-update-5-apec-fails-to-reach-consensus-as-u-s-china-divide-deepens-idUKL4N1XT0SS,18 Nov 2018,"* Leaders fail to agree on communique for first time in APEC

2018-11-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp (PCG.N), facing investor concerns over its possible role in the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California, has reported another power-line outage that it experienced on the morning of Nov. 8 when the blaze started. The incident report, which was filed on Friday with the safety division of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), said a line near the area of Concow in Butte County suffered an outage at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 8. The information in the report is preliminary, according to a spokesman for PG&E, who said the company was cooperating with any investigations. The utility has said it could face liability that exceeds its insurance coverage if its equipment were found to have caused the Camp Fire. The cause of the blaze, which was 60 percent contained on Sunday, is under investigation. In a previous regulatory report, PG&E, which operates in the northern part of California, said it experienced an outage on a transmission line on the morning of Nov. 8 near the town of Pulga, near where the fire is thought to have started. Authorities were still searching for signs of the 1,276 people listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise. The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far in what is considered the state’s deadliest-ever wildfire. A CPUC spokesman confirmed that the agency received the second report on Friday, and said the incident would be incorporated into its investigation “to assess the compliance of electric facilities with applicable rules and regulations in fire impacted areas.” Investors are watching for clues about whether California’s government will step in to save PG&E should it eventually be found responsible for the fire and should any potential liability exceed the utility’s resources. CPUC President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. Similar comments from Picker a day earlier caused PG&E’s stock to surge in after-hours trading. The company’s stock had slumped more than 60 percent since the wildfire broke out, on fears that without help from California’s government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible.

2018-11-18,"ABUJA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari launched his manifesto on Sunday, hoping his anti-corruption agenda can win him a second term at a Feb. 16 election. Buhari, a military ruler in the early 1980s, in 2015 became the first opposition candidate to oust a president through the ballot box. His focus on corruption may be offset by Nigeria’s slow growth. The country emerged from its first recession in a quarter of a century - largely caused by low crude prices - last year. In his first term, Buhari ordered government revenues and funds recovered in corruption investigations to be placed in a central bank account known as the Treasury Single Account (TSA). That had protected government coffers from corruption when oil receipts - which make up two-thirds of revenues - were low, he said. “We are committed to deepening the work we started this first term such that the nation’s assets and resources continue to be organised and utilised to do good for the common man,” he said at the manifesto launch. Buhari said Nigeria had a chance to make “a break from its tainted past which favoured an opportunistic few”. Despite the president’s focus on tackling corruption, there have not been any significant convictions related to graft in his first term. The main opposition party has accused Buhari of focusing on its members, which the presidency denies. The campaign team of opposition candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, said Buhari’s manifesto was an “anti-climax” and did not address Nigerians’ economic problems. “If the state of the average Nigerian has not improved in the last three and a half years, more of the same is obviously not what they need,” it said in an emailed statement. Abubakar is expected to unveil his policy plans on Monday. The president set education as a policy priority, vowing to overhaul buildings and subjects taught at 10,000 schools in each year of the four-year term, and retrain teachers to focus on science, technology and mathematics. He said there was “scope for over 15 million new jobs” by expanding a nationwide vocational skills programme and improving access to credit for entrepreneurs and artisans.

2018-11-18,"(Updates with end of controlled power cuts) JOHANNESBURG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom cut 1,000 megawatts of electricity from the strained national power grid on Sunday after high unplanned outages, a company spokesman said. The controlled power cuts - locally known as load-shedding - started at 1015 GMT and were scheduled to end at 2000 GMT, but stopped earlier than planned, Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said on Twitter. “Eskom has managed to bring some power generating units back to service, resulting in the improvement of the power system,” Phasiwe said. Eskom had implemented stage 1 controlled power cuts that shed up to 1,000 MW from the grid. The power cuts are implemented to prevent the grid from being overwhelmed after unplanned outages. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power, last week warned of potential outages amid low coal inventories after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection.

2018-11-18,"(Corrects to remove reference to Sacramento in paragraph 13) By Terray Sylvester PARADISE, Calif., Nov 18 (Reuters) - Authorities sifted through the charred wreckage of California’s deadliest ever wildfire on Sunday, searching for any signs of the 1,276 people now listed as missing after the Camp Fire tore through the mountain town of Paradise. The remains of 76 people have been recovered so far, 63 of whom have been tentatively identified pending DNA confirmation. Early on Sunday the blaze, which ignited on Nov. 8, was 60 percent contained, officials said, up from 55 percent Saturday. Rain is forecast for the area this week, potentially helping douse the blazes but raising the risk of floods and mudslides, adding to the misery of 46,000 people under evacuation orders. On Saturday, two forensic anthropologists for the University of Nevada, Reno, were helping firefighters sort through the wreckage at a mobile home park for senior citizens in Paradise. Firefighters peeled back the metal sheet of a collapsed roof as the anthropologists picked up visibly charred bone fragments, sorting them into paper bags. Roger Fielding, chief deputy coroner with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, said that each site was treated as a crime scene, with every step of recovery documented with photographs. “Our job is to pick up any items that might reflect who this person might be,” he said. Besides the toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it the most destructive in California history, posing the additional challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents. Up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain is expected to fall from late Tuesday through Friday in the Sierra foothills, the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center said. Rain will also drop on San Francisco, helping to clear the air filled with unhealthy levels of smoke from the Camp Fire about 175 miles (280 km) to the north. Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said the rain will be a “one-two-punch.” “It’ll bring much needed relief to the firefighters and to the air quality, but there’s a potential for dangerous mudslides wherever vegetation is burned away on slopes and hills,” he said. Up to 2 inches of rain is also expected to fall on southern California this week, where the Woolsey Fire claimed at least three lives, Burke said. California fire officials said on Sunday morning that the Woolsey Fire was 88 percent contained and that full containment will occur on Thanksgiving Thursday. On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump visited Paradise and the scene of the Woolsey Fire. Trump has blamed the recent spate of fires on forest mismanagement, and he said he discussed the issue with California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom.

2018-11-18,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey warned energy companies on Sunday against working with the Greek Cypriot government in carrying out exploratory drilling in the eastern Mediterranean, saying such activities could damage regional stability. The eastern Mediterranean is believed to be rich in natural gas, and attempts to tap resources there have revived tensions between Turkey and Greece, which has a defence pact with the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government. Turkey and Cyprus have overlapping claims of marine jurisdiction and both plan to carry out exploratory drilling this year. Ankara has diplomatic relations only with a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the island that no other country recognises. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said exploratory drilling by Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in the eastern Mediterranean with permission from the Greek Cypriot government did not help regional stability and would “upset some sensitive balances”. “We renew our warnings to companies participating in the Greek Cypriots’ one-sided exploration and drilling. We remind them that sharing the natural resources of the island of Cyprus relates to the core of the Cyprus issue,” Aksoy said in a statement. “In addition to our own continental shelf, we will start carrying out activities in areas where the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has given (state-run oil company) Turk Petrolleri a license,” he said. Last month, Turkey complained that a Greek frigate had hounded a Turkish exploration ship west of Cyprus. Greece denied the charge and Cyprus accused Turkey of stirring tension. Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Ankara, says any offshore wealth also belongs to its citizens, as partners in the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.
