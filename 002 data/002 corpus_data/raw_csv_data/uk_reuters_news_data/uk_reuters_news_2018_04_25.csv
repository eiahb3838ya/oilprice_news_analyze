2018-04-25,"(Adds details from results, context) MEXICO CITY, April 25 (Reuters) - Mexican chemicals and plastic pipe maker Mexichem posted a 52 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on Wednesday, compared to the year-earlier quarter, boosted by higher profitability in its vinyl unit. The company said its net profit jumped to $78.9 million in the quarter, compared to $51.9 million in the first three months of 2017. It is vinyl products unit earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rise 81 percent, partly thanks to better conditions in the PVC market, the company said. Revenue rose to $1.76 billion from $1.39 billion a year earlier. The company, which set ambitious growth targets for 2018, has seen its shares rise by almost one-fifth so far this year. Those targets are partly because of its recently-closed purchase of Israeli drip irrigation pioneer Netafim, which hopes to see its earnings rise 50 percent by 2020. Most analysts have a buy rating on Mexichem, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2018-04-25,"(Adds context, no comment from PDVSA) By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON, April 25 (Reuters) - An international arbitration court has ordered Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA to pay ConocoPhillips $2.04 billion for early dissolution of two joint ventures for producing oil in the OPEC-member country, the U.S. firm said on Wednesday. Conoco’s assets in Venezuela were expropriated in 2007 following a nationalization of the country’s oil industry led by late President Hugo Chavez. The firm left the nation after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA. The arbitration decision, released by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which has no means of enforcing its decisions, is considered by the U.S. company a first step in a series of legal actions to receive compensation for the expropriation of its assets in Venezuela. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuela’s cash-constrained economy, almost completely dependent on oil exports, is in the grip of deep recession with hyperinflation and severe shortages of medicine and food. Its ability to pay has also been hurt by U.S. sanctions imposed on the country and PDVSA. Conoco said it would pursue enforcement and seek financial recovery of its award but did not elaborate. Other companies seeking compensation from Venezuela have tried to enforce awards through various foreign courts. “The ruling upholds the contractual protections to which ConocoPhillips is entitled,” said Janet Langford Carrig, the Houston-based company’s general counsel who called the expropriation “unlawful.” Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for the broken contracts and loss of future profits from the Hamaca and Petrozuata oil projects. The agreements with PDVSA had price formulas that limited the compensation Conoco could claim. A separate arbitration case by Conoco against Venezuela before the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) introduced in 2007 could issue a final decision later this year, a lawyer close to the case said. A partial decision by ICSID in 2013, which declared the takeover unlawful, is considered by Conoco a “positive step” toward receiving more compensation for its Venezuela assets. ExxonMobil Corp, also brought two separate arbitration claims before ICSID and the ICC following the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela. The company last year sought to enforce a $1.6 billion ICSID award after an annulment committee threw out nearly all of the arbitration decision that concerned one of two projects, reducing the payout to $188.3 million.

2018-04-25,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Chevron asked other employees to avoid the facilities of its joint venture with the OPEC nation’s oil firm, the sources said. The arrests, in a raid by national intelligence officers, were the first at a foreign oil firm since Venezuela’s government launched a purge last fall that has resulted in detentions of more than 80 executives at PDVSA and business partners accused of corruption. The Chevron workers may face charges of treason for refusing to sign a supply contract for furnace parts drawn up by PDVSA executives, Reuters reported earlier this week. The workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, linked the Chevron arrests to the government anti-corruption probe for the first time on Wednesday. “In our oil industry and in its relationships with other countries, there has been corruption,” Arreaza said at a news conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York that was broadcast on Venezuela state television. “The decisions of the prosecutor’s office are based on serious investigations to fight corruption ... These two people involved have the right to defence and due process.” Of Chevron’s evacuation of executives, Arreaza said: “The logical decision would be to turn themselves over to authorities and demonstrate their innocence ... not to flee.” Chevron spokeswoman Isabel Ordonez responded to the minister’s comments with a written statement that the firm “abides by a code of business ethics, under which we comply with all applicable U.S. and Venezuelan laws.” Chevron’s move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores the how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through Venezuela’s accelerating political and economic meltdown. The affected staff numbers about 30 people in the coastal city of Puerto la Cruz.  Chevron’s Ordonez said the company had an executive team overseeing operations in Venezuela but declined to provide details on the leadership there or the number and type of workers the company had withdrawn. Last week, the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, who are represented by Chevron lawyers. Chevron has no plans to exit the country, according to a person familiar with the thinking of its board of directors. The oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past, the person said - citing the jailing of employees in Indonesia in 2013 - and the firm believes Venezuela will eventually stabilise. Chevron, the world’s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the OPEC-member nation. The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year, to $329 million (£236 million), according to regulatory filings. The arrests mark an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures’ governance, sources familiar with the dispute told Reuters.  Outside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas. If their executives sign contracts without following their companies’ due process rules, they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption. If they don’t sign, they stoke tension with their partners at PDVSA, which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures. Companies evaluating an exit from Venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil, according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in Venezuela. But continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses, taking massive write-downs - and, now, the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. PDVSA’s deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, according to official data reported to OPEC. Venezuela’s oil output so far this year is at a 33-year low. The falling production and arrests of PDVSA executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after Maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience, Major General Manuel Quevedo, as the nation’s oil minister and president of PDVSA. Several of Chevron’s foreign staff and some local executives and their families left Venezuela starting last week after the arrests, the four sources familiar with their departures told Reuters. They described the situation as temporary, and said executives may return if proposed talks between Chevron and PDVSA to resolve the dispute are successful. Chevron executives have had high-level meetings with Venezuelan government officials this week, said two of the people familiar with the matter. Chevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) in Venezuela in 2007, when the government of then-President Hugo Chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. “No company can leave because it would lose the assets,” said a former negotiator of Exxon’s 2007 exit from Venezuela. “At this point, there are just a few options.”      Chevron employees remaining in Venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management, according to interviews with employees and family members. The arrested Chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil production and processing project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron. Chevron has asked employees assigned to Petropiar to temporarily work from the firm’s Puerto la Cruz office rather than show up at its partner’s oil production and processing facilities, according to one person familiar with the situation. The two men had refused to sign a multi-million dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by Petropiar, according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute. Such decrees, which skip competitive bidding, have been cited by Venezuelan and U.S. prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases.  Algarra and Vasquez are now being held in a detention centre in Barcelona run by Venezuela’s intelligence unit, known as Sebin. Coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided, a person familiar with the matter said.  Several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their Venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations, keeping only a skeletal staff in the country.  Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC) took a pre-tax charge of about $1 billion on its Venezuelan assets in the prior quarter. Italy’s ENI said it was owed 500 million euros ($615 million) in delinquent payments from PDVSA last year. Service provider Schlumberger (SLB.N) wrote down its Venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by $938 million. Halliburton (HAL.N) earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country, adding a $312 million charge on top of $647 million in charges last year.   Other international oil firms, including France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated. “I can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power, lack of water,” said Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne last week at an oil summit in Paris. The company would maintain a presence there, however, on the hope the crisis would ease. “It is important to stay in a country even in difficult times,” Pouyanne said, “because people will remember it.”  Reporting by Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer and Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Gary McWilliams, Simon Webb and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-chevron/insight-chevron-evacuates-venezuela-executives-following-staff-arrests-idUKL1N1S21VN,25 Apr 2018,"U.S. oil major Chevron Corp has

2018-04-25,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday despite data showing rising U.S. inventories, holding within sight of three-year highs reached the previous day on geopolitical tensions including the prospect of fresh sanctions on Iran. French President Emmanuel Macron forcefully challenged many of the U.S. president’s policies during a visit to Washington, saying an international nuclear deal with Iran, which President Donald Trump has harshly criticized, was not perfect but must remain in place until a replacement is forged. Trump will decide by May 12 whether to restore U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which could be a first step to ending the deal. The market was also supported by concerns around oil output from Venezuela. U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to four sources familiar with the matter. “The geopolitical risk in the market has a pretty high premium,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy. “Even with this week’s Department of Energy numbers it hasn’t shaken any of the confidence that the global supply and demand balance continue to tighten.” Brent crude LCOc1 settled 14 cents higher at $74.00 a barrel, below the November 2014 intraday high of $75.47 reached on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures CLc1 ended up 35 cents at $68.05 a barrel. The market rebounded quickly from a dip after bearish U.S. inventory data because the build was not as large as it could have been, given the jump in exports, McGillian said.  Crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 2.2 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a 2 million-barrel draw. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub USOICC=ECI rose 459,000 barrels, EIA said. A rise in U.S. government borrowing costs to their highest since 2013 this week has tempered some investor appetite for risk, but analysts said Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, may yet rise toward new 2018 peaks above $75 a barrel. Supplier cutbacks, steady demand growth, geopolitical tensions and a favorable structure in the futures market have attracted record investment in oil this year. Money managers hold record positions in Brent crude futures and options, lured by the hefty premium of the front-month June contract over subsequent months that makes it profitable to invest in crude over the longer term.  “The prospect of a downside correction in prices is lost on the speculative fraternity. In fact, financial players have rarely felt more optimistic. Bets on rising crude prices are close to a near-record high,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said. “However, given the already vast holdings of long positions in oil, there are doubts over the scope for further inflows.” The forward curve for Brent <0#LCO:> is now above $70 until the end of 2018, and prices are above $60 through 2020.  But the rise in U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent has driven the dollar .DXY to three-month highs, making oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This might eventually pressure crude prices, even though oil and the dollar have moved in tandem for a few weeks.

2018-04-25,"SAO PAULO, April 25 (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA has given up on the idea of selling its Brazilian liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) unit through an initial public offering (IPO) and decided to reopen a sale process, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The state-controlled oil company has not yet set a date for interested companies to deliver bids and is still discussing the best way to avoid problems with antitrust authorities, the sources added, asking for anonymity because talks are private. Petrobras, as the company is known, has sounded out banks and investors for a potential IPO of Liquigas Distribuidora SA, but advisers said it would be a hard sell, especially to international investors, according to the sources. Liquigas sells gas cylinders, used mainly for cooking in Brazilian households not served by gas pipelines — a segment unfamiliar to investors in more developed markets. Petrobras had agreed to sell the subsidiary to a unit of Ultrapar Participações SA in 2016 for 2.8 billion reais ($800 million), but Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade blocked the deal. Ultragaz, a unit of Ultrapar, is Brazil’s largest LPG distributor and Liquigas is the second biggest. In talks with banks, Petrobras has discussed how to structure the sale process without triggering antitrust issues. The easiest solution would be a sale to foreign buyers with similar businesses, such as Turkey’s Aygaz AS or Chile’s Empresas Copec SA, sources said. Some of the Brazilian rivals that bid for the asset are still interested, such as Copagaz Distribuidora de Gas. But a sale to a Brazilian rival would be trickier, and some representatives of Brazilian companies have been lobbying Petrobras to break up the subsidiary before the sale, one of the sources said. A third option would be to require proposals that already include remedies for potential antitrust concerns. So far, no decision has been taken, the sources added. Petrobras responded to a request for comment by referring to a previous securities filing in which it said details of the deal had not been defined. Copagaz, Aygaz and Copec did not immediately comment on the matter. $1 = 3.50 reais

2018-04-25,"* Supply chain to North American users is short, conflict-free * Refinery could be working in 1-to-2 years’ time * Iron Creek, Idaho, could be producing in 3-to-4 years’ time By Barbara Lewis LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Canada’s First Cobalt, which has just bought another cobalt developer, is keen for more acquisitions to accelerate bringing on production to meet North American demand, a senior company official said. Expectations of soaring demand for cobalt because of its use in electric vehicles has inspired a hunt for the mineral across the globe. Governments and miners are anxious to secure supplies in more stable jurisdictions than Democratic Republic of Congo, which holds around half of the world’s reserves. First Cobalt wants to develop U.S. and Canadian resources, which are smaller, but close to end-users, including the car industry. Frank Santaguida, First Cobalt’s vice president for exploration, said on the sidelines of a Canadian mining conference in London the company was “absolutely” working on more deals. “A pipeline of projects is what’s necessary to really move forward and to continually assess the best things to develop,” he said. “We’re looking at smaller things in Idaho,” he told Reuters in an interview. “It’s about having prospects to look at.” The world’s major cobalt producing companies are led by Glencore and China Molybdenum, operating in Democratic Republic of Congo. North America mined cobalt in the past, but no company is currently producing there. First Cobalt describes itself as the largest cobalt exploration company by market capitalisation, which will be nearly 400 million Canadian dollars ($311 million) once its merger with U.S. Cobalt is completed. Santaguida said that should be by the end of May. The deal adds U.S. Cobalt’s exploration properties in Idaho and Utah to First Cobalt’s 50 mining properties in Cobalt, Ontario, which include a permitted cobalt refinery. The U.S. Cobalt acquisition was needed, Santaguida said, to get to a size to attract bigger investors, tolerant of the spending levels necessary to accelerate production. Santaguida estimated it would take a year or two to get its mothballed cobalt refinery running again. “Cobalt demand is now. Predictions are it will last for about 10 years at least, so it is about getting to that early production,” he said. The quickest way could be to use piles of unprocessed rock, which have already been mined. After that, the Iron Creek project in Idaho, acquired in the merger deal, could be producing cobalt in three to four years’ time, Santaguida said. $1 = 1.2861 Canadian dollars

2018-04-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) has reached a $33.5 million (24 million pounds) settlement with Maryland over state claims related to the German automaker’s excess emissions, court documents show. Volkswagen previously agreed to spend more than $750 million to resolve various state environmental and consumer claims in the United States. In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The Maryland settlement includes a $29 million cash payment and another $4.5 million payment if Volkswagen does not use a Maryland-based port facility for some logistical operations over five years. Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said in an interview Wednesday that the state had received benefits valued at nearly twice the value per vehicle as states that settled collectively with Volkswagen in 2016. Frosh said the settlement sends a “clear message to auto manufacturers that violating laws designed to protect our environment and the health of our citizens is unacceptable and will result in harsh penalties.” He called VW’s conduct “outrageous.” Volkswagen must also introduce three additional battery electric vehicle models in Maryland, including the currently available e-Golf or its successor or replacement models through 2019, a provision it previously agreed to with the state of California. Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan called the agreement  an “important step forward for Volkswagen in resolving legacy exposure to state and local environmental claims related to the diesel matter in the United States.” She added that “following a recent federal court ruling, we consider the few remaining environmental claims pending in state courts to be preempted by federal law.” Last week, a U.S. judge dismissed environmental lawsuits filed against Volkswagen over excess diesel emissions by Salt Lake County, Utah and Hillsborough County, Florida. A Maryland judge must still approve the settlement.

2018-04-25,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp (HES.N) reported its 14th consecutive quarterly loss on Wednesday, though results beat Wall Street’s expectations as it cut expenses and benefited from a rise in oil prices CLc1. The company said it was working to turn operations around and boost returns. Hess has been cutting costs, reducing debt and ramping up its share buyback under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. “Our focus for 2018 is on execution and we believe we are off to a very strong start to the year,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement. Shares of the New York-based company, which operates in North Dakota and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, rose about 1.5 percent to $58.52 in afternoon trading. Net loss attributable to Hess narrowed to $106 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $324 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, the loss was 27 cents per share, while analysts on average had expected a loss of 49 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net production fell to 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from 311,000 boepd a year earlier. However the company exceeded its forecast as production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale increased 12 percent. Production had been expected to be lower in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to a shutdown of the Enchilada platform following a fire. For the year, Hess expects production of 245,000 to 255,000 boepd.  Total costs in the quarter fell 11.6 percent to $1.38 billion, from a year earlier. The company’s average realized price of crude oil jumped 22 percent to $59.32 per barrel. In Guyana, where Hess is a minority partner in an oil project with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), first oil production is still expected by 2020, with two subsequent projects coming online by 2022 and 2023 or 2024, executives said on a conference call with investors.

2018-04-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Interior minister Amber Rudd said on Wednesday she deeply regretted failing to realise there was a widespread problem that some Caribbean immigrants who have lived legally in Britain for decades were being labelled illegal immigrants. Rudd told a parliamentary committee she had known about the problem for months and said officials were still checking how many people had been detained over their supposed immigration status. “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner,” Rudd said. “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than individual cases that had gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.” Thousands of people from the so-called “Windrush generation” were invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, but some of them and their descendants have been caught out by tighter immigration rules. The issue has created anger in Britain after it was revealed some of these migrants have been made homeless, lost their jobs, threatened with deportation and denied benefits, raising awkward questions about how the pursuit of lower immigration sits alongside the desire to be an outward-looking global economy. The crisis has focussed attention on the role of Prime Minister Theresa May, who as interior minister set out to create a “really hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, imposing tough new requirements in 2012 for people to prove their legal status.  Rudd told the committee there was no evidence that any of these migrants had been kicked out of Britain as a result of the scandal after officials examined 8,000 deportation records dating back almost two decades. But she admitted her department still had no idea how many migrants have been wrongly detained by immigration authorities - like the grandmother Paulette Wilson, who spent a week in detention after being told she was in Britain illegally. Earlier, the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Rudd to resign for a “cruel and misdirected” immigration policy that he said was responsible for the hardships faced by the Windrush generation. “The current (interior minister) inherited a failing policy and made it worse. Isn’t it time she took responsibility and resigned?” he said.

2018-04-25,"NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - After losing ground and underperforming the broad market in 2017, U.S. energy shares are climbing fast with oil prices and gaining attention from investors who think the trend may hold. Oil prices are near their highest since late 2014 thanks to strong demand and supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia. This will support energy earnings growth, investors and strategists say, particularly for companies involved in exploration and production. Forecasters expected first-quarter earnings for the sector would be up about 69 percent from a year ago, the highest percentage gain of any S&P 500 sector, according to Thomson Reuters data. The exploration and production group was projected to have the biggest year-over-year increase. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 are up 7.5 percent since the start of April, compared with a 0.4 percent decline in the overall S&P 500. Results from energy companies this earnings season could put recent share gains to the test. The big integrated names, Exxon Mobil and Chevron are due to report results Friday, while ConocoPhillips is due Thursday along with and refiner Valero Energy. Results from Apache, more focused on exploration and production, are due next week. Energy shares in general have not caught up with rising oil prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading around $68 a barrel, up about 4 percent for the month so far and roughly 12 percent year to date. “The stock prices are still not reflecting the earnings power that’s likely to show up here in this quarter and for the year as a whole,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which has been overweight the energy sector. “Energy prices are more than likely to stabilize here between the $60 and $70 range as opposed to the prior range of $50 to $60.” The S&P energy index, despite its recent sharp gains, is up just 0.5 percent since Dec. 31. In 2017, the energy index declined 3.8 percent versus a 19.4 percent gain in the S&P 500. Other investors are recommending ways to bet on energy. At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York this week, billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach said investors should consider a trade that includes betting on gains in an exchange-traded fund that tracks oil and gas explorers and producers who could benefit from rising inflation. To be sure, oil prices can be volatile, and prices have risen enough to worry some government and business leaders that energy costs could crimp economic growth. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said OPEC had sent prices to levels that were “artificially Very High!” This led to a brief dip in oil prices. Also, the jump in energy shares has driven up the sector’s valuations, though some strategists say levels are not worrisome yet. Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy for RBC, said in a recent note the sector “continues to be in the middle innings of a rotation back in,” and that “valuations don’t worry us.” With the recent price gains, energy sector multiples are above those of the overall S&P 500. The S&P 500 energy sector is trading at 19.6 times forward earnings, compared with 16.5 times for the S&P 500, based on Thomson Reuters data. RBC Capital Markets reiterated its “overweight” recommendation first made in January, while Credit Suisse upgraded its recommendation on energy to “market weight” from “underweight” last month, and its strategists cited strong earnings growth along with a robust global economy as factors. Shares of early reporter Hess Corp, an E&P company, rose 1.8 percent on Wednesday after it reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, thanks to expense cuts and the rise in oil prices.

2018-04-25,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) expects Canada’s railways to be able to carry more oil in the second half of this year, easing transport bottlenecks and allowing it to stick to previous annual forecasts.  Cenovus, one of the biggest of Canada’s oil sands producers, said in March that it was operating at lower capacity due to the maxing out of pipelines and other routes through which it sends heavy oil south to U.S. markets. Analysts had wondered if that would threaten its previous targets for the full year, but Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix played down any danger and shares rose 6 percent in response. “Despite the temporary pullback in production in the first quarter, we still expect our oil sands volumes for the year to be within our original guidance of 364,000 to 382,000 barrels per day,” he told a conference call with analysts. “I’m really confident that as we move into the second half this year and into the first half of 2019, we’re going to be seeing very material volumes of oil moving by rail,” he added. Railways are producers’ second best option for hauling crude to the United States after pipelines but have so far been reluctant to sign the short-term contracts the oil industry favors.  Pourbaix said that railway operators have hired and are training crew to handle crude shipments and have “indicated that  they’re reactivating a fair amount of locomotives.” The transport bottlenecks have increased the discount buyers take for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude CLc1 and Cenovus said its differentials averaged $24.28 per barrel in the first quarter, a 67 percent jump when compared with last year. That in turn hurt profit per barrel. Netbacks, profit after subtracting transport and other expenses, averaged C$16.80 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with C$21.25 a year earlier. Cenovus’ total oil sands production, however, jumped to 359,666 barrels per day in the quarter, from 181,501 barrels per day, a year earlier. “Investor attention increasingly appears to be migrating toward a much more constructive 2019 outlook,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Cox. The company posted a loss of C$914 million ($711 million), or 74 Canadian cents per share. Adjusting for some operations the company shut, the quarterly loss was 40 Canadian cents per share, while analysts on average expected a loss of 16 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were trading at C$12.89 Wednesday afternoon, up 5.74 percent.

2018-04-25,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian military pilot Mykola Volkozub could barely move under the weight of a lead vest meant to protect him from radiation as he prepared for his first flight over the Chernobyl reactor after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986.  Remembering the incident still brings tears to the eyes of Volkozub, who survived the risk of radiation poisoning to live to a ripe age of 86 and still supervises test pilots for Antonov, a state-run aircraft manufacturer.  Volkozub was deployed in a team of two pilots, an engineer and a scientist, to fly an MI-8 helicopter over the reactor to measure the temperature and composition of gases inside. Thursday marks the 32th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine, caused by a botched safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant that sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe. The accident killed dozens right away and forced tens of thousands to flee. The final death toll of those killed by radiation-related illnesses such as cancer is subject to debate. Speaking ahead of the anniversary, Volkozub called it “a planet-sized tragedy” and recalls agreeing to fly the mission despite knowing his life would be at risk.  “For some reason, I thought I would feel bad if something happened to someone else there and I am not there. That’s why I took such a decision immediately,” he told Reuters in the hangar at an Antonov factory, where he has worked for 23 years. Volkozub was awarded a ‘Hero of Ukraine’ medal for his efforts. After performing three flights which lasted for 19 minutes 40 seconds in total, Volkozub was exposed to such a high dose of radiation that some dosimeters went haywire when he tried to measure his exposure.  The helicopter was also exposed to radiation and had to be buried at a so-called cemetery for decommissioned equipment, something he recalls with tears in his eyes. “I landed there, near (the site). And when I left the place, I felt very sorry for the helicopter. It seemed to me it had not failed me, but I had to throw it away,” he said.  Right after his third flight on May 10, 1986, Volkozub was sent to Moscow for medical tests. He remembered how nurses, afraid of contamination, pushed food towards him with the help of a long stick to avoid physical interaction with him.

2018-04-25,"April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to four sources familiar with the matter. Chevron asked other employees to avoid the facilities of its joint venture with the OPEC nation’s oil firm, the sources said. The arrests, in a raid by national intelligence officers, were the first at a foreign oil firm since Venezuela’s government launched a purge last fall that has resulted in detentions of more than 80 executives at PDVSA and business partners. The Chevron workers may face charges of treason for refusing to sign a supply contract for furnace parts drawn up by PDVSA executives, Reuters reported earlier this week. The workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids. Chevron’s move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores the how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through Venezuela’s accelerating political and economic meltdown. The affected staff numbers about 30 people in the coastal city of Puerto la Cruz, although it is unclear how many people Chevron has already removed from the country. Asked about the departures, Chevron on Tuesday declined to comment on what it called “personnel matters.” Last week, the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, who are represented by Chevron lawyers. Neither PDVSA nor the government’s Information Ministry responded to requests for comment. The public prosecutor’s office, which has not publicly announced any charges against the Chevron employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chevron has no plans to exit the country, according to a company employee familiar with the thinking of its board of directors. The oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past, the person said - citing the jailing of employees in Indonesia in 2013 - and the firm believes Venezuela will eventually stabilize. Chevron, the world’s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the OPEC-member nation. The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year, to $329 million, according to regulatory filings. The arrests mark an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures’ governance, sources familiar with the dispute told Reuters. Outside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas. If their executives sign contracts without following their companies’ due process rules, they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption. If they don’t sign, they stoke tension with their partners at PDVSA, which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures. Companies evaluating an exit from Venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil, according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in Venezuela. But continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses, taking massive write-downs - and, now, the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. PDVSA’s deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, according to official data reported to OPEC. Venezuela’s oil output so far this year is at a 33-year low. The falling production and arrests of PDVSA executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after Maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience, Major General Manuel Quevedo, as the nation’s oil minister and president of PDVSA. Several of Chevron’s foreign staff and some local executives and their families left Venezuela starting last week after the arrests, the four sources familiar with their departures told Reuters. They described the situation as temporary, and said executives may return if proposed talks between Chevron and PDVSA to resolve the dispute are successful. Chevron executives have had high-level meetings with Venezuelan government officials this week, said two of the people familiar with the matter. Chevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips in Venezuela in 2007, when the government of then-President Hugo Chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. “No company can leave because it would lose the assets,” said a former negotiator of Exxon’s 2007 exit from Venezuela. “At this point, there are just a few options.” Chevron employees remaining in Venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management, according to interviews with employees and family members. The arrested Chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil production and processing project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron. Chevron has asked employees assigned to Petropiar to temporarily work from the firm’s Puerto la Cruz office rather than show up at its partner’s oil production and processing facilities, according to one person familiar with the situation. The two men had refused to sign a multi-million dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by Petropiar, according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute. Such decrees, which skip competitive bidding, have been cited by Venezuelan and U.S. prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases. Algarra and Vasquez are now being held in a detention center in Barcelona run by Venezuela’s intelligence unit, known as Sebin. Coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided, a person familiar with the matter said. Several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their Venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations, keeping only a skeletal staff in the country. Spain’s Repsol took a pre-tax charge of about $1 billion on its Venezuelan assets in the prior quarter. Italy’s ENI said it was owed 500 million euros ($615 million) in delinquent payments from PDVSA last year. Service provider Schlumberger wrote down its Venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by $938 million. Halliburton earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country, adding a $312 million charge on top of $647 million in charges last year. Other international oil firms, including France’s Total SA , have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated. “I can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power, lack of water,” said Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne last week at an oil summit in Paris. The company would maintain a presence there, however, on the hope the crisis would ease. “It is important to stay in a country even in difficult times,” Pouyanne said, “because people will remember it.” Reporting by Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer and Ernest

2018-04-25,"(Adds details on exports, crude prices, comments) By David Gaffen April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories unexpectedly rose last week even as exports hit record highs, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday in an overall bearish report that raised some concerns about oversupply. Crude inventories rose 2.2 million barrels in the week to April 20, compared with expectations for a decrease of 2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks grew by 840,000 barrels, versus forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 625,000-barrel drop. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 43,000 barrels per day as exports rose nearly 600,000 bpd to a record 2.3 million bpd, according to the EIA data. Combined exports of crude and petroleum products also hit a weekly record at 8.3 million bpd, of which more than 6 million bpd was from products like gasoline and diesel fuel. Exports of distillate inventories have been strong of late, draining inventories on the East Coast, a traditional parking spot for distillates like jet fuel. “The builds in crude oil and gasoline inventories are obviously negative, but soaring crude oil and gasoline exports cut against those data points,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose by 459,000 barrels, EIA said. After initial losses on the release of the data, U.S. crude futures rebounded and pared losses, trading down 4 cents at $67.66 a barrel by 10:57 a.m. EDT (1457 GMT). Brent was off 35 cents to $73.50 a barrel. Refinery crude runs fell by 328,000 bpd and utilization rates fell by 1.6 percentage points to 90.8 percent of total capacity, EIA data showed. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 2.6 million barrels, versus expectations for a 861,000-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Overall U.S. crude production continued to grow, rising last week to 10.59 million bpd - though the weekly figures are less reliable than monthly data that, as of February, still had the United States producing a shade under 10 million bpd. “U.S. production is going to continue to rise throughout the rest of the year. And also I think OPEC is close to done with their cuts,” said Phillip Streible, analyst at RJO Futures in Chicago, who said oil could test $65 a barrel in the near-future.

2018-04-25,"FRANKFURT, April 25 (Reuters) - German auto supplier Robert Bosch announced on Wednesday a new code of conduct for staff and improved exhaust control technology, as it strives to draw a line under an emissions scandal that has tarnished the diesel car industry. Prosecutors in Stuttgart are probing several car brands and supplier Bosch for their suspected roles in using an engine control unit, EDC17, to cheat exhaust emissions tests. Volkswagen used the unit in its EA189 diesel engine, which was found in 2015 to artificially throttle back real-world pollution levels during a regulatory test cycle, triggering a global crackdown on carmakers and toxic pollution. Earlier this month, prosecutors seized an unknown number of files at Volkswagen’s sportscar brands Porsche and Audi. Chief Financial Officer Stefan Asenkerschbaumer said on Wednesday Bosch had set aside 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to cover potential risks stemming from antitrust probes and an investigation into diesel emissions cheating. That is up slightly from the 1.1 billion euros announced last year. The Stuttgart-based auto supplier also said it would teach 70,000 staff a new code of conduct for developers by the end of this year in an effort to change the “mindset” of the company. As part of the new rules, it will be forbidden to permit the installation of functions that automatically help a vehicle recognise when it is being subjected to an emissions test, and Bosch products are not allowed to be tweaked to help a manufacturer pass a test, the company said. “We view the principles as a way to guide and motivate our engineers,” Bosch said. Using software, some Volkswagen cars could detect when they were being subjected to an emissions test and increase the effectiveness of exhaust filtering systems to temporarily keep emissions within legal limits. Bosch has said manufacturers, not suppliers, are legally responsible for ensuring vehicles obtain road certification by legal means. It has said it takes allegations of engine manipulation “very seriously” and is fully cooperating with authorities. Bosch also said on Wednesday it had developed a new exhaust emissions treatment technology that cuts pollution from health-threatening nitrogen oxides (NOx) to 13 milligrams per kilometre, well below the current legal limit of 120 milligrams. The new system costs roughly the same as a sophisticated exhaust filter system included in high-end diesel vehicles, Bosch said. “This breakthrough offers the opportunity to shift the heated debate over diesel into new territory and, hopefully, bring it to a close.” Electric cars will not become a mass market phenomenon until at least 2020, Bosch said. “Until electromobility breaks through to the mass market, we will still need these highly efficient combustion engines,” Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said. $1 = 0.8208 euros

2018-04-25," LONDON (Reuters) - World markets entered 2018 speculating that the most synchronized global economic expansion in a decade was about to overheat but growth has since proved underwhelming. While missile strikes and threats of a global trade war have hogged the headlines, it’s an unexpected loss of economic momentum, particularly in Europe, that has frightened investors who played down political risks for years and stayed firmly focused on brisk economic growth and rising corporate profits. The recent surge in oil prices, adding inflation to the economic mix, may also weigh further on markets assessing whether a slowdown is afoot, or if the first quarter was merely a soft patch before the boom resumes. “For the first time in 18 months, markets no longer have the protective shield of growth momentum,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, who so far considers the soft economic data an air pocket. “There is not enough evidence to say this is the beginning of the end, yet if you look at fundamentals, there is deterioration relative to last year, no question about that.” Big multilateral forecasters remain broadly optimistic. The International Monetary Fund predicts robust 3.9 percent growth for 2018 and next year, though it too warned last week of risks from trade tensions or the waning impact of U.S. tax cuts. (For a graphic showing Global economic growth, click here: reut.rs/2KeDwYj) Data this week showed euro zone business morale worsened further in April, while German authorities have cut growth forecasts after business confidence hit its lowest level in more than a year. U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data due on Friday is predicted by the latest Reuters polls to show a 2.2 percent expansion, down from a forecast in March of 2.6 percent growth. Adding to investors’ concerns are warnings from companies such heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. (CAT.N), which said on Tuesday its forecast-beating first-quarter profits and sales were probably a high watermark for the year. Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, told clients equities would continue to do well but he predicted lower returns and higher volatility than in 2017, partly because there was “less room for growth to top expectations.” So where, besides Europe’s faltering Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs), are concerns about growth evident? Perhaps most illustrative are government bonds in Western countries where yield curves, the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, have inexorably narrowed all year - a fairly reliable indicator of growth pessimism. Some of the curve flattening has reversed slightly after the oil price jump increased inflation worries and lifted long-term yields. But the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year yields remains almost 30 basis points below the highs hit this year. (For a graphic showing the U.S. yield curve, click here: reut.rs/2K9D7q3)  “I don’t think the curve is telling us anything different from other indicators,” Pictet’s Paolini said. “It’s telling you that over the next one to two years there is reason to be cautious.” Shipping market bellwether, the Baltic Dry Freight Index .BADI, fell to eight-month lows this month and while it has rebounded in recent days, it is still 20 percent off its December highs. Copper, another growth barometer, has come off four-year highs hit late in 2017 CMCU3. (For a graphic showing Copper prices fall in 2018, click here: reut.rs/2JijDys) Then there are indexes that estimate how much pessimism or optimism is priced into markets, based on how often data beat or miss forecasts, and by how much. Perhaps the most closely watched is Citi’s Economic Surprise Index, which has slumped into the red after hitting 7-1/2-year highs at the end of 2017. (For a graphic showing the Economic Surprise Index, click here: reut.rs/2KcD0dt) And finally, equities. After a record 15-month winning streak, world stocks are 7 percent below end-January highs .MIWD00000PUS. (For a graphic showing Attempting recovery? Click here: reut.rs/2KcaKHT) Even more telling, U.S. shares in so-called defensive sectors such as telecoms and utilities have modestly outperformed cyclicals such as technology stocks since mid-March, Morgan Stanley analysts said last week. Defensive stocks usually fare better during downturns while cyclicals thrive in booms. The slight shift may indicate, “economic growth is likely peaking not accelerating at this point in this cycle”, Morgan Stanley told clients. What if markets are reading it wrong? Most still believe that while growth has stuttered rather than roared into 2018, a powerful expansion continues nonetheless. Seasonal adjustments after a long and severe Northern hemisphere winter, early Easter holidays and China’s New Year, may also be to blame. Barclays, for instance, believes U.S. growth did lose steam in the first quarter and has downgraded its forecasts. But it sees “residual seasonality” also playing a role. Even though the U.S. government’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has adjusted its methodology to account for seasonal factors, they still cause weak reported growth in the first quarter each year and buoyant activity later, Barclays said. In Europe too, analysts have blamed weak data on one-offs such as the harsh winter, Easter vacations and high sick levels of sick leave due to flu. Finally, some such as Sebastian Raedler at Deutsche Bank don’t see indicators, market levels and growth forecasts as out of kilter.

2018-04-25,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - “Discipline” has become the oil industry’s favourite word as it emerges from the deepest and longest downturn in a generation. Senior executives are pledging to maintain a cautious approach to investment and spending despite the recovery in oil prices over the last two years. Business leaders and shareholders are still scarred by the memory of project over-runs, spiralling costs and frenzied drilling during the last boom, and the painful adjustments during the subsequent slump. Corporate leaders are under pressure to focus on returning more cash to investors rather than indulging in expensive and risky plans to boost production. The case for a more disciplined approach has been powerfully argued by my counterpart Liam Denning at Bloomberg (“This is Big Oil’s Quarter to Lose”, April 24). This time really will be different, according to the industry, with earnest promises to learn from past mistakes. But there are good reasons to be sceptical. The oil industry has been characterised by deep and prolonged boom-bust cycles since the first modern well was drilled in 1859. Deep cycles are the natural condition of the oil industry and there is no reason to think the future will be any different. Cyclical behaviour is the oil market’s most distinctive characteristic and deeply rooted in the industry’s structure rather than mistakes by its leaders. Price cycles stem from the low price-elasticity of supply and demand, the prevalence of backward-looking expectations and behaviour, and the lumpiness of new discoveries and investments. They also stem from the prevalence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms, which alternately amplify and dampen the initial impact of price changes. The oil market is really multiple sub-markets for crude, fuels, refining, services, engineering, construction, drilling, skilled labour, steel, raw materials etc. Each market is subject to its own feedback mechanisms, operating at different speeds and timescales, with constantly changing supply and demand. Balancing “the oil market” would mean balancing all these sub-markets simultaneously. In practice, the sub-markets are never simultaneously balanced or in a state of equilibrium except accidentally and never for very long. Economist Paul Frankel’s “Essentials of Petroleum”, published in 1946, remains the best explanation of the oil industry’s boom-bust cycle. Frankel noted the basic features of the oil industry made for “continuous crises” with hectic prosperity followed all too swiftly by complete collapse. Frankel concluded the oil industry was not self-adjusting and had an inherent tendency towards extreme crisis. As a result, he was sympathetic to the need for “leading interests” and “planners” to act as “eveners” and “stabilizers”. Frankel urged a form of managed competition, in which oil producers would recognise their common interests and coordinate their policies at strategic level while remaining competitors at tactical level. (I’m not sure how this distinction would work in practice. Frankel did not explain it in detail and seems to have been unsure himself). At different times, Frankel argued that the role of adjusters and eveners had been played by monopolies such as Standard Oil, the major international oil firms, and governments, sometimes in combination. But this was the least convincing part of Frankel’s argument. There is no evidence that any monopoly or combination of interests has ever managed to stabilise the market for long. Even the long period of apparent stability during the 1950s and 1960s came to a dramatic end with the oil shock of 1973 (which was rooted in the long period of low prices during the previous two decades). The price cycle cannot be tamed. Oil-producing companies and countries have to learn to ride with the volatility. “We’ve never been good at predicting these (price) cycles, neither when they occur nor their duration. We don’t spend a lot of time even trying,” Exxon Mobil’s then-chief Rex Tillerson told investors in March 2016. “How the future is going to look, we take no particular view on it, other than to recognise that whatever it is today it will be different sometime in the future, and after that it will be different again.” “In my nearly 41 years (with Exxon) ... I didn’t learn anything about my ability to foresee that. I learned a lot about how you deal with it.” The major oil-producing companies and countries are always cautious in the first stages of a cyclical expansion when memories of the previous slump are still fresh. In the early stages of the last boom, between 2002 and 2006, the major companies were notoriously conservative about investment, worried the rise in prices would not prove sustainable. Ironically, the slow response of investment and production accelerated the boom and pushed prices much higher than they would have risen otherwise. But the combination of high and seemingly sustainable prices eventually triggered a late-cycle rush of investment, not just from the majors but also the independent shale producers. The sluggish response of investment to changes in oil prices is one of the biggest causes of instability in the oil market. However, it is not clear the major oil companies could or should have behaved any differently. If they had adopted an even more restrictive approach to investment, prices would have risen higher, providing an even sharper incentive for other suppliers to fill the gap, most likely U.S. shale producers. The history of the oil industry is of attempts to restrict investment and production to stabilise prices. In every case, price stabilisation efforts have been undone when rival sources of supply were developed to fill the gap: Pennsylvania. Ohio. Dutch East Indies. Romania. Burma. Russia. Texas. Oklahoma. Alberta. California. Mexico. Venezuela. Persia. Iraq. Arabia. Libya. China. Alaska. Nigeria. North Sea. Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater. Oil sands. Most recently U.S. shale. There has never been a shortage of petroleum resources. Every attempt to restrict investment and production has failed because it encouraged the development of new and alternative sources. OPEC and the oil majors may exercise some influence over oil prices in the very short term, but in the medium run they have proved to be price-takers, not price-makers. If the oil majors were to attempt to be more “disciplined” this time around, the resulting rise in prices would simply accelerate the development of alternative sources of supply, as well as curbing demand growth. The majors would end up with lower prices and a smaller market share. Much the same fate awaits OPEC if it tries to tighten the oil market too much (again). What about control over costs? Here too the oil majors and other producers are at the mercy of the industry cycle. Costs for everything from skilled workers and drilling contracts to steel, raw materials, seismic surveys, engineering and a host of other oilfield services are pro-cyclical. In the aftermath of a slump, it is easy for corporate leaders to preach the need for continued cost control, but as the cycle matures and the supply chain tightens, cost pressures inevitably build. Oilfields are a declining asset. If oil companies want to remain in the game, they must invest, accept the price cycle, and manage it as best they can. Most oilfields will produce for decades, so producers must take a view through the cycle and accept the inevitable short-term volatility.

2018-04-25,"* Siba is south Iraq’s first dedicated gas field * Gas at oil fields usually burnt off * Government seeking to end flaring to boost revenue (adds oil production average from southern Iraq in April) By Aref Mohammed BASRA, Iraq, April 25 (Reuters) - Kuwait Energy PLC IPO-KEC.L started producing natural gas from Siba on Wednesday, the first gas field to be brought on stream in the south of Iraq, an Iraqi oil executive told Reuters. Siba began producing gas at an initial rate of 25 million cubic feet a day (mcf/d), which should rise gradually to 100 mcf/d by the end of the year, said Kareem Abd Oda, the director general of the joint venture established by Iraq and Kuwait Energy to develop the field. Siba, south of the city of Basra, is producing natural gas and gas condensates, he added. The other hydrocarbon reservoirs of southern Iraq that are already in operation produce natural gas alongside crude oil. The gas extracted in several of these fields is burnt off instead of being captured, as the country lacks the capacity to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government has started producing natural gas from fields in northern Iraq. Iraq hopes by 2021 to end gas flaring, which costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of its unmet needs for gas-based power generation, according to the World Bank. Iraq holds on Thursday an auction of oil and gas exploration contracts in 11 blocks alongside the border with Iran and Kuwait and in offshore Gulf waters. The new contracts set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oilfields they develop. Iraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia. Companies including BP, Exxon Mobil, Eni , Total, Royal Dutch Shell and Lukoil helped Iraq expand production in the past decade by more than 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 4.7 million bpd. Iraq’s crude exports from its southern region on the Gulf have averaged 3.5 million bpd so far in April, two oil executives told Reuters on Wednesday. That is higher than the March average of 3.45 million bpd.

2018-04-25,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian offshore oil services firm Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) is open to potentially sweetening its $2 billion (1.43 billion pounds) offer for McDermott (MDR.N) if the U.S. company would work with it to identify additional benefits of a deal, Subsea said on Wednesday.  The Norwegian firm’s comments come a week before McDermott’s shareholders vote on a planned combination with Chicago Bridge and Iron (CB&I) CBI.N, which McDermott’s board has recommended its investors to support while rejected Subsea’s proposal “Subsea 7 is open to considering amending its proposal if it can discover additional value through discussions with the McDermott management team,” Subsea, one fifth owned by Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, said in a statement. Siem, who is also Subsea’s chairman, declined to say specifically whether the company was willing to pay more than the $7 per share rejected by McDermott’s board on April 20. Some analysts say that, depending on potential synergies, Subsea could increase its offer to a least $10 a share, but it can’t do that without more information from McDermott.  Subsea repeated on Wednesday its proposal was subject to the termination of McDermott’s planned transaction with CB&I.  Italian oil services group Saipem (SPMI.MI), which competes with Subsea in providing undersea solutions for oil and gas firms, has said the bid for McDermott is a sign of industry consolidation that has to be monitored closely.  The move comes after Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Subsea started talks earlier this year to form a joint venture to deliver undersea installations and services. Oil firms have returned to profit thanks to higher oil prices and cost cuts made in the recent downturn, but their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze. Siem has long called for the industry to consolidate as a way of coping. “Siem doesn’t care about the market share, but about the value ... He wouldn’t do that (buy McDermott) if it would not create value for shareholders,” said analyst Frederik Lunde at Carnegie.

2018-04-25,"* MSCI world index falls for 5th day running * Caterpillar earnings highlight concerns about economic peak * U.S. bond yields rise past 3 pct, 2011 highs next focus * EM currencies feel heat of higher U.S. yields * European shares fall 0.3-0.9 pct * Turkey hikes rates, Facebook status update coming By Marc Jones LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Shares were on their way to the longest losing streak of the year on Wednesday, as an advance in U.S. bond yields beyond 3 percent and warnings from top global firms about rising costs fed fears that a boom in earnings may have peaked. All eyes will be on the scandal-hit social media firm Facebook later when it reports its results, though there was plenty to keep investors occupied till then. Falls in Asia’s and then Europe’s main bourses pushed the 47-country MSCI world share index down for a fifth day running to its lowest level for more than two weeks. Tech-heavy Taiwan shares had hit two-month lows as worries about a slowdown in gadget demand spread, while oil firms also eased as crude prices came off 3-1/2 year highs. Wall Street looked set to follow suit as the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield continued to push above 3 percent , having broken the psychologically key level on Tuesday for the first time since the start of 2014. It has been down to a mix of factors. A strong U.S. economy and rising commodity prices which are increasing the chance of more U.S. interest rate hikes, as well higher debt and improving relations between Washington and China and North Korea. “The now healthier global economy justifies these higher yields,” JPMorgan Asset Management’s Seamus Mac Gorain said. “We expect 10-year Treasuries (yields) to end the year between 3 and 3-1/2 percent. A move beyond this level would likely require an acceleration of inflation in the euro zone and Japan, which is not yet evident.” Euro zone bond yields - yields are a proxy of borrowing costs - were dragged up in the slipstream of the U.S. moves though Thursday’s looming European Central Bank (ECB) meeting ensured there was a touch of caution. Markets want to know when the ECB plans to wind down its 2.55-trillion-euro stimulus programme. One of its policymakers, France’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said on Tuesday the weaker run of recent economic data was expected to pass. The pan-European STOXX 600 equity index was last down 0.9 percent, as worries over the rising bond yields trumped a slew of well-received earnings updates from Kering <PRTP.and Credit Suisse as well as a flurry of takeover activity. S&P E-mini futures slipped 0.5 percent. Wall Street shares had skidded on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 slumping 1.34 percent, the most in two-and-a-half weeks. Industrial heavyweight Caterpillar beat earnings estimates due to strong global demand but its shares tumbled 6.2 percent after management said first-quarter earnings would be the “high water mark” for the year and warned of increasing steel prices. “We’ve seen quite a lot of companies announcing above-estimate earnings and their shares falling sharply,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities senior investment strategist Norihiro Fujito said. Reuters data shows that analysts are now estimating bumper 21.1 percent growth in the January-March quarter among U.S. S&P500 firms. Fujito noted major financial shares such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as well as Google parent Alphabet , the first major tech firm to report earnings, have followed a similar pattern. “The market reaction so far feels as if we are starting to see an end of its long rally since 2009. Investors could be thinking that the best time will be soon behind us,” he said. Facebook’s results are due after the closing bell. Revenues are expected to be up sharply but focus will all be on what impact the scandal over the misuse of tens of millions of its users’ data has had on usage of the social media site. Creeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are also fuelling nerves that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets such as stocks and emerging markets. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 3.02 percent. A break above its January 2014 peak of 3.041 percent could turn investors even more bearish. Fed Funds rate futures prices have been constantly falling this month, pricing in a considerable chance of three more rate hikes by the end of this year. The impact is already reverberating in many emerging markets, with JPMorgan’s emerging market bond index hitting a two-month low. Turkey’s central bank took what was seen as a crucial interest rate decision. The lira has tumbled to all-time lows this year, stoking inflation, and its slightly larger-than- expected 75 basis points hike to 13.5 percent kept its markets largely in check. In Indonesia, a market with one of the largest exposures to foreign portfolio holdings, the authorities have been intervening heavily to put a floor under the rupiah, which has been flirting with two-year lows. The Indian rupee hit a 13-month low while China’s yuan eased again in line with its bond yields following recent tweaks to its policy settings. The dollar also continued gaining against the major currencies, setting new 2-1/2-month highs of 109.21 yen and $1.2175 per euro. Oil prices were broadly steady below the more than three-year highs hit in the previous session. Rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise heavily bullish market. Brent fetched $74.01 a barrel, up 15 cents. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded flat $67.88 while aluminium levelled off at $2,236 a tonne having been on a rollercoaster run in recent weeks following U.S. sanctions on Russia’s top producer of the metal, United Company Rusal Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo

2018-04-25,"BANGKOK, April 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Parched Cape Town, in South Africa, has managed to push back its “Day Zero” - an estimate of when taps in the city could run dry - to 2019 after successful water-saving efforts. But in India, “Day Zero” has come and gone for residents in many parts of the country, where taps failed long ago and people have turned instead to digging wells or buying water. An expanding population, growing demand for water from agriculture and industry, and poor management of water supplies have sent India’s groundwater to ever lower levels. That reality, combined with rising temperatures, threatens worsening scarcity, experts say. Nearly 163 million people among India’s population of 1.3 billion - or more than one in 10 - lack access to clean water close to their home, according to a 2018 WaterAid report. That is the most of any country in the world, according to the UK-based charity, which aims to provide clean water and better hygeiene to people without them. Disputes with neighbours over the sharing of water from rivers that cross national boundaries also means tensions are rising as water shortages grow, said Michael Kugelman, a deputy director and South Asia expert at the Wilson Center, a policy think tank in Washington D.C. “Countries that get along the least are forced to share and cooperate over water resources, and many major rivers originate in, or pass through, politically contested and tense areas,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “So you have population growth, intensifying climate-change impacts, poor water management and geopolitical tensions. It’s a perfect storm for greater water insecurity,” he said. India is entangled in water disputes with its eastern and western neighbours - Bangladesh and Pakistan - which accuse it of monopolising water flows moving downstream toward them. To the north and northeast, however, India fears a loss of water to upstream China, which plans a series of dams over the Tsangpo river, called the Brahmaputra as it flows into eastern India. While India’s trans-boundary rivers are governed by treaties on how water should be shared, disputes are increasing as water shortages stoke tensions. Apart from in Bhutan and Nepal, South Asia’s per capita water availability is already below the world average. The region could face widespread water scarcity - less than 1,000 cubic metres available per person - by 2025, Kugelman said. Almost 600 million people in India are at high risk of being unable to continue relying on surface water - including in the country’s northwest and south, where much of the country’s staple wheat and rice are grown, according to the World Resources Institute. Water supply in India may fall 50 percent below demand by 2030, the Asian Development Bank has forecast. “Large parts of India have already been living with ‘Day Zero’ for a while now,” said Mridula Ramesh, author of an upcoming book on climate change. “Much of it is because of bad management. Most cities lose between a third and a fifth of their water from pilferage or leakage through antiquated pipes, and we don’t treat and reuse wastewater enough,” she said. Bengaluru, Karachi and Kabul are among the 10 cities in the world that are “on the verge of an imminent water crisis”, according to a report last month by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a research and advocacy group based in New Delhi. Bengaluru, once known as the “city of lakes”, now relies heavily on groundwater, which is not being naturally replenished and cannot sustain the growing population, said Sushmita Sengupta at CSE. “‘Day Zeros’ are inevitable unless cities push for judicious use of water - including rainwater harvesting and reuse of waste water, as well as more efficient irrigation, and regulation of tubewells,” she said. India is one of the largest consumers of groundwater in the world, with worsening shortages attributed in part to subsidies that help farmers run electric irrigation pumps cheaply for longer than needed, and to a lack of limits on extracting water or digging wells. Some states are taking steps to manage water better. Karnataka and Maharashtra require industries to use treated urban wastewater, with Gujarat and other states also planning similar measures. But regulating water use is a politically sensitive issue - one few policymakers are keen to address, Kugelman said. That’s the case even as thousands of farmers migratw out of parched rural areas or commit suicide as their crops wilt, he said. . Water scarcity is expected to force 50 to 70 million people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and China from their homes by 2050, according to research by the Strategic Foresight Group in Mumbai. “With greater migration to the cities, there will be increased social disruptions and greater stress on water resources in urban areas,” Kugelman predicted. “These will, in turn, increase tensions between states and countries over water. Even treaties can’t help then.” (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Laurie Goering.

2018-04-25,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan President Salva Kiir has rejected opposition calls for him to resign as part of efforts to end a civil war, accusing anti-government groups of making “unreasonable demands” in peace talks. Despite several agreements and ceasefires, fighting has rumbled on in South Sudan with barely any break since it first erupted in 2013, just two years after independence, killing tens of thousands. In talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa led by East African bloc IGAD, 10 opposition groups last month demanded Kiir step aside. They also want a transitional parliament dissolved and replaced by a new one formed with less than 200 members. “The people who are fighting with us have unreasonable conditions to make peace,” Kiir said during a ceremony for his deceased army chief, General James Ajongo Mawut late on Tuesday.   “They think that I am the obstacle to peace and if I am removed after signing the Agreement then there will be no problem,” he added.  “They want me to sign the agreement and then step down immediately. Just imagine, what is my incentive in bringing peace if it is peace that I will bring and then I step aside? Nobody can do it. Bashir (Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir) didn’t do it when we are fighting with them.”   The government and rebel groups signed the latest ceasefire in December in Addis Ababa, aiming to revive a pact reached in 2015. But the truce was violated within hours. Another series of talks that were scheduled for this week were postponed, and are now expected to take place in early May. Civil war first erupted when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with forces loyal to Riek Machar, then the vice president. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the nation has faced dire food shortages. IGAD said last month Machar should be released from house arrest in South Africa as soon as possible, on condition that he renounces violence. The fighting has slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes. The U.N. refugee agency estimates 3.1 million will be refugees in neighbouring countries by the end of this year. Kiir also dismissed calls to dissolve the parliament. “If we were to sign an agreement, the agreement has to be endorsed by the parliament so that it is passed into law. If the parliament is dissolved then what do we do with the agreement?” he said. “We will not work for such thing.” Reporting by Denis Dumo; Editing by George Obulutsa, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/southsudan-unrest/south-sudan-president-rejects-opposition-calls-to-quit-post-idUKL8N1S22XM,25 Apr 2018,"South Sudan President Salva Kiir

2018-04-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche has appealed against the seizure of files by prosecutors during a raid last week on the sports car brand’s premises related to inquiries into emissions manipulations, prosecutors said. Prosecutors seized an unknown number of files at Porsche during searches carried out by around 160 officials on April 18 as part of an investigation into employees at the Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE)-owned carmaker suspected of fraud and fraudulent advertising tied to manipulated emissions control systems of diesel passenger cars. Porsche has appealed in full against the seizure and consequential inspection of the files, the prosecutor’s office in Porsche’s home town of Stuttgart said on Wednesday. The second-largest contributor to Volkswagen group profit is the latest VW division to find itself in the cross-hairs of public prosecutors after VW admitted to cheating emissions tests in the United States in 2015 and related investigations that have since engulfed luxury brand Audi. Last week, German police arrested the head of powertrain development at Porsche and are holding him on remand on concerns he could try to destroy evidence or flee, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. A local court will now be tasked with deciding whether Stuttgart prosecutors are entitled to process the seized files, a spokesman for the prosecutors said, adding that Porsche has a right to lodge a complaint should the court uphold the seizure. Porsche said the sheer quantum of files seized by the prosecutors which also included confidential data for the carmaker’s own lawyers and information irrelevant to the inquiries have caused it to file a blanket appeal against the seizures. “The reason (for the appeal) is the large number of seized files that is making it impossible for Porsche to carry out an assessment in the short time available,” a spokesman said. “Porsche fully cooperates with the relevant authorities and takes an interest in clearing up the matter.”     Reporting by Andreas Cremer",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-porsche/porsche-appeals-against-seizure-of-files-in-emissions-raid-idUKL8N1S22TQ,25 Apr 2018,"Porsche has appealed against

2018-04-25,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Wednesday it would be negligent to end up in a trade conflict with the United States, which has imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from some countries. Speaking just days before Chancellor Angela Merkel travels to Washington to hold talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on the issue, Altmaier said: “I remain convinced that it would be careless to stumble into a trade conflict so I think a consensual solution should take precedence over a confrontational one.” Trump has given the EU until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions from the tariffs. Asked whether updated German government growth forecasts included the scenario of a so-called ‘hard Brexit’, Altmaier said: “We don’t know whether there will be a hard Brexit. We are all interested in avoiding it and the EU Commission is negotiating with Britain in this spirit. Even if these negotiations were not to lead to the desired outcome, there would unlikely be an impact on economic growth this year.

2018-04-25,"* Fuel price controls have cost Pertamina more than $1 bln * Chief executive pushed for reform, replaced after 13 months * Government prioritises efforts to prop up consumption By Fergus Jensen and Agustinus Beo Da Costa JAKARTA, April 25 (Reuters) - When Pertamina’s former chief executive, Elia Massa Manik, was fired on Friday, he became the state energy company’s shortest-serving boss in more than a decade. His expulsion after 13 months followed repeated clashes with the government over fuel price controls estimated to have cost Pertamina $1.4 billion from January to September last year. Manik’s firing and the dismissal of four other executives, along with Pertamina’s fuel sales losses, starkly illustrate the competing priorities of the state-run firm. While the government wants the company to improve profits by reviving Indonesia’s flagging oil output and building refineries to cut record fuel imports, it also wants Pertamina to keep fuel affordable and politically palatable. “As a state-owned enterprise, Pertamina’s task is not just to seek profit but also to serve the needs of the community,” Deputy State Owned Enterprise Minister Harry Fajar Sampurno said in a statement on Friday. Manik, though, had not “obeyed” the wishes of State Owned Enterprise Minister Rini Soemarno on fuel prices, trying to plead the case for higher prices directly with President Joko Widodo, according to Inas Nasrullah Zubir, a member of a Parliamentary commission overseeing energy. Manik sent a statement by text message on Saturday declining to comment on his dismissal, but saying Pertamina executives needed to ensure the oil company was not “left behind” while working to meet Indonesia’s energy security goals. Questions to the deputy energy minister on the shake-up were not answered. Pertamina dominates Indonesia’s energy industry. It has a virtual monopoly on petroleum imports and retail sales, and owns and operates the country’s main refineries. The company estimates it would need $115 billion over the next decade to realise Widodo’s plans to make Indonesia self-sufficient in energy. Manik had said in December a single price nationwide for “Premium” (RON 88) gasoline and “Solar” diesel could cost Pertamina losses of 3.8 trillion rupiah ($274 million) a year. “This is a burden on Pertamina (and) so far there has been no discussion of compensation,” he told parliament. The government then added to Pertamina’s difficulties this year, saying fuel prices would not change until after the 2019 elections, and extended price controls to all retail fuels. While Pertamina’s growing upstream output will benefit from higher crude prices, unless retail fuel prices are increased, its “superior” downstream earnings will be unsustainable, S&P said in a ratings note on Tuesday. Fuel prices are politically sensitive in Indonesia. More than 160 million people, around 60 percent of the population, live on $5.50 a day or less, according to recent World Bank data, leaving them vulnerable to price swings. “People’s purchasing power has to be number one,” Ego Syahrial, then acting oil and gas director general, said at the same December hearing where Manik spoke. Since January 2016, benchmark Brent crude prices have nearly doubled, while net-oil-importer Indonesia has not raised fuel prices, forcing heavy losses on Pertamina. Southeast Asia’s largest economy grew 5.1 percent in 2017, its best pace in four years, but consumption - the biggest contributor to the economy - has remained sluggish. That’s a concern for Widodo, who is seeking re-election in 2019. State Owned Enterprise Minister Soemarno promised in March to enforce government fuel rules, telling Rakyat Merdeka newspaper in an interview she was “saddened” by Pertamina’s complaints on the matter. “We are doing this for the people,” she said, noting that other state enterprises such as power utility PLN had not complained about rules impacting profitability. After agreeing to dismiss Manik and four other directors, the head of Pertamina’s board of commissioners acknowledged the company’s financial dilemma. The new leadership has been instructed to study “the changes in costs and the latest increases in (crude) prices,” which were impacting Pertamina’s performance, Board Chairman Tanri Abeng told reporters on Friday.

2018-04-25,"* Clariant confirms 2018, mid-term targets * But analysts worry margin goals are demanding * Oil business hurt by price-conscious clients (Adds analyst comments, recasts to lead on margins) By John Miller ZURICH, April 25 (Reuters) - Swiss speciality chemicals maker Clariant disappointed on Wednesday with stagnant first-quarter profit margins, sending its shares 5 percent lower and leaving analysts wondering whether the company’s mid-term profit targets are in reach. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation excluding one-time items rose to 268 million Swiss francs ($273 million), compared to a 266 million poll estimate. That put the operating margin at just 15.6 percent, the same as the first quarter of 2017. Clariant increased sales by 7 percent to 1.72 billion francs but failed to capitalise on demand to improve profitability. Its natural resources business that sells chemicals to the energy industry suffered yet again, with operating margins falling by more than a full percentage point to 15.2 percent. Results were “burdened by the continued price consciousness of the oil market”, Clariant said in a statement. “This, however, is expected to improve throughout the year due to the sales pipeline of the business and a generally improving oil market,” it said, as crude oil prices hit their highest since 2014. Clariant is emerging from a raucous 12 months, after activist investor White Tale scuttled a planned merger with U.S.-based Huntsman Corp.. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) then bought White Tale’s 25 percent stake, with an update on the companies’ plans not due until September. Clariant’s stock is down 8 percent this year, as Chief Executive Hariolf Kottmann’s insistence SABIC will not raise its stake cools investors’ takeover hopes. Wednesday’s lacklustre margin added to their gripes. “We were expecting more operating leverage to kick in, especially at care chemicals and natural resources,” Bank Vontobel analysts wrote. Care chemicals, a division that makes aircraft de-icer and soap ingredients, saw margins rise to 18.4 percent, from 18.2 percent a year ago, while profitability was flat at 16.3 percent in plastics and coatings. Clariant’s fastest-growing business, for catalysts used to accelerate other chemical reactions, boosted the operating margin to 19.8 percent, from 19 percent. Nonetheless, Zuercher Kantonalbank had expected 24 percent and now fears Clariant’s overall mid-term target of 16 to 19 percent could be in danger. “That mid-term margin corridor seems pretty demanding,” analyst Philipp Gamper said. Clariant’s Kottmann remained confident the company will hit its 2018 goals of boosting sales and operating profit and also stuck to his mid-term target, for which he has not given a specific time frame. “We are on track,” Kottmann said.

2018-04-25,"* Tight supplies boost Singapore fuel oil prices * Shortage of high quality bunker fuel compounds tight market * Firm seasonal demand could help keep prices elevated By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - The Singapore fuel oil market has rallied this week as inventories have dropped at the same time that some supplies in the region do not meet the standards for use as shipping fuel, further reducing the amount of supply available, five trade sources said. Cash premiums for 380-centistoke fuel oil, which is primarily sold for ship fuel, known as bunker fuel, have soared this week to the highest since May 2017. The premium of the prompt-month swap for the fuel over the second-month swap has jumped to the highest since October, underscoring a surge in demand for prompt supply. FO380-SIN-DIF The sources said the supply tightness stems from too much of the supply of bunker fuel being so-called off-specification, meaning that it does not meet the standards for use on ships. Singapore is the world’s biggest bunker fuel market. Three of the sources said there were problems with the amount of metals and concerns about the flashpoint, or the temperature at which vapours of the fuel oil will ignite, of some of the bunker supply, which impacts the ability to store the fuel onboard a vessel. “The market strength in the prompt is due to bunker off-specification issues,” said one of the sources, a Singapore-based fuel oil trader, which forced shippers to reject some cargoes and seek alternatives. One source said the quality problems may originate from blending fuel onboard ships, where the blending process cannot be done as well as at large and specialised onshore facilities. The traders declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. The quality of the bunker fuel could be improved by blending it with higher-quality fuel in onshore tanks. However, the amount of fuel oil stored in tanks to blend with has declined as there is no incentive to store fuel because the market is in backwardation, when prices for future delivery are lower than those for immediate dispatch. Landed physical fuel oil storage leased out in Singapore, the world’s largest bunker market, fell by an estimated 30 percent over the past 12 to 18 months, said Mike Beviss, director of special projects at Eastport Maritime, a consultancy. Singapore onshore fuel oil inventories fell to a more than 10-month low of 17.941 million barrels in the week to April 18, the latest official data showed. STKRS-SIN Adding to the shortage of quality cargoes is rising demand ahead of the high consumption summer period in the Northern Hemisphere. “Regional demand has swung big time too, with the Gulf, India and South Korea pulling instead of pushing,” said a second fuel oil trading source.

2018-04-25,"* Says will miss $63 mln savings target * Says writedowns possible * Now expects market supply deficit * Q1 profit up 38 pct, beats forecasts * Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2FapPWM (Adds CEO quotes on Rusal, updates shares) By Terje Solsvik and Joachim Dagenborg OSLO, April 25 (Reuters) - Norsk Hydro will miss its cost-cutting target this year and faces possible writedowns as its Brazilian operations work at reduced capacity following a spill, the Norwegian aluminium producer said on Wednesday. Hydro was ordered by regulators to slash output from Alunorte, the world’s largest alumina refinery, which triggered cutbacks at its nearby Albras aluminium plant and a scramble among other factories and customers for supplies. Unless it gets permission in the second quarter to restart shuttered output, it may have to write down the value of Alunorte and its related Paragominas bauxite mine, and faces the risk of impairments at Albras and other plants, the company said. Even if Hydro wins permission to restart the closed production lines at Alunorte, it would take about three weeks to reach full output, the company said. As a result, Hydro said its “Better” improvement programme was now expected to miss its target of 500 million Norwegian crowns ($63 million) in cost cuts this year. Brazilian authorities have ordered Alunorte, which has a capacity of about 6.3 million tonnes of alumina per year, to halve production after the plant admitted to making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains in February. Hydro has said neighbouring Albras will also halve production, cutting the equivalent of 230,000 tonnes of aluminium per year. Hydro’s Brazilian outage and U.S. sanctions imposed on Russian rival Rusal have caused fears of a supply crunch, sending prices this month to seven-year highs, although the rally later faded. The sanctions on Rusal caused great uncertainty in aluminium markets and will impact trade flows and availability of metal and raw materials throughout the value chain, Hydro said. The company still expects 4-5 percent growth in global aluminium demand in 2018, but now predicts a supply deficit for the year, rather than the balanced market it had previously anticipated. “Our customers are worried,” Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg told Reuters, adding that supplies could still flow from global warehouses to replace the production cuts for some time. “It’s important to remember that there are some 12 million tonnes of aluminium in storage,” Brandtzaeg said. A U.S. decision to postpone the deadline for complying with sanctions to Oct. 23 from June 5 has also provided some relief, he added. The company reiterated that it may have to declare force majeure on its contracts with Rusal, though it was too early to provide details on the timing or volume impact. Hydro reported 3.15 billion Norwegian crowns ($398 million) in underlying January-March earnings before interest and taxes, up 38 percent and better than the 3.06 billion expected in a Reuters poll of analysts. Hydro shares were down 0.4 percent at 0826 GMT. They are down 19 percent this year versus a 4.7 percent rise in the Oslo benchmark index.

2018-04-25,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Soon after taking office in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo made a landmark decision to cut subsidies on politically sensitive fuel prices to boost the economy, but a year out from a tough re-election campaign, his reformist zeal may be waning. Markets cheered Widodo’s gamble to free up billions of dollars to build much-needed infrastructure, while the former furniture salesman also unveiled a series of reforms to slash regulations holding back Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Now, less than a year from an expected hard-fought 2019 election, Widodo has made a “strategic policy shift”, say senior government officials, dropping nearly $20 billion of infrastructure projects to focus on social welfare. The government has also slapped price controls on staple goods such as fuel, power, rice and sugar - moves that will surely be welcomed by voters. “Of course he’s thinking about elections. With these moves, he can gain popularity by benefiting the people and ensuring welfare both in the short- and long-term,” said one senior official, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak on the issue. Economists warn Widodo’s return to “populist” policies may threaten Indonesia’s investment climate. “With national elections around the corner, Widodo appears to be backtracking on his reform agenda with a string of populist measures... moves that would pressure firms’ profit margins and weigh on the investment climate,” Fitch Group’s think-tank BMI Research said in a note last week. Widodo took office promising to boost annual economic growth to 7 percent and with an ambitious plan to build $350 billion worth of infrastructure across the poorly connected archipelago. Indonesia has since earned coveted upgrades from ratings agencies. Standard & Poor’s last year announced a landmark upgrade for Indonesia to investment grade status. This month Moody’s Investors Services raised its ratings another notch, citing effective policies to support broad economic stability. Indonesia has also jumped 19 places to 72nd in the World Bank’s 2018 Ease of Doing Business index. The 56-year old Widodo still enjoys high public approval, with recent surveys giving him a double digit lead over his main rival, former general Prabowo Subianto. Widodo only narrowly defeated Subianto in a bitterly fought 2014 election. Subianto is expected to campaign on welfare issues, the cost of living and a perceived over-reliance on Chinese investment at a time when economic growth is stagnating at around 5 percent and consumption has been persistently sluggish. Asked about the government’s change in policy focus, Widodo’s chief-of-staff said it was time to be “realistic”. “Development should not just be in the physical sector but also be oriented to the non-physical sector like vocational schools, education, religious schools, health,” Moeldoko, a former military commander, said in an interview with Reuters. “The president is aware that we are achieving some success in the investment area, in infrastructure, in ease of doing business, and in deregulation... so we can leap to the next stage which is to focus on human development,” he told Reuters. Data shows that as of the end of 2017, around $100 billion worth of roads, ports, bridges and dams had been built or were under construction. But experts say it’s unlikely the remainder of the programme can be finished before the end of Widodo’s term in Oct 2019. Denni Purbasari, the president’s deputy chief-of-staff for economic affairs, said the government had taken into account external factors like rising global oil prices in its decision to re-route funds to public welfare. “It’s important to balance between economic progress and the burden borne by the people. We 100 percent believe that an adjustment must be made to fuel subsidies,” said Purbasari. Motorcycle taxi driver Ibrahim Naben, 34, believes Widodo’s new policies can only boost the president’s support base. “Jokowi has been fair and has a record of policies that help the poor even in the most remote islands,” Naben said, using the president’s nickname. “We’re not feeling the effects yet, but we anticipate any price controls will be good for welfare.” Widodo plans to keep electricity tariffs and fuel prices unchanged over the next two years by hiking subsidies by $588 million in 2018 and making state owned enterprises (SOEs) foot the rest of the bill. Critics say the move is a reversal of the 2015 decision to scrap fuel subsidies and that the government is essentially forcing SOEs to subsidise prices. Moody’s has said it could undo its recent upgrade of Indonesia’s government debt if the financial health of SOEs worsened and threatened the government’s balance sheet. The finance ministry has said it will monitor such risks. Another plan to force fuel retailers to get government approval before changing prices has been criticised as distorting the market. Other efforts to boost purchasing power include imposing a ceiling price on rice, even though traders say the upcoming main harvest of the staple should contain prices. Government officials insist the policy changes will not affect the core discipline of Widodo’s economic agenda. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati recently told foreign correspondents the government was not returning to subsidising everything and was not curtailing market mechanisms. This year’s budget deficit would be under 2.2 percent of gross domestic product, well below a legal cap of 3 percent, she said. Arianto Patunru, a researcher on Indonesia’s economy at Australian National University, said Widodo’s actions should be seen in the context of a global shift towards populist policies. “If the Indonesian government is carried away with this trend, I think the prospect is not so bright,” he said, adding it was too early to say if it was a long-term risk to economic reforms in the Southeast Asian nation.

2018-04-25,"BASRA/NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - United in their fight against Saddam Hussein’s oppression for decades, Iraq’s Shi’ites have become deeply fragmented and disillusioned with their leaders after 15 years in power. In Iraq’s Shi’ite heartlands, many who once voted blindly along sectarian lines are now turning their ire against the Shi’ite-led governments they say have failed to repair crumbling infrastructure, provide jobs or end the violence. The divisions within the community now risk splitting the Shi’ite vote in a May 12 election, which could complicate and delay the formation of a government, threaten gains against Islamic State and let Iran meddle further in Iraq’s politics. In the oil-rich southern province of Basra, 81-year-old retired teacher Mowafaq Abdul Ghani is disappointed with the performance of the Shi’ite leaders since Saddam fell in 2003. “I’ve been waiting for Saddam to fall since the 1970s. I’ve been waiting for you! Why would you do this to us?” he said.  “Look around. The streets are filthy, there are flies everywhere, pot holes at every step. Twenty years ago Basra was terrible but it was better than this,” Abdul Ghani said. In the holy city of Najaf, home to Imam Ali’s shrine and Iraq’s most revered Shi’ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, there was a similar feeling of disillusionment. At midnight on April 13 when official campaigning began, hordes of party activists plastered campaign posters on every visible surface, in same cases covering pictures honouring those who died fighting Islamic State. “They took down the martyrs and replaced them with thieves,” said unemployed 29-year-old Abbas Saad. Even Sistani seems unhappy with the performance of the politicians, issuing a fatwa recently implicitly calling on Shi’ites to vote for new blood. “The tried should not be tried,” said the fatwa from Sistani, whose decrees are sacrosanct to millions. Under the informal power-sharing arrangement in place since Saddam’s fall, the prime minister has always come from the Shi’ite majority with a Kurdish president and a Sunni speaker. In the past, while no party has won enough seats to govern alone, there has typically been one Shi’ite leader with enough support to shape a ruling coalition government. This time there are three Shi’ite frontrunners: incumbent Haider al-Abadi who has promoted a more inclusive government, his overtly sectarian predecessor Nuri al-Maliki who failed to inspire unity and Hadi al-Amiri, a military commander close to Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards seen as a war hero by many. If no clear winner emerges, Iran could have more of a chance to act as a broker between the Shi’ite parties and influence who becomes prime minister, while Islamic State could capitalise on any power vacuum and exploit Sunni feelings of marginalisation. At a party for university graduates in Najaf, dozens of young people danced under a glittering disco ball and listened to poetry in a packed hall. At the event sponsored by Adnan al-Zurfi, a former governor running on Abadi’s Victory Alliance list, the talk was of inclusiveness. About 60 percent of Iraqis are 27 or younger and many young people in urban areas say they want a secular government, underscoring the split within the Shi’ite voter base. “I’m against voting based on sect,” said student Ali Reda. Abadi’s list, touted by Zurfi as “cross-sectarian”, is the only one contesting the election in all of Iraq’s 18 provinces. “The youth care about unemployment, education, and freedoms,” he said at a nearby cafe surrounded by young men playing billiards. “The Shi’ite majority has a responsibility to calm the fears of other communities. We are proposing an inclusive government in which everyone is represented.” Just an hour away from Najaf in Karbala, the holy city visited by 30 million Shi’ite pilgrims a year, sharing power with Sunnis and Kurds is not seen as a solution. “Iraq has a Shi’ite majority. It is natural that it be ruled by a Shi’ite,” said Muntazer al-Shahrestani, who runs a school for Shi’ite clerics. While there has been no census for a long time, U.S. figures from 2003 put the breakdown of the Iraqi population at roughly 48-60 percent Shi’ite Arabs, 15-22 percent Sunni Arabs, 18 percent Kurds with other groups making up the rest. Shahrestani said while the rights of minorities should be protected there should be a Shi’ite government, echoing a popular opinion among religious Shi’ites. Many campaign on that sentiment, none more than former prime minister Maliki, who is widely viewed by Sunni and Kurds as sectarian and oppressive. Maliki is also blamed by many Shi’ites for losing a third of Iraq to Islamic State in 2014 before being replaced by Abadi, but he remains popular with others who credit him with signing Saddam’s death warrant. In Hayaniya, one of the poorest parts of Basra, Ali Khaled plans to vote for Amiri’s Conquest Alliance, as do many in his neighbourhood. Khaled’s brother was killed fighting Islamic State for Amiri’s Badr Organisation, an Iran-backed militia that is one of the many state-sponsored groups collectively known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) that emerged as a response to a Sistani fatwa calling on Iraqis to fight Islamic State. He receives up to $675 a month as payment for the death of his brother but he’s not thanking the current government. “The PMF follow God, they don’t have bureaucracy like the government,” Khaled said. “Hadi al-Amiri fought with us. He left his cushy post as a minister to fight for us. He eats our food. He lived with us.” But many others view Amiri, whose candidates hang photos of Iranian Supreme Leaders Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in their offices, as having a stronger allegiance to Iran than Iraq. “Amiri is a hero but he is too close to Iran. A vote for him is one against Iraq’s sovereignty,” said Abdul Ghani, the retired teacher in Basra.   For years, the province was a support base for Shi’ite leaders. Now, many Basrawis are fed up. Basra produces about 3.5 million barrels of oil per day, the vast majority of Iraq’s oil wealth equivalent to more than 80 percent of the federal budget. But many in the city don’t believe they get a fair share of government revenues handed out to the 18 provinces and say what little they do get is squandered by local officials. The city’s water is undrinkable, its roads neglected, and its streets overflowing with waste. The al-Ashar river that divides the city was once a source of prosperity for its people, but now its clogged with rubbish. Jobs are scant, as are school supplies and medical equipment but there is no shortage of posters for the Shi’ite candidates. At the same house in Hayaniya where Khaled was speaking, his neighbour, a soldier with an elite Interior Ministry unit, said he would just not vote, even for Abadi, his commander-in-chief. Many do still plan to vote for Abadi, though more out of pragmatism than passion with some describing him as “the best of the worst”. Wounded fighting Islamic State in Mosul last year, the soldier, who requested anonymity, sipped tea sitting on the floor, his leg still in a cast he was forced to pay for himself. “When I was first injured I got visits and promises (from officials) but nothing, ultimately. I have no faith in the government or parliament,” he said. A majority of those interviewed by Reuters in Basra said they would not vote. Two men, who declined to be named, said they planned to sell their families’ votes to the highest bidder, just to help make ends meet. “I am hungry. I have eight votes and I want to sell them,” said one.

2018-04-25,"* Global wind capacity seen reaching 840 GW by 2022 * Market to return to growth from 2019 * China remains largest wind energy market in world By Nina Chestney LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Global wind energy capacity could increase by more than half over the next five years, as costs continue to fall and the market returns to growth at the end of this decade, a report by the Global Wind Energy Council shows. In its annual report on the status of the global wind industry, the GWEC said cumulative wind energy capacity stood at 539 gigawatts (GW) at the end of last year, 11 percent higher than the previous year. That should increase by 56 percent to 840 GW by the end of 2022 as countries develop more renewable energy to meet emissions cut targets and prices continue to fall, the wind industry association said. Around 52.5 gigawatts (GW) of new wind power capacity was added worldwide last year, down slightly from 54.6 GW in 2016. The GWEC expects the market to be flat this year but start growing again from 2019. “The annual market will return to growth in 2019 and 2020, breaching the 60 GW barrier once again and continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, in the beginning of the new decade,” the GWEC said in its report. “We expect to see total cumulative installations reach 840 GW by the end of 2022,” it added. Wind power has become more competitive over the past few years, with a move from government subsidies to auctions which has brought costs down further. “Overall, offshore prices for projects to be completed in the next five years or so are half of what they were for the last five years and this trend is likely to continue,” the report said. China continues to be the biggest wind market in the world, adding nearly 19.7 GW of new capacity in 2017, though this was 15.9 percent lower than the previous year. The pace of China’s wind development is gradually slowing down and growth is expected to be flat to 2020. India experienced record wind installations last year, adding over 4 GW, but GWEC expects this to slow this year due to a transition period between old market incentives and moving towards an auction-based system, the GWEC said. The European Union also had a record year in 2017 with 15.6 GW added. The bloc is expected to install around 76 GW of new wind power by the end of 2022, reaching a cumulative total of 254 GW. The United States added 7 GW of new wind capacity last year. Despite attempts to change the structure of tax credits last year, the provisions remained intact and continue to support the industry.

2018-04-25,"* Ex-Japan Asia hits 3-week low * Caterpillar earnings highlight concerns about economic peak * U.S. bond yields rise at 3 pct, Jan 2014 high in focus * EM currencies feel heat of higher U.S. yields * European shares seen falling 0.7-0.9 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, April 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares fell on Wednesday as a rise in U.S. bond yields above 3 percent and warnings from bellwether U.S. companies of higher costs drove fears that a boom in corporate earnings may be near its peak. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.3 percent, hitting their weakest in almost three weeks, with tech-heavy Taiwan shares slipping to two-month lows on worries about slowing semi-conductor demand. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent. European shares are expected to fall, with spread-betters calling a 0.7 to 0.9 percent drop in Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac. S&P E-mini futures slipped 0.2 percent. Wall Street shares skidded overnight, with the S&P 500 slumping 1.34 percent, the most in two-and-a-half weeks. Industrial heavyweight Caterpillar beat earnings estimates due to strong global demand but its shares tumbled 6.2 percent after management said first-quarter earnings would be the “high water mark” for the year and warned of increasing steel prices. “We’ve seen quite a lot of companies announcing above-estimate earnings and their shares falling sharply,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Fujito noted major financial shares such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as well as Google parent Alphabet , the first major tech firm to report earnings, have followed a similar pattern. Corporate earnings are in solid shape, with analysts estimating 21.1 percent growth in the Jan-March quarter among U.S. S&P500 firms, according to Thomson Reuters data. A similar trend is expected globally. “If shares are falling when corporate earnings are rising 20 percent and the economy is growing at 3 percent, the market is in trouble. The market reaction so far feels as if we are starting to see an end of its long rally since 2009. Investors could be thinking that the best time will be soon behind us,” he said. Creeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are fuelling fears that portfolio managers may move money into safer fixed-income securities at the expense of riskier assets like stocks and emerging markets. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply, and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 3.009 percent. A break of its January 2014 high of 3.041 percent could turn investors even more bearish. Fed Funds rate futures prices have been constantly falling this month, pricing in a considerable chance of three more rate hikes by the end of this year. The impact is already reverberating in many emerging markets, with JPMorgan’s emerging market bond index hitting a two-month low. In Indonesia, a market with one of the largest exposures to foreign portfolio holdings, the authorities have been intervening heavily to put a floor under the rupiah, which has been flirted with two-year lows. The Indian rupee hit a 13-month low. “Higher yields are no doubt having a negative impact on emerging markets. We are likely to see outflows from emerging market bonds,” said Takahiko Sasaki, market economist at Mizuho Bank. The dollar also gained a tad against major currencies. The euro stood at $1.2226, not far from Tuesday’s low of $1.2182, a low last seen on March 1. The dollar traded at 108.87 yen after having jumped to a 2-1/2-month high of 109.20 yen on Tuesday. The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to a four-month low of $0.7572. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar index edged up 0.2 percent. Oil prices were stable, but were below the more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market. Brent fetched $73.86 a barrel, little changed on the day. On Tuesday it rose to $75.47, its highest since November 2014. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded flat at $67.68.

2018-04-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Baltic Exchange, owned by Singapore Exchange (SGXL.SI), plans to launch new indexes for grains, gas and potentially air freight in its biggest shake-up for more than a decade, according to executives and two sources familiar with the matter. The London-run company operates the world’s leading shipping freight index, which tracks rates for vessels transporting dry bulk commodities including iron ore and coal. It is looking to diversify its business after a near decade-long shipping downturn hit trading volumes and profitability. “We are only going to make real money through volume, so we have got to increase our reach,” said Baltic Exchange Chief Executive Mark Jackson. “Everything we are doing now is about increasing our reach.”  For its listed owner, the far larger Singapore Exchange (SGX), the new products are part of a drive to expand its own global presence and increase its market share, particularly in Asia. The centuries-old Baltic told Reuters it was developing two new grain freight indexes as well as a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) index. The grain indexes, which the company aims to launch this year, will be tradable instruments, allowing investors to take a position on freight rates at a point in the future, known as forward freight agreements or FFAs.  The new products will target users including gas and grains players, moving the company beyond its traditional shipping base, which it hopes will help counter future market shocks.     Some of the biggest grains traders such as U.S. groups Cargill [CARG.UL], Archer Daniels Midland (ADM.N), Bunge (BG.N) and China’s COFCO International have been consulted on the development of the new grains indexes, according to the two sources, who declined to be named, citing market sensitivity.      Cargill, Bunge and ADM declined to comment. Alessio La Rosa, global head of freight with COFCO International, confirmed the group was involved in the initiative, adding that it expected the new indexes “to be beneficial”.  For SGX, which acquired the Baltic in 2016 for 87 million pounds ($121 million), the new indexes could boost its market share in FFA clearing volumes - currently estimated at about 50 percent - and fend off rival clearing houses such as U.S. exchange Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) and Europe’s EEX, part of the Deutsche Boerse group (DB1Gn.DE).  Mike Syn, head of derivatives at SGX, stressed that the Baltic needed to expand its global customer base. “Profitability will result if we are able to get the world to accept that they need these tools,” he said.  The Baltic Exchange, which has been located in the heart of the City of London since its founding in a coffee house in 1744, produces daily benchmark rates and indexes that are used to trade and settle freight contracts. It also publishes data used in the multi-billion dollar freight derivatives market. It did not disclose how much the new products would cost to develop, launch and operate. But there are risks - the indexes may never take off, or could take years to gain traction or fail to provide significant returns.  SGX, which has a market value of 8 billion Singapore dollars  ($6 billion), does not break out the Baltic’s financial performance. The last annual report directly filed by the Baltic Exchange, for the year ending March 2016, showed its profit after tax more than halved to 968,570 pounds.   The Baltic does not have any direct competitors at this stage. But with growing interest from investors in shipping this year, following an improvement in the market, the firm could face potential challengers from players like data provider S&P Global Platts or companies in China such as the Shanghai Shipping Exchange, according to industry sources.  The Baltic Exchange is also exploring the possibility of moving into air freight in the future, to provide indexes for freight routes potentially in Europe, according to two sources familiar with the matter. CEO Jackson did not confirm this, saying the firm presently had “nothing in the pipeline for air freight”, but he added: “We are an established benchmark provider and if it has got the word freight in it we should be looking at it.” SGX’s Syn added: “For air freight as a concept, we would need to learn to get to know a new group of people and it would not be a stretch.”  Before SGX’s acquisition of the company, the Baltic was privately owned by shareholders, many of whom were in the shipping industry and included ship brokers, companies and individuals.  “The shareholders (before the acquisition) did not want the Baltic to take any risks,” Jackson said.   “We are more reactive now, more willing to test things and take the risk of failure,” he added. “Our decisions are a lot  more commercial.”      ($1 = 0.7175 pounds; $1 = 1.3245 Singapore dollars)     Additional reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago; Editing by Veronica Brown and Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shipping-balticexchange/focus-shippings-baltic-exchange-turns-to-grains-gas-and-even-air-freight-idUKL8N1RU2YW,25 Apr 2018,"The Baltic Exchange, owned by

2018-04-25,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Police in the north China city of Tianjin confiscated 600 computers used to mine bitcoin cryptocurrency after the local power grid operator reported abnormal electricity usage, Xinhua reported Wednesday. “Eight high-power fans were also seized,” Xinhua said, quoting local police and added that it was the “largest power theft case in recent years.” The report didn’t say when the police had seized the equipment.   China was home to the majority of crytopcurrency mining operations before Beijing last year began to discourage it as part of a larger crackdown on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It is unclear how much of mining activity has moved offshore or been shut down.  Reuters reported in January that China’s central bank told a top-level government internet finance group that the monetary authority can tell local governments to regulate the power usage of bitcoin miners to gradually reduce the scale of their production. Miners use high-powered machines to generate the massive computing power to produce cryptocurrencies, which is done by solving mathematical equations. The activity is also highly energy intensive, leading miners to seek locations with easy access to cheap electricity.

2018-04-25,"* Oil prices in April hit highest levels since Q4 2014 * OPEC-led cuts, political risk, strong demand have lifted oil * But rising U.S. supplies dragging on markets By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Wednesday, but were below more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production dragged on an otherwise bullish market. Brent crude oil futures were at 74.02 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close, but were some way below the November-2014 high of $75.47 a barrel reached the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $67.84 per barrel. That was also off the late-2014 highs of $69.56 a barrel reached earlier in April. Overall, many analysts say an oil market slump that started in 2014 has now ended and is turning into a sustained price rally due to supply disruptions and also strong demand, especially in Asia. That’s due to production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which were introduced in 2017 with the aim of propping up the market, but also because of political risk to supplies in the Middle East, Venezuela and Africa. “Market sentiment is turning increasingly bullish towards the commodity,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at futures brokerage FXTM. Despite this, Otunga said “the sustainability of the rally is a concern” as it was fuelled largely by political risk in the Middle East. “With rising production from U.S shale still a key market theme that continues to weigh on oil prices, it will be interesting to see how much oil appreciates before bears enter the scene,” he said. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has shot up by more than a quarter since mid-2016 to over 10.54 million barrels per day (bpd), taking it past Saudi Arabia’s output of around 10 million bpd. Only Russia currently produces more, at almost 11 million bpd. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels in the week to April 20 to 429.1 million, according to a report by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. Official weekly U.S. fuel inventory and crude production data will be published later on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Reporting by Henning Gloystein
