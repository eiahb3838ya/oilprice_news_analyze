2019-01-15,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Big Pacific storms are set to dump up to seven feet (2.1 meters) of snow in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and several inches of rain elsewhere in the state, forcing evacuations in areas at risk to mudslides. The first storm moved over Southern California on Tuesday, with rainfall of up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) expected in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and up to 4.5 inches (11.4) in the Santa Monica Mountains, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported. Police in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties ordered evacuations from areas damaged by last year’s wildfires because of the risk heavy rain would trigger mud and debris flows on charred hillsides. Significant road closures and travel delays were possible in the Los Angeles area given risks of flash flooding and rockslides, the NWS reported. An even bigger storm was brewing out at sea and set to hit the coast on Wednesday, Accuweather reported. Areas north of Santa Barbara were likely to see up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) of rain. As much as seven feet of snow was possible over 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) in the Sierra Nevada mountains. “The big one is still out in the middle of the Pacific,” said AccuWeather meteorologist John Gresiak. “It’s a very powerful storm.” The weather is a boon for California’s farmers and ski areas, given most of the state is recovering from years of drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor. The wild weather is the result of moisture-laden winds from the Pacific known as “atmospheric rivers.” The first storm will reach the U.S. Midwest and Northeast on Thursday and Friday, gathering more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The second storm will hit the central and eastern United States through the weekend, Gresiak said.

2019-01-15,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition-run Congress declared President Nicolas Maduro a “usurper” on Tuesday, and the U.S. government indicated its support for an opposition leader, ratcheting up pressure on the socialist president as he embarks on a disputed second term.  U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was considering recognising the leader of the Congress, Juan Guaido, as the country’s legitimate president, according to two people familiar with the matter. White House aides were weighing such a move among a list of options being prepared for Trump in response to the latest Venezuela developments but no final decision had been made, one of the people told Reuters. Maduro was inaugurated on Jan. 10 under an avalanche of criticism that his leadership was illegitimate following a 2018 election widely viewed as fraudulent, with countries around the world disavowing his government. The United States and many Latin American nations say Maduro has become a dictator whose failed state-led policies have plunged Venezuela into its worst ever economic crisis, with no recovery in sight. Maduro says that a U.S.-directed “economic war” is trying to force him from power. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence spoke by phone on Tuesday with Guaido to express U.S. support for Congress as the “only legitimate democratic body in the country,” a White House official said. Venezuela’s Congress on Tuesday also approved a measure asking dozens of foreign governments to freeze bank accounts controlled by Maduro’s government. The measure calls on the United States, European Union and several Latin American governments to instruct regulatory agencies to “prohibit any movement of liquid assets by the Venezuelan state in local bank accounts.” The United States and EU have already imposed sanctions that limit the sale of Venezuelan government debt and freeze assets belonging to Maduro and a number of his top officials. A White House spokesman, asked if further sanctions were in the pipeline, said the United States was considering “all diplomatic, political, and economic tools in its arsenal in response to the usurpation of power by the illegitimate Maduro regime.” The pro-government Supreme Court, which has been in conflict with the legislature since the opposition took Congress over in 2016, has preemptively invalidated any laws passed by the body. Guaido, a newcomer on the national scene who was elected to head Congress on Jan. 5, said last week he was willing to replace Maduro as interim president if he had the support of the military, with the aim of then calling free elections.  “Our roadmap is clear: to achieve the end of the usurpation via national unity and internal and external pressure,” Guaido wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post published on Tuesday. In Washington, a person familiar with the matter said any U.S. decision to recognise Guaido would be complicated by the fact that he has not declared himself president or even stated an intention to do so. Such a move by the Trump administration could also backfire if Maduro took action to prevent Guaido from being sworn in or used it as a pretext to detain him again. There would also be the question of how to deal with Venezuela’s diplomatic personnel in Washington, the person said. Several Venezuelan government officials have said Guaido should be arrested for treason and on Sunday he was briefly detained by intelligence agents. Diosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative superbody elected in 2017 that gives the ruling Socialist Party sweeping powers, said on Tuesday the opposition in Congress were “the only ones trying to usurp power.” Opposition lawmakers are also discussing a future amnesty for government officials and military officers who reject Maduro and help bring about a return to democracy. The measures are unlikely to be enforced in the short term. The country’s top military commanders pledged loyalty to Maduro immediately after his swearing-in.

2019-01-15,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp’s shares and bonds fell sharply for a second day on Tuesday, as a failure to make interest payments by the California power utility added to investor nerves following the company’s plans to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The state’s biggest private utility’s shares have lost 71 percent of their value since the start of January, when the company began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for California’s catastrophic wildfire in November. PG&E’s shares lost 52 percent of their value on Monday after the company said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 protection, and they closed down 18 percent on Tuesday. PG&E missed interest payment of about $21.6 million of its 2040 bond due Tuesday, per regulatory filing and the company said it has a 30-day grace period to make the interest payment. California politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state’s largest private utility to fail. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&E stay solvent, but no decisions had been made. PG&E said on Tuesday that Rothschild Inc banker Roger Kimmel had resigned from the company’s board, adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations. Rothschild did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires. The company’s chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires. The doctrine, known as “inverse condemnation”, exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. That legal rule could keep PG&E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter. Still, analysts from Chicago-based brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value. “The most likely near-term scenario is a fourth-quarter  2018 accounting charge that cuts PG&E’s book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure,” they said. “Our new fair value estimate for PG&E is $11 per share after considering possible bankruptcy scenarios.” Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham",https://uk.reuters.com/article/pge-us-bankruptcy/update-1-pge-plunges-for-second-day-after-step-toward-bankruptcy-idUKL3N1ZF5KV,15 Jan 2019,"PG&E Corp's shares and bonds fell

2019-01-15,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department intends to temporarily recall some workers furloughed by the partial federal government shutdown to prepare an upcoming Gulf of Mexico oil lease sale, using funds left over from last year, according to a department document. The move would add to the administration’s push on its energy portfolio despite the partial shutdown triggered last month by President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign funding legislation that excludes money for his proposed border wall with Mexico. “If the lapse in appropriations extends past January 15, additional personnel will be designated as exempt to complete work to publish Proposed Notice for Gulf of Mexico Sale 253 and Final Notice of Sale and Record of Decision for Gulf of Mexico Sale 252,” Interior said in its shutdown contingency plan. “These employees will be designated as exempt for only the amount of time needed to complete this work. They will be funded through carryover,” it said. The Interior Department’s Sale 252 is scheduled for March, and will offer some 78 million acres (31.5 million hectares) across the Gulf of Mexico region. Recent lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico have drawn relatively weak interest from oil and gas drillers doing well in lower-cost onshore plays, despite the administration’s efforts to pump up the region with lower royalty rates. The Interior Department is already keeping some personnel working on other energy efforts it says are exempted from the shutdown, including the Trump administration’s push for the expansion of oil drilling on sensitive, federally owned lands in Arctic Alaska.

2019-01-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 3 percent on Tuesday, along with world stock markets, supported by China’s plan to introduce policies to stabilize a slowing economy, reversing the previous session’s losses due to grim data in the world’s second-largest economy. Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.65, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $60.64 a barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 ended $1.60, or 3.2 percent, higher at $52.11 a barrel.  “Some of the fears about the economic slowdown in 2019 seem to have ebbed away,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The market is latching on to news that suggests that the economy may be better than thought.” China’s National Development and Reform Commission offered some support on Tuesday, signaling it might roll out more fiscal stimulus. This countered negative sentiment from Monday when crude prices fell more than 2 percent after data showed weakening imports and exports in China.  However, both oil benchmarks pared gains slightly in post-settlement trade after British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit divorce deal by a crushing margin, triggering political upheaval that could lead to a disorderly exit from the European Union or even to a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave. Parliament voted 432-202 against her deal, raising economic uncertainty that weighed on markets. Fundamentally, output cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, have begun to reduce fears of oversupply. The group, known as OPEC+, agreed in late 2018 to cut supply starting this month, seeking to rein in a global glut. OPEC+ have set a meeting for March 17 to 18 to monitor implementation of their pact, sources told Reuters, and another  meeting on April 17 to 18 to decide on whether to extend cuts beyond the agreed six months. Further support has come from data showing the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new oil dipped slightly so far this year. Also, analysts in a Reuters poll, ahead of weekly industry data on Tuesday and a government report on Wednesday, expected U.S. crude stockpiles to have fallen for a second straight week.  The rig data could signal a slowing of the swift rise in output from the United States, which became the world’s top oil producer in 2018. C-OUT-T-EIA. In the longer term, U.S. crude output is expected to rise to a new record of more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and to climb to nearly 13 million bpd next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its first 2020 forecast. (GRAPHICS: U.S. oil production, drilling & storage levels - tmsnrt.rs/2GVNTmb)  The market also found support in news that the U.S. will not grant further waivers to its sanctions on Iran. U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said on Saturday that Washington was not looking to grant any more waivers for Iranian oil after the reimposition of U.S. sanctions. The move could limit Iranian oil coming the market in coming months. Such positive signals and hopes for renewed U.S.-China talks to resolve trade tensions have boosted world stock markets and oil prices, but fears about global growth weigh heavily. “It would seem that the market is having a rather hard time making up its mind as to which story to believe in,” consultancy JBC Energy said.

2019-01-15,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern forces loyal to commander Khalifa Haftar have launched a military operation in southern Libya to secure oil and gas facilities and fight extremists, a spokesman said on Tuesday, a move that may alarm the authorities in Tripoli in the west. Haftar, whose powerbase is the eastern city of Benghazi, leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls the east of the North African nation and major oil ports in the region. “We announce the start of an operation to liberate the south,” LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters in Benghazi. He said the operation’s goals included protecting local and foreign oil firms, fighting Islamic State and other extremists, and tackling illegal migration. He gave few other details about the initiative, but any advance on oilfields in the south by Haftar’s forces could be opposed by Libya’s internationally recognised administration in Tripoli, which lies in the west of the OPEC nation. Other military sources told Reuters several LNA units had moved in recent days from Benghazi to Sabha, the biggest city in the south of Libya that lies in the same southwestern region as El Sharara, Libya’s biggest oilfield. El Sharara, more than 200 km (125 miles) from Sabha, has been closed since December due to a protest by tribesmen and state guards demanding salary payments and development in the area. It was not immediately clear whether the LNA forces were headed to El Sharara. El Feel oilfield, a smaller production facility in the area, has not been affected by protests. Haftar has become a major player in Libya since his forces seized Benghazi in 2017, after a three-year battle mainly with Islamist fighters. Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the state-owned National Oil Company, has said he would not reopen the 315,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) El Sharara field without a new security arrangement. He had demanded a change of leadership of the state oil guards, parts of which NOC has previously accused of being behind the field occupation, plus training for the force to make it more professional, and the creation of “Green Zones” within the field to prevent unauthorized access among other measures. Tripoli-based NOC has struggled to keep national oil production steady because armed groups or tribesmen have often forced the closure of El Sharara and other oilfields. Libyan output has been hovering around 1 million bpd, well below the 1.6 million bpd produced before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and plunged the nation into chaos. Security in southern Libya is very poor given its remoteness from the main population centres on the northern coast and the overall breakdown of law and order since 2011. The region has frequently experienced clashes between tribes and armed groups.

2019-01-15,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Corruption-ensnared Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] has proposed that creditors take over its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, in exchange for reducing Odebrecht’s huge debt load, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. The move is the latest sign of the radical way in which Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht, best known for its engineering and construction operations, is remaking itself to renegotiate 70 billion reais (£15 billion) in consolidated debt. Accused of bribing politicians and executives to get contracts throughout Latin America, Odebrecht made a deal two years ago with U.S, Brazilian and Swiss authorities, paying a record $3.5 billion (£2.8 billion) in fines to settle charges. Atvos has about 12 billion reais in debt with various lenders, including state-controlled Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA), Caixa Economica Federal and development bank BNDES, as well as private Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA), Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) and Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA). Another creditor is U.S. investment management firm Lone Star Funds, one of the sources added. A debt-for-equity swap would give Atvos more time to recover without selling plants, a potential alternative to paying off debt. Both sources, who requested anonymity because the talks are private, said this week that a sale of Atvos’ assets would not be enough to pay off all outstanding debt. The sources added that a final decision has not yet been made regarding a swap and that an agreement to transfer Atvos ownership may not be reached. Atvos is Brazil’s second largest ethanol company after Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and energy firm Cosan (RLOG3.SA). Atvos’ net debt is equivalent to about 10 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. By comparison, debt for the sector’s best-run companies is double EBITDA or less. In preliminary discussions with creditors, Odebrecht said it wanted lenders to swap most of their debt in Atvos for control of the company, but family-owned company Odebrecht wants to keep a minority stake. The sizes of the stakes have yet to be determined, the sources added.  The largest chunk of Atvos debt is held by state-controlled banks, mainly Banco do Brasil and BNDES, one source said. Banco do Brasil, Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter. Odebrecht, Itau, BNDES and Lone Star Funds did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The ethanol company has crushing capacity of 37 million tonnes of sugar cane per year, but has been operating at a much lower level due to financial problems. In the 2017/2018 crop, Atvos processed 25.8 million tonnes, according its annual report. Odebrecht hired consultancy Canaplan to assess how much debt Atvos’ cash flow could handle, and the firm will present a report to lenders about a new business plan. In November, the corruption-ensnared conglomerate hired advisers to restructure a portion of its bank and bond debt.

Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong surged almost 2 percent after U.S. President Trump talked up chances of a China trade deal and Chinese officials then came out in force hinting at more stimulus for their slowing economy. That came a day after data on Monday showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply. “China feels some pressure to at least keep the negotiations going and that could be enough for now, for markets to have an idea that some deal is possible, perhaps in a couple of months, not anytime soon,” said Jeroen Blokland, portfolio manager for multi-asset strategies at Robeco in Rotterdam. On Wall Street, a nearly 7 percent gain in shares of Netflix , which said it was raising rates for its U.S. subscribers, helped boost stocks, while JPMorgan Chase & Co ‘s shares were near flat despite reporting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and revenue, hurt by weakness in bond trading. U.S. stocks slightly pared gains after Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not see much progress made on structural issues during trade talks with China last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 119.24 points, or 0.5 percent, to 24,029.08, the S&P 500 gained 24.65 points, or 0.95 percent, to 2,607.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.25 points, or 1.61 percent, to 7,017.16. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.68 percent. Germany reported its weakest growth in five years, causing the euro to decline against the dollar. The euro was last down 0.71 percent, at $1.1393, while Europe’s broad FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.47 percent, to 1,373.38. Sterling slipped ahead of a parliamentary vote on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. It was last trading at $1.2719, down 1.12 percent on the day. Worries about Britain leaving the EU at the end of March without some kind of transition deal appear to have eased, but with Prime Minister Theresa May potentially facing the biggest defeat for a government plan in 95 years, uncertainty still dominates. May’s hopes of keeping her plan alive will hinge on the scale of her expected loss in the vote. Avoiding a heavy defeat could give her the chance to ask Brussels for more concessions before trying to get the plan through parliament in another vote. But a humiliating outcome could pressure May to delay Britain’s scheduled March 29 EU departure and potentially open up other options, ranging from a second referendum, to a dangerous no-deal path or a general election. In commodities, oil prices rebounded on supply cuts by producer club OPEC and Russia. Brent crude was last up $1.53, or up 2.59 percent, at $60.52 a barrel. U.S. crude was last up $1.52, or up 3.01 percent, at $52.03 per barrel. U.S. Treasury yields were mostly little changed amid negative external factors such as weak European data and concerns over the Brexit deal. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.7112 percent, from 2.71 percent late on Monday. Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New York, Marc

U.S. crude production is forecast to climb 1.14 million bpd to 12.07 million bpd in 2019 and an additional 790,000 bpd in 2020 to 12.86 million bpd, the statistics arm of the U.S. Energy Department said in a monthly report. The United States has become the world’s largest crude producer, boosted by output from shale formations, with production of nearly 11 million barrels in 2018, which broke the country’s annual record set in 1970. “Steady growth from non-OPEC countries, including the United States, headlines the forecast for global crude oil production through 2020,” Linda Capuano, EIA administrator said in comments issued following the forecast. “We expect the United States to remain the world’s largest producer.” The forecast indicates that the U.S. will become a net crude exporter in late 2020. U.S. demand for diesel and other distillate fuels is expected to rise 20,000 bpd to 4.15 million bpd in 2019 and to rise to 4.19 million in 2020, the agency said. U.S. gasoline demand in 2018 was seen at 9.29 million bpd, down from 9.31 million bpd previously.

2019-01-15,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s power system operator has requested that 662 transformers made by General Electric Co (GE.N) be removed from the country’s grid after a number of explosions involving the devices, according to document seen by Reuters.         The document, which was prepared by Brazil’s grid operator ONS and submitted to the Ministry of Mines and Energy in early December, says 53 GE transformers have exploded in the past six years, suggesting that the incidents may be associated with the product or its materials. They are all the same transformer model.      There is no evidence that anyone was injured in those explosions. ONS confirmed in a statement that it had made the request to change some GE transformers after finding they “present a failure rate that is superior to what is expected for that equipment.” It did not specify the number of transformers or  incidents that led to the request. GE said it was aware of the incidents but that it had not seen the ONS report.”Currently, there is no evidence that the cause could be related to the design, the materials or the product’s manufacturing,” GE said in a statement, after Reuters provided it with excerpts of the report. The company said the transformers were used around the world.  GE pointed to the concentration of incidents in “one part of Brazil’s electric network.”  The problem has been on ONS’s radar since 2014 and it concluded that similar incidents had not been recorded with other transformer manufacturers or different GE models, according to the document, which Reuters obtained through Brazil’s access to public information law.       A source at a local utility, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said that the position of his employer and its peers is that “there is a systemic problem with the manufacturer, and not with the operators.”     The source said the company had taken measures to avoid potential harm from the explosions.  ONS’s recommendation comes as GE tries to restructure its struggling power division amid falling revenues and it follows reports of problems with other products, including gas turbines in several countries.

2019-01-15,"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe’s military put on a show of force to deter further unrest on Tuesday after at least three deaths in violent protests over steep fuel price hikes, but continuing disorder blocked the flow of key supplies into the country. Zimbabweans accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa of failing to live up to pre-election pledges to kick-start growth, having seen their purchasing power eroded by hyper-inflation, and of resorting to armed forces to crush dissent like strongman predecessor Robert Mugabe.  Mnangagwa has promised a clean break from the 37-year era of Mugabe, who was forced out in a de facto coup in November 2017. But residents said the army was beating up suspected protesters in various townships. “We are suffering. Mnangagwa has failed this country. Enough is enough, we no longer want this,” protester Takura Gomba said in Warren Park, a Harare township, while retreating with others as soldiers approached in trucks.  Amnesty International condemned the military crackdown, saying at least 200 people had been arbitrarily detained and calling on Zimbabwean authorities to ensure restraint by security forces and respect the public’s right to protest. Monday’s street disturbances followed sharp increases in fuel prices decreed by Mnangagwa, five months after post-election violence during which six people died when the army intervened to quell trouble.   As security forces faced accusations of heavy-handedness and more protests threatened to break out, Labour Minister Sekai Nzenza announced that public workers would get a monthly supplement of between 5 and 23 percent of their salaries from January to March while wage negotiations with unions continued. Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba told reporters that a police officer was stoned to death by protesters in Zimbabwe’s second city Bulawayo on Monday, while two other people died during protests in Chitungwiza, south of Harare, and Kadoma, west of the capital. Mnangagwa, who is on an official visit in Moscow, said Zimbabwe was interested in receiving Russian loans and might need Moscow’s help in modernising its army, RIA news agency reported.  In Harare and Bulawayo, banks, schools, businesses and the stock market remained shut as many residents stayed at home.  A human rights lawyers’ group said it had received reports of soldiers and police breaking into homes in townships overnight and assaulting suspected demonstrators. Security forces deployed in population centres to stave off further demonstrations, witnesses said, and people in Harare said they could no longer access the internet.  Amnesty, in a statement, said the internet was cut off to prevent people from supporting or organising protests while critics said the government sought to prevent images of its heavyhandedness from being broadcast around the world.  Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said she was not aware of an internet shutdown. Reports of violent disorder prompted southern African bus lines to suspend services into Zimbabwe, interrupting the flow of goods into Zimbabwe from the diaspora in adjacent countries.  “We can’t proceed because they are saying things are tough there. Buses are being burned. Roads are blocked. It’s a total shutdown,” said Alexio Chirisa. He had been driving a bus full of passengers from the South African city of Port Elizabeth to Harare but was forced to park in Johannesburg on Tuesday.  With Zimbabwe’s banks strapped for cash, shipping essential daily commodities like rice and cooking oil to families from their relatives abroad has become a favoured alternative to cash remittances.  “Years of political and economic mismanagement has brought Zimbabwe’s economy to its knees. Millions of Zimbabweans are terrified about the knock-on effects that the fuel increases will have on their daily lives, including for food and healthcare,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.

2019-01-15,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Electricity prices charged to German households by local utilities have reached record highs, driven by high wholesale and carbon prices that are passed down to consumers, internet portal Check24 said on Tuesday, adding gas prices were also up. “Consumers are paying a new record price for power. The main reason was the higher costs for carbon emission rights prices,” said Oliver Bohr, managing director of the portal’s energy section. “Consumers must continue to reckon with high prices in future, a relief is not in sight,” he added. Check24 looked at 834 local utilities that included municipal companies in cities such as Frankfurt, Aachen and Bremen, finding 500 had hiked prices in January, or announced that they would do so shortly. The increases averaged 5.1 percent and applied to some 4.7 million households.  Check24 did not take into account a total of 66 other private sector utilities, including integrated operators such as Innogy (IGY.DE) or asset-free supply firms that operate nationwide, but these show a similar trend. A typical household buying from a local supplier that consumes 5,000 kilowatt hours a year is now paying 1,437 euros per annum, 46 percent more than in 2007, Check24 said. Day-ahead wholesale power prices last year rose 28.9 percent to 44.5 euros ($50.89) a megawatt hour (MWh), according to data from think-tank Agora.  Generators were faced with high gas and coal prices in the global market where demand for fuels expanded, while the cost of European carbon emissions rights prices more than doubled as a result of measures to curb supply.  Other big contributors to final power bills, renewable support fees and grid transport costs, were relatively stable. State charges and taxes, mainly to support the renewable sector, have reached 52.8 percent of German customers’ final bills, helping to make German retail energy prices the highest in Europe alongside Denmark.  Power grid costs make up 24.4 percent, and procurement and distribution 22.8 percent, of final power bills. As for gas, Check24 recorded 297 price raising intentions so far in 2019 among 710 companies it monitored in January.  Gas prices on the European bourse gained 50 percent between March and October last year, partly owing to a link to higher crude oil price levels.  The latest increases averaged 8.6 percent and applied to three million households. A household using 20,000 kWh a year now pays 1,236 euros.

2019-01-15,"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Shares in California power company PG&E fell sharply for a second day on Tuesday as investors took fright at the prospect of bankruptcy proceedings to protect from $30 billion in potential liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The state’s biggest private utility’s shares have lost 75 percent of their stock value since the start of January, when the company first began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for the fires. Shares lost 52 percent of their value on Monday after the company said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 protection , and they were down another 28 percent in morning trade in New York. California politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state’s largest private utility to fail. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&E stay solvent, but no decisions had been made. PG&E said on Tuesday that Rothschild Inc banker Roger Kimmel had resigned from the company’s board, adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations. Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, while PG&E declined to comment. PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires. Its chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires. The doctrine, known as “inverse condemnation,” exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. That legal rule could keep PG&E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter. Still, analysts from Chicago-based brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value. “The most likely near-term scenario is a fourth-quarter 2018 accounting charge that cuts PG&E’s book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure,” they said. “Our new fair value estimate for PG&E is $11 per share after considering possible bankruptcy scenarios.” It was trading at around $6 half an hour after opening on Wall Street.

2019-01-15,"(Adds comments from president, background) MEXICO CITY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday that widespread fuel theft extended to oil drilling platforms and he pledged to take actions to alleviate shortages sparked by his crackdown on gasoline thieves. Lopez Obrador said there had been “acts of sabotage at crude oil drilling platforms,” without providing further details. “We have identified the problem and we are also going to face it,” he said at a press conference. In a bid to halt rampant fuel theft, Lopez Obrador has ordered the closure of important fuel pipelines, which has caused shortages at gas stations and concerns of an impact to the economy if the shortfalls are prolonged. Lopez Obrador said that the government was looking at purchasing an additional 500 tanker trucks to distribute gasoline and that officials were asking private companies to increase fuel imports. “Very soon things will go back to normal,” he said. “We are on the way to solving the problem in a definitive way.” Lopez Obrador’s offensive against fuel robbers marks the leftist’s first major effort to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. A poll released last weekend showed the crackdown was polarizing the population, though more people support the measure than oppose it. Fuel inventories have been accumulating at major oil terminals and Mexico’s freight transport association expects a contingency plan aimed at speeding up gasoline distribution that began over the weekend will help ease bottlenecks.

Haftar, whose powerbase is the eastern city of Benghazi, leads the Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls the east of the North African nation and major oil ports in the region. “We announce the start of an operation to liberate the south,” LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari told reporters in Benghazi. He said the operation’s goals included protecting local and foreign oil firms, fighting Islamic State and other extremists, and tackling illegal migration. He gave few other details about the initiative, but any advance on oilfields in the south by Haftar’s forces could be opposed by Libya’s internationally recognised administration in Tripoli, which lies in the west of the OPEC nation. Other military sources told Reuters several LNA units had moved in recent days from Benghazi to Sabha, the biggest city in the south of Libya that lies in the same southwestern region as El Sharara, Libya’s biggest oilfield. El Sharara, more than 200 km (125 miles) from Sabha, has been closed since December due to a protest by tribesmen and state guards demanding salary payments and development in the area. It was not immediately clear whether the LNA forces were headed to El Sharara. El Feel oilfield, a smaller production facility in the area, has not been affected by protests. Haftar has become a major player in Libya since his forces seized Benghazi in 2017, after a three-year battle mainly with Islamist fighters. Mustafa Sanalla, chairman of the state-owned National Oil Company, has said he would not reopen the 315,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) El Sharara field without a new security arrangement, although he has not specified what that should be. Tripoli-based NOC has struggled to keep national oil production steady because armed groups or tribesmen have often forced the closure of El Sharara and other oilfields. Libyan output has been hovering around 1 million bpd, well below the 1.6 million bpd produced before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and plunged the nation into chaos. Security in southern Libya is very poor given its remoteness from the main population centres on the northern coast and the overall breakdown of law and order since 2011. The region has frequently experienced clashes between tribes and armed groups.

2019-01-15,"(Adds detail) By Nerijus Adomaitis SANDEFJORD, Norway, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Norway awarded a record 83 blocks to explore for petroleum resources in mature areas of the Norwegian continental shelf, in a sign of continuing interest from oil companies in the country’s oil sector, the energy ministry said on Tuesday. A lack of large discoveries on the shelf has prompted concerns that Norway’s top industry, which employs about 170,000 people directly and indirectly, could fall into decline. The government hopes that offering more licenses could trigger more activity. “This is the largest licensing award on the Norwegian continental shelf. Fifty-three years after the first licensing round, this new record confirms the industry’s belief in continued value creation and activity in Norway,” Oil and Energy Minister Kjell-Boerge Freiberg said. A total of 38 oil companies had submitted bids for acreage offshore Norway in the so-called predefined areas (APA) licensing round by last September’s application deadline. Western Europe’s largest oil producer is expected to see its oil output decline this year to its lowest level in three decades, before rebounding next year. The government handed out 37 licenses in the North Sea, 32 in the Norwegian Sea and 14 in the Barents Sea in areas near the existing discoveries. Altogether, 21 oil firms received operatorships. Norway’s majority state-owned oil and gas firm Equinor was awarded the majority, with 13 operatorships. Aker BP was awarded 11 operatorships, while Sweden’s Lundin won 9. Norway’s DNO and Britain’s Faroe Petroleum together won 9 operatorships. Middle East-focused DNO, which returned to the North Sea, recently won a hostile bid to acquire Faroe. DEA and Wintershall, which have agreed to merge, have received a combined five operatorships. The other companies that received operatorships and stakes in licenses include oil majors Total, Shell and ConocoPhillips, as well as Eni’s Norwegian subsidiary Vaar Energy. When announcing the round last May, the government expanded the pre-defined areas near the existing discoveries by a total of 103 blocks.

2019-01-15,"* Total hires Jefferies to run sale process * Sale to raise up to $400 million * Gas fields near end of life, decommissioning By Ron Bousso LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Total has launched the sale of its offshore gas fields in the Netherlands, a move that would mark the French energy giant’s exit from Dutch upstream production after 55 years, industry and banking sources said. The Paris-based company hired investment bank Jefferies in December to run the process that could raise $300 to $400 million, according to the sources. Total had no immediate comment and Jefferies declined to comment. Total’s platforms in the Netherlands are nearing the end of their life after gas reserves have dwindled in recent decades. Many of the platforms will require dismantling, a process known as decommissioning, which could carry tax credits to the benefit of the owners, the sources said. Total’s production in the Netherlands was around 41 billion cubic feet of gas, or around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2017, down from 25,000 boed the previous year as a result of the natural decline of fields and the shutdown of two fields, according to its 2017 annual report. Total, which started its Dutch activities in 1964, holds interests in 24 offshore production licences, of which it operates 20. Upstream production aside, Total has a 55 stake in the Zeeland refinery in the Netherlands. It also operates a gas and power wholesale business in the country. Total, like many of its peers, has sold out of ageing assets in the North Sea in recent years to focus on new developments. Smaller, often privately-owned companies, have progressively taken over many of the assets. Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London and Felix

2019-01-15,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) next month will start to drop plastic straws from its products and is working on biodegradable water bottles in a drive to reduce plastic waste, it said on Tuesday. The steps are part of a campaign launched last year by firms including the Swiss group, the world’s biggest packaged food company, to make all packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.  They come amid a global crackdown on throw-away items that can languish for years in oceans and landfills. Nestle said from February it would start using alternative materials such as paper and adopt designs to replace plastic straws and reduce litter. Nestle’s bottled water unit Nestle Waters would increase the recycled PET, a type of plastic, content in its bottles to 35 percent by 2025 globally and reach 50 percent in the United States, with a specific focus on its Poland Spring brand. It would raise the recycled PET content for some European water brands to half by 2025.  Nestle was developing new paper-based materials and biodegradable polymers that are also recyclable. “This could become a valuable option in places where recycling infrastructure does not yet exist and will not be available for some time,” it said in a statement. Nestle said it was collaborating with U.S.-based Danimer Scientific to develop a marine biodegradable and recyclable bottle for its water business, and with PureCycle Technologies to produce food-grade recycled polypropylene, a polymer used for packing food in trays, tubs, cups and bottles.  Magdi Batato, Nestle’s global head of operations, said the company was still assessing the potential impact on products’ shelf life and manufacturing costs.     “Some of those alternative solutions are even cheaper, some of them are cost neutral and indeed some of them are more expensive,” he told reporters on a call.

2019-01-15,"* Exports to Middle East surge to 158,000 bpd in Jan -Kpler * Reformate exports to China jump after long hiatus * European gasoline cracks near six-year lows * Europe to Middle East exports: tmsnrt.rs/2RJDaja * ARA weekly gasoline stocks: tmsnrt.rs/2HbZii7 By Ron Bousso and Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European exports of gasoline to the Middle East and Asia have surged so far in January as high inventories in the Atlantic basin and a drop in fuel prices sparked bargain-hunting around the world. Profit margins for distilling crude oil into gasoline in Europe have held near a six-year low since late October after global demand for the road fuel disappointed during the peak summer driving season. Exports from Europe to the U.S. East Coast, traditionally the main outlet for surplus gasoline, dropped in the second half of 2018, leading to sharp stock builds. In recent days, however, bookings to carry gasoline and blending components out of Europe to the Middle East and Asia have shown strong signs of a recovery. So far, some 158,000 barrels per day (bpd), or roughly 587,000 tonnes of gasoline, have been booked out of Europe to the Middle East in January, according to data intelligence company Kpler. The January figure, which is expected to rise further, already represents a 50 percent increase from the full December figure, according to the data. Middle East demand has been strong since a gasoline-producing unit at Abu Dhabi’s 800,000 bpd Ruwais refinery was destroyed in a fire more than two years ago. The 127,000 bpd residue fluid catalytic cracker (RFCC) is expected to come back online in the first quarter of 2019. At the same time, exports to China of reformate, a component blended into gasoline in order to increase its octane content, surged in January, according to traders. Around six tankers carrying roughly 240,000 tonnes of reformate have been booked out of Europe for January, according to shipping data. That compares with no deliveries in the second half of January, according to traders. Most gasoline exports from Europe in recent months headed to West Africa, where Nigeria regularly buys large volumes, as flows to the United States eased. Exports to West Africa, however, came to a near standstill in recent weeks due to congestion outside ports, traders said. “The arbitrage from Europe into the U.S. East Coast isn’t open, leaving Asia and the Middle East as the only outlets,” said Robert Campbell, head of global oil products at consultancy Energy Aspects. “Global demand has been surprisingly weak, particularly in the United States but also in places like Mexico, where distribution disruptions led to a drop in U.S. exports,” he added. Global inventories of gasoline and light distillates rose sharply in recent months, and in the first week of January were 16 million barrels higher than a year ago, according to consultancy FGE. The gains were driven mostly by an 8.1-million-barrel gain in stocks in the United States. European gasoline stocks remain close to an all-time high.

2019-01-15,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Pound near 2-month high before Brexit vote * Euro kicked lower by soft German economic data * Oil nudges higher on supply cut talk * Bond yields slip lower after weak data, friendly Fed * JP Morgan earnings miss scuffs Wall Street futures By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Spluttering noises from Germany and an earnings miss from banking giant JP Morgan dragged back stocks on Tuesday, while Britain’s pound hovered near a two-month high ahead of a crucial parliamentary vote on Brexit. Most European markets started in good spirits after attempts by Washington and Beijing to play down the risks associated with their trade war and sterling’s bizarrely positive twist on the looming Brexit drama. But things began to wobble when German reported its weakest growth in five years and then Wall Street futures flinched as JP Morgan blamed bond market volatility for lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2018 profits. There were still remnants of positive sentiment. Shanghai and Hong Kong stocks had gained almost 2 percent overnight after U.S. President Trump talked up the chances of a China trade deal and Chinese officials then came out in force hinting at more stimulus for their slowing economy. Tokyo had risen 1 percent on return from holiday too and Seoul ended up smartly as well. “It seems like a coordinated effort (between the U.S. and China),” said Saxo Bank’s head of global equities strategy, Peter Garnry, highlighting how the Federal Reserve had also scaled back talk of multiple U.S. rate hikes. “For now at least it seems to be working,” he added, given that China’s plans to cut some taxes showed its policymakers were starting to wake up to its problems. All other focus was largely on Britain’s Brexit gyrations. The pound barely budged at $1.2860 and was up 0.2 percent at 88.88 pence per euro in London, having strengthened steadily in recent weeks. But the surface calm was deceptive. Worries of Britain plunging out of the EU at the end of March without some kind of transition deal appear to have eased but with May potentially facing the biggest defeat for a UK government plan in 95 years, uncertainty still dominates. May’s hopes of keeping her plan alive will hinge on the scale of her expected loss. Avoiding a heavy defeat could give her the chance to ask Brussels for more concessions before trying to get the plan through parliament in another vote. But a humiliating outcome could pressure her to delay Britain’s scheduled March 29 EU departure date and potentially open up other options, ranging from a second referendum, the dangerous no deal path or even a general election. “We are recommending our clients not to take strong positions on the pound or the equity markets,” Garnry added. The vote was due around 1900 GMT. Euro zone government bond yields tested six-month lows after the weak German economic data that had also hurt the euro. The overall impact of Brexit on German economic growth is also “impossible to quantify”, an official of the statistics office said in Berlin. Overnight, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan recovered from early losses and advanced 1.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi hit a one-month high and Japan’s Nikkei added 1 percent. China’s CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares ended up almost 2 percent too amid the expectations of more government policy measures to prop up a slowing economy. China’s state planner said it would aim to achieve “a good start” in the first quarter for the economy in a signal of more growth-boosting steps. State television also quoted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as saying the government is seeking to establish conditions helpful to meeting this year’s economic goals. That came after data on Monday showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply. Cyclical shares had led the broader gains. Australian financial shares also hit their highest since early December while Japanese electronics and machinery-maker shares rose to their best levels in six weeks. Local currency emerging market government debt, which was pounded last year when investors dumped riskier assets on the trade war worries, rallied to a near one-year high. “It appears some contrarian investors are starting to buy cyclicals, looking beyond the last economic slowdown,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “But I would suspect there will be heavy selling if we go up further, to around 2,650 in the S&P500 and 21,500 in the Nikkei,” Kuramochi added. Back in the currency markets the weaker euro meant the dollar was up for a third day in the last four against a basket of top world currencies. In commodities, meanwhile, oil prices rebounded on supply cuts by producer club OPEC and Russia. International Brent crude oil futures were last at $59.95 per barrel, up 1.6 percent from their last close. U.S. crude futures stood at just over $51 per barrel, up 1.3 percent.

2019-01-15,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's trade and economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Anybody reading the commentary on China’s December trade figures would be left with the impression of an economy increasingly losing momentum amid a dispute with the United States. It was reasonable for analysts to zero in on the 4.4 percent drop in China’s December exports from a year earlier, a huge miss when a rise of 3 percent had been forecast. Imports also surprised on the downside, dropping 7.6 percent in December, the biggest decline since July 2016. The numbers do point to weakness in the world’s second-largest economy, and the trade dispute with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is getting much of the blame. The weakness in exports could be put down to the pull-forward effect in prior months as both producers and buyers stocked up ahead of the imposition of U.S. tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. The poor trade numbers also came despite efforts by Beijing to stimulate the economy in a series of measures, from looser credit to tax cuts to infrastructure spending. The trade data was grist to the mill for those taking the view that China’s economy is struggling, that the United States is “winning” the trade dispute, and that Beijing will be forced to compromise on Trump’s terms. This may well turn out to be the case, but there are also trade numbers that paint an entirely different view of the Chinese economy, namely the volume of commodity imports. Crude oil imports surged nearly 30 percent in December from the same month in 2017, reaching 10.31 million barrels per day (bpd), the second-highest monthly outcome on record. That hardly sounds like a weak outcome, even if the likely explanation is that smaller, independent refiners boosted purchases to use up 2018 import quotas before they expired. Overall, China’s 2018 crude imports rose by 10.1 percent to a record 9,24 million bpd, an increase of 846,000 bpd over 2017. Boosting annual crude imports by the equivalent of the total consumption of a country such as Netherlands cannot be construed as weak either. A history lesson on past-year crude imports, though, doesn’t say much about what’s likely to happen in 2019, but so far there is little reason to expect the imports to tail off. China is still building its strategic petroleum reserves and the sharp drop in crude prices in the previous months is likely to encourage more buying for storage. It’s not just crude oil. Imports of natural gas, by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG), hit a record high of 9.23 million tonnes in December, up 17 percent from the same month of 2017 and eclipsing the previous record high from November. That means China has imported record amounts of natural gas for two consecutive months, again, hard numbers that don’t quite tally with the view of an economy in distress. It could be the case that energy imports are staying strong, while those of metals, which are more exposed to weakness in manufacturing, are feeling more pain. Imports of unwrought copper dropped to 429,000 tonnes in December, down 4.7 percent from the same month in 2017 and by the same margin from November. Imports in November were also weaker than in the same month in 2017, indicating some softness toward the end of the year, notwithstanding the strong 12.9 percent gain in copper imports for 2018 as a whole. Iron ore imports also look uninspiring, with December’s 86.65 million tonnes up 3 percent from the same month a year earlier, but not enough to prevent a 1 percent drop across 2018 as a whole, the first annual decline since 2010. However, China’s steel output is likely to hit a record high in 2018, with output for the first 11 months rising 6.7 percent to 857.37 million tonnes from the same period in 2017. What this shows is that China’s switch to higher-grade iron ore in order to maximise the output of blast furnaces meant steel mills were able to boost production without having to import more iron ore. Again, this is hardly a weak outcome, but likewise doesn’t shed much light on the probable trends for 2019. Coal was one commodity that looked weak in December, with imports plunging 55 percent from the same month in 2017 to just 10.23 million tonnes. But this was entirely policy driven, with Beijing putting pressure on traders to curb imports as they didn’t want total inbound coal shipments in 2018 to exceed those for 2017. Despite the slump in December, imports for the full year were up 3.9 percent to 281.23 million tonnes, a four-year high. Coal imports may remain restrained in the early months of 2019 amid an official push to use more domestic coal to boost prices for local miners. Overall, if you were to assess the Chinese economy on its commodity imports, you’d likely reach quite a different conclusion than if you focused only on the U.S. dollar value of total exports and imports. Weaker commodity prices lowered the value of imports in the latter part of 2018, but if anything, also served to boost volumes. China’s economy does appear to be losing some growth momentum, but it doesn’t seem to make much sense to look only at imports and exports from a dollar perspective, and not take volumes into account.

2019-01-15,"(Repeats earlier column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HebsXA By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices are expected to oscillate close to current levels well into the next decade, averaging around $65-70 per barrel through 2023, according to an annual survey of energy professionals conducted by Reuters. Despite the recent slump in oil prices, forecasts have edged down by less than $5 per barrel compared with the last annual survey conducted at the start of 2018 and have changed little over the last three years. Long-term expectations for the average price of Brent crude remain anchored around $70 per barrel, close to the $72 average realised in 2018 (tmsnrt.rs/2HebsXA). The results are based on the responses from just over 1,000 energy market professionals to a poll conducted between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11. Brent prices in 2019 are expected to average $65 per barrel, unchanged from surveys in 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2020, Brent is also expected to average $65 per barrel, revised down by $5 or less compared with prior surveys. Far fewer respondents now see any risk of prices spiking to $100 or more by the end of the decade as a surge in U.S. shale output has eased fears of supply shortages. The proportion of respondents expecting prices to average more than $90 in 2020 has fallen to just 3 percent this year, from 13 percent at the time of the 2016 survey. By 2023, prices are still expected to average $70, with most forecasts between $60 and $80, which suggests most energy professionals think there will be enough production developed at this level to meet consumption growth. Among survey respondents, 26 percent are involved directly in oil and gas production (exploration, drilling, production, refining, marketing and field services). Most of the rest work in banking and finance (18 percent), research (9 percent), professional services (9 percent), hedge funds (8 percent) and physical commodity trading (6 percent). The results from respondents involved directly in the oil and gas industry were similar to those in other sectors. Oil and gas insiders and those outside the industry have more or less the same outlook for prices in 2019 and 2020. Insiders are marginally more bullish than outsiders on prices, but the difference is just $1.50 per barrel in 2019, rising to $3.50 by 2023. Respondents exhibit more certainty about prices this year and next compared with subsequent years, which is natural given that uncertainty tends to increase over longer time horizons. Responses for 2019-2020 are tightly clustered, while expectations for 2021-2023 exhibit more variation. Even so, few respondents expect average prices to fall below $55 or rise above $85 in the next five years. The level of uncertainty, as measured by the standard deviation of responses, has remained constant over the last four surveys. Short-term uncertainty has remained little changed, with the standard deviation of responses for the first forecast year at $8 in 2019, compared with $7 in 2018, $6 in 2017 and $8 in 2016. Long-term uncertainty has also held constant, with the standard deviation of forecasts for the fifth year at $19 in 2019, compared with $18 in 2018, $18 in 2017 and $20 in 2016. There is no significant difference between oil and gas industry insiders and outsiders, with the level of uncertainty similar in both groups for both short-term and long-term prices. Overall, most respondents expect the oil market to remain comfortably supplied in the foreseeable future with prices oscillating around the current level or a little higher and relatively moderate volatility.

2019-01-15,"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp’s chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep the utility owner perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires even beyond the more than $30 billion the company expects to face from recent blazes. The doctrine, known as “inverse condemnation,” exposes California utilities to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved.  That legal rule could keep PG&E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter.  PG&E on Monday said it was preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this month amid pressure from potentially staggering liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The most recent blaze engulfed the California mountain community of Paradise, destroying homes and killing at least 86 people in the most destructive wildfire in state history.  Once PG&E files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, creditors can no longer call loans or demand interest payments, lawsuits are paused, and other claimants have to get in line and be subject to the reorganization plan that the company develops. This could allow PG&E to settle disputes more effectively, and negotiate down its legal bill from the wildfires. PG&E is hoping it can exit bankruptcy in as little as two years, according to its advisers. It envisions no negative impact on its customers.  However, exiting bankruptcy could take longer if there are more wildfires while PG&E is in bankruptcy, a real threat given that climate change has turned the blazes into an annual occurrence. A bankruptcy judge could even refuse to approve PG&E’s reorganization and exit from court proceedings if the judge finds that inverse condemnation calls into question its future as a viable company, according to U.S. law.  “Inverse condemnation is a state law but a bankruptcy judge is god,” said Robert McCullough, principal at energy consulting firm McCullough Research in Portland, Oregon, noting that PG&E faces widespread lawsuits. “He’s going to have to figure out, once he releases the company from bankruptcy, if it’s actually a viable entity.” Private companies generally are not subject to this law, though it varies state by state, McCullough said. California’s laws are more extreme than most, he said. In a regulatory filing on Monday, PG&E questioned whether it could continue to operate as a so-called investor-owned utility while being exposed to that risk. PG&E’s exposure to inverse condemnation represents a key issue the utility owner hopes to address should it seek bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter.   PG&E challenged inverse condemnation in California’s Supreme Court unsuccessfully late last year. In a legal filing, the company noted that regulators decide how much private utilities such as PG&E can charge customers, limiting their ability to mitigate pain from crushing liabilities.  PG&E also highlighted in the legal argument a decision by regulators to deny another private utility’s request to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in uninsured costs resulting from settling claims related to wildfires.  That status quo will cause private utilities to “face increasing difficulty in obtaining capital from investors, threatening financial harm to the utilities and potentially rendering them economically unsustainable,” the company said in the petition to California’s highest court.  Absent a court intervention, it would be up to California’s state politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom, to come up with a legislative fix to inverse condemnation. “Bankruptcy is PG&E’s response to the risk of (inverse condemnation),” said Severin Borenstein, the faculty director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.  “That leads to the larger question of whether or not this bankruptcy leads to...how we have utilities in California, and if we move from private firms to government owned,” he said.  PG&E’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, filed for bankruptcy in 2001, offering hints on how much investors and creditors could recover this time. The subsidiary could not pay its bills during a California energy crisis caused by market manipulation that left consumers dealing with blackouts.  In PG&E’s 2001 bankruptcy, creditors were repaid in full, according to company statements, an unusual scenario most companies in financial distress do not achieve.  What is more, PG&E shares continued trading between 2001 and 2004, while the subsidiary was in bankruptcy, and never dropped below $6 per share, according to Refinitiv data. PG&E shares ended trading on Monday at $8.38. Most companies lose all equity value as they face bankruptcy. PG&E’s bonds traded sharply lower Monday after the company said it was preparing for bankruptcy, indicating that holders do not expect to recover all of their investment this time.

2019-01-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices are expected to oscillate close to current levels well into the next decade, averaging around $65-70 per barrel through 2023, according to an annual survey of energy professionals conducted by Reuters. Despite the recent slump in oil prices, forecasts have edged down by less than $5 per barrel compared with the last annual survey conducted at the start of 2018 and have changed little over the last three years. Long-term expectations for the average price of Brent crude remain anchored around $70 per barrel, close to the $72 average realised in 2018. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HebsXA) The results are based on the responses from just over 1,000 energy market professionals to a poll conducted between Jan. 8 and Jan. 11. Brent prices in 2019 are expected to average $65 per barrel, unchanged from surveys in 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2020, Brent is also expected to average $65 per barrel, revised down by $5 or less compared with prior surveys. Far fewer respondents now see any risk of prices spiking to $100 or more by the end of the decade as a surge in U.S. shale output has eased fears of supply shortages. The proportion of respondents expecting prices to average more than $90 in 2020 has fallen to just 3 percent this year, from 13 percent at the time of the 2016 survey. By 2023, prices are still expected to average $70, with most forecasts between $60 and $80, which suggests most energy professionals think there will be enough production developed at this level to meet consumption growth. Among survey respondents, 26 percent are involved directly in oil and gas production (exploration, drilling, production, refining, marketing and field services). Most of the rest work in banking and finance (18 percent), research (9 percent), professional services (9 percent), hedge funds (8 percent) and physical commodity trading (6 percent). The results from respondents involved directly in the oil and gas industry were similar to those in other sectors. Oil and gas insiders and those outside the industry have more or less the same outlook for prices in 2019 and 2020. Insiders are marginally more bullish than outsiders on prices, but the difference is just $1.50 per barrel in 2019, rising to $3.50 by 2023. Respondents exhibit more certainty about prices this year and next compared with subsequent years, which is natural given that uncertainty tends to increase over longer time horizons. Responses for 2019-2020 are tightly clustered, while expectations for 2021-2023 exhibit more variation. Even so, few respondents expect average prices to fall below $55 or rise above $85 in the next five years. The level of uncertainty, as measured by the standard deviation of responses, has remained constant over the last four surveys. Short-term uncertainty has remained little changed, with the standard deviation of responses for the first forecast year at $8 in 2019, compared with $7 in 2018, $6 in 2017 and $8 in 2016. Long-term uncertainty has also held constant, with the standard deviation of forecasts for the fifth year at $19 in 2019, compared with $18 in 2018, $18 in 2017 and $20 in 2016. There is no significant difference between oil and gas industry insiders and outsiders, with the level of uncertainty similar in both groups for both short-term and long-term prices. Overall, most respondents expect the oil market to remain comfortably supplied in the foreseeable future with prices oscillating around the current level or a little higher and relatively moderate volatility.  John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2019-01-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Supreme Court began hearing arguments on Tuesday on whether EU ships can fish for snow crab off Arctic islands north of Norway without permission from Oslo, a case that could decide who has the right to explore for oil in the region. At stake is whether the snow crab - whose meat is considered a delicacy by gourmets in Japan and South Korea - is a sedentary species living on the seabed or a fish stock that moves around - and who gets to decide about it.  If it is seen as a sedentary species, then it is a resource belonging to the continental shelf of Norway. If the EU can stake a claim over the snow crab, then it could be harder for Oslo to secure its claim over potential oil and gas resources.  “The question of the snow crab is a proxy for oil. Because what is valid for the snow crab is valid for the oil industry,” Oeystein Jensen, a senior research fellow in law at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo, told Reuters. The verdict is expected in three to four weeks.  The issue arises out of a conviction for illegal fishing of  an EU fishing vessel, the Senator, in the waters off the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago.  Norway, which is not a member of the EU, argued successfully in a lower court that the European Commission does not have the right to issue fishing licenses off Svalbard, over which Norway has sovereignty via a 1920 treaty.  The ship’s owner, Latvian fisherman Peteris Pildegovics, is appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court and seeks to assert a right to fish for snow crab off Svalbard. “There was no need for a Norwegian license,” Pildegovics told Reuters. “We followed the procedure. Norwegian authorities were kept fully informed.” Pildegovics estimated the loss of income due to the ship’s ongoing seizure at about 20 million euros a year. Norway says only it has the right to issue fishing license for snow crab.   “The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea - the constitution of the seas - is clear on this. It is only Norway as a coastal state that can give permission to fish on the Norwegian continental shelf,” Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in an April 2018 column. In a sign of the importance the case has for Norway, a panel of 11 Supreme Court judges, a higher than usual number, will listen to the arguments during the three-day session starting on Tuesday. Jensen, the academic, said that according to international law it is only coastal states that can grant licenses for the management of natural resources. “So Norway, via Svalbard, is the coastal state in charge,” he said. “Now, the 1920 Svalbard Treaty forces Norway to treat all signatories fairly. The EU does not have the right to issue licenses, but the treaty perhaps grants the EU the right to be equally treated.

2019-01-15,"(Adds details on outlook, background) Jan 15 (Reuters) - Oil and gas company Ophir Energy Plc said on Tuesday full-year production exceeded its own forecast, a day after it rejected Indonesian oil and gas group Medco Energi Internasional Tbk PT’s potential buyout offer. Ophir, which historically focused on Africa, has of late been concentrating on Asia, purchasing some assets from Australian peer Santos Ltd last year. The Southeast Asian assets performed better than expected and have returned cash flow of about $110 million in 2018, or about half the initial purchase price, interim CEO Alan Booth said, adding that the company was well positioned to generate significant free cash flow going forward. Ophir’s total daily production averaged 29,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2018, 8 percent ahead of its own estimates. It also forecast daily production for 2019 to be in line with previous outlook of 25,000 boepd. The company expects to maintain operating expenses for the year at $12 per boe, due to the low cost and cash generative nature of its expanded production base. However, 2019 costs are expected to be slightly higher at $16 per boe, the company said blaming the jump on maintenance works at its Kerendan and Bualuang fields in Indonesia and Thailand. Earlier this month, the company was denied extension of the block licence for its Fortuna liquid natural gas project in Equatorial Guinea after the firm failed to scrape together enough cash for the venture. A unit of Indonesia’s Medco Energi had swooped in with an all-cash takeover offer for the 15-year old energy company, but Ophir rejected the offer on Monday saying it “undervalues” the firm.

2019-01-15,"HARARE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Streets were mostly quiet on Tuesday in Zimbabwe’s capital Harare and second city Bulawayo as banks, schools and businesses stayed shut, a day after deadly protests over economic hardship and a sharp increase in the price of fuel. The closures followed a call by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions for a three-day stay-at-home protest over the sharp drop in living standards caused by a dollar crunch that has sent prices soaring and caused shortages of fuel and drugs. Several people were killed and some 200 arrested during Monday’s protests, which followed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s decision to hike the price of fuel in an attempt to tackle the southern African country’s worst economic crisis in a decade. A human rights lawyers group said it had received reports of soldiers and police officers breaking into homes in Harare townships overnight and assaulting suspected demonstrators. “Even if I wanted to go to work, where do I get the $8 to go to and from work? It is better to tend to my field,” said Malvin Chigora, a 36-year-old father of two, on his small maize field in Kuwadzana township on the outskirts of the capital. In central Harare, banks, shops and offices were closed with few people on the streets. Most public taxis were off the road. Two local journalists told Reuters the situation was similar in Bulawayo. The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZHLR), which provides free legal services, said it had received distress calls from residents in Mabvuku and Chitungwiza who were forcibly taken from their homes and made to remove barricades from roads. That tactic was used by security agents during the rule of long-time leader Robert Mugabe, who was ousted by his one-time ally Mnangagwa in a bloodless coup in November. “Of concern is the involvement of soldiers in these illegal acts who are actively participating in the cruel and inhuman treatment of residents,” ZLHR said in a statement. Six people were killed in post-election violence in August after the army intervened. Zimbabwe Defence Forces spokesman Overson Mugwisi and police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said they did not have sufficient information to comment. The government has blamed the opposition and rights groups for Monday’s violence. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Information said it was looking for a man who was seen on videos posted on social media brandishing an assault rifle in Harare and giving orders to motorists. “Where did he obtain the assault weapon ...He is suspected of shooting some innocent civilians,” the ministry said.

2019-01-15,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Anybody reading the commentary on China’s December trade figures would be left with the impression of an economy increasingly losing momentum amid a dispute with the United States. It was reasonable for analysts to zero in on the 4.4 percent drop in China’s December exports from a year earlier, a huge miss when a rise of 3 percent had been forecast. Imports also surprised on the downside, dropping 7.6 percent in December, the biggest decline since July 2016. The numbers do point to weakness in the world’s second-largest economy, and the trade dispute with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is getting much of the blame. The weakness in exports could be put down to the pull-forward effect in prior months as both producers and buyers stocked up ahead of the imposition of U.S. tariffs on a range of Chinese goods. The poor trade numbers also came despite efforts by Beijing to stimulate the economy in a series of measures, from looser credit to tax cuts to infrastructure spending. The trade data was grist to the mill for those taking the view that China’s economy is struggling, that the United States is “winning” the trade dispute, and that Beijing will be forced to compromise on Trump’s terms. This may well turn out to be the case, but there are also trade numbers that paint an entirely different view of the Chinese economy, namely the volume of commodity imports. Crude oil imports surged nearly 30 percent in December from the same month in 2017, reaching 10.31 million barrels per day (bpd), the second-highest monthly outcome on record. That hardly sounds like a weak outcome, even if the likely explanation is that smaller, independent refiners boosted purchases to use up 2018 import quotas before they expired. Overall, China’s 2018 crude imports rose by 10.1 percent to a record 9,24 million bpd, an increase of 846,000 bpd over 2017. Boosting annual crude imports by the equivalent of the total consumption of a country such as Netherlands cannot be construed as weak either. A history lesson on past-year crude imports, though, doesn’t say much about what’s likely to happen in 2019, but so far there is little reason to expect the imports to tail off. China is still building its strategic petroleum reserves and the sharp drop in crude prices in the previous months is likely to encourage more buying for storage. It’s not just crude oil. Imports of natural gas, by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG), hit a record high of 9.23 million tonnes in December, up 17 percent from the same month of 2017 and eclipsing the previous record high from November. That means China has imported record amounts of natural gas for two consecutive months, again, hard numbers that don’t quite tally with the view of an economy in distress.  It could be the case that energy imports are staying strong, while those of metals, which are more exposed to weakness in manufacturing, are feeling more pain. Imports of unwrought copper dropped to 429,000 tonnes in December, down 4.7 percent from the same month in 2017 and by the same margin from November. Imports in November were also weaker than in the same month in 2017, indicating some softness toward the end of the year, notwithstanding the strong 12.9 percent gain in copper imports for 2018 as a whole. Iron ore imports also look uninspiring, with December’s 86.65 million tonnes up 3 percent from the same month a year earlier, but not enough to prevent a 1 percent drop across 2018 as a whole, the first annual decline since 2010. However, China’s steel output is likely to hit a record high in 2018, with output for the first 11 months rising 6.7 percent to 857.37 million tonnes from the same period in 2017. What this shows is that China’s switch to higher-grade iron ore in order to maximise the output of blast furnaces meant steel mills were able to boost production without having to import more iron ore. Again, this is hardly a weak outcome, but likewise doesn’t shed much light on the probable trends for 2019. Coal was one commodity that looked weak in December, with imports plunging 55 percent from the same month in 2017 to just 10.23 million tonnes. But this was entirely policy driven, with Beijing putting pressure on traders to curb imports as they didn’t want total inbound coal shipments in 2018 to exceed those for 2017. Despite the slump in December, imports for the full year were up 3.9 percent to 281.23 million tonnes, a four-year high. Coal imports may remain restrained in the early months of 2019 amid an official push to use more domestic coal to boost prices for local miners. Overall, if you were to assess the Chinese economy on its commodity imports, you’d likely reach quite a different conclusion than if you focused only on the U.S. dollar value of total exports and imports. Weaker commodity prices lowered the value of imports in the latter part of 2018, but if anything, also served to boost volumes. China’s economy does appear to be losing some growth momentum, but it doesn’t seem to make much sense to look only at imports and exports from a dollar perspective, and not take volumes into account.

The odds look stacked against Prime Minister Theresa May winning  approval for her deal. Voting is expected to start about 1900 GMT Tuesday. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Asia’s lead and open higher, with Britain’s FTSE seen gaining 0.55 percent, Germany’s DAX 0.7 percent and France’s CAC 0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan recovered from early losses and advanced 1.3 percent. South Korea’s Kospi hit a one-month high and Japan’s Nikkei added 1 percent. In China, the CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares was up 1.7 percent amid expectations of more government policy measures to prop-up a slowing economy. China’s state planner said on Tuesday it will aim to achieve “a good start” in the first quarter for the economy in a signal of more growth-boosting steps. State television also quoted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as saying the government is seeking to establish conditions helpful to meeting this year’s economic goals. That came after data on Monday showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply. Cyclical shares led the gains in Asia-Pacific, with Australian financial shares at their highest since early December while Japanese electronics and machinery makers shares rose to their best levels in six weeks. “It is interesting that cyclicals are leading the gains today. It appears some contrarian investors are starting to buy cyclicals, looking beyond the last economic slowdown,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “But I would suspect there will be heavy selling if we go up further, to around 2,650 in the S&P500 and 21,500 in the Nikkei,” Kuramochi added. S&P500 e-mini futures gained 0.6 percent in Asian trade. In Monday’s session on Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.53 percent, with the biggest drag coming from a 0.9 percent fall in technology sector. U.S. earnings season began on a positive note on Monday as Citigroup Inc beat profit estimates. The bank’s shares rose 4.0 percent and bolstered the S&P financial sector .SPSY, which rose 0.7 percent. The British pound was expected to steal the limelight later in the day as the Britain’s parliament votes on the proposed Brexit deal. On Monday, May urged lawmakers to take a “second look” at her deal, which lawmakers are expected to reject. Such a result could produce a wide range of outcomes, from a disorderly exit from the union to a reversal of Brexit. “Markets have priced in a rejection of May’s plan and there are many scenarios after that. Still I’d think the most likely outcome is to extend the (March 29) deadline of Brexit,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Indeed, currency option markets are barely pricing in the chances of sharp moves in sterling. The pound’s one-month implied volatility stood at 12.625 percent, above the average for the past year of around 8.8 percent well off 20-percent plus levels seen in the days just before the UK referendum on June 23, 2016. The pound changed hands at $1.2909, up 0.3 percent, having hit a two-month high of $1.2930 on Monday after a report, subsequently denied, that a pro-Brexit faction of lawmakers could support May’s deal. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.1480, consolidating after hitting a 12-week high of $1.1570 touched on Thursday. The dollar gained 0.5 percent on the yen to 108.685.

2019-01-15,"SHANGHAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China has approved construction of one of its tallest dams, a 239-metre (784-foot) hydroelectric structure on the upstream section of its longest river, the Yangtze, the state planning agency said on Tuesday. Hydropower is a clean and renewable source of energy but large-scale construction in southwest China has sparked accusations of damage to fragile ecosystems and inadequate compensation to thousands who have lost their homes. As concern grows over the social and environmental costs of large hydroelectric dams, China has become more cautious of approving new projects in recent years. “Great importance must be attached to environmental protection and migrant resettlement work during the construction,” the state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, said in a notice. The reservoir of the Lawa hydroelectric project will submerge nearly 12 sq miles (31 sq km) of forest and farmland on the Jinsha branch of the Yangtze on the border between Sichuan and Tibet. The project is envisaged to eventually consist of four turbines with a total capacity of 2,000 megawatts (2 gigawatts). That compares with China’s total hydropower capacity of 350 gigawatts by the end of last year, with about 270 GW contributed by large-scale projects, an industry group said last week. State power giant Huadian Group will hold a stake of 48 percent in the project, with local firms holding the rest. Planned total investment of 30.97 billion yuan ($4.59 billion) will include 2.19 billion yuan to cover the costs of relocating and compensating people displaced by construction. Industry advocates say big dams are the most efficient way of bringing electricity to remote and undeveloped regions, and China has promised to improve the way it compensates displaced residents. In its notice, the NDRC also said it would look at ways of using the new project to boost local income. It has also launched a campaign to clear up “disordered” small-scale hydropower on the Yangtze, with an audit last year putting the number of projects along the river and its tributaries at 24,100. Many new facilities are located in remote regions of Tibet, and the southwestern Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where relocation and environmental costs can be minimised.

2019-01-15,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians have been warned to avoid exerting themselves outdoors and to drink lots of water as record temperatures in parts of the country look set to linger, and even increase, over coming days. Parts of New South Wales, Australia’s most populated state, and an area of Western Australia, saw record high minimum temperatures of 33 Celsius (91 Fahrenheit) overnight. The maximum is expected to soar to more than 45C (113F) on Wednesday in parts of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, the Bureau of Meteorology said. “Avoid physical activity, stay well hydrated - it’s vital at this time,” said Richard Broome, director of environmental health for the New South Wales state government.      For the four-fifths of Australia’s 25 million people who live on the coast, the summer typically means lazing on the beach and watching cricket. But the unusually high temperatures add to a sense of exhaustion for a farm economy already reeling from a year of drought. “The weather is not good news for summer grain crops such as sorghum,” said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. “Many east coast farmers are still reeling from the winter wheat crops, which suffered from recent drought.” Australia, the world’s fourth largest wheat exporter, saw production of the grain fall to a 10-year low this year when dry weather wilted crops. With unusually dry pasture, the danger of bush fires looms. Emergency workers were forced to battle more than 100 fires across the northeast coast late last year when unprecedented hot weather triggered a wave of blazes.

2019-01-15,"ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Etihad Airways plans to hike its stake in debt-laden Jet Airways (JET.NS), a person close to the Abu Dhabi carrier told Reuters late on Monday, further driving up shares of the Indian airline. Jet shares had already spiked following a CNBC TV18 report that, apart from flagging the capital infusion from Etihad, also said Jet’s founder and chairman, 69-year old Naresh Goyal, was likely to step down from the board and give up majority control.  Goyal’s penchant for control, according to people who have worked with him, has emerged as a major obstacle as the airline tries to negotiate a rescue deal, Reuters reported last month. The person who spoke to Reuters, on condition of anonymity, said Goyal was on his way out but did not clarify if that meant he was stepping down as chairman or from the board.  Jet shares jumped as much as 7 percent early on Tuesday, after spiking 16 percent on Monday. Shares are trading at the highest levels in more than a month. Etihad putting more cash into Jet is conditional on Goyal diluting his stake, another person told Reuters last month. The Abu Dhabi carrier currently owns 24 percent in Jet.  Even so, Etihad’s stake will be capped at 49 percent given foreign ownership rules in Indian airlines.  Once its stake goes past 25 percent, under the country’s capital markets regulations, Etihad will have to make an open offer to shareholders for a majority of the shares, unless it obtains a rare exemption from the market regulator. CNBC TV18, citing sources, reported on Monday that Goyal would trim his 51 percent stake to 20-25 percent and agree to voting rights on his stake being capped at 10 percent. Etihad declined to comment.  Jet on Tuesday told the Bombay Stock Exchange that it was regularly making appropriate disclosures but it was unable to comment on the reasons for the share price rise on Monday.  Goyal did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Jet said on Jan. 2 it had defaulted on debt payments to a consortium of Indian banks and that it was in talks with the consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI.NS). The 25-year-old airline is facing financial difficulties and owes money to pilots, lessors and vendors. Intense pricing competition, a weak rupee and rising fuel costs weighed on Indian airlines in 2018. Last week, Reuters reported that crisis talks between Jet and aircraft lessors had failed to ease the row over late payments, prompting some lessors to explore repossessing their aircraft. Jet is due to meet with its lenders in Mumbai on Wednesday, the Business Standard reported on Tuesday.

2019-01-15,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China plans to launch 100 new large-scale recycling “bases” by the end of next year, part of a campaign to make better use of its resources after extending a ban on foreign trash imports. A long manufacturing boom has saddled China with millions of tonnes of waste, much of which is buried in sprawling landfill sites or dismantled by hand in polluting backstreet workshops. It has vowed to tackle the problem by creating fully industrialized recycling bases and cutting off foreign supplies. “Large volumes of solid waste are already impacting and restricting the high-quality development of the industrial economy,” the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a policy document issued late last week.       It said 50 new “comprehensive utilization” bases would deal with bulk solid waste and another 50 with industrial waste from sectors such as metals production, coal mining, construction, agriculture and forestry. The bases will tackle waste with the biggest public impact, the ministry said, citing shared bicycles, packaging, batteries and solar panels as examples. They will also promote advanced technologies, products and recycling methods, it added.  Projects or companies approved to set up shop in one of these new bases can apply for special government funding, and China will also make use of new financing mechanisms, including green bonds, the document added. China’s recyclers have profited from waste shipped in from Europe and the United States, which is better sorted and therefore cheaper to treat than domestic material.  Imports reached 60 million tonnes a year at their peak, but the government has been steadily blocking shipments since 2017. The initial 2017 ban on 24 types of imported waste, including plastic and paper, was extended at the end of 2018 to 16 new products, including scrap ships and automobile parts.  It said in December that it would also ban imports of more varieties of scrap steel, copper and aluminum from July, and another 16 products - including scrap stainless steel and titanium - will be blocked at the end of the year. Total solid waste imports fell 48 percent on the year in 2018, and China eventually aims to block all imports that have readily available domestic replacements. Many domestic recyclers have tried to move their facilities to Southeast Asia, despite tougher restrictions in Malaysia and elsewhere, and while some have started to switch to domestic feedstock, China still needs to do more to standardize and scale up the treatment of local waste. “Some items just can’t be imported anymore, including plastics ... but domestic waste and imports are handled by different people, and they are not part of the same system,” said Wang Wang, secretary general of the China Scrap Plastic Association.

2019-01-15,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Regulators in the U.S. state of Alaska will investigate all of the oil and natural gas wells operated by BP Plc at its Prudhoe Bay oil field after the release of a small amount of crude oil and gas from a well that had earlier been shut. The Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) has scheduled a Feb. 7 hearing “to assess the mechanical integrity of Prudhoe Bay wells operated by BP Exploration (Alaska), Inc.,” the agency said in a notice issued on Friday.  Last month’s leak occurred at one of 14 wells that BP had shut in 2017 following a much bigger release oil and gas then.  The most recent failure, detected on Dec. 7, released natural gas and about two gallons of crude oil, said Megan Baldino, spokeswoman for BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. The gas release was brought under control two days later, she said. There was no oil released to the tundra and no one was injured, she said.  There are 1,780 Prudhoe Bay wells, said Baldino, adding that the company is cooperating with the AOGCC’s investigation. “BP is investigating the incident to determine the cause. We are cooperating with AOGCC’s request for more information,” she said in an email on Monday. The earlier failure, in April 2017, caused crude oil to spray over a roughly 1 acre (0.4 hectare) area and caused natural gas to vent for days before it was brought under control.  That well failure was linked to permafrost thaw. The normally frozen soil thawed, triggering movement that pushed the well up 3 to 4 feet (1.2 meters), breaking a pressure gauge that previously regulated the site, according to regulators. That sparked a North Slope-wide well review ordered by the AOGCC. In the end, BP identified and shut the 14 wells that because of an outdated and flawed design. In the aftermath of that incident, AOGCC officials concluded that the permafrost thaw was the result of the wells’ design flaw, not to climate change. However, permafrost in Prudhoe Bay, which is located on the Alaska North Slope region above the Arctic Circle, from the area near the tundra’s surface to the depths far below it, has warmed significantly since the 1980s in response to the rising temperatures in that region, according to scientists at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks.

2019-01-15,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Agriculture losses caused by Mexico’s ongoing fuel shortage are estimated at nearly $300 million, a sector leader said on Monday, and overall economic growth is also likely to be hit as the government struggles to stabilize gasoline distribution.    Losses of at least 5.5 billion pesos ($290 million) have been reported by major farm and ranching businesses as delayed shipments and spoiled supplies have accumulated due to shortage of motor fuels that are required to transport products, Bosco de la Vega, who heads Mexico’s National Farm Council, told Reuters.  Berries, avocados and tomatoes are vulnerable and have relatively short shelf lives, and the situation will worsen if fuel supply and distribution are not normalized soon, De la Vega explained. “In the next 10 days, if this issue isn’t resolved, I think we will have a serious shortage of perishable food,” he added. Meanwhile, Mexico’s economy could contract in January due to a slowdown in activity caused by the fuel shortage. Late last month, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador began cutting supply from major fuel pipelines that have been tapped for years by thieves, a move that has led to long lines of frustrated motorists waiting hours to fill their tanks. Criminal groups have tapped pipelines and stolen tanker trucks carrying diesel and gasoline in the oil-producing country for years, costing the government billions of dollars. Lopez Obrador’s offensive against fuel robbers marks the leftist’s first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. Jonathan Heath, one of Lopez Obrador’s nominees to serve on the central bank board, told a congressional hearing on Monday that shortfalls stemming from the government crackdown on fuel theft could become a serious risk if they go on for weeks. “For January, right now I’d think that we could see a negative rate (of growth),” Heath said. “If it goes on beyond February and March, who knows when we could start to get into something dangerous, and then I would be more worried.” “If it’s a problem that lasts a week or two more weeks, and we see things starting to work themselves out, I think the effects could be minimal,” the economist added. Industry groups say the economy could suffer if the bottlenecks in supply are prolonged. Several states complained they were given no warning by the government that it was about to shut down major pipelines in order to stop the theft that has caused billions of dollars worth of losses to Mexico in recent years. The government launched its crackdown on theft on Dec. 27, and traders started to feel the crunch about a week later.

The United States became the world’s largest oil producer last year as shale production hit new highs, encouraging exchanges and pricing agencies to launch new mechanisms to allow companies to price and hedge U.S. oil exports. Enterprise will offer light sweet crude oil from Midland, Texas, to be loaded at the Enterprise Houston Ship Channel (EHSC) terminal in the first auction scheduled to be held in early March, CME said in a statement. Buyers will place bids during the auction at prices based on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Houston futures. “The electronic auction will provide a competitive and transparent venue for firms across the world to efficiently hedge U.S. crude oil,” the exchange said. The auction process is similar to one held by CME’s affiliate Dubai Mercantile Exchange for Middle East crude. Enterprise transports crude oil from the Permian Basin to Houston via the Midland-to-ECHO pipeline system, which has a capacity of 575,000 barrels per day. The ECHO terminal in Houston can store 7.4 million barrels of crude oil. CME launched its crude oil futures contract deliverable at Houston in November.

2019-01-15,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s freight transport association expects a contingency plan aimed at speeding up gasoline distribution that began over the weekend to help ease bottlenecks at terminals, where fuel inventories have been accumulating in recent weeks. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s crackdown on rampant fuel theft has caused long lines of angry motorists waiting to fill up their tanks since a handful of Mexico’s most important fuel pipelines were closed to avoid further losses. The switch to more road distribution has slowed down deliveries to gas stations as crowded fuel terminals owned by state-run Pemex’s [PEMX.UL] create bottlenecks with tanker ships waiting to discharge imports at several ports. The National Chamber of Freight Transport expects faster truck loading, direct deliveries and better security can increase fuel distribution by road to 50 percent of the 1.27 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel Mexico consumes, compared with a current average of about 30 percent. “This is a contingency plan for using existing assets to achieve a larger capacity of (fuel) distribution,” said chamber President Enrique Gonzalez.  Transporters have asked Pemex to speed up loading at terminals to a maximum of four hours from 8-18 hours currently. Before Lopez Obrador’s anti-theft push, each truck would spend up to 72 hours at Pemex’s distribution centers, Gonzalez said.  The chamber represents companies with a combined fleet of 3,500 double-tank fuel trucks capable of loading up to 62,000 liters each. The contingency plan also contemplates direct delivery from terminals to gas stations, without passing through Pemex distribution centers.  Large convoys of gasoline trucks are now a common sight along Mexican highways. The vehicles are given a military escort since Lopez Obrador moved thousands of soldiers and police to supervise and protect refining and distribution. Mexico’s central region, including the capital, has been most affected by the shortages since a key pipeline from Pemex’s Salamanca refinery was shut in late December. Some 150,000 bpd of gasoline are lost due to theft, according to Reuters calculations based on official data. The problem caused a $3 billion loss for Pemex last year. Lopez Obrador’s offensive against gasoline robbers marks his first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. As of Jan. 14, the number of tankers waiting to discharge imported fuel at Mexican ports grew to 48 compared with 39 at the end of last week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. That represents a hold-up of about 14 million barrels. Gasoline imports - which represent three-quarters of the country’s consumption - typically dip in January due to lower demand, but shipments so far this year have declined even more than usual as drawing down inventory is running slower.  Total gasoline imports fell to 370,000 bpd in the first nine days of January, down by a quarter versus the same period last year, according to ClipperData. Traders say the fall in imports is due to less purchases by Pemex, which is struggling to transport gasoline from congested ports and terminals, but also by less private imports since fuel taxes were increased at the beginning of the year.

2019-01-15,"(Repeats Jan. 14 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HcppoW By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers show signs of having completed their recent sale of crude and refined fuels, with positions edging up slightly in the first week of the new year, amid hopes a recession can be averted. Oil prices have bounced off their recent lows, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most other major currencies and expectations of a trade deal between the United States and China are rising. Portfolio managers raised their net long position in ICE Brent crude futures and options by 6 million barrels to 158 million barrels in the week to Jan. 8. Funds also boosted their net long position in European gasoil by 3 million barrels to a total of 5 million barrels, according to exchange data. Net long positions in Brent and gasoil remain close to multi-year lows and increases since the start of the year have been very small. But the heavy fund selling in crude and refined fuels reported during the fourth quarter appears to have ended, at least for now (tmsnrt.rs/2HcppoW). The completion of fund sales has been enough to help oil prices bounce off their recent lows as at least a few short positions have been covered. Fund managers have essentially squared their positions in crude and fuels and are remaining on the sidelines until the economic outlook becomes clearer. There are three main scenarios for the global economy this year: resumption of strong growth; an extended soft patch; or a slump into recession. In the first scenario, crude and fuel prices will likely rise, while in the second and third they are likely to remain around current levels or fall further. Fund managers’ cautious positioning in oil suggests they see roughly equal probabilities for all three outcomes at present.

2019-01-15,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Mexico’s economy could contract in January due to a slowdown in activity caused by fuel shortages, one of the government’s candidates to serve on the central bank board said on Monday. Jonathan Heath, one of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s nominees for the bank, told a congressional hearing the shortfalls stemming from a government crackdown on rampant fuel theft could become a serious risk if they go on for weeks. “For January, right now I’d think that we could see a negative rate (of growth),” Heath said. “If it goes on beyond February, March, who knows when, we could start to get in to something dangerous, and then I would be more worried.” “If it’s a problem that lasts a week, two more weeks, and we see things starting to work themselves out, I think the effects could be minimal,” the economist added. Industry groups say the economy could suffer if the bottlenecks in supply that have caused long lines of motorists to form outside gas stations across Mexico are prolonged. Several states complained they were given no warning by the government that it was about to shut down major pipelines in order to stop the theft that has caused billions of dollars worth of losses to Mexico in recent years. The government launched its crackdown on theft on Dec. 27, and shortages started to be felt about a week later.

2019-01-15,"SINGAPORE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Tuesday amid supply cuts by producer club OPEC and Russia, although the darkening economic outlook capped gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $50.78 per barrel at 0041 GMT, up 27 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “The impact of OPEC+ cuts, Iran sanctions and lower month-on-month growth in U.S. production should help to support oil prices from current levels,” U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said in a note. The Middle East dominated producer club of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia, agreed in late 2018 to cut supply to rein in a global glut. Meanwhile, the United States last November re-imposed sanctions against Iran’s oil exports. Although Washington granted sanctions waivers to Iran’s biggest oil customers, mostly in Asia, the Middle Eastern country’s exports have plummeted since. However, Tuesday’s slight oil price increases came after crude futures fell by more than 2 percent the previous session, dragged down by weak Chinese trade data which pointed to a global economic slowdown. “Given the heightened macro risk anxiety, any support from supply-side correction could be limited,” J.P. Morgan said.

The world’s fifth-largest crude importer won a six-month sanctions waiver from Washington in November, allowing it to purchase a limited amount of oil from Iran, but has been working to overcome payment and insurance issues. South Korean buyers can buy up to 200,000 barrels per day of Iranian oil under the waiver, mainly condensate, according to industry sources, and oil imports from Iran are expected to resume this month, a source has told Reuters. One South Korean buyer was set to receive nearly 2 million barrels of Iranian condensate in January, with the first condensate cargo of about 960,000 barrels set to arrive this week, the source said. For 2018, South Korea’s imports of Iranian oil fell to 7.15 million tonnes, according to customs data. In 2017, South Korea bought 18.07 million tonnes, making Iran its No.3 crude supplier. In total, South Korea imported 12.38 million tonnes of crude oil in December, down 6.6 percent from 13.25 million tonnes from a year earlier. For the year, the country imported 148.60 million tonnes of crude, down 0.1 percent from 148.68 million tonnes in 2017, the data showed. Saudi Arabia remained the top oil supplier, delivering 43.60 million tonnes of crude in 2018, up 1.3 percent from 43.06 million tonnes last year, according to the data. In the absence of Iran oil, oil shipments from the United States more than quadrupled to 7.87 million tonnes in 2018, reaching an all-time high. Final crude imports data from state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) is set to be released later this month.

2019-01-15,"* Weak China trade data gives markets reality check * Pound off 2-month high ahead of UK parliament vote * Sterling implied volatilities lower compared to 2016 referendum By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares were on back foot on Tuesday as an unexpected drop  in China’s exports heightened worries about the global economy     while the British pound braced for a showdown in parliament over the government’s Brexit plan. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat in early trade while Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.7 percent after a market holiday on Monday. In Monday’s session on Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.53 percent, with the biggest drag coming from a 0.9 percent fall in technology sector. Chipmakers, which get a sizable portion of their revenue from China, took a hit, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index falling 1.6 percent. Data on Monday showed China’s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December, while imports also contracted sharply, pointing to further weakness in the world’s second-largest economy in 2019 and deteriorating global demand. Adding to the gloom were weak industrial output numbers from the euro zone, which showed the largest fall in nearly three years. The weak data provided a reality check to equity markets which had mounted a rally since late last year, propelled in part by hopes Washington and Beijing could reach a deal on trade to avoid further hikes in tariffs. The British pound is likely to steal the limelight later in the day as the Britain’s parliament will vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal. On Monday May urged lawmakers to take a “second look” at her deal ahead of a vote that looks set to reject the agreement. Such a result could open up the possibilities of a wide range of outcomes, from a disorderly exit from the union to a reversal of Brexit. “Markets have priced in a rejection of May’s plan and there are many scenarios after that. Still I’d think the most likely outcome is to extend the (March. 29) deadline of Brexit,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. Indeed, currency option markets are barely pricing in the chances of sharp moves in sterling. The pound’s one-month implied volatility stood at 12.5 percent, above the average for the past year of around 8.8 percent well off 20-percent plus levels seen in the days just before the UK referendum on June 23, 2016. The pound changed hands at $1.2866, having hit a two-month high of $1.2930 on Monday after a report, subsequently denied, that a pro-Brexit faction of lawmakers could support May’s deal. The euro traded at $1.1469, consolidating after hitting a 12-week high of $1.1570 touched on Thursday. The dollar stood little changed at 108.16 yen, Oil prices backed off as the weak Chinese trade data soured the mood. U.S. crude futures stood at $50.69 per barrel, up 18 cents on Tuesday but still off Friday’s five-week high of $53.31.
