is it time to go long on crude?
last
week
i
wrote
that
i
expect
a
bounc
in
crude
befor
long
and
as
wti
ha
continu
to
fall
the
troll
have
had
a
field
day
point
out
that
i
wa
wrong
let
s
for
a
minut
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
i
said
it
may
not
happen
immedi
and
assum
that
it
wa
simpli
a
wrong
call
i
can
onli
assum
that
those
point
that
out
have
never
trade
or
are
new
to
it
as
a
pastim
the
simpl
fact
is
that
in
a
deal
room
point
out
that
somebodi
got
a
call
wrong
is
like
point
out
that
they
are
breath
get
thing
wrong
is
an
everyday
or
rather
mani
time
everi
day
occurr
what
defin
you
is
how
you
deal
with
it
and
what
you
do
that
mean
simpli
chang
your
view
to
do
that
involv
understand
someth
market
can
never
be
wrong
i
wa
taught
earli
in
my
deal
room
career
that
while
you
may
believ
that
the
market
is
miss
someth
import
or
misinterpret
some
inform
the
price
is
simpli
an
express
of
the
last
point
at
which
two
counterparti
were
prepar
to
transact
as
such
it
can
t
be
wrong
that
is
encapsul
in
the
old
say
that
the
market
can
stay
illog
a
lot
longer
than
you
can
stay
thi
case
though
while
i
understand
that
the
market
isn
t
wrong
i
do
believ
that
fundament
and
technic
factor
combin
to
make
a
rapid
revers
like
at
some
point
soon
and
am
therefor
prepar
to
have
anoth
crack
