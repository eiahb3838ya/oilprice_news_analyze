they
all
have

for
thi
diluent
are
typic

and
light

are

and
that

just
the
cost
are
multipl

includ
the

of
transport
it
from

place
of

to
where
it
would
be
ad

then
strip
it
off
the
bitumen
upon
arriv

transport
it
to
a
diluent
collect
hub
and
from
there
back
to

produc
all
these
cost
realli
be
to
burn
when
you
factor
in
the
proport
of
bitumen
to
diluent
that
make
it
possibl
for
the

to

through

at

in

aspect
for

bitumen
doe
not
need
dilut
to
be

car
and
that
s
some
cost
save
for

undilut
bitumen
is
much
harder
to
spill

leak
so
from
a
certain
perspect
transport
oil
by

might
in
fact
be
safer
than
pipelin
transport
and
there
is
research
aim

both
of
