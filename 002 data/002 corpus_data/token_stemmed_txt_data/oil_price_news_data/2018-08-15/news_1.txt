the
increas

problem
with

seem
to
be
that
when

financi

tend
to
slacken

lead
to

and
cost
overrun
in
fact
befor
the
last

the
biggest

combin
came
in

which
make
an
averag
of
percent
over

for
each
of
these
investor
are
right
to

close
lest
it

rodger
say
with
the
averag
lead
time
from
final
invest
decis
to
project
launch
down
to
less
than
three
year
in
from
more
than
four
back
in
and
the
averag
payback
period
down
to
about
six
year
from
more
than
in
factor
drive
thi
improv
are
six
as
identifi
by
rodger
and
these
six
factor
would
ensur
the
their
lack
would
next
string
of
megaproject
that
includ
lng
develop
in
mozambiqu
the

papua
new

and
oil

in

the

the

as
well
as
the
caspian
and
uganda
relat
is

drill
more
profit
than
shale
first
among
these
factor
is
spare
capac
but
not
just
spare
product
capac
but
capac
across
the
suppli
chain
the
abund
of
spare
capac
allow
oil
and
ga
compani
to
do
better
at
a
lower
come
an
emerg
trend
in
the
industri
and
thi
trend
is
for
increas
collabor
between
the
upstream
industri
and
oilfield
servic
provid
for
now
rodger
say
thi
trend
is
clearli
evid
in
northern
europ
but
it
becaus
it
improv
perform
and
ultim
bottom
unsurprisingli
is
corpor
disciplin
the
last
downturn
taught
oil
and
ga
compani
to
be
stricter
in
their
project
screen
and
activ
so
now
they
are
wari
of
project
that
would
almost
certainli
go

fourth
factor
rodger
identifi
on
the
report
is
simpli
better
project
manag
the
downturn
contribut
here
as
well
now
there
are
fewer
project
to
choos
from
so
compani
can
allow
themselv
to
realli
make
the
best
of
fifth
factor
is
relat
to
the
fourth

fewer

thi

the

the

danger
is
from

turn
