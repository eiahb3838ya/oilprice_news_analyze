deeper
on

comment
from
secretari
of

steven

in
may
suggest
that
the

saudi
arabia
had
at
least
discuss
the
possibl
in
the
context
of
the
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
mnuchin
said
that
variou
convers
with

parti
about

parti
that
would
be
will
to
increas
oil
suppli
to
offset
the
loss
of
iranian

a
bit
of
a
word
salad
but
mnuchin
wa
like
telegraph
the
willing
of
saudi
arabia
to
increas
offici
huddl
in
kuwait
just
a
few
day
ago
tri
to
hash
out
a
strategi
ahead
of
the

opec
offici
were
about
what
wa
discuss
but
they
promis
to
ensur
stabl
oil
suppli
are
made
avail
in
a
time
manner
to
meet
grow
demand
and
offset
declin
in
some
part
of
the
the
boilerpl
statement
could
be
interpret
as
a
willing
to
increas
output
thi
year
ahead
of
schedul
but
it
wa
like
intent
that
the
statement
wa
left
so
all
the
jockey
behind
close
door
a
seri
of
public
comment
from
the
saudi
and
russian
energi
minist
suggest
that
the
two
largest
produc
in
the
group
will
like
agre
to
increas
product
in
two
week
time
although
the
specif
still
need
to
be
hammer
out
russia
is
aim
for
a
larger
increas
in
suppli
perhap
around
saudi
arabia
want
someth
much
more
are
a
few
reason
whi
opec
might
be
more
sensit
to
the
wish
of
the
govern
than
they
were
in
the
past
for
one
the
trump
administr
ha
been
veri
explicit
about
it
support
for
riyadh
and
hasn
t
express
ani
concern
about
human
right
or
the
war
in
yemen
or
other
issu
that
might
irk
the
saudi
govern
trump
is
also
much
more
aggress
toward
iran
than
the
obama
administr
someth
that
goe
down
well
with
the
saudi
the
saudi
govern
led
by
crown
princ
moham
bin
salman
is
more
bellicos
than
it
use
to
be
mb
as
he
is
known
ha
wage
an
aggress
foreign
polici
and
is
itch
for
a
fight
with
iran
the
saudi
need
the
on
board
with
that
campaign
so
placat
washington
with
cheaper
gasolin
price
is
a
small
price
to
pay
relat
new
iraqi
lawmak
want
out
of
opec
dealhowev
unlik
the
past
the
biggest
differ
arguabl
come
from
the
oil
market
itself
a
decad
ago
when
presid
bush
ask
for
help
saudi
arabia
saw
littl
downsid
in
snub
him
the
wa
hopelessli
addict
to
oil
and
had
no
way
to
avoid
pay
high
price
while
that
addict
ha
chang
onli
margin
in
the
interven
year
the
differ
between
then
and
now
is
that
saudi
arabia
ha
to
worri
about
lose
market
share
to
shale
saudi
shale
narr
is
a
bit
overblown
in
the
media
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
opec
run
the
risk
of
spark
too
much
suppli
if
it
let
price
rise
too
far
in
year
past
oil
would
stimul
new
invest
but
those
project
would
take
year
to
come
onlin
short
lead
time
for
shale
howev
have
sped
up
the
price
cycl
so
the
risk
is
that
high
price
will
lead
to
a
wave
of
new
suppli
which
crash
price
again
in
short
order
inde
shale
ha
alreadi
grown
rapidli
over
the
past
few
short
saudi
arabia
look
readi
to
increas
product
but
it
ha
a
varieti
of
reason
whi
it
could
agre
to
do
so
it
isn
t
just
that
riyadh
is
compli
with
a
