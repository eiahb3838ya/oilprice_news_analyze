the

take
a
breath
from
their
upward
march
for
now
the
signal
of
more
suppli
are
weigh
on
the
oil
price
with
the
meet
still
almost
two
week
fascin
dynam
between
the
three
most
import
player
here
the
us
russia
and
the
saudi
is
go
to
tell
the
real
stori
of
what
the
final
outcom
from
the
opec
meet
will
be
and
where
oil
price
are
go
to
go
from
s
analyz
the
motiv
of
all
three
and
make
a
plan
in
the
trump
ha
tweet
hi
unhappi
with
higher
oil
price
and
there
have
been
indic
that
he
s
gotten
some
concess
from
opec
to
increas
product
and
keep
ga
price
at
a
manag
level
through
the
midterm
the
other
side
of
the
globe
it
s
clear
that
russia
ha
benefit
enorm
from
higher
oil
price
but
their
loyalti
to
opec
and
the
global
suppli
chain
is
histor
weak
if
there
is
a
commit
for
anoth
barrel
a
day
to
be
ad
to
the
product
pot
russia
is
go
to
lobbi
for
a
lot
of
that
alloc
for
we
have
the
saudi
who
at
the
veri
least
need
to
look
like
they
are
help
presid
trump
toward
stabl
ga
price
after
all
the
saudi
were
virul
oppos
to
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
and
the
presid
did
deliv
on
hi
promis
to
abandon
it
and
reinstat
sanction
howev
and
thi
is
a
big
caveat
the
saudi
still
must
make
their
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
huge
success
if
young
princ
muhammad
bin
salman
is
to
surviv
and
for
that
they
ll
need
an
even
higher
price
for
oil
optim
over
a
what
do
i
think
will
happen
the
tightrop
that
the
saudi
need
to
walk
is
the
key
here
deliv
the
impress
of
keep
oil
price
lower
yet
still
obtain
at
least
complianc
on
the
origin
product
deal
through
by
do
that
they
are
assur
that
global
stockpil
will
still
continu
to
drain
if
more
slowli
than
they
have
for
the
past
sever
month
bin
salman
and
have
shown
a
brilliant
abil
to
walk
these
tightrop
in
the
past
year
and
a
half
and
i
expect
them
to
success
navig
it
thi
one
should
expect
oil
price
to
remain
moder
up
to
the
meet
date
of
june
and
with
that
oil
stock
to
remain
moder
price
as
well
it
is
possibl
the
mani
will
perceiv
the
pressur
of
russia
and
the
to
be
too
much
for
the
saudi
predict
the
meet
will
be
a
disast
and
therefor
send
oil
stock
significantli
lower
immedi
prior
to
see
thi
as
an
bottleneck
in
the
permian
shale
play
will
final
cap
oil
increas
there
and
with
continu
complianc
assur
by
crafti
saudi
move
the
oil
price
will
again
resum
it
steadi
creep
higher
in
spite
of
presid
trump
s
angri
us
there
remain
the
same
strategi
that
we
ve
been
follow
onli
now
it
should
becom
more
aggress
to
accumul
cash
by
jettison
permian
shale
produc
and
center
back
into
