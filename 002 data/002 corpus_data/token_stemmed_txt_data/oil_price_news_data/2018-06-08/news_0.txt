the
comment
suggest
that
a
good
portion
of
the
cartel
is
line
up
against
ani
move
to
increas
product
it
could
set
the
stage
for
a
heat
meet
in
vienna
in
two
week
time
it
might
be
one
of
the
worst
opec
meet
sinc
eugen
weinberg
of
commerzbank
told
will
saudi
arabia
listen
to
demand
for
more
oil
he
wa
refer
to
the
infam
meet
that
fell
apart
over
sharp
differ
in
opinion
with
saudi
arabia
want
to
increas
product
to
eas
oil
price
follow
the
conflagr
in
part
of
north
africa
and
the
middl
east
dure
the
arab
spring
but
the
saudi
were
shot
down
by
much
of
the
rest
of
the
group
which
oppos
lift
output
former
saudi
oil
minist
ali
said
it
wa
one
of
the
worst
meet
we
have
ever
although
not
exactli
the
same
the
differ
back
then
echo
those
of
today
saudi
arabia
wari
of
hurt
global
econom
growth
and
also
cautiou
about
not
incentiv
too
much
suppli
want
to
add
some
barrel
back
onto
the
about
everi
opec
member
outsid
of
the
gulf
is
unabl
to
increas
product
anyway
so
it
is
of
littl
surpris
that
they
are
oppos
to
higher
product
venezuela
s
output
is
fall
fast
angola
is
also
lose
product
libya
and
nigeria
seem
to
have
hit
a
temporari
ceil
with
secur
issu
alway
loom
as
a
suppli
risk
also
they
don
t
have
offici
limit
on
their
output
as
part
of
the
opec
deal
so
there
is
littl
upsid
for
them
in
support
product
increas
from
other
obvious
is
face
product
outag
from
sanction
so
it
like
can
t
increas
output
even
if
it
want
to
offici
from
iraq
and
algeria
made
neg
comment
over
the
past
week
about
the
possibl
of
higher
the
camp
mexico
s
product
is
fall
anyway
so
it
ha
littl
to
no
abil
to
respond
to
chang
in
the
onli
beneficiari
of
higher
product
would
be
saudi
arabia
and
russia
and
to
a
lesser
extent
some
of
the
gulf
state
like
kuwait
and
the
oil
kingdom
in
crisi
saudi
royal
famili
rift
turn
violentbut
saudi
arabia
and
russia
probabl
can
t
simpli
allot
themselv
more
product
allow
without
risk
a
revolt
from
the
rest
of
the
group
so
they
will
like
need
to
alloc
more
product
to
everyon
but
even
the
act
of
decid
on
a
formula
will
also
be
highli
contenti
still
it
will
be
somewhat
of
a
formal
for
most
member
sinc
they
can
t
increas
product
there
are
a
few
possibl
from
the
upcom
meet
first
saudi
arabia
and
russia
convinc
the
group
to
agre
to
an
increas
in
output
and
while
everyon
nomin
is
allow
to
increas
output
a
bit
the
two
top
produc
make
up
the
lion
s
share
of
the
increas
that
will
requir
sacrific
from
much
of
the
group
who
won
t
be
abl
to
increas
product
and
will
have
to
stomach
lower
oil
possibl
is
a
breakdown
in
negoti
and
saudi
arabia
and
russia
go
their
own
way
increas
output
or
talk
could
breakdown
and
there
is
no
chang
in
output
although
with
the
upsid
risk
to
price
thi
seem
the
outcom
odd
are
that
the
upcom
meet
is
the
most
comb
we
have
seen
