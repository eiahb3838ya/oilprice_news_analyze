is arctic drilling the key to u.s. energy dominance?
energi
domin
is
a
term
that
ha
becom
almost
synonym
with
trump
s
administr
on
the
face
of
thing
it
may
seem
that
the
term
requir
no
further
analysi
for
a
deeper
understand
sure
it
is
simpli
as
it

unfeas
to

that
the

is
there
as
an

to
answer

detractor
to
the
polici
but
secur
is
anoth
matter
entir
it

energi

isn

simpli
about

rather
about

as
a

level
the

yet
it
is
europ
a
market
over
which
russia
ha
someth
of
a
stranglehold
where
thing
get
much
more
interest
it
is
here
that
energi

seem
to
be
a
direct
challeng
to

then
that
the
thirst
for

as
a

compani
profit
is
in
complet
accord
with

it
may
inde
be
prudent
to
bolster

secur
more
reliabl
