how significant is wtiâ€™s breakout?
oil
after
look
rangebound
for
a
while
albeit
at
the
highest
level
sinc
look
like
it
ha
broken
out
when
wti
futur
challeng
februari
s
high
of
a
few
week
ago
we
reach
befor
retreat
rapidli
a
pattern
that
reinforc
the
resist
level
and
suggest
that
we
would
head
lower
again
a
coupl
of
day
ago
howev
we
broke
through
and
have
been
trade
abov
that
point
for
three
day
now
that
confirm
that
wti
ha
broken
out
of
it
rang
but
the
lack
of
follow
through
sinc
suggest
that
thi
may
not
be
all
that
signific
an
analysi
of
the
reason
for
the
breakout
and

sinc
howev
suggest
that
it
will
be
click
to
enlarg
the
first
question
that
heed
to
be
answer
is
how
signific
ani
technic
signal
is
in
the
longer
term
the
answer
is
not
veri
even

visibl
technic

such
as
thi
can
onli
take
you
so

the

around

so
can
caus
a

thi

that
have
been
in

for

improv
global

suggest
higher
oil
demand
and
the
market
ha
react
accordingli
what
chang
thi
week
howev
wa
the
suppli
side
of
the
equat
convent
wisdom
ha
held
that
that
wa
a
restrict
factor
for
oil
price
the
seem
abil
of
north
american
shale
produc
to
turn
product
on
and
off
in
respons
to

suggest
that
the
run
up
would
prompt
big
increas
in

that
is
still
a
possibl
but
what
chang
thi
week
wa
the
suppli

tension
and
conflict
are
noth
new
for
oil
trader
nor
for
anyon
els
for
that
matter
they
have
exist
for
millennia
and
the
occasion
are
sometim
taken
in
stride
by
the
market
the
reaction
to
syria
s

howev
ha
the
potenti
to
be
veri
are
call
for
a
reaction
greater
than
the
target
strike
employ
by
presid
trump
last
time
and
that
ha
trader
worri
there
ha
been
talk
from
opec
thi
week
about
extend
their
product
cut
into
next
year
but
if
the
proxi
war
in
syria
heat
up
the
prospect
of
a
unifi
front
by
the
signatori
to
that
agreement
are
serious
reduc
if
the
vienna
agreement
were
to
break
down
just
as
shale
produc
are
ramp
up
product
it
doesn
t
take
a
geniu
to
conclud
that
oil
will
be
hit
of
that
howev
is
specul
and
if
we
return
to
the
recent
price
action
there
are
suggest
that
the
market
is
not
worri
even
as
trump
ha
been
tweet
out
contradictori
signal
thi
week
and
the
iea
ha
issu
a
report
that
they
expect
the
signatori
to
the
vienna
agreement
to
declar
mission
accomplish
wti
ha
held
abov
the
previou
high
that
indic
one
of
two
thing
either
trader
are
not
worri
about
the
effect
should
that
be
the
case
or
simpli
don
t
believ
it
will
then
while
technic
level
and
breakout
are
not
usual
too
signific
in
the
long
term
the
lack
of
volatil
follow
the
initi
push
upward
suggest
that
thi
one
may
be
we
are
still
close
enough
that
a
drop
back
below
could
come
and
return
us
to
the
previou
rang
but
form
a
new
rang
of
around
