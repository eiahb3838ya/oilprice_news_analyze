pipeline opponents need a shot of common sense
the
veri
word
pipelin
these
day
seem
to
put
a
lot
of
peopl
on
edg
it
ha
somehow
becom
a
synonym
of
evil
yet
pipelin
are
simpli
infrastructur
for
transport
liquid
and
gaseou
hydrocarbon
from
one
place
to
anoth
the
reason
they
are
necessari
is
that
oil
and
ga
have
to
go
where
they
are
need
by
both
support
and
oppon
of
the
fossil
fuel
industri
we
all
use
is
now
a
grow
problem
with
oil
and
ga
pipelin
capac
in
north
america
and
the
solut

common
sens
which
say
that
you
can
not
keep
it
in
the
ground
and
have
the

new

nuclear
it
is

it
is
pay
through

for

when
electr
demand
jump
whi
accord
to
conca
it
s
becaus
the
state
do
not
want
the
new
pipelin
they
need
and
they
also
doesn
t
want
the
addit
transmiss
line
from
canada
to
import
more
power
as
a
result
the
region
is
suffer
you
haven
t
been
follow
the
headlin
from
canada
recent
the
situat
is
not
much
differ
there
a
lot
of
peopl
don
t
want
the
tran
mountain
oil
pipelin
to
be
expand
they
don
t
want
ani
pipelin
to
be
expand
or
built
but
anoth
group
of
peopl
find
that
thi
pipelin
s
expans
is
essenti
for
turn
canada
into
a
truli
intern
oil
s
true
that
canada
s
heavi
oil
is
dirtier
than
ga
and
that
transport
it
is
more
expens
than
transport
regular
crude
becaus
it
need
to
be
dilut
to
a
liquid
form
but
canada
need
the
intern
market
as
product
continu
to
grow
on
both
side
of
the
border
but
demand
is
not
suffici
to
absorb
all
that
alberta
s
produc
have
to
offer
relat
the
invis
sweet
spot
for
big
oilwhat
pipelin
oppon
like
to
point
out
is
the
danger
of
legitim
issu
yet
these
same
peopl
seem
unconcern
about
the
higher
spill
risk
inher
in
railway
transport
which
canadian
produc
are
forc
to
resort
to
due
to
pipelin
capac
shortag
if
we
are
talk
about
statist
calcul
risk
then
these
are
the
lowest
with
pipelin
especi
in
the
age
of
environment
when
everi
pipelin
project
is
the
object
of
veri
close
scrutini
caus
pipelin
builder
to
avoid
cut
pipelin
propon
on
the
other
hand
like
to
point
out
is
that
a
lot
of
the
pipelin
network
in
north
america
is
of
it
older
than
half
a
centuri
the
older
a
piec
of
infrastructur
the
higher
the
risk
of
a
breakdown
yet
the
lobbi
is
against
that
too
for
reason
that
are
not
precis
replac
should
be
easi
enough
but
it
is
not
enbridg
s
propos
to
replac
the
age
line
wa
met
with
sever
opposit
despit
the
fact
that
the
replac
is
suppos
to
make
the
pipelin
safer
pipelin
replac
can
certain
the
need
for
new
infrastructur
conca
note
a
minor
expans
of
the
diamet
of
the
pipe
can
increas
the
flow
of
oil
through
them
quit
a
factor
of
four
in
would
think
that
peopl
would
choos
the
lesser
evil
of
expand
pipelin
to
new
one
but
it
appear
that
opposit
is
a
veri
support
want
no
pipelin
period
of
cours
no
pipelin
at
all
would
mean
blackout
and
a
lot
of
have
yet
to
fulli
replac
oil
and
ga
and
be
as
somehow
thi
doesn
t
seem
to
be
a
concern
perhap
becaus
it
