say
they
have
also
identifi
the
singl
biggest
risk
factor
for

to
which
china
could
meddl

that
the
extent
to
which
the

the
main
risk
factor
face
western
investor
which
is
in
addit
to
a
currenc
risk
given
that
the
ine
is
settl
in
accord
to
reuter
john
kemp
possibl
chines
intervent
on
the
yuan
crude
futur
market
could
be
one
of
the
three
element
that
could
doom
the
new

cite
the
paper
whi
some
futur
contract
succeed
and
other
fail
kemp
argu
that
the
third
key
element
to
a
success
futur
polici
should
not
be
too
advers
to
futur
be
the
stumbl
block
to
the
chines
crude
futur
while
the
new
contract
could
easili
meet
the
other
two
criteria
for
success
these
are
a
commerci
need
for
hedg
and
a
pool
of
specul

the

fact
that

dedic
a
special
articl
on

futur
in
it
close

show
that
the

possibl
that

versu

the
offici
goal
of
the

futur
contract
is
to
establish
a
region
benchmark
for
more
use
price
of
the
crude
grade
preval
on
the
chines
market
analyst
see
the
yuan
oil
futur
as
a
step
toward
china
seek
wider
accept
of
it
currenc
in
global
trade
includ
the
oil
trade
and
establish
a
petroyuan
that
could
challeng
in
the
futur
the
domin
of
the
is
now
the
biggest
crude
oil
import
in
the
world
and
the
pace
of
it
oil
demand
growth
is
capabl
of
influenc
the
oil
market
and
the
trade
in
the
two
most
trade
crude
futur
in
the
world
brent
and
wti
so
it
make
sens
for
the
top
crude
import
to
want
to
use
oil
as
a
mean
to
promot
it
own
currenc

key
and
pragmat
on
the
practic

such
a

would
better

the

china

push

percept
chang

yuan

could
shift
the
structur
of

two
thing
need
to
happen
first
brisco
say
one
is
that
china

the
other
is
that

to

to
accept
yuan
for
their

thi
is
also
take

becaus

we
expect
saudi
