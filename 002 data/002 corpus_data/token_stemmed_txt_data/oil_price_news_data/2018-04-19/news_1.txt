the
one
to

promis
in

for
iran
absent
major
chang
to

but
the
oil

realli
began
to
come
around
to
the
idea
of
a
heighten
conflict
with

in

sens
the
specter
of
a
loss
of
oil
suppli
from
iran
is
not
exactli
news
but
what
is
new
is
that
the
loss
of
iranian
oil
could
occur
against
a
much
tighter
oil
market
than
previous
expect
and
it
could
occur
at
a
time
when
saudi
arabia
may
balk
at
step
in
and
offset
the
loss
after

told
bloomberg
in
her
respons
to
the
big
question
is
what
new
sanction
on
iran
would
do
to
the
islam
republ
s
oil
export
iran
export
around
million
barrel
per
day
and
estim
on
the
effect
of
sanction
run
the
gamut
on
the
low
end
some
think
the
sanction
would
have
a
minim
impact
becaus
the
will
struggl
to
stitch
togeth
the
intern
coalit
that
the
obama
administr
put
togeth
in
the
year
preced
the
iran
nuclear
deal
a
group
that
succeed
in
curtail
iran
s
export
by
more
than
the
upper
end
one
could
point
to
the
fact
that
it
isn
t
just
that
the
is
tri
to
prohibit
countri
from
buy
oil
but
that
the
treasuri
could
ban
bank
and
compani
from
do
busi
with
the
if
they
continu
to
deal
with
iran
in

sens
it
would
still
be
tricki
for

wildli
unpredict

not

would
have

if
they
