price
for

the
lack

start
to

as
larg
as
per

from

but
the
level
of
drill
activ
is
actual
strain
the
market
for
pressur
pump
capac
there
just
isn
t
enough
to
go
capac
is
expect
to
be
particularli
tight
in
the
permian
in
the
second
quarter
befor
the
major
of
new

come
onlin
in
the
second
half
of

rystad

wrote
in

report
more
than
half

if
you
are
in

we
are

and
we
are
just
fine
with
that
a

be
sure
rystad
energi
predict
that
million
horsepow
of
new
capac
will
come
onlin
by
the
end
of
the

a
nearli
increas
from
that
should
help
reliev
some
of
the
canada
s
oil
patch
to
turn
profit
in
market
for
frac
sand
is
also
stretch
to
the
limit
but
that
too
should
be
temporari
rystad
energi
see
the
suppli
of
frac
sand
jump
by
a
massiv
million
ton
in
much
of
it
locat
in
the
permian
in
close
proxim
to
drill
site
which
is
differ
from
the
past
when
much
of
the
sand
had
to
be
ship
to
texa
from
wisconsin
and
move
all
that
sand
around
requir
a
lot
of
truck
and
the
market
for
truck
is
also
tight
to
top
it
off
a
zillion
truck
move
around
wear
down

which
ultim
could
creat
