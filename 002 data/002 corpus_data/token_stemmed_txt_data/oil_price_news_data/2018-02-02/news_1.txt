s
headlin
figur

is
base

at

around
in

word
if
venezuela
can
exit
at
about

a
littl

the
loss
at

in

context
wouldn

be
that
the

barclay
note
that
there
is
some
downsid
risk
to
even
thi
dire
forecast
there
is
a
possibl
of
a
sharper
declin
due
to
the
creditor
decis

a
further
escal

the

said
in
