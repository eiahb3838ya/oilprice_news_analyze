the real effect of iran sanction waivers
on
the
day
sanction
against
iran
went
into
effect
brent
crude
trade
at
us
a
barrel
today
three
week
later
brent
is
down
to
us
a
barrel
and
presid
trump
is
congratul
himself
on
the
low
oil
price
instead
of
shoot
up
to
us
oil
price
are
fall
and
the
waiver
grant
to
eight
larg
iranian
oil
buyer
are
among
the
main
reason
for
thi
but
how
long
with
the
effect
of
the
waiver
last
bloomberg
last
week
publish
a
of
how
much
each
of
the
seven
import
that
won
waiver
are
allow
to
continu
import
from
iran
and
the
number
suggest
these
seven
countri
could
continu
buy
over
a
million
bpd
of
iranian
crude
until
the
waiver
expir
next
year
howev
the
key
word
here
is
could
japan
for
exampl
one
of
the
world
s
top
crude
oil
import
and
a
larg
client
of
iran
stop
buy
crude
ahead
of
the
sanction
to
improv
it
chanc
of
score
a
waiver
now
that
it
ha
the
waiver
japanes
refin
are
still
not
sure
they
should
resum
buy
iranian
crude
which
make
one
wonder
whi
they
even
work
to
secur
a
waiver
if
they
were
not
go
to
use
it
yet
theoret
these
refin
can
import
about
bpd
of
iranian
crude
down
from
bpd
befor
the
korea
is
anoth
reluct
buyer
becaus
of
it
close
link
with
the
unit
state
the
countri
wa
grant
a
waiver
that
would
allow
it
to
import
iranian
crude
at
a
rate
of
bpd
over
a
period
of
six
month
but
refin
have
yet
to
resum
import
relat
could
oil
price
fall
to
india
and
china
are
import
iranian
crude
the
former
at
the
allow
rate
of
some
bpd
accord
to
order
data
the
latter
china
wa
allow
to
continu
buy
iranian
crude
at
a
rate
of
bpd
but
it
also
ha
right
to
product
from
field
in
iran
where
chines
compani
have
stake
so
it
may
be
get
more
than
is
the
countri
that
ha
had
to
slash
it
intak
of
iranian
crude
the
most
and
it
is
also
the
countri
that
would
have
the
biggest
problem
find
an
afford
altern
to
iranian
crude
when
the
waiver
expir
india
wa
lucki
pessimist
forecast
for
the
global
economi
and
indic
of
oversuppli
pressur
price
but
thi
may
onli
be
temporari
opec
is
talk
about
product
cut
again
after
import
would
also
have
to
find
altern
sourc
of
crude
that
can
compet
with
iranian
crude
on
price
these
are
to
put
it
mildli
few
and
far
between
sinc
tehran
is
sell
it
crude
at
a
discount
to
maintain
market
share
other
produc
can
not
afford
to
sell
at
such
discount
so
what
happen
when
the
waiver
expir
import
would
have
two
choic
breach
the
sanction
and
risk
washington
s
wrath
or
switch
to
costlier
crude
which
will
be
even
costlier
at
the
time
becaus
the
end
of
the
waiver
will
definit
have
an
impact
on
price
these
fatter
oil
import
bill
won
t
do
much
for
these
economi
growth
prospect
and
we
just
saw
last
month
what
pessimist
econom
growth
prospect
do
to
oil
demand
outlook
and
price
especi
if
they
concern
