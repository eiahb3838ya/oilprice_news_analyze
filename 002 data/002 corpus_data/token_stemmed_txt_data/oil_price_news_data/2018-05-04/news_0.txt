never trust a banker about oil prices
in
recent
week
i
ve
comment
on
the
power
bullish
forc
that
have
combin
in
oil
and
oil
stock
and
your
need
to
increas
your
exposur
to
them
so
befor
go
on
to
other
topic
thi
ha
to
be
the
start
of
ani
column
until
further
notic
despit
the
weak
in
stock
index
and
particularli
saudi
arabia
continu
to
drop
not
so
quiet
hint
about
the
import
of
higher
oil
price
for
the
cartel
and
the
upcom
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
in
case
anyon
might
have
forgotten
about
their
chanc
to
remak
their
entir
economi
and
cultur
anoth
leak
of
saudi
oil
reserv
number
wa
serv
up
in
the
past
week
a
posit
one
of
of
the
analyst
who
previous
were
pessimist
about
the
rise
in
oil
price
have
been
slowli
and
steadili
rais
their
project
that
should
neither
encourag
us
or
bother
us
as
bank
analyst
have
a
dismal
record
of
correctli
project
price
much
into
the
futur
one
should
alway
trust
a
trader
first
whose
oblig
is
to
hi
own
invest
and
money
and
not
to
retain
the
respect
of
the
commun
or
keep
the
job
alway
rememb
an
analyst
s
first
prioriti
is
not
to
be
wrong
while
a
trader
doesn
t
care
if
he
s
wrong
or
right
onli
if
he
s
got
the
right
side
of
the
trade
and
make
the
specul
trade
from
hedg
fund
continu
to
be
almost
uniformli
long
a
fact
that
use
to
bother
me
much
more
in
the
day
when
bank
proprietari
trade
desk
domin
the
specul
in
those
day
their
own
posit
would
often
be
in
conflict
with
sale
and
chines
wall
or
not
could
make
for
some
veri
sticki
and
fast
revers
of
posit
insid
the
bank
when
most
specul
were
on
one
side
of
the
market
prior
to
it
wa
a
huge
siren
to
get
out
of
that
trade
befor
the
avalanch
of
bank
trader
began
to
liquid
i
use
to
call
thi
the
porthol
effect
as
in
a
group
of
folk
on
a
boat
that
is
sink
yet
onli
ha
one
porthol
avail
for
exit
if
everyon
would
be
calm
the
departur
could
be
an
orderli
one
but
you
and
i
know
it
won
t
be
panic
is
sure
to
ensu
and
that
one
porthol
is
go
to
becom

useless

to
determin
the

of

and
run
with

with
such
an
overflow
of
similar

emotionless
activ
we
need
to
expect
both
that
uniform
will
appear
more
often
and
to
more
extrem
level
and
that
the
exit
from
such

in

final
one
note
of
misstep
on

i
have
onli
briefli
mention
refin
as
a
choic
invest
to
use
in
the
last
sever
month
when
it
seem
that
s
were
lag
so
use
refin
as
a
hold
zone
for
capit
wa
a
use
way
to
keep
capit
activ
but
hardli
took
advantag
of
the
amaz
move
that
refin
have
continu
to
have
throughout
the
last
two
year
i
have
argu
for
refin
at
other
time
but
have
abandon
them
in
the
last
month
and
have
miss
a
massiv
move
my
bad
i
had
seen
the
advantag
of

have
done
a
