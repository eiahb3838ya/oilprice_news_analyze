in

that

by

that
the
wsj
say
amlo
will
push
to
rais
local

rule
which
would
requir
a
higher
percentag
of
domest
involv
in

project
that
mean
that
if
a
compani
like
exxonmobil
or
chevron
or
some
other
outsid
entiti
want
to
drill
for
oil
in
mexico
it
would
need
to
sourc
a
certain
percentag
of
equip
and
servic
from

the
idea
is
to
captur
a
greater
portion
of
the
benefit
of
oil
and
ga
develop
for
the
countri
while
also
build
up
expertis
for

of
these
chang
will
be
loathsom
to
the
intern
oil
compani
who
will
view
them
as
oner
burden
that
inject
higher

into

oil
compani
have
repeatedli
blame

if
all
of

it
would
send
