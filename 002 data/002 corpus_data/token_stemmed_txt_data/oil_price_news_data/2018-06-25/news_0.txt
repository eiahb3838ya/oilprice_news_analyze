on

with

excit
to
get
some
relief
from
high
ga

at
the

while
opec

announc
the
expect
decis

jump
and
they
look
unlik
to

downward
ani
time
soon
for
minist
claim
the
group
would
increas
it
overal
product
by
a
million
barrel
per
day
but
the
increas
is
like
to
be
much
lower
becaus
some
member
venezuela
and
iran
in
particular
will
find
it
difficult
to
increas
their
current
level
of
product
exactli
how
much
of
an
increas
we
will
see
remain
unclear
but
the
veri
fact
that
the
product
jump
will
be
smaller
than
trader
had
hope
for
ha
been
enough
to
send
price
fact
all
opec
said
in
it
statement
after
the
friday
meet
wa
that
it
will
rein
in
it
complianc
rate
from
the
percent
for
may
to
percent
estim
made
on
thi
basi
suggest
the
actual
increas
will
be
a
bit
over
bpd
with
anoth
bpd
to
come
from
russia

to
the

then
that
