norwayâ€™s oil discoveries on track for best year since 2010
higher
oil
price
and
increas
effici
have
made
compani
more
optimist
that
they
could
spend
more
on
explor
on
the
norwegian
continent
shelf
nc
thi
year
than
they
did
in
the
previou
two
year
of
stubbornli
low
oil
firm
have
boost
explor
spend
more
than
expect
and
so
far
in
they
have
had
more
success
in
discoveri
than
in
the
year

petroleum
director
npd
compani
are
on
track
to
find
nearli
billion

equival
thi

these
calcul
show
that
the
resourc
found
per
well
could
reach
their
highest
sinc
year
in
which
the

be
one
of
the
most
import
industri
project
in

in
the
next
year
and
will
be
the
main
contributor
to
norway
s
rise
oil
product
until
from
the
onward
product
offshor
norway
will
start
to
declin
so
make

area
in

wa
a
flop
but
oil
compani
oper
on
the
norwegian

vow
to
return
thi
year
for
a
renew
effort
to
find
oil
in
the

estim
to
hold
nearli
of
norway
s
undiscov
thi
year
well
are
also
be
spud
in
the

norwegian
sea
the
focu
is
on
the
backyard
of
the
norwegian
north
all
three
sea
around
norway
wildcat
have
been
complet
so
far
thi
year
and
resourc
found
are
around
million
barrel
of
oil
equival
accord
to
bloomberg
calcul
base
on
the
estim
of
thi
year
s
discoveri
report
by
the
npd
the
total
resourc
found
so
far
thi
year
have
alreadi
exceed
the
volum
found
in
the
wildcat
last
price
are
now
come
back
up
so
activ
is
pick
up
and
they
ll
want
to
drill
well
that
they
might
have
held
back
on
when
oil
price
were
low
the
npd
s
stordal
told
year
of
high
explor
activ
the
oil
price
crash
led
to
explor
slump
from
well
drill
in
to
just
well
in
and
the
npd
said
in
it
resourc
report
but
thi
year
between
and
explor
well
are
expect
to
be
drill
the
regul
on
averag
discoveri
in
recent
year
are
smaller
than
befor
smaller
find
and
fewer
well
will
make
it
demand
to
maintain
product
over
time
the
number
of
well
drill
and
the
size
of
discoveri
made
must
be
abov
the
averag
for
the
past
decad
if
product
is
to
be
sustain
at
a
high
level
opportun
for
make
larger
find
are
probabl
greatest
in
area
the
npd
higher
explor
success
rate
so
far
thi
year
couldn
t
have
come
at
a
better
time
for
norway
s
oil
industri
and
the
oper
on
it

oil
price
are
higher
than
in
the
previou
three
year
the
more

the
