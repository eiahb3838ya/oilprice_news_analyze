equatori
guinea
s
chart
speak
for
itself
i
realli
don
t
know
whi
they
join
opec
their
product
is
clearli
in
declin
but
is
not
enough
to
make
much
differ
either
way
everyth
i
said
about
equatori
guinea
can
also
be
said
about
gabon
iran
is
obvious
ignor
ani
opec
request
to
cut
product
and
are
produc
everi
possibl
barrel
they
can
iraq
s
averag
peak
so
far
last
year
at
barrel
per

their
januari
crude
oil
product
wa
barrel
per

below
that
averag
are
they
deliber
cut
product
if
so
not
by
much
kuwait
s
chart
look
strang
to
my
eye
i
believ
kuwait
is
one
of
two
and
possibl
three
opec
countri
that
could
increas
product
somewhat
the
other
are
saudi
arabia
and
possibl
the
unit
arab
emir
libya
is
struggl
if
peac
ever
break
out
in
libya
they
could
increas
product
somewhat
but
peac
doesn
t
seem
to
be
on
the
horizon
in
libya
nigerian
crude
oil
product
ha
a
gener
downward
trend
how
much
of
thi
trend
is
due
to
polit
problem
some
of
it
no
doubt
but
definit
not
all
of
it
qatar
peak
in
and
i
won
t
say
so
far
here
they
are
clearli
in
declin
saudi
crude
oil
product
ha
been
hold
steadi
for
month
now
saudi
is
the
onli
opec
nation
that
could
increas
product
by
ani
consider
amount
they
could
possibl
increas
product
from
one
quarter
to
one
half
million
barrel
per
day
but
like
a
lot
closer
to
one
quarter
million
per
possibl
the
uae
is
one
of
the
other
two
opec
nation
that
just
might
be
abl
to
increas
product
somewhat
but
i
have
more
doubt
about
the
uae
than
i
do
about
kuwait
venezuela
is
in
the
grasp
of
a
collaps
their
product
ha
fallen
barrel
per
day
in
the
last
three
month
their
novemb
product
wa
revis
downward
by
barrel
per
day
and
their
decemb
product
wa
revis
downward
by
barrel
per
is
in
danger
of
becom
a
total
fail
state
like
somalia
the
wors
thing
get
the
wors
thing
get
that
is
fall
incom
from
oil
export
increas
the
chanc
that
product
will
continu
to
fall
all
incom
from
export
will
have
to
be
use
to
keep
the
public
from
total
rebellion
and
none
will
be
left
for
the
oil
field
look
at
a
chart
put
opec
crude
onli
product
in
a
much
clearer
perspect
on
thi
chart
is
januari
onli
the
point
here
is
that
opec
cut
are
not
make
much
of
a
differ
world
oil
product
is
on
that
proverbi
bumpi
plateau
click
to
enlarg
saudi
kuwait
and
the
uae
began
to
increas
product
in
may
of
and
peak
in
novemb
of
that
year
the
other
opec
countri
peak
in
juli
seven
month
after
the
opec
cut
began
they
were
all
at
that
time
produc
flat
out
and
in
my
opinion
still
the
three
opec
countri
saudi
kuwait
and
the
uae
are
like
capabl
of
increas
product
they
in
my
opinion
can
in
no
way
increas
product
to
what
they
were
produc
in
late
that
wa
a
period
where
they
made
heroic
effort
to
increas
product
in
order
to
establish
a
point
from
which
they
could
cut
product
that
level
wa
then
and
is
now
unsustain
and
if
you
remov
venezuela
from
the
mix
then
the
combin
product
of
the
other
are
at
an
high
or
nearli
so
the
increas
in
product
of
the
countri
repres
in

for
the
last

ha
been
all
iran
recov

in
