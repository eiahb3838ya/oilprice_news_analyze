the
export
surg
is
like
set
to
export
figur
bounc
around
quit
a
bit
from
week
to
week
but
the
trend
ha
been
sharpli
up
over
the
past
year
rise
from
the
level
to
routin
top
million
barrel
per
day
more
recent
the
latest
week
put
crude
export
abov
for
the
first
time
obvious
the
surg
in
shale
product
is
a
larg
part
of
the
reason
refin
have
swallow
up
a
larg
portion
of
the
enorm
increas
in
shale
suppli
over
the
past
few
year
but
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
they
can
take
on
moreov
the
type
of
oil
that
refin
can
handl
is
not
perfectli
suit
to
the
type
of
oil
come
out
of
texa
shale
field
mani
of
the
gulf
coast
refin
are
best
equip
to
handl
medium
and
heavi
type
of
oil
while
shale
driller
are
extract
light
and
sweet
oil
from
west
texa
that
leav
a
lot
left
over
for
a
strong
driver
of
higher
oil
export
recent
is
the
discount
for
american
crude
the
discount
of
wti
to
brent
ha
widen
thi
year
from
around
per
barrel
in
earli
to
a
much
more
pronounc
discount
recent
in
late
april
the
discount
hit
per
barrel
and
by
the
discount
explod
to
about
per
barrel
relat
the
regul
that
could
push
oil
up
to
discount
ha
continu
to
widen
as
the
condit
between
the
american
market
and
the
rest
of
the
world
diverg
opec
is
keep
barrel
off
of
the
market
help
to
drain
inventori
back
to
averag
level
the
suppli
loss
in
venezuela
and
angola
have
tighten
the
market
faster
than
most
analyst
expect
plu
the
potenti
loss
from
iran
becaus
of
sanction
have
also
led
to
suppli
fear
all
of
thi
ha
put
a
premium
on
brent
rel
to
in
the
the
stori
is
the
same
that
it
ha
been
for
the
past
year
shale
continu
to
add
new
suppli
at
an
amaz
rate
to
be
sure
pipelin
bottleneck
could
significantli
slow
that
growth
rate
but
ani
curtail
in
suppli
ha
yet
to
show
up
in
the
end
result
is
that
cheap
american
crude
make
it
except
attract
to
foreign

definit
larg
enough
