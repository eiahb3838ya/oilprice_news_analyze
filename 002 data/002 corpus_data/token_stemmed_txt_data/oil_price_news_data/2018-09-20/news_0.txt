it
s
about
that
time
again
wti
hit
per
barrel
and
the
is
protect
the
countri
of
the
middl
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
veri
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continu
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
price
we
will
rememb
the
opec
monopoli
must
get
price
down
now
opec
doe
have
a
meet
in
the
come
day
in
algier
to
assess
the
state
of
the
oil
market
and
decid
on
next
step
but
one
of
the
largest
challeng
for
opec
is
balanc
the
oil
market
in
the
wake
of
lost
barrel
from
iran
a
key
factor
drive
up
price
and
also
a
fact
that
seem
to
be
lost
on
the
american
are
no
clear
solut
for
that
leav
the
oil
market
satisfi
while
also
maintain
group
obviou
cours
of
action
is
to
allow
for
higher
product
level
but
there
is
no
way
to
do
thi
while
also
get
all
parti
on
board
iran
s
oil
minist
said
that
ani
chang
to
tehran
s
allot
would
be
block
i
will
definit

that
threaten
our

interest
bijan
zanganeh
said
in
an
interview
with
report
from
s
p
global
platt
and
bloomberg
news
anyon
who
say
they
will
compens
for
the
shortfal
in
the
market
is
speak
against
iran
thi
is
a
polit
statement
not
becaus
ani
opec
agreement
requir
unanim
consent
iran
could
block
ani
chang
to
the
formal
oil
product
cut
still
hold
a
littl
bit
of
leverag
becaus
the
specif
of
the
june
agreement
which
call
for
increas
product
on
the
order
of
million
barrel
per
day
were
not
hammer
out
in
all
likelihood
saudi
arabia
and
russia
would
realist
take
on
a
greater
share
of
output
mostli
becaus
they
are
the
onli
one
that
have
the
abil
to
choos
to
produc
substanti
formal
those
increas
is
polit
tricki
after
all
iran
is
take
tangibl
loss
becaus
of
sanction
those
miss
barrel
have
to
be
made
up
elsewher
saudi
arabia
russia
and
a
few
gulf
state
are
the
onli
countri
that
can
increas
output
on
a
larg
scale
but
even
if
riyadh
can
physic
replac
the
gap
left
over
by
iran
iran
would
never
vote
in
favor
of
such
a
scenario
no
consensu
on
thi
issu
is
like
commerzbank
wrote
in
a
a
de
facto
increas
in
saudi
product
in
lieu
of
suppli
loss
from
iran
is
the
onli
realist
outcom
the
end
result
could
be
no
formal
agreement
on
specif
allot
that
take
into
account
fall
product
from
iran
and
venezuela
but
the
shift
in
market
share
may
happen
anyway
whether
or
not
approv
it
relat
mexico
aim
to
becom
the
energi
hub
of
latin
americait
amount
to
a
sort
of
between
riyadh
and
moscow
the
two
largest
produc
within
the
group
but
it
certainli
will
diminish
group
cohes
they
are
sacrif
opec
they
are
destroy
opec
and
slowli
slowli
without
directli
say
so
they
want
to
gather
some
name
togeth
to
creat
a
forum
to
replac
opec
and
manag
the
market
zanganeh
also
said
that
saudi
offici
should
fess
up
to
their
real
motiv
if
they
want
to
produc
excess
we
can
not
stop
them
zanganeh
said
there
is
no
forcibl
instrument
in
opec
but
they
should
do
it
in
the
name
of
opec
they
should
come
out
and
say
ha
phone
and
told
me
to
increas
output
and
i
have
no
other
way
but
to
do
so
not
onli
are
saudi
arabia
and
russia
take
on
a
greater
role
in
the
current
moment
to
ensur
market
stabil

they
are
also
look

in

the
seem
to
be

on
saudi

and
russia
along
with
american

to
offset
the

saudi

ha

sinc
may
while
russia
ha
ad
about
bpd
but
cover
the
acceler
loss
from
iran
won
t
be
an
easi
task
iran
could
lose
as
much
as
by
the
end
of
the
year
accord
to

analyt
venezuela
could
lose
anoth
arabia
is
the
onli
countri
with
the
abil
to
increas

on
the

of
what
we
are
talk
about
here

ani
ramp
up
in

necessarili
cut
into
spare
capac
which
is
alreadi
at
rel
low

the

market
will
welcom
more

will
nonetheless
grow

as

that

are
perhap
a
sign
that
saudi

are
acknowledg
the
challeng
of
keep
a

on

at
a
time
when
iran
is

a

it
won

increas
