iea: oil prices could rise further as shale canâ€™t fill the gap
shale
will
continu
it
breakneck
growth
rate
into
despit
bottleneck
but
the
oil

still
face
seriou
suppli
risk
from
the
potenti
loss
from
venezuela

the

that
the
run
up
in

in
the
last

despit

trade
significantli
higher
than

a

ahead
to
the
iea
think
that
oil

will
expand
by
yet
anoth
thi
time
with
the
help
of
the

a
number
of

come
onlin
earlier
than
expect
ad
more
consumpt

the

estim
is
a
rather
strong
one
given
substanti
expans

over
the
past
few
are
risk
to
that
forecast
includ
a
weaken
of

confid
trade
protection
and
a
potenti

strengthen
of

the
iea
said
those
factor
should
not
be

inde
strong

doe
not
stand
independ
of
the
price
variabl
for
instanc
how
thi
play
out
is
unclear
but
with
the
oil
market
now
much
tighter
than
at
ani
point
in
the
last
few
year
strong
demand
go
forward
will
start
to
drive
up
price
much
more
than
it
did
in
the
suppli
side
of
the
equat
is
much
more
interest
on
the
posit
side
of
the
ledger
the
iea
see

by
anoth

ha
not
been
without

the
iea
note
cite
the
discount
for

to
brent
and
an
even
greater
discount
for
oil
locat
in
midland
texa
where
all
of
that
oil
is
come
from
the
iea
doe
not
seem
overli
concern
about
the
pipelin
bottleneck
in
the
permian
note
that
much
of

will
be
resolv
with

by

end

rebound
on

we
think
that
in
texa
by
there
will
be
a
net
of
addit
pipelin
capac
beyond
our
earlier
number
albeit
with
most
of
it
come
on
line
in
the
second
half
of

the
iea
wrote
in
the
meantim
capac
will
like
remain
tight
but
product
will
still
be
abl
to
grow
strongli
by
thi
year
and
in
howev
while

shale
output
would
seem
to
keep
the
oil
market
catastroph
declin
in
venezuela
and
potenti
in
iran
could
keep
thing
rather
tight
the
iea
said
it
is
conceiv
that
the
