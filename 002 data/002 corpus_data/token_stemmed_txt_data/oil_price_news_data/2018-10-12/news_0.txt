and
these
higher

the

combin
with
the

leav
the
oil

a
step
back
the
iea
paus
to
note
the
histor
natur
of
today
s
oil
market
both
suppli
and
demand
are
close
in
on
the
mark
for
the
first
time
the
agenc
use
the
opportun
to
take
a
swipe
at
those
who
warn
about
peak
oil
suppli
fifteen
year
ago
forecast
of
peak
suppli
were
all
the
rage
with
product
from
countri
suppos
to
have
start
declin
by
now
the
iea
said
in
fact
product
ha
surg
led
by
the
us
shale
revolut
and
support
by
big
increas
in
brazil
canada
and
elsewher
in
futur
a
lot
of
potenti
suppli
could
come
to
the
market
from
place
like
iran
iraq
libya
nigeria
and
venezuela
if
their
variou
challeng
can
be
relat
will
big
oil
ever
win
back
investor
trust
global
product
ha
climb
significantli
over
the
last
decad
or
so
led
by
the
shale
revolut
but
it
seem
a
littl
presumptu
to
feel
confid
about
the
futur
of
suppli
when
it
rest
on
iran
iraq
libya
nigeria
and
venezuela
as
if
their
variou
challeng
can
so
easili
be
when
ha
it
ever
been
the
case
that
such
seriou
challeng
can
simpli
be
overcom
just
becaus
the
market
want
their
oil
not
onli
doe
the
iea
not
subscrib
to
peak
suppli
but
it
warn
that
peak
demand
may
be
far
off
as
well
the
driver
of
demand
remain
veri
power
and
consumpt

set
to
continu

transport

continu
to

although
at
a
slower
pace
as
electr

surg
petrochem
