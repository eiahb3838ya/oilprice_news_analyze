pipelin
woe
in

the
star
of

revolut
is
pant
under
the
weight
of
too
much
crude

and
not
enough
pipelin
avail
to
carri
it
to
the
gulf

the
eagl

the
situat
is
for
the
moment
better
and
as
pioneer
natur
resourc
chief
execut
scott
sheffield
said
last
week
some
driller
will
stop
drill
in
the
permian
but
other
will
pack
up
and
leav
the
destin
that
would
make
the
most
sens
will
be
the
eagl

industryth
eagl
ford
is
current
the
produc
shale
play
with
an
estim
daili
averag
of
million
bpd
in
eia
s
latest
drill
product
report
thi
is
expect
to
rise
to
million
bpd
next
month
the
number
of
activ
rig
is
also
rise
from
a
trough
of
just
at
the
height
of
the
oil
price
crisi
to
the
same
time
product
cost
are
not
all
that
much
higher
than
the
averag
in
the
permian
and
let
s
not
forget
that
thi
averag
cover
a
wide
rang
of
cost
level
in
the
eagl
ford
thi
averag
is
less
than
us
per
barrel
and
although
thi
is
higher
than
the
breakeven
of
the
permian
the
fact
that
there
is
more
spare
pipelin
capac
is
tempt
for
driller
have
to
sell
their
permian
oil
at
a
steep
discount
to
wti
becaus
of
the
pipelin
fact
driller
are
alreadi
focus
more
on
the
eagl
ford
thi
is
what
conocophillip
execut
vice
presid
alan
hirshberg
said
dure
an
earn
call
in
april
there
s
just
been
less
competit
for
good
and
servic
in
the
eagl
ford
and
better
netback
becaus
there
ve
been
less
peopl
tri
to
jam
their
barrel
down
the
same
takeaway
capac
so
everyth
about
the
eagl
ford
is
realli
hit
on
all
cylind
for
colorado
driller
are
move
into
the
permian
there
is
a
pickup
in
m
a
activ
in
the
area
and
there
are
new
pipelin
be
built
in
the
eagl

as
