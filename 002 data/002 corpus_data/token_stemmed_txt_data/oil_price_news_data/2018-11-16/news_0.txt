cnbc
thi
mark
the
longest
lose
streak
for
crude
oil
in
have
cover
the
factor
behind
thi
drop
in
the
previou
two
articl
to
recap
the
loss
of
china
as
an
export
market
for
oil
produc
ha
caus
crude
inventori
in
the
to
swell
and
the
trump
administr
s
weaken
of
immin
sanction
on
iran
have
both
been
larg
factor
in
the
badiali
senior
research
analyst
at
banyan
hill
think
the
declin
is
now
overdon
matt
say
that
from
april
to
septemb
iran
cut
of
export
but
saudi
arabia
and
the
expand
product
by
more
than
that
so
the
world
didn
t
feel
the
pinch
as
matt
explain
to
me
my
research
show
that
dure
the
to
iran
sanction
mani
of
the
asian
countri
cut
back
on
iranian
oil
import
china
includ
those
countri
cut
about
of
iranian
export
that
demand
didn
t
go
away
it
wa
fill
by
the
and
saudi
arabia
then
the
govern
issu
waiver
to
most
of
iran
s
oil
trade
partner
now
that
those
same
countri
got
waiver
they
are
buy
iranian
crude
a
glut
of
oil
on
the
market
i
agre
that
the
demand
hasn
t
declin
suppli
particularli
from
the
is
said
i
am
veri
skeptic
that
the
saudi
s
can
maintain
thi
level
of
product
it
s
onli
about
below
their
highest
product
in
the
last
decad
and
they
onli
maintain
that
level
of
output
for
a
few
month
befor
cut
back
i
believ
that
the
market
still
ha
a
drop
in
demand
price
in
that
seem
wrong
i
believ
thi
will
be
the
low
oil
price
for
the
next
to
michael
bertuccio
presid
ceo
of
energi
also
note
that
refineri
mainten
may
be
contribut
to
the
percept
of
an
oversuppli
market
i
believ
there
may
be
more
immedi
and
driver
to
oil
price
fall
particularli
the
west
texa
intermedi
wti
cash
market
in
cush
oklahoma
thi
is
refineri
mainten
season
of
the
million
barrel
per
day
of
refin
capac
in
padd
percent
ha
been
the
biggest
threat
to
dollar
dominanceit
is
far
more
transpar
in
the
physic
oil
basi
market
where
we
have
seen
midland
trade
plu
per
barrel
under
wti
howev
houston
ship
channel
meh
is
trade
closer
to
brent
which
is
current
plu
barrel
over
wti
add
a
stronger
and
strengthen
dollar
to
the
equat
and
i
see
thi
as
noth
more
than
a
price
michael
agre
that
global
demand
remain
chines
demand
he
believ
export
will
acceler
with
upcom
pipelin
infrastructur
and
the
wide
basi
spread
will
compress
toward
brent
which
is
a
better
benchmark
of
global
oil
thing
is
for
certain
oil
price
are
on
sale
rel
to
where
they
were
a
month
ago
it
appear
unlik
to
me
that
a
continu
declin
is
support
by
fundament
especi
if
the
stop
grant
waiver
on
iranian
oil
import
in
six
month
as
is
the
state
