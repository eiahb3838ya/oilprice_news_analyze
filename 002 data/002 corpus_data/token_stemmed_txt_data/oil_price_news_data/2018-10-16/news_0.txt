u.s. shaleâ€™s glory days are numbered
there
are
some
earli
sign
that
the
shale
industri
is
start
to
show
it
age
with
deplet
rate
on
the
studi
from
wood
mackenzi
found
that
some
well
in
the
permian
wolfcamp
were
suffer
from
declin
rate
at
or
abov
percent
after
five
year
much
higher
than
the
to
percent
origin
anticip
if
you
were
expect
a
well
to
hit
the
normal
or
percent
after
five
year
and
you
start
see
a
percent
declin
thi
becom
more
of
a
reserv
issu
than
an
econom
issu
said
duke
a
director
at
industri
consult
wood
mackenzi
accord
to
bloomberg
as
a
result
you
have
to
grow
activ
year
over
year
or
it
get
harder
and
harder
to
offset
moreov
shale
well
fizzl
out
much
faster
than
major
offshor
oil
field
which
is
signific
becaus
the
boom
in
shale
drill
over
the
past
few
year
mean
that
there
is
more
deplet
in
absolut
term
than
ever
befor
a
slowdown
in
drill
will
mean
that
deplet
start
to
becom
a
seriou
separ
studi
from
goldman
sach
take
a
deep
look
at
whether
or
not
the
shale
industri
is
start
to
see
the
effect
of
age
the
invest
bank
say
the
averag
life
span
for
the
most
transform
area
of
global
oil
suppli
is
between
and
of
these
rapid
growth
period
includ
the
ussr
in
the
mexico
and
the
north
sea
in
the
late
venezuela
s
heavi
oil
product
in
the
brazil
in
the
earli
and
shale
and
canada
s
oil
sand
in
the
each
had
their
period
in
the
limelight
but
ultim
mani
of
them
plateau
and
enter
an
extend
period
of
declin
though
some
suffer
steeper
declin
than
other
relat
oil
price
under
pressur
as
shale
suppli
shale
is
enter
the
lower
end
of
thi
rang
at
about
year
while
shale
is
still
grow
there
are
some
sign
that
the
shale
tail
which
goldman
say
is
the
phase
when
shale
becom
a
less
meaning
driver
of
global
oil
suppli
may
not
be
that
far
lay
out
the
five
signal
to
watch
out
for
which
would
indic
that
the
glori
day
of
shale
are
over
although
goldman
say
the
real
troubl
may
be
a
few
year
off
there
is
some
evid
that
some
of
those
dynam
are
begin
to
occur
the
invest
bank
offer
a
breakdown
as
when
inventori
is
be
revis
down
not
up
thi
is
alreadi
occur
in
some
area
such
as
the
eagl
ford
goldman
note
that
eog
resourc
inventori
fell
in
the
eagl
ford
in
the
second
quarter
with
the
compani
have
drill
more
well
than
it
ad
in
new
when
well
product
stop
improv
thi
one
is
inconclus
although
perhap
it
is
begin
to
becom
a
concern
goldman
note
that
the
industri
pose
explos
product
gain
in
but
those
gain
slow
thi
year
declin
rate
have
acceler
in
the
eagl
ford
and
delawar
basin
but
in
the
aggreg
there
may
still
be
some
room
for
improv
for
a
littl
when
suppli
cost
rise
for
structur
reason
cost
have
climb
recent
but
larg
becaus
of
cyclic
reason
goldman
argu
high
rate
of
drill
have
creat
bottleneck
and
push
up
cost
but
those
would
come
down
if
the
cycl
sour
it
is
still
earli
for
thi
when
capit
shift
to
other
region
thi
look
the
least
threaten
of
the
five
warn
sign
shale
remain
a
top
prioriti
and
the
oil
major
have
step
up
their
spend
in
shale
pivot
out
of
other
region
spend
on
crash
and
hasn
t
recov
there
ha
been
some
shift
of
capit
within
shale
play
such
as
from
the
permian
to
the
eagl
ford
and
the
bakken
but
thi
is
mostli
due
to
pipelin
when
growth
is
no
longer
lag
indic
goldman
sach
still
see
shale

indic

the
invest

say
that
compani

still
a
solid

through

goldman

much
invest

still
expect

to
add
