opec ‘supergroup’ keeps oil exports subdued
i
wa
jest
the
other
day
about
who
would
be
on
guitar
in
opec
supergroup
but
it
got
me
think
about
the
variou
global
oil
produc
and
how
their
trait
could
be
reflect
of
their
musicianship
thi
is
where
it
led
me
if
opec
nopec
were
a
supergroup
saudi
arabia
would
have
to
be
the
band
manag
the

keep
everyon
els
in
check
the
kingdom
would
also
as
the
tour
bu
driver
given
they
are
the
one
drive
the
rest
of
the
group
if
saudi
is
the
manag
russia
must
be
the
lead
singer
step
into
the
spotlight
and
up
to
the
mic
unlik
roadi
the

angola

kuwait
would
be
the

upbeat

angola
would
be

reliabl
