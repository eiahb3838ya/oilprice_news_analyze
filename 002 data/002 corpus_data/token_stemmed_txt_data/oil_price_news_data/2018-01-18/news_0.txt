ha
been
the
subject
of
much
debat
and
a
topic
that
ha
attract
a
lot
of
interest
just
in
the
last
few

consumpt
level
in
some
part
of
the

for
electr
the

will
hit

kind
of
miss
the
whole

argu
a
new
report
which
is
notabl

coauthor
by

chief
economist
spencer
dale
along
with
bassam
fattouh
the
director
of
the
oxford
institut
for
energi
argu
that
the
focu
shouldn
t
be
on
the
date
at
which
oil
demand
peak
but
rather
the
fact
that
the
peak
is
come
at
all
the
signific
of
peak
oil
is
that
it
signal
a
shift
from
an
age
of
perceiv
scarciti
to
an
age
of

exact

unknow
and
in

event
the
year
in
which
the
world
doe
hit

consumpt
won
t
result
in
some
abrupt
discontinu
of
behavior
the
report
argu
demand
growth
will
slow
and
then
declin
but
probabl
won
t
fall
off
a
cliff
so
the
exact
date
of
peak
oil
demand
is
not
particularli
nevertheless
the
implic
of
a

are
massiv
without

the
author
of
the
more
intrigu
