sinc
now
there
are
question
about
saudi
arabia
s
spare
capac
and
it
abil
to
offset
the
outag
in
result
is
that
wti
and
brent
are
on
diverg
path
which
could
widen
the
differenti
to
as
much
as
per

accord
to
citigroup
roughli
twice
as
high
as
today
as
permian

more

the

that
a

are

said
in

in

last
week
it
s
bottleneck
get
to
the
gulf
coast
but
it
s
not
as
bottleneck
get
into
that
could
result
in
the
widest
discount
in
about
five
year
we
expect
that
permian
product
is
go
to
continu
to
grow
mors
said
we
have
product
from
colorado
to
oklahoma
even
from
north
dakota
and
canada
that
ha
to
go
to
cush
befor
get
to
the
gulf
a
differenti
as
larg
as
per
barrel
would
have
knock
on
effect
it
would
supercharg
the
busi
case
for
new
pipelin
come
out
of
the
permian
although
some
analyst
think
that
the
midstream
market
in
texa
is
get
pretti
crowd
with
sever
pipelin
under
construct
such
a
heavi
discount
could
also
increment

in
the
shale
patch
at
the
same
time
new
mode
of
transit
could
open
up
with
an
expans
of
truck
and
rail
move
oil
from
west
texa
to
the
gulf
coast
although
truck
and
rail
are
also
face
their
own
constraint
more
obviou
effect
of
a
discount
for
wti
would
be
an
acceler
of
crude

export
crude
discount
by
that
much
would
be
veri
attract
to
buyer
around
the
world
so
export
would
like
rise
even
higher
than
today
s
level
if
wti
were
discount
by
per

rel
to

the

refin
would
also
enjoy
buy
up
crude
and
churn
out

which
they
could
export
at
much
higher

that
are
more

even

would
have
a
better

the
heavili
discount
oil
trap
behind
the
pipelin
wti
may
be
discount
to
brent
by
per
barrel
but
midland
crude
would
be
discount
by
at
least
as
much
rel
to

the
result
would
be
a

for
thi
is

there
are
sever
reason
whi
the

the
biggest
and
most
obviou
reason
is
that
the
permian
pipelin
bottleneck
is
expect
to
be
fleet
by
late
next

new

start
come

that
will
allow

either

narrow
the

second
reason
would
be
that
a
