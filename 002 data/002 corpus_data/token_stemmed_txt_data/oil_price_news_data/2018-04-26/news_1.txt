and
there
are
those
who
claim
that
we
have
seen
the
last
big
oil
price
beg
to
differ
howev
a
notabl
voic
among
the
skeptic
is
reuter
market
analyst
john
kemp
in
a
recent
column
kemp
lay
out
in
detail
the
reason
whi
the
it
will
never
happen
again
refrain
is
wish
think
at
best
and
delus
at
worst
the
oil
industri
he
say
ha
a
cyclic
natur
learn
from
past
mistak
while
a
good
thing
gener
can
not
help
avoid
the
next
bust
becaus
boom
and
bust
is
the
veri
natur
of
the
scar
from
the
last
bust
still
fresh
the
oil
industri
is
be
cautiou
with
new
invest
just
as
it
ha
been
after
everi
singl
bust
sinc
the
dawn
of
oil
kemp
note
oil
compani
are
suspici
of
the
price
rise
uncertain
it
will
last
and
they
are
quit
right
to
be
suspici
becaus
no
boom
ever
last
as
histori
ha
proven
time
and
again
the
problem
is
that
nobodi
can
predict
the
end
of
the
next
cycl
and
the
begin
of
a
new
one
henc
the
if
nobodi
can
predict
the
next
price
collaps
what
is
the
point
of
have
analyst
fall
over
themselv
to
forecast
the
unforecast
name
futur
oil
price
well
here
s
a
pertin
quot
from
john
kenneth
galbraith
economist
don
t
forecast
becaus
they
know
they
forecast
becaus
they
re

forecast
are
notori
inaccur
and
thi
is
particularli
and
veri
emphat
true
of
oil
price
forecast
here
s
anoth
quot
from
rex
tillerson
we
ve
never
been
good
at
predict
these
price
cycl
neither
when
they
occur
nor
their
durat
we
don
t
spend
a
lot
of
time
even
that
s
certainli
a
smart
approach
and
one
that
must
pay
off
by
save
time
effort
and
money
relat
are
investor
turn
away
from
big
oil
the
reason
whi
predict
the
next
oil
industri
cycl
is
mission
imposs
come
down
to
the
makeup
of
the
oil
market
and
the
huge
divers
of
extern
factor
that
have
a
bear
on
price
and
therefor
on
the
cycl
the
oil
market
kemp
say
is
actual
a
collect
of
numer
submarket
and
these
are
never
in
balanc
when
they
are
in
balanc
it
s
onli
for
a
veri
short
time
so
the
phrase
balanc
the
market
is
basic
the
market
there
are
thousand
of
event
that
can
affect
oil
price
and
there
is
no
way
on
earth
anyon
can
account
for
each
and
everi
one
of
these
thousand
of
event
rang
from
local
polit
in
oil
produc
and
consum
to
forc
majeur
event
as
bill
gilmer
director
of
the
institut
for

forecast
at
the
univers
of
houston
put
it
the
world
doe
not
stand
still
so
the
chanc
of
ani
one
analyst
or
big
oil
ceo
get
the
price
right
is
pretti
much
the

as
the

what
