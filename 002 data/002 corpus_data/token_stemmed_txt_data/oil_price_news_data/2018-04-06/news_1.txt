in

decad
true
the
period
until

which
the
neg

heighten

india

have
now
move
into

that
show
posit
correl

and
a
neg

the

is
also
in
thi
group
with
a
weak
posit
correl

with
a
neg

correl
the
research
s
not
clear
whether
the
global
economi
will
continu
to
show
a
neg
correl
between
oil
demand
and
oil
price
from
thi
point
onward
but
the
research
suggest
that
in
the

state
and
even
in
china
and
india
oil
demand
is
now
more
sensit
to
