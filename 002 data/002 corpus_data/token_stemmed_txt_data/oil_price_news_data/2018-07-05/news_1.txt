that

a

is
these
forc
which

such
as

that
while
commod

goldman
think
it
will
be
one
of
the
other
two
factor
the
bottom
line
is
that
someth
ha
to
give
and
we
agre
with
our
fx
strategist
that
the
dollar
will
like
weaken
from
the
bank
also
dismiss
chines
tariff
on
crude
argu
that
market
will
quickli
adapt
china
will
end
up
buy
more
oil
from
russia
the
middl
east
west
africa
and
the
north
sea
export
will
initi
have
to
discount
their
crude
in
order
to
attract
other
buyer
but
thi
period
would

short
live
goldman
short
the

doe
not
believ
that
the

will
end
the
upsw

we
believ
that
the
trade

impact
on
commod
market
will
be
veri
small
with
except
of

where
complet
