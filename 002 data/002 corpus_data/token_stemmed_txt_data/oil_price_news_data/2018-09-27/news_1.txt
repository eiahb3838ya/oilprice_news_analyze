is
a
bloomberg
stori
say
indian
refin
will
not
buy
ani
iranian
crude
in
novemb
the
other
is
a
reuter
stori
quot
a
govern
offici
as
say
new
delhi
ha
not
told
refin
to
stop
buy
iranian
crude
these
two
stori
don
t
just
offer
two
differ
perspect
they
demonstr
exactli
how
confus
the
situat
is
and
how
much
more
confus
it
could
becom
and

support
thi
soon
enough
if

find
a
replac
for
those
bpd
that
they
had
been
import
from
iran
as

ship
is
no
