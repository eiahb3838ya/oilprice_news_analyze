and
it
willing

go
along
with
a

the
key
factor
in

although
russia
s
precis
contribut
wa
not
known
at
the
time
of
thi
write
deal
can
be
call
a
success
for
two
reason
first
it
take
off
of
the
market
begin
in
januari
which
will
go
a
long
way
to
eras
the
surplu
second
it
remov
a
great
deal
of
uncertainti
about
what
to
expect
in
the
near
futur
oil
price
have
been
all
over
the
map
in
the
last
few
month
with
saudi
product
surg
at
a
time
when
shale
wa
also
defi
expect
now
it
s
reason
to
assum
that
ani
surplu
or
deficit
won
t
be
so
larg
as
to
lead
to
dramat
price
swing
at
least
in
the
short
run
relat
could
iraq
be
the
next
opec
member
to
exit
howev
the
one
remain
piec
of
uncertainti
is
how
or
if
the
govern
will
react
presid
trump
ha
repeatedli
demand
low
oil
price
and
tweet
as
recent
as
wednesday
to
that
effect
typic
opec
would
not
be
all
that
sensit
to
trump
s
demand
but
saudi
arabia
is
reel
after
the
intern
outrag
over
the
murder
of
jamal
khashoggi
a
bipartisan
movement
in
washington
is
up
the
pressur
on
riyadh
and
trump
ha
been
one
of
the
few
friend
saudi
arabia
ha
oil
price
rise
too
much
trump
might
lash
out
and
dump
the
saudi
although
what
that
mean
in
practic
is
veri
much
unclear
due
to
extrem
budgetari
pressur
from
low
oil
price
saudi
arabia
had
no
choic
but
to
risk
trump
s
ire
and
push
for
