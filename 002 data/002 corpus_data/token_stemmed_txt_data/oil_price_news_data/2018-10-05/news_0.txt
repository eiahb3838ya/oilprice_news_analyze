should energy investors be worried by the fedâ€™s latest move?
just
in
case
you
didn
t
notic
stock
lost
ground
yesterday
and
the
reason
du
jour
wa
a
surg
in
interest
rate
the
yield
on
the
benchmark
climb
to
around
percent
it
highest
level
in
year
and
the
jump
extend
out
along
the
curv
with
the
year
also
hit
it
highest
level
sinc
that
put
pressur
on
stock
as
trader
weigh
the
potenti
slow
effect
of
higher
rate
on
the
economi
and
the
fact
that
higher
yield
make
bond
rel
more
attract
potenti
divert
money
from
the
stock
market
the
question
here
though
is
should
energi
investor
be
concern
figur
year
yield
click
to
enlarg
peopl
are
attract
to
invest
in
the
energi
sector
for
sever
reason
but
recent
one
of
the
main
among
them
is
the
lack
of
correl
between
stock
in
the
sector
and
the
broader
market
energi
stock
respond
more
to
move
in
the
price
of
oil
than
they
do
to
anyth
els
so
don
t
necessarili
follow
the
herd
in
order
to
assess
the
potenti
impact
on
those
stock
of
higher
yield
then
we
must
first
look
at
what
it
could
mean
for
oil
seem
to
be
sever
reason
rate
jump
yesterday
the
most
obviou
is
that
the
fed
is
hike
rate
but
that
ha
been
the
case
for
a
while
and
their
plan
to
continu
along
that
path
can
hardli
be
call
a
secret
more
like
thi
wa
a
move
in
front
of
today
s
job
report
which
wa
expect
to
show
higher
averag
wage
someth
that
is
often
an
indic
of
futur
inflat
the
belief
is
that
that
could
prompt
the
fed
to
increas
the
magnitud
and
pace
of
rate
hike
and
the
market
is
discount
that
possibl
onc
again
though
the
relev
question
here
is
how
will
that
affect
energi
stock
relat
whi
the
saudi
can
t
keep
a
lid
on
oil
pricesif
inflat
is
at
the
root
of
concern
then
far
from
be
a
neg
for
the
sector
the
event
of
the
last
coupl
of
day
should
be
a
posit
at
least
in
the
rel
short
term
inflat
mean
rise
price
and
the
price
of
oil
should
go
up
along
with
everyth
els
as
i
said
earlier
the
price
of
oil
is
one
of
the
main
driver
of
energi
stock
so
if
that
move
higher
stock
will
follow
we
are
alreadi
see
high
price
becaus
of
suppli
constraint
so
anoth
jump
should
result
in
a
windfal
for
oil
rate
hike
have
been
seen
as
bad
for
energi
stock
becaus
much
of
their
valu
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
big
multin
ha
been
deriv
from
dividend
payment
howev
follow
the
collaps
in
oil
price
a
coupl
of
year
ago
dividend
have
been
cut
in
mani
case
make
them
less
of
a
factor
for
energi
investor
so
while
higher
rate
will
push
the
price
of
invest
such
as
mlp
lower
they
will
probabl
have
a
mute
effect
on
other
oil
stock
in
term
of
rel
yield
howev
the
pictur
becom
a
littl
less
rosi
if
we
look
a
littl
further
into
the
futur
rate
hike
are
necessari
to
counter
inflationari
pressur
but
they
are
not
without
some
risk
higher
interest
rate
discourag
borrow
and
invest
slow
the
economi
down
if
they
are
overdon
even
by
a
small

that
could
choke
off
the
energi
demand
growth
that
the
market
is
current

in
forc
oil
and
therefor
energi
stock
answer
to
the
origin
question
should
energi
investor
be
concern
about
rise
bond
yield
is
therefor
ye
and
no
in
the
short
term
the
inflat
that
the
move
is
anticip
will
be
a
posit
but
in
the
long
term
slower
growth
could
have
a
neg
effect
in
those
circumst
as
stock
fall
in

buy
energi
stock
make

for
