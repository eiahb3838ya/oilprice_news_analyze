that
four

is
not

one
at

it
could
be
the
start
of

chang
after
the
midtermsth
idea
for
the
exchang
is
to
have
privat
local
entiti
buy
the
crude
and
then
resel
it
to
foreign
trader
analyst
accur
point
out
that
thi
would
still
put
the
foreign
entiti
on
the
hook
for
penalti
from
washington
as
do
busi
with
iranian
entiti
would
constitut
a
breach
of
the
sanction
yet
smuggler
would
hardli
care
about
iranian
sanction
so
there
is
a
good
chanc
that

would
make
use

our
goal
remain
to
get

we
are
prepar

realiz
that
they
do
not

there
is
such
