is the oil industry repeating a critical error
ten
year
ago
thi
to
be
price
of
a

on
the

mercantil
exchang
hit
an
intraday
high
of
it
highest

ever
by

out
around

in

at

then
rose
almost
continu
until
as

rose
the

best

began
to
look
so
foolish
for
have
predict
ampl
suppli
for
decad
to
come
that
hi
firm
final
revers
itself
in
and
began
to
forecast
higher
price
that
should
have
been
read
as
a
contrarian
signal
just
two
month
later
the
oil
bull
market
oil

at
the

believ
that
their
forecast
of
a
nearbi

in
the

of

had
been
fulfil
the
offici

seem
to
confirm

had
made
a

fell
by
more

and
did
not
surmount

until

in

the

a

what

rather

one
of

critic

think

that

a

is
that

heavi

both
critic
are
fals

as
they
appli
to
the
thinker
such
as

geologist
colin
far
back
as
campbel
recogn
that
high

price
would
dampen
oil
consumpt
and
delay

draw
out
the
peak
but
neither
he
nor
other
thinker
believ
that
unconvent
oil
resourc
could
do
anyth
more
than
soften
the
rate

the
reason
wa
that
such
resourc
would
be
expens

difficult
to

and
would
therefor
not
enter
the
market
quickli
enough
to
overcom
the
declin
of

oil
here
is
what
peak
oil
thinker
could
forese
that

would
subsid
the
product
of

rather
than
seek
a
