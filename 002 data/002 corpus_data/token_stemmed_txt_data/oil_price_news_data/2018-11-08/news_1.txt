will china continue its canadian crude buying spree?
chines
refin
have
been
buy
a
lot
of
canadian
crude
oil
in
the
last
coupl
of
month
take
advantag
of
the
massiv
discount
of
western
canadian
select
to
west
texa
intermedi
the
purchas
have
given
troubl
canadian
driller
hope
for
the
futur
that
even
without
the
tran
mountain
expans
their
crude
could
expand
on
asian
purchas
million
barrel
of
heavi
canadian
crude
oil
for

in
septemb
up
by
nearli
percent
compar
to
the
million
barrel
it
import
from
canada
in
april
bloomberg
report
last

quot
data
by

intellig
compani
month
chines
refin
continu
buy
canadian
crude
with
tanker
load
bound
for
china
reach
million
barrel
sinc
the
start
of
septemb
bloomberg
data
thi
is
not
a
whole
lot
of
oil
if
it
were
a
million
barrel
daili
then
we
could
probabl
speak
of
a
seismic
shift
in
the
export
market
of
canadian
crude
a
shift
that
would
make
it
more
competit
by
introduc
anoth
buyer
besid
refin
even
at
the
current
level
though
the
chine
refin
intak
of
canadian
crude
indic
a
chang
might
be
come
yet
thi
chang
will
onli
come
if
chines
refin
can
offer
canadian
produc
good
price
that
beat
the
price
that
the
west
coast
refin
are
prepar
to
have
yet
to
see
how
thi
play
out
becaus
the
past
two
month
were
refineri
mainten
season
in
the
unit
state
and
a
lot
of
refineri
have
yet
to
ramp
up
to
full
product
thi
mean
that
they
have
yet
to
ramp
up
their
purchas
of
heavi
canadian
crude
that
they
need
to
make
fuel
and
thi
mean
the
chines
buyer
have
yet
to
face
the
competit
of
the
refin
relat
oil
product
is
set
to
soar
past
million
bpdchanc
are
they
will
face
it
with
a
smile
becaus
the
huge
discount
of
western
canadian
select
to
wti
is
not
the
onli
reason
for
thi
shift
the
other
reason
ha
to
do
with
suppli
china
s
two
other
main
sourc
of
heavi
and
both
go
through
a
product
declin
albeit
for
differ
reason
so
chines
refin
simpli
don
t
have
much
of
a
choic
when
it
come
to
sourc
the
heavi
crude
blend
that
they
need
when
one
supplier
can
not
deliv
you
turn
to
whoever
potenti
huge
market
is
what
motiv
the
expans
of
the
tran
mountain
pipelin
that
turn
into
a
bone
of
content
between
neighbor
british
columbia
and
alberta
howev
there
is
littl
chanc
the
expans
will
begin
anytim
soon
what
with
all
the
opposit
and
legal
challeng
from
environmentalist
and
first
nation
alberta
is
not
give
up
the
fight
but
it
s
not
make
a
lot
of
progress
if
chines
refin
continu
to
buy
canadian
crude
even
without
the
cheaper
pipelin
channel
it
would
significantli
brighten
the
prospect
of
canada
s

industri
the
problem
is
if
