the u.s. oil production “mirage”
some
of
the
surg
in
oil
product
thi
past
spring
might
have
been
a
on
juli
the
eia
releas
monthli
data
on
oil
product
which
reveal
a
declin
in
output
of
bpd
in
may
compar
to
a
month
earlier
the
dip
is
a
surpris
given
the
widespread
assumpt
that
shale
product
wa
continu
to
grow
at
a
blister
be
sure
a
big
reason
for
the
declin
in
overal
output
wa
the
declin
in
product
from
offshor
gulf
of
mexico
but
texa
product
onli
rose
by
bpd
a
disappoint
figur
that
like
came
in
far
below
what
most
analyst
had
the
monthli
total
of
million
barrel
per
day
for
may
is
sharpli
lower
than
what
eia
itself
thought
at
the
time
here
are
the
weekli
estim
for
oil
product
that
the
eia
put
out
back
then
april
the
weekli
estim
tend
to
be
less
accur
than
the
retrospect
monthli
number
that
is
not
a
new
dynam
and
estim
on
a
weekli
basi
inher
involv
a
lot
of
guesswork
so
thi
is
not
a
knock
on
the
the
discrep
is
rather
strike
not
onli
did
the
eia
estim
that
product
in
april
and
may
wa
much
higher
than
it
actual
wa
but
the
agenc
also
thought
product
wa
rise
the
weekli
estim
were
to
be
believ
at
the
time
product
would
have
climb
from
in
earli
april
to
by
the
end
of
may
an
increas
of
bpd
over
a
roughli
onli
wa
product
lower
than
that
but
it
didn
t
actual
increas
at
all
the

more
accur

a
slight
declin
in

from
in

to
just
in
weekli
data

shown
a
strong

from

the

horsnel

along
with

we

crude

not

shown
in

in
the

and
that
it
is
significantli
below
with

that
is
a
reason
conclus
given
the
roughli
differ
between
the

the

switch
it
report
for
the
weekli
survey
by

data

from

look

s
a

to

from

dip
at
the
end
of

a
rather
surpris
move
output
from

fell
bpd
over
the
last

much
of
the

sinc
the

which

of

is
a
littl
earli
to
realli
get
a
sens
of
how
much
the

slow
down
most
analyst
have
been
assum
an
overal
slowdown
over
the
next
month
becaus
of
pipelin

howev
the

figur
might
suggest
that
the

alreadi
start
to
bite
in

the
eia
predict
in
it
drill
product
report
that
permian
product
would
jump
by
bpd
in
may
but
the
monthli
data
just
releas
find
onli
modest
gain
in
texa
bpd
and
new
mexico
bpd
the
eia
think
output
broke
in
juli
an
high
but
judg
by
the
monthli
data
from
april
and
may
perhap
the
agenc
is
also
overst

figur
which
rais
the
possibl
that
product
is
not
nearli
as
high
as
we
current
the
come
month
if
monthli
product
figur
continu
to

undershoot
expect
that
would
have

most

still
are

figur
into
their

if

the
