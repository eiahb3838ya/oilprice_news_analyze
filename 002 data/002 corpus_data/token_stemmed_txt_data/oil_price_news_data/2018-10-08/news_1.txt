s
remark
by

that
the
saudi
were
offset

even
an
interview
with

princ
moham
said
that
a
ctualli
the
request
that
america
made
to
saudi
arabia
and
other
opec
countri
is
to
be
sure
that
if
there
is
ani

that
we
will
suppli
that
and
that

so
we
export
as

higher
price
of

over
the

not
the
result
of

rather
the
consequ
of
lower
