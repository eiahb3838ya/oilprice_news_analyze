he
said
that
the

not

aim
at
a

but
to
coordin
product
level
as
they
see
of
cours
thi
ha
alway
been
the
mission
of
opec
the
object
of
establish
a
perman
bodi
rais
the
question
of
what
is
suppos
to
happen
to
opec
suggest
that
could
work
close
with
it
seem
confus
sinc
all
of
the
opec
member
are
in
while
contain
a
bunch
of
addit
countri
how
will
these
two
bodi
interact
and
to
what
degre
will
they
overlap
that
much
remain
one
certainti
is
that
there
is
somewhat
of
a
chang
of
the
guard
with
opec
give
way
to
a
govern
structur
domin
by
just
two
countri
saudi
arabia
seem
keen
on
forgo
the
struggl
of
work
with
more
than
a
dozen
countri
to
build
consensu
prefer
a
of
sort
with
i
think
russia
will
have
to
take
the
leadership
said
when
ask
about
who
will
be
the
drive
forc
behind
establish
a
formal
secretariat
russia
is
a
heavi
weight
both
in
term
of
product
and
in
term
of
polit
influenc
so
russia
s
leadership
for
is
indisput
that
s
whi
i
expect
russia
would
play
a
key
relat
the
biggest
winner
in
the
mediterranean
energi
warth
rest
of
opec
or
for
that
matter
no
longer
carri
the
weight
they
onc
did
sever
opec
member
suffer
from
instabl
and
volatil
product
level
some
are
presid
over
declin
output
asid
from
kuwait
and
the
uae
no
one
els
ha
the
abil
to
add
or
subtract
suppli
from
the
market
base
on
strateg
or
polit
calcul
just
about
everi
other
member
is
tri
to
produc
as
much
as
even
allud
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
power
to
manipul
oil
market
condit
is
concentr
in
saudi
arabia
and
russia
he
said
the
new
would
still
nomin
adher
to
the
one
countri
one
voic
philosophi
but
he
also
seem
to
suggest
that
the
group
s
two
largest
produc
would
realli
be
in
charg
ye
we
ultim
want
everybodi
to
be
on
board
but
my
experi
is
that
countri
like
russia
and
saudi
arabia
with
bigger
scale
and
bigger
impact
ultim
carri
more
weight
said
becaus
peopl
know
that
if
we
agre
to
cut
five
percent
as
we
did
our
volum
are
when
we
sit
around
the
tabl
our
voic
carri
more
he
even
suggest
that
formal
vote
would
not
realli
be
the
focu
but
convinc
other
saudi
arabia
and
russia
will
set
the
agenda
and
the
rest
of
will
follow
their
what
doe
have
in

note
that
