there
were

that

hi
remark
in

question
no
i
think
it
can
absolut
be
solv
through

a

of
thi
ha
to

perfor
and
we
have
divers
technolog
that
we
have
been
promot
to
the
market
for
sever
year
with
some
but
i
think
thi
is
like
to
acceler
and
it
s
also
about
how
you
ensur
that
your
frac
stay
within
the
alloc
rough
volum
that
you
have

which
is
more
of
a
conform
that
you
are
look
for
and
we
have
technolog
in
term
of
how
we
design
the
frac
fluid
to
address
that
too
so
all
of
these
thing
i
believ
are
address
but
it
requir
a
bit
more
of
a
reservoir
focu
on
how
the
well
are
drill
how
the
well
are
frack
and
we
need
a
littl
bit
more

that
we

the
right
thing
here

the
