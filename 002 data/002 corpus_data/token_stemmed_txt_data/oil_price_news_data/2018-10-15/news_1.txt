are u.s. oil exports really unstoppable?
earlier
thi
year
when
crude
oil
export
hit
a
record
million
bpd
the
figur
wa
hail
as
the
begin
of
a
new
era
that
could
eventu
see
the
world
s
top
top
produc
for
thi
year
so
export
up
to
million
bpd
some
believ
that
noth
short
of
a
sharp
price
spike
can
interfer
with
the
bright
futur
of
light
crude
inde
if
fundament
were
the
onli
factor
at
play
that
would
be
the
case
ala
there
are
more
factor
that
can
affect
the
futur
of
the
unit
state
as
a
major
oil
it
s
worth
note
whi
export
are
grow
it
s
not
just
becaus
of
the
shale
boom
it
s
also
not
onli
becaus
of
the
lift
of
the
oil
export
ban
from
the
an
import
reason
for
the
jump
in
crude
oil
export
is
the
fact
that
as
houston
chronicl
s
rye
druzin
note
in
a
recent
stori
a
lot
of
refineri
are
simpli
not
equip
for
process
the
light
crude
they
need
heavier
grade
henc
the
still
exist
demand
for
canadian
and
venezuelan
oil
which
is
heavier
than
the
light
crude
pump
from
the
could
invest
in
new
facil
that
can
process
light
crude
but
it
is
a
larg
undertak
still
chevron
is
do
it
although
as
druzin
point
out
it
might
be
the
except
for
most
export
the
crude
they
can
t
absorb
in
the
refineri
is
the
prefer
option
so
thi
mean
export
are
set
for
a
rise
whatev
happen
right
wrong
of
cours
there
is
no
such
thing
as
whatev
the
clearest
sign
yet
that
oil
is
not
yet
readi
to
take
over
is
china
s
zero
oil
import
in
august
local
refin
appar
decid
to
be
cautiou
amid
the
deepen
trade
row
between
washington
and
beij
and
perhap
see
if
they
can
make
do
without
crude
they
did
make
do
total
chines
oil
import
in
august
went
up
by
percent
hit
a
reason
china
is
import
is
that
as
of
juli
it
wa
the
buyer
of
crude
after
canada
it
took
in
percent
of
total
oil
export
last
year
and
percent
thi
year
until
august
that
s
more
than
a
fifth
of
total
export
and
truth
be
told
the
receiv
countri
mix
is
not
that
great
without
china
relat
oil
s
billion
black
marketsur
produc
are
export
to
japan
and
india
as
well
and
india
is
a
top
import
of
crude
but
india
is
also
have
troubl
with
it
oil
bill
alreadi
and
oil
will
be
hard
press
to
compet
with
middl
eastern
crude
which
is
simpli
a
lot
closer
to
india
and
henc
korea
is
also
a
buyer
of
oil
and
it
ha
a
stronger
economi
than
india
and
could
therefor
afford
costlier
crude
for
a
while
especi
after
it
cut
it
import
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
in
anticip
of
a
pat
on
the
head
for
compli
with
washington
s
request
for
iranian
import
cut
to
zero
japan
is
a
staunch
alli
and
a
major
oil
import
so
that

european
countri
notabl
the
netherland
the
uk
and
itali
and
to
a
lesser
extent
franc
and
denmark
are
also
buyer
of
crude
but
the
amount
they
need
are
too
low
to
spur
a
true
export
boom
in
fact
morgan

the

all
the
