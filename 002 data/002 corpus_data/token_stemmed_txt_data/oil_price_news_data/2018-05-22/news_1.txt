but
now
with
the

meet
just
a

week
away
opec
is
suddenli
warm
up
to
the
idea

oecd

and
becaus
that
is
the
latest

for

it
is
safe
to
assum
that

the
motiv

the

to
the

of

which
allow

than

at
thi

the

for

the
propos
under

for

would
be
to

becaus
most
of

suppli
would
have

could
still
keep

allow

onli
