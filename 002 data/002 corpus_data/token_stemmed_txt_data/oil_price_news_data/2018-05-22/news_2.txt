make
sure
it
is
low
enough
for
other
member

start
pump
opec
is
talk
about
take
action
thi
mean
it
is
not
too
happi
with

is
now
at
the
lowest

about
seven
decad
at
just

and
all
sign
point
toward
a
further
declin
after
the
of
nicola
maduro
and
the
veri
good
chanc
for
more
punit
action
from
washington
which
will
no
doubt
target
the

even
without

be
grate
to

the

also

such
as

a
result

thi
is

despit
the
upbeat
rhetor
from

a

could
it
be
that

suppli
follow
the
reintroduct
of

help
thi
stronger
demand
by
the
way
ha
been
one
of
the
top
argument
of
oil
bull
in
support
of
their
expect
that
even
brent
at
us
won
t
hurt
china
ha
made
it
clear
it
will
continu
buy
crude
for
iran
with
or
without
sanction
so
the
effect
of
these
sanction
on
suppli
is
like
to
be
a
lot
milder
than
the
last
time
when
the
west
impos
sanction
on
iran
china
in
other
word
ha
secur
the
suppli
to
match
it
demand
even
with
opec
product
at
current
level
and
it
will
like
prefer
iranian
crude
to
other
opec
crude
becaus
it
can
pay

note
that

a

so
opec
is
right
to
