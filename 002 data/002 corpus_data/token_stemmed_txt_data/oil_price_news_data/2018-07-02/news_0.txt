saudi arabia wonâ€™t bring 2 million bpd online
presid
trump
said
in
a
tweet
on
saturday
that
saudi
arabia
agre
to
boost
oil
product
by
million
barrel
per
day
a
claim
that
sure
came
as
news
to
the
spoke
to
king
salman
of
saudi
arabia
and
explain
to
him
that
becaus
of
the
turmoil
disfunct
in
iran
and
venezuela
i
am
ask
that
saudi
arabia
increas
oil
product
mayb
up
to
barrel
to
make
up
the
differ
price
to
high
he
ha
agre
the
tighten
of
the
oil
market
ha
push
up
price
which
is
alway
a
concern
for
politician
wari
of
catch
heat
from
their
decis
by
in
june
to
hike
product
by
look
increasingli
inadequ
in
deal
with
the
grow
number
of
suppli
outag
around
the
world
it
s
no
surpris
that
trump
want
more
saudi
oil
on
the
market
but
he
like
misunderstood
what
the
saudi
told
arabia
wa
produc
in
may
and
recent
report
suggest
they
might
add
as
much
as
bpd
to
in
juli
a
massiv
increas
in
such
a
short
period
of
it
s
a
far
cri
from
the
that
trump
think
saudi
arabia
will
add
that
would
translat
into
overal
product
of
around
which
is
probabl
unrealist
for
a
few
there
are
technic
question
about
how
far
and
how
fast
saudi
arabia
can
push
it
oil
field
can
they
ramp
up
to
probabl
but
there
is
not
a
lot
of
histor
evid
to
go
on
also
they
probabl
can
t
do
it
immedi
it
would
take
time
perhap
more
than
a
second
and
more
import
reason
whi
saudi
arabia
won
t
compli
with
trump
s
wish
to
add
anoth
onto
the
market
is
that
they
don
t
want
to
ramp
up
that
much
would
leav
the
oil
market
danger
low
on
spare
capac
cut
it
down
to
less
than
at
that
point
ani
suppli
disrupt
would
send
oil
price
skyrocket
inde
it
wouldn
t
even
take
a
tangibl
disrupt
the
mere
possibl
of
anoth

would

of

of

nevertheless
trump
is
probabl
right
that
the

need
more

is
expect
to
send

and
trump
himself
could
be
respons
for

more
of

do
forget
the
one
neg
to
the
iran
deal
is
that
you
lose
a
lot
of

they
got
to
make
up

you
