the
near
futur
the
grant
waiver
to
eight
countri
allow
them
to
continu
to
import
oil
from
iran
for
a
period
washington
spun
the
waiver
as
a
brief
period
of
time
that
would
allow
a
hand
of
countri
to
get
their
import
from
iran
down
to
zero
some
countri
realli
depend
on
iran
so
a
grace
period
would
give
them
a
bit
more
govern
wa
a
bit
defens
about
the
action
no
one
s
go
to
argu
that
secretari
pompeo

tough
on
iran
secretari
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
fox
news
and
no
one
is
go
to
argu
that
presid
trump
isn
t
do
the
he
cite
the
loss
of
around
million
barrel
per
day
of
iranian
oil
export
as
evid
that
the
polici
wa
work
that
number
will
fall
yet
the
presid
himself
reveal
the
logic
behind
the
waiver
we
have
the
toughest
sanction
ever
impos
but
on
oil
we
want
to
go
a
littl
bit
slower
becaus
i
do
want
to
drive
the
oil
price
in
the
world
presid
trump
told
report
on
monday
i
could
get
the
iran
oil
down
to
zero
immedi
but
it
would
caus
a
shock
to
the
it
s
highli
debat
that
the
could
have
succeed
in
slash
iran
s
oil
export
to
zero
but
even
if
it
did
succeed
there
is
littl
doubt
that
oil
price
would
be
substanti
higher
than
they
are
eight
countri

south

taiwan
turkey
greec
japan
china
india
and
itali
mani
of
these
countri
had
alreadi
made
sharp
reduct
in
their
purchas
of
iranian
oil
which
allow
them
to
curri
favor
with
washington
as
they
sought
some
lenienc
on
sanction
relat
the
rapid
acceler
toward
peak

howev
south
korea
and
japan
had
alreadi
zero
out
their
import
from
iran
well
ahead
of
the
deadlin
the
waiver
for
them
then
are
a
bit
curiou
the
trump
administr
may
have
want
to
reward
alli
that
had

it
could
also
allow

told

that
enquiri
for

combin
the

will
allow
iran
to
continu
to

it
might
even
be
abl
to
increas

and
accord
to

but
the
loss
could
potenti
stop
there
and
might
even
rise
if
some
countri
resum
is
like
that
iranian
oil
export
will
stabilis
at
their
present
level
of
a
good
million
