last
week
bloomberg
creat
quit
a
stir
with
thi
stori
the
just
becam
a
net
oil
export
for
the
first
time
in
year
i
have
seen
a
number
of
stori
that
prais
the
signific
of
thi
develop
but
other
laugh
it
off
as
mislead
or
is
some
truth
to
both
viewpoint
ye
the
headlin
is
somewhat
mislead
and
requir
some
context
but
there
continu
to
be
a
trend
in
the
direct
of
energi
independ
for
the
so
today
i
want
to
break
down
the
number
so
reader
can
understand
the
truth
about
petroleum
product
consumpt
and
crude
product
ha
surgedth
bloomberg
stori
is
base
on
data
from
the
energi
inform
administr
eia
each
week
the
eia
publish
detail
statist
on
oil
product
consumpt
export
and
inventori
in
a
report
call
the
weekli
petroleum
statu
report
so
let
s
go
straight
to
the
the
week
end
the
eia
report
that
the
produc
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
of
crude
oil
that
repres
a
million
bpd
increas
from
the
number
thi
number
is
gener
accept
even
by
those
who
believ
the
bloomberg
headlin
wa
down
in
the
report
the
categori
of
product
suppli
is
list
at
million
bpd
thi
is
approxim
crude
oil
consumpt
for
the
week
thu
as
some
skeptic
of
the
stori
suggest
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
is
burn
more
than
million
bpd
while
produc
less
than
million
bpd
thu
the
conclus
for
some
wa
that
the
isn
t
close
to
be
energi
supplybut
there
is
import
context
between
these
number
first
the
million
bpd
is
a
fairli
accur
represent
of

there
is
a
larg
product
number
that
isn

soar

as
an
asid
the
reason
the

import

crude
is
that
some
of
what
we

isn

a
good
match
for

so
we
export
some
domest

and
import

that
is
a
better
match

inde
when

a

thi

the

as

as
i
can
tell
bloomberg
is
correct
that
thi
hasn

happen
in

that
s
not
what
the

the

the
is
still

to
the

of

total

that

while

that
still
put

more

actual
a

feedstock
the
bottom
line
is
that
we
aren

we
aren

the
ha
