so
well
that
there
are
call
from

consid
make
it
perman
but
there
s
alway
a
s
no
secret
that
the
excel
perform
of
opec
and
it
partner
wasn
t
exactli
excel
across
the
board
some
member
did
more
than
their
fair
share
and
other
didn
t
hit
their
quota
at
all
in
ani
the
top
perform
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
the
former
cut
more
than
it
had
to
in
order
to
make
up
for

in
light
of
the
fact
that
two
larg
opec
produc
libya
and
nigeria
did
not
take

enough
to
take
care
of

doe
opec

what
it
take
to
continu

that
opec
