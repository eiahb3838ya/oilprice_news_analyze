it
isn

just
a

put
a

on
pdvsa
ha
a
critic
structur
problem
that
can
not
be
fix
in
a
few
week
or
even
a
few
month
becaus
the
core
problem
is
that
venezuela
crude
product
ha
drop
far
beneath
the

we
are

deliv
a
compani
execut
told

and
we
do
have
the
cash
flow
to
compens
by

crude
from
third
parti
to
meet
our
suppli
commit
our
greatest
oper
concern
right
now
is
that
product
continu
to
fall
and
our
export
suppli
volum
also
will
continu
to
declin
as
a
as

the

that
compani
that
