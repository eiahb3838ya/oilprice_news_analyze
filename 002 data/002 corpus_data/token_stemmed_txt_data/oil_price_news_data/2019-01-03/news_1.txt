2019 could make or break opec
when
agre
to
begin
cut
crude
oil
product
again
in
decemb
hardli
anyon
in
the
cartel
thought
the
effect
of
the
news
on
price
would
be
as
lacklust
as
it
turn
out
to
be
it
took
some
time
for
the
fact
to
sink
in
that
thi
time
too
mani
trader
were
worri
about
the
futur
of
oil
demand
and
were
reluct
to
specul
with
oil
now
opec
is
face
anoth
tough
year
perhap
even
tougher
than
and
it
might
just
need
to
reduc
product
even
more
to
make
it
well
morgan
said
prior
to
the
opec
meet
earli
decemb
that
if
opec
didn
t
realli
cut
by
more
than
around
million
barrel
per
day
and
they
did
just
for
the
first
half
not
for
the
full
year
that
we
could
gravit
toward
our
scenario
which
is
brent
for
the
invest
bank
s
head
of
oil
and
ga
for
the
told
cnbc
thi
we
expect
oil
market
to
remain
volatil
in
part
driven
by
flexibl
north
american
shale
product
that
can
ramp
up
and
down
quickli
in
respons
to
chang
in
invest
level
conocophillip
ceo
ryan
lanc
told
bloomberg
also
thi
american
shale
product
is
of
cours
the
challeng
for
opec
s
plan
two
year
ago
it
wa
easier
nobodi
wa
sure
exactli
how
flexibl
shale
oil
product
can
be
so
the
opec
cut
work
help
by
a
brighter
global
econom
outlook
now
thing
are
differ
shale
product
is
grow
despit
the
slump
in
price
and
although
thi
may
chang
if
price
fall
further
or
stay
at
current
level
for
longer
thi
is
far
from
certain
in
the
last
week
of
decemb
after

have
been
on
the

did
at

the
effect
on

will
come
to

jp

may
just
turn
out
to
be
right
yesterday
news

agre
million

if

it

the

is
not
the

factor
that
count
the

light

while
there
is
also
global

that
the
