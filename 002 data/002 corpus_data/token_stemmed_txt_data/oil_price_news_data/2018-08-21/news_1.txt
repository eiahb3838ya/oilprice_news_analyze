chinese oil futures remain high-risk endeavour
when
the
oil
futur
launch
earlier
thi
year
opinion
were
split
one
camp
argu
with
passion
that
the
day
of
the
petrodollar
were
number
it
demis
a
certainti
the
other
camp
argu
with
just
as
much
passion
the
yuan
ha
yet
to
catch
up
with
the
dollar
as
an
intern
currenc
and
the
chines
futur
had
basic
as
much
of
a
chanc
as
a
snowflak
in
six
month
later
opinion
remain
split
but
now
the
two
camp
have
some
fact
and
figur
in
their
arsen
for
exampl
a
figur
for
the
camp
wa
the
record
surg
in
trade
volum
in
june
to
million
ton
of
crude
for
deliveri
in
septemb
thi
translat
into
lot
compar
to
a
combin
million
lot
for
brent
and
wti
togeth
though
so
the
yuan
contract
still
ha
a
way
to
go
to
catch
camp
howev
seem
to
have
a
bit
more
go
for
it
after
six
month
of
trade
bloomberg
cite
trader
as
say
that
the
exchang
rate
of
the
yuan
coupl
with
storag
cost
make
the
chines
oil
contract
still
a
yuan
ha
been
fall
in
recent
month
on
the
back
of
slow
econom
growth
and
the
tariff
spat
with
the
unit
state
there
is
a
lot
of
space
for
surpris
howev
and
unpredict
is
not
someth
trader
like
so
exchang
rate
are
one
thing
that
could
put
them
off
the
yuan
cost
in
china
are
anoth
problem
they
are
much
higher
than
elsewher
us
per
barrel
per
month
in
the
shanghai
intern
energi
exchang
compar
with
us
per
barrel
per
month
at
the
louisiana
offshor
oil
port
bloomberg
report
the
reason
for
the
higher
cost
is
limit
storag
capac
avail
and
the
requir
that
the
cargo
be
store
at
a
specif
storag
facil
rather
than
at

avail
relat
the
weakest
eia
report
in
yearsso
in
light
of
these
unpleas
fact
what
doe
the
futur
contract
have
go
for
them
well
appar
they
could
make
seller
richer
than
if
they
choos
to
trade
middl
east
grade
the
yuan
contract
last
week
trade
at
a
consider
premium
to
all
other
oil
futur
with
the
premium
to
the
middl
east
benchmark
at
us
per
barrel
that
make
a
profit
of
us
million
for
a
cargo
accord
to
bloomberg
not
a
small
sum
but
is
it
worth
all
the
risk
perhap
it
is
and
perhap
it
isn
t
but
it
look
like
it
is
still
too
earli
to
say
the
serious
of
the
risk
after
all
is
rel
thi
wa
evidenc
in
the

that

the
question
of
whether
the

is
moot
the
reason
for
thi
is
simpl
the
dollar
is
the

becaus
most
