is this lithium battery breakthrough too good to be true?
it
would
be
a
dull
month
if
a
new
recharg
batteri
project
didn
t
make
headlin
amid
all
the
excit
surround
electr
car
thi
month
s
indisput
winner
is
the
batteri
that
replac
cobalt
with
iron
at
least
accord
to
the
peopl
who
came
up
with
the
potenti
implic
of
thi
invent
are
huge
cobalt
is
enjoy
a
veri
strong
ralli
as
demand
is
estim
to
skyrocket
with
the
influx
of
electr
car
in
the
world
s
biggest
market
notabl
china
and
the
unit
state
so
is
lithium
but
the
iron
batteri
is
unlik
to
have
an
impact
on
lithium
demand
also
theoret
the
iron
batteri
could
put
some
batteri
maker
out
of
idea
of
use
iron
in
batteri
isn
t
new
but
so
far
attempt
to
substitut
the
cheap
metal
for
costlier
cobalt
and
other
metal

christoph
wolverton
professor
of
materi
scienc
and
engin
at
northwestern
univers
had
two
problem
to
solv
to
make
hi
batteri
work
first
replac
cobalt
with
iron
second
trick
oxygen
into
take
part
in
the
reaction
that
move
the
lithium
ion
from
the
anod
to
the
cathod
and
back
again
as
the
batteri
is
charg
and
second
challeng
wa
the
bigger
one
the
widespread
opinion
in
scienc
circl
is
that
use
oxygen
in
the
reaction
take
place
in
a
recharg
batteri
make
the
concoct
insid
unstabl
and
oxygen
escap
make
the
reaction
irrevers
and
the
batteri
that
s
whi
wolverton
and
hi
team
first
made
the
batteri
on
a
comput
to
see
if
it
would
work
surprisingli
for
all
it
better
than
the
most
popular
iron
batteri
use
four
lithium
ion
instead
of
just
one
like
current
batteri
do
for
now
it
can
onli
util
one
of
these
but
there
s
potenti
for
make
use
of
all
four
consider
increas
the
batteri
s
effici
relat
is
an
oil
price
correct
overdu
that
s
realli
excit
but
the
offici
news
releas
is
shi
on
the
experiment
aspect
of
the
team
s
work
there
s
mention
that
there
wa
an
author
in
charg
of
the
experiment
work
but
all
the
detail
about
the
composit
of
the
batteri
and
the
reaction
are
about
the
comput
the
team
made
these
comput
were
use
to
make
the
physic
batteri
but
the
experiment
stage
of
the
project
is
like
at
an

further

the

thi

the

even
that
would
be
enough
to
