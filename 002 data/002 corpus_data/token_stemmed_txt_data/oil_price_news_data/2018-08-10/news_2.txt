the
drive
factor
behind
thi

that
threaten
to
significantli
impact
iranian

while
thi
bullish

is
certainli
justifi
there
are
also
plenti
of
bearish
catalyst
loom
over
market
that
should
not
be
ignor
the
most
import
of
these
catalyst
is
the
possibl
of
an
trade
war
between

and
the
an
outcom
that
is
veri
much
plausibl

the
second
round
of

which
is
go
to
focu

will
have
a
much
higher

than
the
current
round

could
take
anywher
from
to
million
barrel
out
of

thi
combin
with

certainli
a
possibl
of
a
more
than
one
