ultim

but
as
i
note
in
an
articl
last
year
product
growth
could
potenti
offset
those
product
cut
in
a
littl
over

again
put
opec
in
the
posit
of
either
cut
product
to
balanc
the
market
or
in
potenti
let
the
price
crash
the
latter
approach
had
some
limit
success
in
as
product
did
dip
in
respons
to
the

war
but
as
soon
as

did

and
nearli
percent
of

reserv
in
product
from
opec
and
russia
is
more
than
million
bpd
in
theori
they
should
have
substanti

power
but
the
rapid
growth
of
shale
oil
product
continu
to
give
them
oil
rise
on
hope
of
a
trade
dealit
is
certain
that
the
oil
product
surg
broke
opec
s
stranglehold
on
global
oil
price
if
the
shale
oil
boom
in
the
hadn
t
happen
opec
and
russia
would
have
enjoy
the
fruit
of
oil
for
the
past
decad
the
trade
deficit
would
have
now
opec
ha
to
look
at
the
pictur
and
tri
to
estim
just
how
much
further
product
can
expand
if
we
are
reach
the
limit
of
shale
product
growth
then
opec
can
go
through
a
coupl
of
cycl
of
product
cut
and
they
will
be
back
in
the
driver
s
if
product
can
expand
for
anoth
decad
opec
will
have
lost
complet
control
over
oil
price
in
that
case
product
will
like
onli
slow
when

are
start
to
take
a
seriou
bite
out
of
global
oil
of
which
oil
demand
continu
to
grow
at
more
than
million
bpd
everi
year
that
help
mitig
the
impact
of
product
growth
but
as
long
as
product
grow
annual
at
a
faster
pace
than
global
demand
which
it
ha
sever
time
in
recent
year
opec
is
go
to
have
to
live
with
either
product
cut
which
also
