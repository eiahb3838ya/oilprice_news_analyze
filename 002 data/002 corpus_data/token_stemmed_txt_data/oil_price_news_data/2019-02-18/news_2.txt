the

my
figur
are
more
or
less
in
line
with
those
of
other
i
onc
did
a
similar
calcul
i
start
with
the
assumpt
that
the
estim
of
billion
barrel
wa
correct
and
then
i
just
subtract
saudi
product
sinc
then
i
calcul
their
total
product
sinc
as
billion
barrel
leav
billion
barrel
of
i
then
did
a
saniti
check
that
threw
that
calcul
in
doubt
i
did
the
same
calcul
for
prove
reserv
over
the
same
time
prove
crude
oil
reserv
were
report
to
be
billion
barrel
by
and
befor
the
shale
oil
boom
wa
underway
prove
reserv
had
onli
fallen
to
billion
barrel
but
total
product
between
and
wa
billion
we
extend
that
calcul
through
the
end
of
prove
reserv
have
actual
jump
to
billion
barrel
per
the
bp
statist
review
and
there
have
been
billion
barrel
of
product
sinc
reiter
in
prove
crude
oil
reserv
stood
at
billion
barrel
between
then
and
the
produc
billion
barrel
of
oil
yet
prove
reserv
grew
to
billion
barrel
relat
can
ukrain
gain
energi
independ
how
did
thi
happen
there
were
new
discoveri
technolog
improv
that
allow
more
barrel
to
be
extract
from
exist
field
and
higher
price
that
made
addit
resourc
econom
to
think
it
s
reason
to
assum
that
saudi
arabia
also
found
addit
barrel
sinc
they
also
have
access
to
the
same
kind
of
technolog
that
improv
recoveri
in
field
therefor
i
do
not
believ
it
s
a
legitim
exercis
to
consid
deplet
from
a
histor
reserv
number
to
estim
current
reserv
such
an
exercis
would
have
suggest
that
oil
product
would
have
fallen
to
zero
by
i
don
t
find
a
reason
basi
for
conclud
that
saudi
arabia
s
reserv
are
much
lower
than
their
offici
number
their
publish
reserv
are
consist
with
the
independ
audit
and
they
are
consist
with
the
experi

the
of
reserv
growth
despit

you
think
that
the
result
are
atyp
you
can
repeat
thi
exercis
for
ani
of
the
world
s
major
oil
produc
and
find
the
same
thing
start
with
the
prove
reserv
in
and
subtract
the
subsequ
product
will
not
accur
predict
the
reserv
at
some
point
in
the
futur
in
mani
case
as
with
the
cumul
product
wa
greater
than
the
prove

i
have
thu

found
no
