recent
report
that
onli
five

mostli
on

frack
gener
more

they
spent
in
the
first
quarter
of
thi

thi
continu
a

doesn

pictur
for

nor
did
it
explain
how
it
calcul
cash
flow
but
base
on
the
number
they
report
and
my
own
analysi
it
appear
they
are
defin
cash
flow
as
simpli
the
amount
of

gener
from

indic
that
overal
compani
spent

they
took
in
it
further
note
that

it
made

cash
while
parsley

the

were
therefor
unabl
to

on
the

that
make
you
wonder
whi
a
compani
would
hedg
