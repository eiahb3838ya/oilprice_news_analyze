i
write
in
my
newest

on
the
geopolit
of
ga
when
german
chancellor
willi
brandt
sign
the
countri
s
first
ga
contract
with
the
soviet
in
he
consid
such
ga
trade
as
part
of
hi
ostpolitik
an
econom
polici
toward
the
east
that
could
reduc
cold
war
tension
and
help
reestablish
contact
with
communist
east
germani
but
it
wa
washington
s
militari
spend
and
contain
polici
not
the
german
mark
that
went
to
moscow
that
eventu
bankrupt
the
soviet
union
and
brought
down
the
berlin
wall
washington
should
recal
it
own
effort
dure
the
cold
war
era
when
it
tri
to
discourag
it
european
alli
from
depend
on
soviet
ga
presid
ronald
reagan
impos
sanction
on
the
ussr
in
late
in
respons
to
soviet
martial
law
in
poland
and
also
to
block
soviet
construct
of
the
pipelin
that
would
have
brought
vast
quantiti
of
siberian
ga
to
germani
and
western
europ
in
the
administr
extend
sanction
to
american
energi
equip
so
it
would
not
be
use
for
the
pipelin
s
construct
yet
the
effort
fail
to
convinc
europ
and
by
late
washington
cancel
the
sanction
while
the
pipelin
wa
built
today
the
unit
state
face
a
similar
predica
washington
s
juli
russia
sanction
threaten
to
target
nord

but
the
most
recent
sanction
implement
in
januari
did
not
do
so
explicitli
more
recent
poland
ha
call
for
nord
stream
to
be
includ
under

there
is
still
time
for
presid
donald
trump
to
tri
to
achiev
what
reagan
could
not
and
derail
russian
pipelin
plan
american
sanction
against
nord
stream
would
not
be
easi
to
implement
given
the
resist
from
countri
like
germani
austria
the
netherland
and
franc
german
support
for
futur
russia
sanction
is
crucial
but
get
merkel
to
agre
to
add
nord
stream
to
these
measur
seem
unlik
instead
washington
should
push
brussel
to
take
a
harder
look
at
