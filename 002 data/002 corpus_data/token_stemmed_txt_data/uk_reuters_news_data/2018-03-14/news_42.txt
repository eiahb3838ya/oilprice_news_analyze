what
you

is
a

thom
said
onli
lukoil
ha
so
far
reach
a
preliminari
agreement
with

bring
the
goal
for

but
the

have
not
yet
finalis
talk
as
discuss
continu
on
when
lukoil
can
hit
the
new
target
he
said
we
are
in
discuss
but
noth
ha
been
approv
yet
said
iraq
want
the
plateau
to
be

delay
in
such
negoti
are
a
headach
for
ani
oil
compani
that
need
to
plan
it
annual
budget
base
on
how
mani
oilfield
it
want
to
drill
and
what
new
facil
it
need
to
bring
extra
product
on

the
impact
of

delay
is
be
felt
disproportion
with
compani
that
have
product

farthest
from
the
previous
agre

feel
the
most
heat
a
sourc
at
one
of
those
firm
told
reuter
iraq
s
oil

is
near
million

and
it
can
easili
increas
that
by
a
further
percent
in
the
next
year
or
two
even
without
a

analyst
and
industri
sourc
say
if
you
bring
the

if
