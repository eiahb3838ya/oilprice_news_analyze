vienna
june
reuter
saudi
energi
minist
khalid
said
on
thursday
increas
oil
suppli
by
million
barrel
per
day
would
be
a
good
target
as
the
organ
of
the
oil
export
countri
and
alli
such
as
russia
meet
in
vienna
thi
week
below
are
highlight
from
falih
s
speech
at
an
opec
seminar
what
strike
me
most
is
the
great
align
the
veri
strong
align
between
the
interest
of
produc
and
consum
and
mani
peopl
underestim
how
much
align
of
interest
there
is
between
produc
and
consum
of
we
ve
seen
invest
start
flow
back
certainli
it
s
flow
back
in
the
unit
state
with
oil
the
shale
we
still
want
more
invest
my
concern
is
realli
to
be
abl
to
look
forward
in
term
of
five
to
year
in
the
futur
and
see
enough
project
come
back
we
want
to
prevent
the
shortag
and
the
squeez
that
we
saw
in
we
saw
it
again
a
few
year
ago
as
a
result
of
lack
of
invest
but
at
the
same
time
we
want
to
prevent
the
sever
downturn
that
choke
the
industri
caus
bankruptci
job
be
lost
across
the
our
opec
secretariat
will
share
with
us
today
in
the
joint
ministeri
monitor
committe
their
report
i
ve
look
at
the
report
fli
in
and
i
think
it
show
that
there
will
be
a
deficit
in
the
second
half
of
thi
year
of
million
barrel
assum
that
the
main
product
continu
that
will
continu
to
drive
inventori
down
we
think
that
that
will
be
probabl
too
short
of
a
suppli
situat
we
can
not
allow
it
to
happen
so
what
level
of
suppli
releas
we
will
have
to
come
to
a
at
the
end
of
the
day
our
first
and
foremost
respons
is
to
our
consum
and
to
our
how
much
do
we
distribut
amongst
the
countri
and
how
much
of
it
actual
is
deliv
i
think
is
the
debat
in
the
next
coupl
of
one
thing
you
can
be
assur
of
is
we
will
be
respons
we
will
releas
suppli
to
make
sure
that
no
shortag
come
close
or
even
below
the
million
cut
is
call
for
by
the
fundament
how
to
achiev
it
is
the
tricki
question
becaus
not
everi
countri
can
respond
to
an
alloc
for
a
higher
product
realloc
output
to
other
countri
like
saudi
arabia
may
be
a
technic
solut
but
it
may
not
be
polit
accept
to
i
can
speak
for
saudi
arabia
we
do
have
a
coupl
of
million
barrel
of
spare
capac
how
much
oil
do
we
need
it
s
not
go
to
be
anyth
close
to
that
level
but
volum
around
million
probabl
given
the
fact
that
we
will
see
demand
in
the
second
half
rise
significantli
abov
the
first
half
i
think
million
sound
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
good
target
to
work
in
the
mid
to
long
term
we
are
concern
about
global
trade
and
global
econom
growth
obvious
when
the
major
economi
clash
it
s
difficult
for
me
to
see
that
we
re
go
to
see
a
signific
drop
in
demand
in
the
next
month
