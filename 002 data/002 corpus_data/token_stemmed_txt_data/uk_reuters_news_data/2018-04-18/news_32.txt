china

to

there
would

risk
from

april
the

s
view
is
that
rusal
will
be
restructur
to
bypass

allow
both

and
export
to
continu
but
it
ha
still
lift
it

forecast
to
factor
in
the
uncertainti
the
ironi
here
is
that
china
is
alreadi
a
huge
export
not
of
primari
aluminium
but
rather
of
aluminium
in
the
form
of
product
inde
such
ha
been
the
flood
of
product
out
of
the
countri
that
up
to
now
the
big
issu
for
everyon
els
ha
been
how
to
stop
china
export
so
much
not
how
to
stimul
it
to
export
more
the
unit

ha
led
the
polit
push
back
against
chines

export
which
rose
anoth

last
year
to
an
annual

of

presid

the

thi
is
the
dilemma
for

it

the

show
no

the

is
no
more
than
that
and
there
is

plenti

the
key
takeaway
here
is
that

the
