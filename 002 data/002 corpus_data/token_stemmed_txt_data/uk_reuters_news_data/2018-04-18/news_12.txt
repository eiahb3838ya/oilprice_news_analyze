ask
in

with
reuter
about
that
controversi
gate
said
there
were
understand
concern
about
safeti

efficaci
that
would
need
to
be

and
trial
but
he
counter
malaria
itself
is
quit
controversi
it

so
we

not

also
note
that
at
their
summit
in
januari
leader
of
the
african
union
endors
gene
drive
research
as
part
of
the
fight
against
a
diseas
that
continu
to
kill
their
peopl
they
spoke
out
to
say
that
for
them
get
rid
of
malaria
is
worth

said
the
world
health
organ
who
warn
late
last

that
global
progress
against
malaria
had
stall

could
be

to
wipe

infect
around
million
peopl
in

in

over
the
previou

it
kill
peopl
about
the
same
number
as
in
with
the
vast
major

occur
in

and
young

in

gate
told
the
forum
that
hi
almost
year
of
involv
in
global
effort
to
beat
malaria
had
been
both
gratifi
in
term
of
progress
and
tough
in
term
of
suffer
he
wit
he
describ
see
a
child
in
a
hospit
in
tanzania
convuls
with
seizur
due
to
cerebr
malaria
with
the
state
of
scienc
and
the
wealth
of
the
world
that
realli
should
be
an
affront
he
said
we
realli
shouldn
t
accept
that
thi
diseas
can
gate
said
that
end
malaria
for
good
would
take
mani
year
and
a
rang
of
tool
both
new
and
old
from
bednet
and
mosquito
trap
to
a
new
vaccin
and
next
gener
gene
tool
he
said
he
thought
it
unlik
that
creat
gene
drive
in
mosquito
would
have
a
major
impact
on
the
wider
ecosystem
becaus
it
would
onli
target
a
few
speci
and
suppress
their
popul
for
a
period
of
time
none
of
these
gene
technolog
construct
will
actual
wipe
out
the
speci
he
said
it
will
evolv
back
after
all
evolutionari

reduc
mosquito
popul
with
such
technolog
could
howev
give
a
window
of
opportun
to

limit
the
human

of
diseas
so
that
transmiss
of
the

among
peopl
is

said
gate
also
said
genet
inform
and
data
gather
in

is
allow
scientist
to

help
them
stay
one
step
