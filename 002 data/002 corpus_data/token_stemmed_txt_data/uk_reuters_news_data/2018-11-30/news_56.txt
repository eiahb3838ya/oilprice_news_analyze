of
card
as
well
as
he
can
at
next
week
s
meet
of
opec
and
oil
produc
in
vienna
falih
s
challeng
is
to
get
other
countri
on
board
with
output
cut
to
avert
anoth
crash
in
oil
price
next
year
while
disguis

the
start

while
the
calendar
spread
is
in

indic
most
trader
expect
the
market
to
be
oversuppli
in
the
market
outlook
is
strikingli
similar
to
with
product
from
shale
surg
while
consumpt
growth
slow
as
the
global
economi
falter
but
in
one
respect
the
situat
is
even
more
uncomfort
becaus
saudi
arabia
s
offici
foreign
reserv
are
down
to
just
over
billion
from
almost
billion
in
june
the
kingdom
probabl
need
to
keep
sever
hundr
billion
dollar
worth
of
reserv
asset
on
hand
to
maintain
confid
in
it
fix
peg
to
the
dollar
and
prevent
a
run
on
the
currenc
the
kingdom
can
anoth
slump
in
oil
revenu
so
soon
after
the
last
one
which
suggest
it
will
have
to
cut
product
while
tri
to
cajol
other
opec
and
countri
to
share
the
burden
at
the
same
time
ani
cut
must
avoid
provok
a
polit
reaction
from
the
unit
state
where
the
presid
ha
continu
to
press
for
even
lower
oil
price
saudi
arabia
face
a
familiar
but
uncomfort
choic
cut
product
to
defend
price
or
allow
price
to
fall
to
protect
market
share
in
novemb
saudi
arabia
chose
to
maintain
product
and
allow
price
to
fall
which
temporarili
halt
the
shale
boom
but
wreck
the
kingdom
s
financ
and
push
it
economi
into
recess
in
decemb
saudi
arabia
opt
to
cut
product
which
boost
price
and
stabilis
the
kingdom
s
financ
and
economi
but
also
reviv
the
shale
boom
and
cost
it
share
the
strategi
associ
with
falih
s
predecessor
as
oil
minist
ali
is
often
characteris
as
a
failur
though
it
did
manag
to
restrain
shale

for
a
time
by

the
strategi
of

cut
with

ha
been
hail
as
a
triumph
even
though
it

that
the

cut
would
fall
