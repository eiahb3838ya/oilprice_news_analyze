the
opinion
express
here
are
those
of
the
author
a
columnist
for
reuter
by
clyde
russel
launceston
australia
feb
it
seem
coal
miner
are
adopt
one
of
two
dispar
strategi
either
exit
the
busi
in
a
highli
visibl
way
to
buff
up
your
climat
credenti
or
sit
tight
keep
as
quiet
as
possibl
and
rake
in
the
cash
an
exampl
of
the
public
exit
from
the
busi
is
the
miner
spun
out
of
bhp
billiton
which
is
in
the
process
of
sell
out
of
it
thermal
coal
asset
in
south
africa
mike
fraser
s
presid
and
chief
oper
offic
for
south
africa
told
reuter
earlier
thi
month
that
the
compani
wa
aim
to
sell
it
coal
asset
becaus
it
did
not
believ
in
the
it
would
also
be
better
if
the
coal
mine
were
by
black
investor
fraser
said
thi
is
a
reason
recognit
that
it
s
increasingli
hard
for
compani
without
black
investor
to
do
busi
in
south
africa
given
it
law
and
rule
aim
at
promot
the
econom
interest
of
the
major
popul
follow
centuri
of
discrimin
under
first
coloni
and
then
rule
join
anglo
american
in
get
out
of
south
african
coal
with
the
miner
sell
the
last
of
it
domest
coal
asset
to
a
major
compani
in
januari
anglo
american
will
continu
to
export
coal
from
south
africa
but
it
will
no
longer
be
a
particip
in
suppli
the
domest
market
which
is
domin
by
the
state
power
util
eskom
perhap
it
s
not
surpris
that
the
two
major
coal
asset
sale
thi
year
are
take
place
in
south
africa
given
the
ongo
disput
between
the
govern
and
the
mine
industri
over
a
new
mine
charter
and
the
requir
to
increas
the
particip
of
black
investor
but
rio
tinto
also
decid
to
exit
it
australian
coal
busi
sell
out
to
yancoal
australia
and
glencor
if
there
is
a
trend
at
play
here
it
s
that
diversifi
miner
are
the
one
most
like
to
exit
coal
and
some
have
cite
the
risk
of
be
in
an
increasingli
unpopular
busi
activist
and
other
investor
are
ramp
up
pressur
on
fund
manag
and
sovereign
wealth
fund
to
divest
from
compani
that
are
in
coal
given
coal
wa
a
tini
part
of
rio
s
busi
exit
the
industri
make
sens
especi
if
you
can
then
tout
yourself
as
a
miner
of
metal
that
will
be
part
of
the
electr
vehicl
and
batteri
revolut
the
other
choic
is
to
stay
in
coal
and
tri
to
mitig
ani
public
backlash
bhp
and
it
allianc
partner
mitsubishi
are
the
world
s
largest
export
of
coke
coal
use
to
make
steel
and
there
are
no
sign
that
the
miner
intend
to
exit
the
busi
same
goe
for
glencor
and
both
these
compani
are
probabl
calcul
that
the
monetari
reward
from
coal
still
outweigh
ani
public
backlash
benjamin
sporton
chief
execut
of

that
china

also
be
