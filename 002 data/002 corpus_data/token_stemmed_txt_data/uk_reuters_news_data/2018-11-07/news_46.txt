can
six

down
the

rais
question
as
to
how
the
variou
player
in
the

will
use
the
time
the

grant

to
eight
buyer
of

exempt
them
from
the

that

that
are
aim
at

for
anoth
day
a
move
aim
at
reduc
the
shock
of
a
sudden
loss
of
all
iranian

there
are
a
number
of
way
of
look
at
the
decis
to
grant
waiver
to
countri
which
togeth
account
for
some
percent
of
iran
s
total
oil
export
the
first
would
be
that
trump
and
hi
administr
effect
blink
first
in
their
disput
with
iran
over
it
nuclear
and
missil
programm
it
could
also
be
argu
that
it
wa
a
rare
exampl
of
realpolitik
from
the
trump
administr
with
the
tacit
recognit
that
cut
iran
s
export
to
zero
in
one
fell
swoop
would
boost
crude
price
hurt
not
onli
consum
but
also
the
rest
of
the
world
trump
wa
keen
to
talk
up
hi
administr
s
capabl
of
complet
isol
iran
but
perhap
with
an
eye
on
the
elect
on
tuesday
he
made
it
clear
that
keep
crude
price
low
wa
also
a
prioriti
i
could
get
the
iran
oil
down
to
zero
immedi
but
it
would
caus
a
shock
to
the
market
i
don
t
want
to
lift
oil
price
trump
told
report
on
befor
fli
to
a
campaign
event
the
decis
to
grant
the
waiver
ha
alreadi
calm
oil
market
which
hadn
t
realli
anticip
tehran
s
export
drop
to
zero
but
may
have
also
been
uncertain
as
to
how
much
crude
would
actual
be
lost
brent
crude
close
at
a
barrel
on
tuesday
down
percent
from
the
close
on
and
down
percent
from
the
high
of
reach
on
and
port
data
suggest
that
iran
ha
alreadi
suffer
a
fairli
steep
drop
in
export
prior
to
the
of
sanction
from
some
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
of
export
in
iran
s
export
drop
to
around
million
bpd
in
recent
month
accord
to
refinitiv
data
a
further
drop
is
on
the
card
for
novemb
with
the
caveat
that
track
iran
s
export
ha
becom
more
difficult
given
that
tanker
are
turn
off
their
system
with
the
grant
of
the
waiver
it
s
like
that
iran
will
be
abl
to
keep
it
export
at
least
around
million
bpd
and
possibl
even
as
high
as
the
million
bpd
of
recent
month
for
the
iranian
the
waiver
provid
them
with
a
financi
lifelin
and
time
to
tri
and
lobbi
support
from
other
countri
against
washington
s
sanction
for
major
buyer
like
china
which
import
about
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
the
first
month
of
the
year
the
waiver
allow
it
to
maintain
divers
of
suppli
as
well
as
keep
price
lower
with
iranian
barrel
still
in
the
market
the
pressur
on
other
major
export
like
saudi
arabia
and
russia
to
ensur
a
market
or
risk
trump
s
displeasur
is
reduc
but
they
may
not
be
happi
if
crude
price
continu
to
weaken
the
big
question
is
how
doe
the
trump
administr
use
the
window
it
ha
grant
to
iran
will
there
be
ani
genuin
attempt
to
find
common
ground
with
tehran
on
deal
reach
togeth
with
other
western
power
to
limit
iran
s
nuclear
programm
or
will
the
unit
state
use
to
time
to
ensur
that
it
can
enforc
the
sanction
when
the
day
expir
while
not
caus
oil
price
to
spike
it
seem
unlik
that
washington
and
tehran
could
agre
to
the
nuclear
deal
in
such
a
short
time
period
even
if
onli
rel
minor
chang
were
made
similar
to
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
recent
conclud
by
the
trump
administr
and
canada
and
mexico
in
the
meantim
the
oil
market
can
probabl
cross
iran
off
it
list
of
worri
but
pencil
it
back
for
sometim
around
april
next
year
