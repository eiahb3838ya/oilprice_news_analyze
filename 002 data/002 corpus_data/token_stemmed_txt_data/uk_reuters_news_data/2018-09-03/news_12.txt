one
of
the
surpris
packet
in
the
commod
space
thi
year
ha
been
uranium
with
the
spot
price
surg
percent
in
the
past
four
month
a
stellar
perform
that
may
not
be
justifi
by
current
fundament
uranium
stood
at
per
pound
on
up
from
the
low
so
far
thi
year
of
hit
in
the
gain
is
percent
and
the
metal
use
to
power
nuclear
reactor
is
on
track
to
record
a
second
annual
increas
thi
look
like
a
strong
perform
on
the
surfac
but
uranium
isn
t
quit
like
other
commod
market
and
it
s
worth
delv
down
to
tri
and
fathom
the
underli
dynam
the
most
obviou
factor
drive
the
spot
price
ha
been
suppli
cutback
by
major
produc
name
canada
s
cameco
and
kazakhstan
s
produc
kazatomprom
cameco
said
in
juli
it
would
extend
indefinit
a
shutdown
of
it
mcarthur
river
and
key
lake
mine
in
saskatchewan
provinc
have
initi
announc
a
suspens
of
oper
in
novemb
last
year
kazatomprom
also
said
at
the
end
of
last
year
that
it
would
reduc
it
output
by
percent
for
three
year
start
from
the
begin
of
as
it
battl
a
market
that
ha
been
oversuppli
sinc
the
nuclear
shutdown
in
the
wake
of
the
fukushima
disast
in
japan
the
cameco
and
kazatomprom
cutback
took
about
percent
of
annual
uranium
ore
suppli
from
the
market
but
the
price
action
in
the
wake
of
the
cutback
is
instruct
the
spot
price
took
off
after
cameco
s
novemb
announc
jump
from
per
pound
to
a
high
of
by
a
date
that
coincid
with
the
news
of
the
kazatomprom
product
curb
onc
the
initi
surg
wa
over
howev
spot
uranium
drift
back
down
to
the
april
low
of
per

the
same
level
it
wa
befor
the
output
cut
were
announc
it
did
recov
somewhat
thereaft
and
got
anoth
shot
in
the
arm
with
cameco
extend
the
idl
of
it
major
mine
indefinit
in
juli
but
it
doe
appear
the
uranium
price
ha
been
driven
by
the
news
flow
and
may
struggl
to
sustain
a
ralli
it
s
also
the
case
that
ralli
built
on
suppli
cut
are
rare
as
endur
as
those
prompt
by
increas
in
demand
if
the
price
of
spot
uranium
doe
rise
to
around
a
pound
as
some
analyst
forecast
it
s
like
that
cameco
and
kazatomprom
will
simpli
increas
output
from
their
idl
mine
but
is
there
a
posit
demand
case
to
be
made
for
uranium
the
news
headlin
in
recent
year
have
tend
to
focu
on
the
neg
such
as
the
closur
of
japan
s

germani

after
fukushima
and
the

on

almost
quietli
though
substanti
nuclear

china
and
elsewher

data
from
the

nuclear

show
that

it
is
worth
note
that
apart
from

the

their

have
far
less

the

thi
