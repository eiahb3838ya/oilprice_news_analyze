a
stellar

that
may
not

uranium
stood
at

on
up
from

so
far
thi

the

is
on

to
record
a

thi
look
like
a

on

uranium
isn

quit
like

and
it
s
worth
delv
down

tri

the

the
most
obviou

the

ha
been
suppli
cutback
by

said
in

it

kazatomprom
also
said
at
the
end
of
last

that
it
would
reduc
it
output
by

for
three
year
start
from
the
begin
of
as
it
battl
a
market
that
ha
been
oversuppli
sinc
the
nuclear
shutdown
in
the
wake
of
the
fukushima
disast
in
japan
the
cameco
and
kazatomprom
cutback
took
about
percent
of
annual
uranium
ore
suppli
from
the
market
but
the
price
action
in
the
wake
of
the
cutback
is
instruct
the
spot
price
took
off
after
cameco
s
novemb
announc
jump
from

to
a
high

extend
the

indefinit
in

but
it
doe
appear
the
uranium
price
ha
been
driven
by
the
news
flow
and
may
struggl
to
sustain
a
ralli
it
s
also
the
case
that

built
on

are
rare
as
endur
as
those
prompt
by
increas
in

if
the
price
of

uranium
doe
rise
to
around
a

as
some
analyst
forecast
it
s
like
that
cameco
and
kazatomprom
will
simpli
increas
output
from
their
idl

but
is
there
a
posit

case
to
be
made
for

the

headlin

have
tend
to
focu

as
the

that

the
