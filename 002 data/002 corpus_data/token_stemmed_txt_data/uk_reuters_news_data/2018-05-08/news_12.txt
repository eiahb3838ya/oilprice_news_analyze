with
brian

macro
strategist
at
natwest
market
in
stamford
connecticut
the
market
ha
been
prepar
in
a
sens
for
thi
announc
the
combin
of
the
changeov
in
the
presid
s
team
from
secretari
of
state
rex
tillerson
to
mike
pompeo
and
the
appoint
of
john
bolton
wa
a
signal
to
the
market
of
the
direct
that
the
administr
wa
go
you
have
seem
some
modest
flight
to
qualiti
though
it
hasn
t
been
major
i
think
right
now
there
s
still
quit
a
bit
of
uncertainti
about
the
futur
of
the
deal
even
now
that
the
ha
made
it
intent
clear
we
do
know
that
the
european
union
ha
said
they
will
continu
to
uphold
the
accord
regardless
of
the
decis
we
need
to
know
how
iran
will
respond
to
thi
there
s
still
plenti
up
in
the
air
you
could
argu
that
presid
trump
be
open
to
negoti
of
a
better
deal
while
also
hang
the
risk
of
sanction
over
iran
that
if
an
agreement
could
still
be
reach
a
riski
scenario
could
be
eric
nuttal
partner
and
senior
portfolio
manag
at
ninepoint
partner
in
toronto
as
an
energi
investor
trump
announc
everyth
that
one
could
possibl
have
want
him
to
say
the
term
that
he
use
wa
the
highest
level
of
sanction
we
re
obvious
look
for
the
detail
to
thi
but
it
give
one
confid
that
there
could
be
a
reduct
in
the
physic
movement
of
barrel
and
thi
also
put
at
stake
the
and
growth
ambit
of
iran
to
grow
their
product
and
capac
today
s
announc
give
energi
bull
that
much
more
confid
that
the
bull
market
for
oil
ha
even
greater
longev
for
it
i
think
we
re
go
to
next
year
for
wti
we
see
the
inventori
reach
a
low
by
the
end
of
thi
brian
battl
director
of
trade
at
perform
trust
capit
partner
in
chicago
thi
is
a
realli
telegraph
polici
posit
so
i
don
t
think
the
market
is
surpris
the
econom
effect
will
be
minim
realli
thi
is
a
polit
stori
it
s
not
a
market
or
an
econom
investor
are
also
react
to
trump
s
tone
he
s
not
close
the
door
and
shun
them
he
want
a
new
deal
the
door
is
open
to
tri
again
which
is
probabl
less
harsh
than
what
he
could
have
michael
o
rourk
chief
market
strategist
at
jonestrad
in
greenwich
connecticut
there
wa
so
much
of
thi
leak
out
there
in
the
media
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
much
of
a
surpris
to
the
market
the
initi
reaction
wa
that
defens
name
pop
and
ralli
oil
had
ralli
but
they
re
give
back
now
as
well
overal
we
haven
t
move
beyond
the
rang
we
were
trade
jacqu
rousseau
manag
director
of
clearview
energi
in
washington
i
think
peopl
are
sort
through
what
could
actual
happen
is
there
actual
ani
oil
that
s
go
to
leav
the
market
it
doesn
t
appear
so
in
the
if
you
take
a
look
at
what
s
go
on
now
iran
ship
about
million
barrel
per
day
to
asia
and
that
oil
is
unlik
to
get
chang
at
all
those
buyer
which
are
mainli
china
india
and
korea
are
unlik
to
adjust
their
plan
the
piec
that
could
come
into
play
is
what
goe
to
europ
about
barrel
a
day
goe
to
europ
and
so
it
depend
on
the
level
that
europ
is
cooper
with
trump
one
import
thing
in
all
of
thi
the
oil
in
iran
is
veri
differ
to
the
oil
in
venezuela
one
of
the
issu
venezuela
ha
is
that
their
oil
is
veri
heavi
and
sour
and
so
not
mani
refin
in
the
world
can
actual
process
it
if
for
exampl
the
stop
import
the
oil
from
venezuela
it
s
a
littl
more
difficult
to
find
a
home
for
it
wherea
the
oil
from
iran
is
medium
qualiti
so
there
s
a
lot
more
place
it
could
if
you
look
back
on
the
last
time
sanction
came
into
effect
the
asian
buyer
did
not
cut
back
on
their
purchas
so
now
that
s
someth
that
is
unlik
to
occur
there
s
definit
a
lot
of
littl
in
and
out
that
could
tri
and
steer
thing
in
that
direct
in
term
of
whether
cargo
would
be
insur
there
s
a
lot
of
piec
to
the
puzzl
and
i
m
not
sure
when
exactli
all
of
that
is
go
to
be
put
out
but
it
doesn
t
seem
like
there
s
go
to
be
volum
affect
in
the
near
stephen
massocca
senior
vice

secur
san
francisco
it
s
difficult
to
see
how
go
back
to
the
old
iranian
sanction
without
cooper
from
major
european
countri
will
be
effect
it
might
have
an
impact
on
oil
price
more
than
anyth
els
but
to
the
stock
market
i
don
t
see
a
big
move
one
way
or
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
not
that
leo
mariani
energi
specialist

secur
austin
texa
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
good
chanc
that
iranian
product
will
start
to
declin
by
and
iran
could
lose
roughli
bopd
over
the
next
month
thi
should
oil
price
to
continu
to
act
well
into
and
our
oil
price
forecast
is
wti
and
michael
purv
chief
global

co
the
big
risk
is
a
crude
spike
which
trump
doesn
t
want
ahead
of
the
midterm
doe
trump
realli
want
that
from
a
polit
strategi
point
of
view
so
doe
he
bark
at
then
walk
it
back
if
oil
price
go
too
high
but
the
secondari
impact
is
that
it

a
