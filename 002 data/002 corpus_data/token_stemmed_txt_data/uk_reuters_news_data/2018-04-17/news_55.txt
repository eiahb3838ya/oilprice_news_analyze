reuter

say
they
have
engin
a

that
could
in

the
enzym
is
abl

while
examin

thought
to
have

in

find
that
thi

wa
help
a

to
break

the

decid
to

it
structur
by

said
john
mcgeehan
a
professor
at
portsmouth
who
the
work
thi
led
to
a
serendipit
chang
in
the
enzym
s
action
allow
it
abil
to
work
faster
we
ve
made
an
improv
version
of
the
enzym
better
than
the
natur
one
alreadi
mcgeehan
told
reuter
in
an
interview
that
s
realli
excit
becaus
that
mean
that
there
s
potenti
to
optim
the
enzym
even
the
team
whose
find
wa
publish
on
monday
in
the
proceed
of
the
nation
academi
of
scienc
journal
is
now
work
on
improv
the
enzym
further
to
see
if
they
can
make
it
capabl
of
break
down
pet
plastic
on
an
industri
scale
it
s
well
within
the
possibl
that
in
the
come
year
we
will
see
an
industri
viabl
process
to
turn
pet
and
potenti
other
plastic
back
into
