china
s
import
of
major
commod
may
be
lose
some
of
their
strong
growth
momentum
with
gain
in
the
first
quarter
of
thi
year
fail
to
keep
pace
with
those
from
the
same
period
in
at
first
glanc
china
s
import
of
crude
oil
iron
ore
coal
and
copper
look
to
have
bounc
back
in
march
after
a
poor
show
in
februari
howev
the
first
two
month
of
the
year
gener
result
in
some
distort
in
the
data
depend
on
the
time
of
the
lunar
new
year
thi
year
s
holiday
fell
entir
within
februari
result
in
weaker
import
number
it
s
alway
more
illumin
to
look
at
first
quarter
number
when
assess
china
s
commod
import
and
here
the
stori
is
far
more
mix
crude
oil
import
rose
percent
in
the
first
quarter
of
compar
to
the
same
period
a
year
earlier
to
the
equival
of
about
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
howev
the
growth
rate
in
the
first
quarter
of
wa
percent
mean
that
although
china
s
import
of
crude
oil
are
still
increas
they
aren
t
do
so
at
the
same
pace
as
they
did
in
the
earli
part
of
last
year
in
volum
term
the
gain
still
look
impress
with
import
in
the
first
quarter
some
bpd
more
than
they
were
in
the
same
period
in
howev
it
s
also
worth
note
that
export
of
refin
fuel
were
about
million
bpd
which
is
about
bpd
more
than
they
were
in
the
first
quarter
of
last
year
thi
impli
that
of
the
addit
bpd
of
crude
import
in
the
first
quarter
of
just
over
a
third
wa
export
as
refin
product
a
further
factor
point
to
the
loss
of
some
growth
momentum
in
china
s
crude
demand
coal
import
also
look
to
have
rebound
strongli
in
march
with
a
percent
jump
over
the
previou
month
but
the
gain
for
the
first
quarter
as
a
whole
wa
a
more
modest
percent
thi
growth
rate
is
still
robust
but
it
is
about
half
the
pace
of
what
wa
achiev
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
stori
is
even
weaker
for
iron
ore
with
first
quarter
import
of
million
tonn
actual
be
percent
down
from
the
same
quarter
last
year
in
the
period
last
year
iron
ore
import
were
up
percent
from
the
same
period
in
it
would
appear
that
china
s
vast
steel
sector
may
be
take
a
breather
after
sever
month
of
strong
gain
and
the
of
iron
ore
inventori
at
port
to
record
level
in
recent
week
probabl
ha
help
lower
the
appetit
for
import
howev
copper
is
an
area
of
strength
in
china
s
first
quarter
with
import
of
unwrought
copper
increas
percent
in
the
first
quarter
a
revers
of
the
declin
of
percent
experienc
in
the
first
three
month
of
howev
it
s
like
that
some
of
thi
gain
is
due
to
a
chang
in
regul
make
it
more
difficult
to
import
copper
scrap
and
therebi
boost
demand
for
the
refin
metal
overal
the
pictur
that
emerg
from
china
s
first
quarter
trade
data
is
somewhat
similar
to
an
australian
govern
public
inform
campaign
on
terror
which
urg
citizen
to
be
alert
not
alarm
there
is
littl
to
suggest
that
china
s
economi
is
slow
faster
than
expect
and
the
data
show
that
commod
import
are
still
rel
robust
even
if
the
pace
of
growth
is
slow
it
s
like
that
a
healthi
moder
is
the
best
outcom
for
china
just
so
long
as
it
doesn
t
turn
into
someth
more
pronounc
in
the
current
quarter
