the

ha
appreci
by
more
than
percent
against

sinc
the

in
respons
to
the

between
the

the

brent
crude

have
risen
nearli
percent
thi
year
in
dollar
term
but
are
up
more
than

as
a
result
of
the
shift
china
s
currenc

is
partli
driven
by

permit
the
exchang

to
act
as
a
shock
absorb
the
practic
effect
is
the
same
but
the

ha
also
appreci
against
everi

in
gener
it
is
the

mostli
as
a
result
of

steadili
rise

the
result
is
that

rise
much
faster
than
the
intern
benchmark
price
quot
in

there
is
no

onli
one
of
mani
influenc
on
the
price
of

the
