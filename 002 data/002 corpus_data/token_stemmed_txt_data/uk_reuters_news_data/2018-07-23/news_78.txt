oil
research
and
forecast
show
china
import
million
barrel
or
about
barrel
per
day
bpd
of
oil
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
thi
wa
up
from
just
million
barrel
or
bpd
over
the
same
period
last
year
accord
to
the
data
much
of
the
gain
so
far
thi
year
ha
been
in
recent
month
with
the
april
to
juli
period
be
four
of
the
five
strongest
month
on
record
and
januari
thi
year
be
the
other
juli
is
set
to
be
the
month
for
chines
import
of
crude
with
the
data
point
to
the
arriv
of
million
barrel
or
about
bpd
expect
shipment
in
august
appear
to
be
head
substanti
lower
howev
with
onli
million
barrel
or
about
bpd
expect
to
arriv
at
chines
port
while
these
number
may
still
chang
they
are
unlik
to
shift
much
given
the
typic
journey
between
port
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
china
thi
mean
all
cargo
slate
to
arriv
in
china
in
august
should
have
alreadi
left
it
also
mean
most
cargo
like
to
arriv
in
septemb
would
also
have
depart
the
unit
state
but
so
far
no
such
fixtur
are
show
thi
doesn
t
mean
there
will
be
zero
crude
export
arriv
china
in
septemb
but
it
doe
rais
the
possibl
that
there
will
be
a
sharp
declin
to
put
it
in
perspect
of
the
cargo
unload
in
china
in
june
nine
left
port
in
april
given
there
is
onli
one
week
left
of
juli
and
no
cargo
have
yet
left
the
for
arriv
in
china
in
septemb
it
seem
risk
are
rise
that
oil
shipment
to
china
are
fall
off
a
cliff
thi
may
add
to
the
exist
trade
tension
between
china
and
presid
donald
trump
who
ha
made
it
clear
he
want
a
lower
trade
deficit
with
china
if
crude
oil
export
do
plummet
though
the
trade
deficit
is
like
head
higher
notwithstand
tariff
alreadi
place
on
some
chines
export
by
the
trump
administr
while
thi
sound
like
a
poor
outcom
for
crude
export
there
is
evid
suggest
other
import
in
north
asia
are
take
up
cargo
no
longer
be
bought
by
china
south
korea
may
import
a
record
amount
of
crude
in
septemb
with
data
point
to
the
arriv
of
million
barrel
or
about
bpd
japan
may
bring
in
million
barrel
in
septemb
or
about
bpd
the
highest
sinc
januari
thi
year
taiwan
s
import
from
the
unit
state
are
slate
at
million
bpd
for
august
or
about
bpd
which
would
be
the
highest
on
record
while
addit
import
from
japan
south
korea
and
taiwan
are
probabl
insuffici
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
chines
purchas
they
will
provid
some
comfort
to
oil
export
but
they
are
also
unlik
to
do
anyth
to
eas
the

tension
between
the

the
loom
slump
in

s
purchas
of

may
be
taken
as
a
sign
that
beij
is
prepar

fight
back
against

even
if
the
tactic

rather
than

china
may
simpli
persuad
it
