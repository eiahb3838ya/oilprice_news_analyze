howev
there
is
still
a
long
road
to

from

even

much
will
depend
on
what
the

the
smart
play
is
probabl
to
condemn
vocifer
in

to
do
veri
littl
in

while
at

assum
trump

it
will

becom
clear
that
the

are
like
to
have
onli
a
small
impact
on

are
effect
an
for
the

that
s
a
big
assumpt
and
one
not

trump
ha
seemingli
on

say
in

that

are
good
and
easi
to
win
a
phrase
that
may

becom
hi
polit
epitaph
but
the
extent
of
the
poor
reaction
to
the
plan

especi
from
industri
trump
ha
count
among
hi
support
such
as

with
the

of

may
yet
give
hi
administr
paus
for
thought
at
ani
rate
assum
a
global
trade

can
be
avoid
the
effect
of
the
tariff
should
be
to
make
steel
and
aluminium
more
expens
insid
the
countri
while
make
it
rel
cheaper
elsewher
in
the
world
if
countri
that
export
to
the
unit
state
find
they
can
no
longer
ship
the
same
volum
they
can
either
find
new

given
that
china
the

a
fraction
of

it
s
like
to
be
the
least
affect
among
asia
s
steel
maker
japan
and
south
korea
may
find
the
go
tougher
but
if
those
countri
do
end
up
with
steel
glut
it
will
like
lower
cost
for
their
signific
automot
industri
thu
improv
their

competit
aluminium
is
also
a
major
input
into

the

will
find

tough

are
therefor
most
at

from

tariff
at
the
margin
lower
brazilian
steel
export
may
free
up
some
iron
ore
for

but
it
seem
like
at
thi
stage
that
seaborn
iron
ore
is
unlik
to
suffer
much
chang
to
either
demand
or
suppli
from
the

look
at

it
s
like
that
a
similar

emerg

that
the

hurt
itself
more
than

won

termin
railroad

will
serv
to
erod
their

in

again
much
of
thi
is
at
the
margin
with

like

the

that
