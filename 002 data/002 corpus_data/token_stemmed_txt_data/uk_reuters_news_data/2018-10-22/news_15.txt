with
china
s
restrict
start
to
take
effect
one
of
the
convent
market
wisdom
is
that
thi
will
boost
demand
for
iron
ore
the
logic
is
sound
if
steel
mill
are
restrict
as
to
how
much
they
can
pollut
they
will
use
the
best
possibl
qualiti
iron
ore
in
order
to
maximis
the
amount
of
steel
produc
rel
to
the
energi
consum
thi
mean
that
ore
with
an
iron
content
of
percent
or
higher
should
command
a
greater
period
dure
the
winter
restrict
period
than
those
poorer
qualiti
grade
such
as
percent
it
s
still
not
absolut
certain
how
much
iron
ore
capac
will
be
idl
or
forc
to
run
at
lower
product
rate
over
the
winter
period
as
part
of
effort
to
limit
air
pollut
from
burn
coal
thi
time
around
beij
ha
allow
local
author
to
set
their
own
measur
chang
from
last
winter
s
polici
of
impos
blanket
cut
on
certain
region
thi
had
made
it
more
difficult
to
work
out
precis
how
much
steel
capac
may
be
cut
and
how
mani
tonn
of
product
may
be
lost
some
area
such
as
top
produc
tangshan
appear
to
have
impos
less
stringent
measur
but
have
made
them
last
for
longer
thi
time
to
the
end
of
march
as
oppos
to
the
middl
of
march
in
thi
year
s
curb
analyst
at
barclay
bank
said
in
a
research
note
on
that
the
longer
period
will
outweigh
the
more
lenient
capac
reduct
result
in
the
loss
of
million
tonn
thi
winter
from
tangshan
compar
to
million
tonn
the
previou
winter
the
output
restrict
will
also
appli
to
more
region
than
last
year
rais
the
possibl
that
steel
output
will
declin
over
the
winter
period
thi
didn
t
happen
last
winter
as
mill
in
area
not
subject
to
restrict
were
abl
to
increas
output
by
more
than
the
volum
lost
by
plant
subject
to
pollut
control
whatev
end
up
be
the
case
the
likelihood
is
that
steel
mill
will
seek
to
use
iron
ore
in
order
to
produc
the
most
amount
of
steel
from
whatev
capac
they
are
allow
to
use
thi
should
boost
demand
for
iron
ore
although
thi
dynam
ha
yet
to
show
up
in
price
iron
ore
for
china
deliveri
with
a
iron
content
as
assess
by
argu
media
end
last
week
at
a
tonn
while
ore
wa
and
wa
thi
put
the
ore
at
a
premium
of
percent
to
and
at
a
premium
of
percent
to
the
grade
that
may
seem
like
quit
substanti
but
it
s
not
far
off
the
percent
command
by
the
ire
over
the
at
the
end
of
octob
last
year
and
the
percent
premium
over
interestingli
last
winter
the
premium
didn
t
actual
widen
over
the
season
it
narrow
with
ore
end
februari
just
percent
abov
grade
ore
and
percent
higher
than
that
would
seem
to
fli
in
the
face
of
the
market
view
that
winter
should
lead
to
stronger
demand
for
ore
given
that
the
last
year
the
poorer
qualiti
grade
actual
close
the
gap
on
the
ore
howev
the
explan
is
like
that
steel
mill
outsid
the
pollut
control
area
took
advantag
of
the
wide
discount
for
ore
at
the
start
of
winter
and
bought
cargo
of
the
cheaper
suppli
thi
winter
the
dynam
may
end
be
slightli
differ
given
the
like
wider
applic
of
measur
certainli
there
is
some
evid
to
suggest
that
ore
such
as
those
suppli
by
brazil
s
vale
are
see
increas
demand
and
port
data
compil
by
refinitiv
suggest
that
china
may
import
as
much
as
million
tonn
from
brazil
thi
month
that
would
be
the
strongest
monthli
result
sinc
the
data
seri
began
in
while
thi
data
is
subject
to
revis
due
to
the
time
of
vessel
arriv
and
discharg
their
cargo
it
still
point
to
strong
chines
demand
for
iron
ore
