ventur
and
is
not
fund
by

taxpay
when
germani
make
a
massiv
oil
and
ga
deal
with
russia
trump
said
to
stoltenberg
we
re
suppos
to
be
guard
against
russia
and
germani
goe
out
and
pay
billion
and
billion
of
dollar
a
year
to
russia
we
re
protect
germani
we
re
protect
franc
we
re
protect
all
of
these
countri
and
then
numer
of
the
countri
go
out
and
make
a
pipelin
deal
with
russia
where
they
re
pay
billion
of
dollar
into
the
coffer
of
russia
so
we
re
suppos
to
protect
you
against
russia
and
you
pay
billion
of
dollar
to
russia
and
i
think
that
s
veri
inappropri
trump
said
at
the
resid
of
the
ambassador
in
brussel
germani
will
have
almost
percent
of
their
countri
control
by
russia
with
natur
ga
you
tell
me
is
that
appropri
he
ask
while
stoltenberg
listen
at
one
point
the
former
norwegian
prime
minist
point
out
that
the
nato
alli
in
europ
disagre
among
themselv
on
way
to
reduc
the
contin
s
relianc
on
russian
ga
germani
is
total
control
by
russia
caus
they
are
get
to
percent
of
their
energi
from
russia
and
a
new
trump
renew
hi
call
for
other
nato
alli
to
pay
in
more
to
the
western
allianc
after
year
in
which
taxpay
have
he
said
born
an
unfair
share
of
militari
spend
i
think
these
countri
have
to
step
it
up
not
over
a
year
period
they
have
to
step
it
up
immedi
germani
is
a
rich
countri
they
talk
about
increas
it
a
tini
bit
by
well
they
could
increas
it
immedi
tomorrow
and
have
no
problem
trump
said
if
you
look
at
it
germani
is
a
captiv
of
russia
they
got
rid
of
their
coal
plant
they
got
rid
of
their
nuclear
they
re
get
so
much
of
their
oil
and
ga
from
russia
i
think
it
is
someth
nato
ha
to
look
