technolog
that

techniqu
such
as

the
sourc
said

accord
to
the
sourc
who
ask
not
to
be

becaus
of
the
sensit
of
the
matter
that
way
you
could
address
a
countri
s
concern
about
spent
fuel
without
transfer
ownership
of
the
technolog
to
them
said
one
of
the
sourc
the
nnsa
confirm
a
project
to

other
countri
with
nuclear
wast
is
underway
but
declin
to
provid
detail
we
are
in
the
conceptu
phase
of
identifi
approach
that
could
reduc
the
quantiti
of

fuel
without
creat

a
goal
with
signific
econom

secur
benefit
nnsa
spokesman

said
the
effort
is
be
led

the

would

after
it

the

schwartz
said
the
plan
under

do
not

declin
to
say
what
technolog
could
be

the
sourc
familiar
with
the

s
deliber
said
there
are
three
basic
way
that
the
physic
volum
of
nuclear
wast
can
be
reduc
all
of
which
are
costli
at
least
one
of
the
techniqu
pose
a
secur
threat
they
said
the
first
call
consolid
reduc
the
volum
of
nuclear
wast
by
take
apart
spent
fuel
assembl
and
crunch
the
wast
down
to
two
time
smaller
than
the
origin
volum
an
approach
that
is
consid
costli
but
which
doesn
t
add
much
secur
risk
a
second
techniqu
involv
heat
radioact
pellet
in
spent

assembl
the
process
which
give
off
gase
that
must
be
contain
result
in
a
wast
product
that
ha
more
environment
and
health
risk
a
third
approach
call

put

in

it
that

it
a

the
nuclear

is
divid
on
whether
pyroprocess
fit
