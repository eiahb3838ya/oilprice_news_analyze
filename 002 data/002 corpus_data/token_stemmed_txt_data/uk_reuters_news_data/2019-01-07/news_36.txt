start

with
three

but
volum
are
still
a
long
way
off

prior

the
outbreak
of

hostil
between

s
two
largest
economi
data
compil

show
three
tanker
carri
million
barrel
are
en
rout
from
the

to

and
will
arriv

thi
is
up
from

in

a
mere
one
in

zero
in

and

prior

from

wa
a

in

in
the
first
nine

of

china
import
about
barrel
per

bpd
from
the

repres
about
percent
of

china
s
import
of
crude
reach
a
record
high
of
about
bpd
in

accord
to
the
refinitiv

it
s
worth
note
that
china
hasn
t
impos
ani
tariff
on
crude
import
unlik
coal
and
liquefi
natur
ga
which
were
includ
in

s
retaliatori
measur
what
seem
clear
is
that
chines
refin
decid
to
hold
back
on
buy
crude
either
becaus
they
were
nudg
in
that
direct
by
the
govern
or
becaus
they
were
concern
that
a
tariff
would
be
impos
use
crude
oil
for
polit
is
certainli
noth
new
so
the
resumpt
of
trade
between
china
and
the
unit
state
may
well
depend
on
the
statu
of
talk
between
the
administr
of
presid
donald
trump
and
it
counterpart
in
beij
howev
if
the
crude
trade
wa
strictli
about
econom
it
s
like
that
crude
price
will
have
to
fall
some
more
especi
rel
to
compet
grade
of
west
african
crude
the
bulk
of
the
crude
go
to
asia
is
light
and
sweet
and
therefor
compet
with
grade
like
nigeria
s
bonni
light
and
angola
s
girassol
while
west
texa
intermedi
wti
futur
have
drop
sharpli
sinc
their
peak
in
earli
octob
the
price
of
physic
wti
deliv
in
houston
as
assess
by
argu
media
hasn
t
fallen
by
as
much
wti
houston
wa
at
a
barrel
on
while
wti
futur
were
at
a
discount
of
a
barrel
six
month
ago
wti
houston
wa
at
a
barrel
and
the
futur
were
show
that
sinc
then
the
investor
market
ha
becom
more
bearish
on
crude
price
than
the
physic
market
compar
wti
houston
to
girassol
show
that
the
angolan
grade
trade
at
a
small
premium
on
close
at
a
barrel
to
wti
houston
s
the
small
price
advantag
for
the
physic
wti
is
not
enough
to
overcom
the
higher
cost
of
a
longer
voyag
to
asia
mean
that
crude
is
current
uncompetit
thi
suggest
that
export
will
have
to
be
prepar
to
offer
deeper
discount
if
they
wish
to
displac
west
african
barrel
from
the
asian
market
a
further
complic
factor
is
the
new
output
cut
announc
by
opec
and
it
alli
chiefli
russia
it
s
like
that
much
of
the
oil
affect
by
the
product
restrict
will
be
medium
to
heavi
grade
given
that
the
bulk
of
the
cut
will
be
done
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
thi
is
like
to
tighten
the
market
for
heavier
grade
which
are
not
readili
replac
by
light
crude
such
as
wti
even
if
there
are
plenti
suppli
of
the
light
crude
thi
mean
that
even
if
the
unit
state
is
increas
it
output
there
may
not
be
enough
demand
for
light
crude
to
soak
up
the
extra
suppli
