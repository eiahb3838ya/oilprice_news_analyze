growth
there
is
much
greater
interest
in
gener
return
and
free
cash
but
given
the
natur
of
the
busi
where
field
natur
declin
as
they
age
and
take
year
to
develop
invest
will
have
to
grow
after
to
avoid
a
dip
in

would
i
be
surpris
if

higher
no
i
wouldn
t
there
will

bishop
said
instead
compani
should
opt
for
and
phase
project
where
spend
is
better
control
such
as
shale
oil
and
offshor
field
expans
as
well
as

such
as
chemic

there
seem
to
be
less
appetit
for
just
