befor
we
start
to

thi
too
close
so
that

still
probabl
a

he
ad
an
lng

expans
would
have
to
compet
with
global
rival
includ
option
in
the
africa
and
middl
east
and
would
depend
on
the

for
the

though
all
sign
point
to
sustain
asian
demand
lng

ha
risen
sharpli
in
recent

led
by

gobbl
up
an

of

corp
one
of
the
key
benefit
for

is
access

crother
said
note
that
western

are
roughli
less

the

is
boom
as
oil
sand
produc
use
it
as
a
diluent
to
run
their
heavi

through

the
risk
is
that

could
cut

in

to

if

sand
play
declin
or
peopl
shut

then
the
