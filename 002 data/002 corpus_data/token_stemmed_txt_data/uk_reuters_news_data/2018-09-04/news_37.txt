thi

the

indic
that

remain
robust
throughout

so
far
there
wa
a
summer
in

thi
had
more
of
an
impact
on

demand
given
limit

it
seem
that
china
ha
not

been

ha
also
been
build
up
storag
capac
in

what
appear
to
be
happen
is
that

show
a

to
the

wa
percent
compar
to

last

and
percent
the

befor
it
s
also
worth
note
that

thi
