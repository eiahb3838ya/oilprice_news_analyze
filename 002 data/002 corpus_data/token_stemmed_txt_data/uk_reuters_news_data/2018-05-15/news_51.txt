but
the
countri

have
final
realis
there
is
mount
public
anger
against
their
industri
and
they
are
veri
much
on
the
back
foot
when
it
come
to
tell
what
they
believ
is
a
posit
stori
the
public
relat
problem
for
the
industri
have
been
brew
for
sever
year
but
have
been
greatli
exacerb
in
the
past
year
by
a
combin
of
factor
these
includ
sharpli
higher
natur
ga
price
for
domest
consum
and
a
campaign
by
green
activist
against

thi
environment
campaign
attack
the
industri
on
sever
level
from
claim
that
onshor
natur

is
unsaf

will
damag
farmland
to
articul
that
the
rise
of
australia
s
lng
export
industri
ha
rais
price
and
starv
domest
consum
of
suppli
to
draw
a
direct
link
between
natur
ga
product
and
climat
chang
not
all
of
these
argument
stand
up
to
scrutini
but
the
industri
ha
been
slow
to
realis
that
reli
on
reason
and
argument
when
it
oppon
are
use
popul
and
fear
and
outrag
is
a
lose
posit
what
the
industri
ha
taken
too
long
to
realis
is
that
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
it
doesn
t
matter
that
differ
govern
inquiri
have
found
that
extract
natur

is
safe
as
long
as
it
is
properli
regul
if
the
populac
believ
the
of

a
refus
to

ha
cost
the
industri
credibl
and
rebuild
a
public
imag
of

produc
as
a
valuabl
contributor
to
societi
will
take
time
despit
the
billion
the
industri
ha
invest
over
the
past
decad
to
build
eight
new

zoe
yujnovich
chairwoman
of
royal
dutch
shell
s
oper
in
australia
and
also
of
appea
told
the
confer
the
industri
wa
well
receiv
and
respect
in
the
larg
remot
commun
where
it
oper
are
locat
but
vilifi
and
distrust
in
australia
s
larg
citi
so
a
question
we
must
answer
is
whi
is
there
such
a
gulf
in
percept
from
the
region
area
where
we
oper
to
the
comment
and
activist
of
the
inner
citi
who
reli
on
our
product
she
said
yujnovich
said
the
industri
ha
been
unwil
to
engag
in
convers
with
other
australian
and
when
it
ha
it
ha
chosen
to
avoid
challeng
or
confront
dialogu
in
effect
the
industri
ha
sat
in
it
ivori
tower
believ
that
scienc
back
it
posit
and
that
it
product
provid
the
energi
the
commun
need
it
s
thi
sort
of
disengag
that
ha
allow
the
industri
to
be
tar
with
the
narr
that
it
doesn
t
contribut
it
fair
share
of
tax
that
it
is
send
australian
natur
resourc
offshor
for
it
own
profit
and
that
it
is
respons
for
surg
domest
price
for
natur
ga
and
electr
there
is
an
element
of
truth
to
the
price
argument
against
the
industri
insofar
as
the
establish
of
three
lng
export
plant
on
the
east
coast
in
queensland
state
ha
effect
link
the
domest
natur
ga
price
to
asian
lng
price
instead
of
recognis
the
issu
the
industri
push
back
against
govern
plan
to
ensur
that
domest
ga
suppli
need
were
met
befor
the
demand
of
the
lng
plant
the
industri
ha
also
been
larg
ineffectu
in
lobbi
the
variou
state
and
territori
govern
to
open
up
more
onshor
explor
area
and
end
ban
that
have
been
impos
the
australian
state
of
new
south
wale
victoria
and
tasmania
all
have
some
form
of
ban
or
restrict
on
natur
ga
explor
and
product
and
the
northern
territori
just
lift
a
ban
on
hydraul
fractur
after
a
govern
inquiri
found
the
risk
could
be
manag
there
are
sever
step
the
australian
natur
ga
industri
can
take
to
improv
it
public
imag
and
rebuild
trust
the
first
is
to
cooper
with
each
other
to
ensur
the
domest
market
is
well
suppli
at
price
that
will
allow
industri
compani
to
continu
to
be
competit
thu
prevent
them
from
shift
oper
offshor
the
second
is
to
ensur
that
govern
realis
that
increas
suppli
is
a
key
way
of
deliv
cheaper
price
and
the
third
is
to
do
more
than
just
engag
commun
where
they
oper
but
also
to
talk
to
peopl
in
the
citi
as
to
what
the
industri
actual
deliv
and
what
it
can

the
opinion
