depart
issu
a

red
alert
on

becaus
fissur
in
the
southeast
area
of
the
lanipuna
garden
area
were
issu
high
level
of
sulfur
dioxid
condit
red
mean
immedi
danger
to

so
take
action
to
limit
further
exposur

the

said
in
the
alert
while
resid
deal
with
noxiou
ga
and
lava
on
the
ground
the
geolog
survey
is
concern
that
steam
could
caus
a
violent
explos
erupt
at
the
volcano
crater
launch
a
plume
that
could
spread
debri
over
mile
km
scientist
had
expect
such
explos
by
the
middl
of
thi
month
as
kilauea
s
lava
lake
fell
below
the
water
tabl
the
possibl
exist
howev
that
water
may
not
be
enter
the
crater
as
fear
and
ga
and
steam
may
be
safe
vent
scientist
said
so
far
those
explos
have
not
occur
and
i
think
the
key
here
is
that
the
vent
system
is
an
open
one
therefor
pressur
is
not
be
built
or
develop
down
at
the
top
