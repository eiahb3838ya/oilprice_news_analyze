as
part
of
a
long

economi
japanes
firm
are
work

coleman
told

woodsid
ha
discuss
the
prospect
of
ship
hydrogen
with

s
chiyoda
corp
coleman
said
for
woodsid
the
opportun
would
be
to
use
ga
it
produc
off
western
australia
to
convert
to
ammonia
and
then
liquid
hydrogen
to
export
to
japan
it
make
more
sens
to
produc
hydrogen
in
australia
and
then
ship
it
rather
than
send
liquefi
natur
ga
lng
to
japan
to
make
hydrogen
as
the
product
process
requir
a
lot
of
energi
which
japan
is
short
on
coleman
said
woodsid
is
look
to
tap
the
abund
sunshin
in
western
australia
s
pilbara
region
for
the
energi
need
to
releas
hydrogen
from
methan
as
a
first
step
the
compani
is
consid
switch
it
north
west
shelf
lng
plant
to
be
power
by
solar
energi
and
batteri
instead
of
ga
which
coleman
estim
would
cost
hundr
of
million
of
dollar
that
would
be
justifi
onc
australia
s
oldest
and
largest
lng
plant
secur
ga
suppli
to
keep
oper
beyond
it
make
econom
sens
to
do
it
coleman
told
report
the
switch
would
free
up
more
ga
for
sale
and
would
also
have
environment
benefit
as
percent
of
the
plant
s
carbon
emiss
current
come
from
burn
ga
for
power
and
run
compressor
about
percent
of
ga
produc
for
the
north
west
shelf
plant
is
use
to
gener
power
and
run
compressor
at
the
plant
the
main
byproduct
from
produc
hydrogen
from
ga
would
be
carbon
which
woodsid
could
decid
to
buri
or
use
for
other
purpos
