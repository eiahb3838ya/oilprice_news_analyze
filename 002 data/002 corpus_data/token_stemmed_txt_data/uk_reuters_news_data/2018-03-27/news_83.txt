more
sour
than
the

better
reflect
the
type
of

the

is
a
sort
of
chines
mirror

futur
the

provid
an
opportun
to
use
both
as

as
well
as
arbitrag
play
thi
dynam
is
like
what
will
attract
and
retain
intern
market
player
to
the
ine
as
it
will
allow
them
to
profit
from
ani
opportun
between
the

by
the
dme
futur
and
deliv
to

cargo
by
the
ine
the
difficulti
for
western
investor
in
the
ine
is
the
risk
of
interfer
by
the
author
in
beij
the
latter
have
a
track
record
of
chang
rule
and
regul
for
commod
trade
if
the
market
isn
t
behav
in
their
desir
fashion
currenc
risk
is
also
on
the
agenda
given
the
ine
is
settl
in
yuan
and
the
other
major
oil
contract
are
in
dollar
there
are
other
challeng
for
the
ine
with
one
be
that
the
contract
is
onli
trade
in
asian
hour
close
at
local
time
or
gmt
thi
exclud
london
and
new

trader
from
get
in
on
the
action
in
their
own
time
zone
a
factor
that
may
hamper
liquid
there
is
also
a
risk
of
differ
expect
of
the
variou
particip

compani
seek
hedg
and
arbitrag
opportun
meanwhil
the
chines
govern
and
major
may
be
seek
market
control
and
the
abil
to
pay
for
crude
in
their
own
currenc
anoth
factor
that
still
ha
to
be
work
out
will
be
how
much
of
the
volum
and
open
interest
is
held
by
profession
player
either
foreign
or
chines
and
how
much
is
down
to
day
trader
and
other
investor
sever
of
china
s
vibrant
commod
contract
are
domin
by
smaller
player
which
can
exacerb
swing
base
on
sentiment
or
momentum
without
too
much
base
on
market
fundament
but
none
of
these
problem
are
insurmount
and
can
be
address
as
the
contract
build
up
a
histori
and
a
reput
the
key
will
be
to
keep
an
eye
on
