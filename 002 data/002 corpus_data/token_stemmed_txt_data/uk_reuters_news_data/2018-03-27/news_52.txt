thi
dynam
is
like
what
will
attract
and
retain
intern
market
player
to
the

as
it
will
allow

cargo
by

the
difficulti
for

in
the

is
the
risk
of

in
beij
the

have
a
track
record
of

rule
and
regul
for

trade
if
the
market
isn
t
behav
in
their
desir
fashion
currenc
risk
is
also
on
the
agenda
given
the
ine
is
settl
in
yuan
and
the
other
major
oil
contract
are
in
dollar
there
are
other
challeng
for
the
ine
with
one
be
that
the
contract
is
onli
trade
in
asian
hour
close
at
local
time
or

thi
exclud
london
and
new

trader
from
get
in
on

in
their
own
time
zone
a
factor
that
may
hamper
liquid
there
is
also
a
risk
of

expect
of
the

and
major
may
be
seek
market
control
and
the
abil
to
pay
for

in
their
own
currenc
anoth
factor
that
still
ha
to
be
work
out
will
be
how
much
of
the
volum
and
open
interest
is
held
by
profession
player
either
foreign
or
chines
and
how
much
is
down
to
day
trader
and
other
investor
sever
of
china
s
vibrant
commod
contract
are
domin
by
smaller
player
which
can
exacerb
swing
base
on
sentiment
or
momentum
without
too
much
base
on

fundament
but
none
of
these
problem
are
insurmount
and
can
be
address
as
the
contract
build
up
a

the
key
will
be
