the
prospect
of

the

togeth
with

partner
may
consid
rais
output
to
compens
for
ani
suppli
shortfal
even
if
the
suppli
gap
is
plug
the
market
will
be
fine
balanc
next
year
and
vulner
to
price
rise
higher
in
the
event
of

disrupt
it
is
possibl
that
the
veri
small
number
of
countri
with
spare
capac
beyond
what
can
be
activ
quickli
will
have
to
go
the
extra
mile
the
agenc
said
if
the
other
opec
member
were
to
continu
pump
at
the
same
rate
as
may
a
potenti
suppli
gap
could
emerg
and
lead
to
a
draw
on
stock
of
more
than
million
bpd
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
report
said
the
agenc
said
it
had
look
at
a
scenario
in
which
by
the
end
of
next
year
output
from
iran
and
venezuela
could
be
million
bpd
lower
than
it
is
today
the
iea
estim
that
iranian
export
would
drop
by
the
same
amount
as
they
did
dure
the
last
round
of
sanction
for
venezuela
the
agenc
said
it
saw
no
respit
in
the
collaps
in
product
from
econom
crisi
that
ha
taken
million
bpd
off
the
market
in
the
past
two
year
opec
s
effort
in
restrain
output
led
to
commerci
oil
stock
across
the
world
s
richest
nation
fall
by
million
barrel
in
april
to
a
new
low
of

the

estim
that
