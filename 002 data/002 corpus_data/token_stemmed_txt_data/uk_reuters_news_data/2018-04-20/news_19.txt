we
are

but
now
part

karobl
did
not
expect
nato
to
increas
defenc

he
expect
the
allianc
to
show
greater
commit
at
a
nato
leader
summit
in
juli
to
deter
ani
threat
in
the
baltic
one
difficulti
is
that
other
nato
member
face
defenc
gap
after
year
of
better
tie
with
russia
follow
the
end
of
the
cold
war
that
made
such
defenc
unnecessari
we
would
like
to
have
the
perman
deploy
of
ground
missil
system
and
other
capabl
but
we
understand
that
a
quit
signific
part
of
these
capabl
were
lost
by
nato
after
the
cold
war
and
it
s
difficult
to
rebuild
them
fast
he
said
we
need
to

that
