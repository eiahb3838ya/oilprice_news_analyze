after
a

and
may
be
pois
for

jump

up

from

in

accord

on

howev
the

in

went
onli
some

thi

import
for
the
first

as
a
whole
total
million

a
drop
of
percent
on
the

last

in
some
way
the
declin
in
coke
coal
import
isn
t
that
surpris
given
the
winter
restrict
place
on

as
part
of
the

over

in
fact
march
s
product
of
million
tonn
wa
the
most
sinc
septemb
accord
to
data
from
the
nation
bureau
of
statist
what
is
the
like
explan
is
that
steel
product
wa
curb
in
the
north
of
countri
where
winter
pollut
concern
are
most
acut
but
mill
in
other
part
of
china
were
abl
to
increas
their
output
to
take
advantag
of
good
price
the
higher
steel
output
in
the
first
quarter
doesn
t
fit
well
with
the
lower
import
of
coke
coal
but
there
are
some
factor
that
may
help
explain
some
of
the
issu
the
first
is
that
steel
mill
have
been
use
higher
qualiti
iron
ore
therefor
requir
less
coke
coal
to
produc
the
same
amount
of
raw
materi
certainli
recent
month
have
seen
widen
premium
for
iron
ore
and
trader
have
report
mill
have
been
prefer
qualiti
over
quantiti
a
switch
to
qualiti
probabl
isn
t
enough
by
itself
to
explain
lower
coke
coal
import
and
it
s
doubt
that
domest
product
ha
been
make
up
the
shortfal
china
s
total
coal
product
includ
both
thermal
and
coke
grade
fell
to
the
lowest
in
five
month
in
march
total
million
tonn
output
wa
up
percent
on
the
same
period
in
to
million
tonn
suggest
that
if
anyth
there
wa
onli
a
modest
increas
in
domest
suppli
of
coke
coal
it
s
like
that
steel
mill
and
produc
of

which
is
made
from
coke
coal
and
use
in
blast
furnac
have
been
run
