point
to

arriv

in

about
barrel
per

bpd
of

is
expect
to
land
at

in

up
from
bpd
in
may
which
wa
the
previou
high
for
crude
export
to

while
there
may
be
scope
for
export
to
push
higher
in
come

they
will
probabl
be
limit
by
both
infrastructur
constraint
and
a
weaken
of

while
the
paper
futur

make
a
compel
case
for
crude
export
price
in
the
physic
market
is
far
less
convinc
the
price
of
wti
crude
at
houston
as
assess
by
argu
media
wa
a
barrel
on
june
a
premium
of
a
barrel
or
percent
to
wti
futur
on
the
new

mercantil
exchang
that
mean
an
asian
buyer
of

is

quit
a
signific
premium
over
the
price
of

in

the

ha
risen
sharpli
in

week
given
that
it
wa
closer
to

at

of

further
out
along

also
show
a

houston
wti
be
a

more
expens
than
the
equival
futur
contract
as
at
the
end
of

while
physic
wti
crude
is
current
at
a
strong
premium
to

the
opposit
is
the
case
when
compar
paper

put
the
number
togeth
show
that
an

light
sweet
crude
could
have
on
june
bought
a
cargo
from
angola
at
just
cent
a
barrel
more
than
one
from
houston
thi
small
advantag
in
favour
of
wti
from

would
more
than
like
be
eaten
up
by
the
increas
in

that

onc
you

while

may

such
a

the

of

suggest
that

may
struggl
to
be
competit
in
the
second
half
of

one
side
issu
worth

the
potenti

concern

an

it
