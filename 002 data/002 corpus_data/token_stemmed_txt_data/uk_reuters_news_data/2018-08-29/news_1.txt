the

tend
to
be
rural

urban
area
where
there
is
a
higher
level
of
access

one
of
the
thing
you
see
with

that
peopl

more
like
to
stay
where
they
after
tanzania
nigeria
is
the
african
countri
that
is
farthest
along
in

minigrid
becaus
the
govern
ha
taken
an
activ
interest
robert
said
but
challeng
remain
primarili
the
lack
of
financ

nervous
of
