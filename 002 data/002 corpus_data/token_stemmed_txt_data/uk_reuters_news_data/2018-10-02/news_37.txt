today
sound
remark
similar
to
the
coal
industri
of
a
decad
ago
in
the
recoveri
from
the
global
recess
the
coal

found
itself
in
the
happi
place
of
be
in
strong

to

robust
econom
growth
in

the

the

at

event
at
the
time
wa
the
outlook
is
bright
becaus
coal
is
cheap

that

rapidli
move
from

thi
optim
manifest
itself
in
some
extrem
bullish
forecast
which
seem
ridicul
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
among
those
wa
a
forecast
that
china
s
coal
import
would
rise
to
billion
tonn
a
year
when
they
in
realiti
peak
at
million
tonn
in
thi
rosi
outlook
for
coal
led
the
industri
to
invest
heavili
in
mine
to
boost
the
avail
of
seaborn
suppli
which
in
turn
led
to
five
consecut
year
of
declin

as

overwhelm
demand
but
that
wasn
t
the
real
problem
for
the
coal
industri
what
is
caus
them
more
problem
now
is
the
fact
that
they
didn
t
see
either
renew
and
natur
ga
in
their
rearview
mirror
a
decad
ago
coal
industri
execut
dismiss
both
renew
and
natur

as
too
expens
and
in
the
case
of

too
unreli
what
they
didn

be
a
case
in

natur

wa
also
happi
to
sink
the
knife
into

especi
in
the

with
the
rise
of

ga
the
natur

could
simultan
claim
a

in

as

the

the

major

the

for

is
that
it

how

much
of

that

it
