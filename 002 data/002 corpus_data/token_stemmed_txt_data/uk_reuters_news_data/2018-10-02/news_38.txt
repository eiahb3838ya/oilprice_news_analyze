ha
long
monitor
it
forest
and
the
carbon
they
hold
but
it
hope
to
soon
have
a
cheaper
and
more
effect
way
to
do
it
by
drone
deep

a
project
back
by

group
fundecor
manufactur
intel
and
san
aerial
robotix
aim
to
give
scientist
a
better
idea
of
what
is
happen
in
the
countri
s
forest
canopi
and
allow
more
frequent
monitor
there
are
mani
way
of
take
these
metric
but
none
with
thi
level
of
resolut
said

the
advantag
is
the
precis
in
a
scheme
that
is
carazo
said
at
a
congress
of
sustain
ecolog
and
evolut
in
san

the
project
will
use
a
drone
to
fli
over
remot
area
of
forest
use
a
laser
to
scan
the
forest
the
effort
still
in
an
experiment
phase
will
scan
three

near
the
costa

citi
of
guapil
thi
year
said
it
backer
who
are
financi
support
the
test
they
say
the
method
could
scale
up
to
help
mani
countri
monitor
their
forest
more
accur
a
step
both
toward
reduc
emiss
from

loss
and
tap
into

it
could
help

to
fulfil
the
commit
we
sign
in

the

is
not
the
first
to
use

the

a

satellit

also
will
track

the

simpli
reinforc
monitor
of

that
ha
gone
on
for
more
than
year
in

in
the
end
the
import
thing
in
a
countri
like
our
is
to
guarante
the

costa

is
the

to

it
rate
of

the
area
of

s
decad
of

make
it
easier
to
develop

to
analys
drone
footag
and
judg
what
is
chang
in
the
forest
carazo
said
but
make
the
drone
scan
technolog
work
ha
been
anyth
but
simpl
project
backer
said
not
least
becaus
the
drone
need
to
captur
and
store
larg
amount
of
data
as
it
fli
simpli
fli
the
devic
at
first
took
a
big
share
of
avail
processor
time
and
when
the
processor
wa
overwhelm
the
drone
fell
scott
said
the
pilot
could
not
control
intel
then
set
about
increas
the
capac
of
the
processor
so
that
the
pilot
could
both
control
the
drone
and
at
the
same
time
scan
the
forest
the
drone
use
in
the
project
also
will
use
a
laser
call
lidar
hd
to
analys
an
area
of
forest
that
until
now
wa
difficult
for
research
to
access
treetop
the
lidar
hd
system
ha
previous
been
use
from
airplan
or
helicopt
both
expens
way
to
gather
data
carazo
said
put
the
technolog
on
a
drone
can
help
make
the
process
cheaper
and
more
frequent
he
said
we
have
been
monitor
forest
for
more
than

quesada
said
the

will
be
