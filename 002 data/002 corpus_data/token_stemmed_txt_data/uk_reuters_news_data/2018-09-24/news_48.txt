somebodi
is
go
to
be
wrong
on
the
outlook
for
the
crude
oil
price
as
the
market
can
not
be
and
increasingli
tight
at
the
same
time
the
messag
from
saudi
arabia
the
biggest
produc
in
the
organ
of
the
petroleum
export
countri
opec
and
it
alli
russia
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
extra
crude
in
the
market
howev
the
word
from
trader
and
refin
at
the
industri
s
annual
gather
in
singapor
thi
week
is
that
the
market
start
to
look
short
of
necessari
barrel
and
price
are
like
to
head
higher
certainli
the
recent
rise
in
price
for
oil
benchmark
such
as
brent
seem
to
support
the
view
that
the
market
is
tighten
brent
trade
as
high
as
a
barrel
in
asia
on
monday
within
spit
distanc
of
the
intraday
peak
for
the
year
on
may
and
if
it
close
abov
it
will
the
first
time
thi
ha
happen
sinc
novemb
but
the
rise
in
price
doesn
t
seem
to
be
an
issu
for
saudi
arabia
with
energi
minist
khalid
say
after
a
meet
of
opec
and
it
alli
in
algier
at
the
weekend
that
there
wa
no
plan
to
boost
output
even
though
they
could
if
need
the
market
are
adequ
suppli
i
don
t
know
of
ani
refin
in
the
world
who
is
look
for
oil
and
is
not
abl
to
get
it
falih
told
report
after
the
meet
while
refin
may
be
abl
to
get
crude
oil
they
are
have
to
pay
more
for
it
and
deal
with
mount
disrupt
to
normal
suppli
chain
the
decis
to
sanction
on
iran
is
alreadi
forc
refin
to
look
elsewher
for
suppli
of
the
heavi
sour
crude
suppli
by
the
islam
republ
the
situat
may
worsen
in
the
month
follow
novemb
when
the
administr
of
presid
donald
trump
impos
sanction
on
all
iranian
export
while
iran
is
unlik
to
see
a
drop
to
zero
export
initi
assess
by
sever
analyst
that
about
barrel
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
oil
would
be
lost
appear
way
too
optimist
now
it
s
possibl
that
iranian
export
may
drop
by
more
than
million
bpd
and
possibl
even
as
high
as
million
bpd
as
major
custom
with
the
possibl
except
of
china
switch
to
altern
add
to
thi
the
loss
of
venezuelan
oil
becaus
of
mount
econom
and
polit
problem
and
ongo
disrupt
in
libya
and
suddenli
the
market
doesn
t
look
that
ani
more
a
further
complic
factor
is
the
trade
disput
with
china
which
is
like
to
result
in
chines
refin
buy
less
crude
from
the
unit
state
disrupt
what
had
becom
a
signific
trade
flow
while
it
s
possibl
that
refin
around
the
world
will
be
abl
to
juggl
their
suppli
to
work
around
the
disrupt
thi
is
like
to
come
at
a
cost
as
alway
quantifi
that
cost
is
difficult
but
the
of
oil
trade
at
trafigura
ben
luckock
on
monday
told
the
asia
pacif
petroleum
confer
host
by
s
p
global
platt
that
a
price
of
a
barrel
by
christma
and
by
new
year
wa
possibl
crude
oil
price
curv
are
current
in
backward
with
contract
more
expens
that
futur
backward
is
normal
a
sign
of
a
tight
market
as
trader
and
consum
are
prepar
to
pay
more
in
order
to
assur
suppli
in
the
near
term
but
if
price
realli
are
expect
to
rise
sharpli
in
the
come
month
on
the
back
of
the
sanction
against
iran
it
may
make
sens
to
buy
oil
at
the
current
price
look
at
price
that
more
close
track
iranian
crude
such
as
oman
futur
on
the
dubai
mercantil
exchang
and
physic
dubai
swap
and
some
interest
trend
emerg
the
oman
forward
curv
ha
seen
backward
steepen
in
the
past
month
with
the
contract
now
at
a
premium
of
to
the
futur
up
from
a
month
ago
howev
compar
the
paper
oman
contract
to
physic
dubai
show
that
the
forward
curv
for
the
physic
market
is
not
as
steepli
backward
current
dubai
swap
for
novemb
are
at
a
barrel
a
premium
of
to
the
april
contract
what
may
be
happen
is
that
physic
oil
consum
such
as
refin
are
lock
in
suppli
further
along
the
curv
in
anticip
of

rise
while
the
of

market
are
be
driven
higher
by
investor
flow
seek
to
take
advantag
of
increas
media
coverag
of
a
tighter
market
but
onc
the
sanction
on
iran
take
full
effect
it
will
becom
clearer
whether
the
saudi
are
correct
that
the
market
is
or
whether
the
trader
have
pick
a
