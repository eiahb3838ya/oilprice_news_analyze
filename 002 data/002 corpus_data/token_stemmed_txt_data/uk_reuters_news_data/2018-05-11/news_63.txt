he
told
the

foundat
in
part
becaus
peopl
do
not
know
about
the
technolog
but
there
are
other
reason
vasquez
said
it
is
costli
to
set
up
and
there
is
not
enough
clariti
about
the
law
cover
rainwat
harvest
both
factor
lower
the
econom
incent
for
farmer
to
invest
a
system
like
the
one
roja
instal
cost
about
a
sum
that
in
practic
is
unafford
for
farmer
like
him
it
consist
of
a
network
of
gutter
that
captur
rain
from
the
roof
of
hi
barn
and
direct
it
to
the
tank
from
there
a

distribut
it

an

diego
falla
said
it
is
hard
for
farmer
to
get
financ
for
green
solut
like
rainwat
harvest
as
the
exist
of
such
system
is
larg
unknown
access
to
green
financ
is
import
for
exampl
these
are
action
that
adapt
produc
to
climat
chang
and
green
financ
should
make
thi
type
of
technolog
more
access
to
produc
falla
said
the
fao
want
to
encourag
more
farmer
in
the
guanacast
region
to
consid
rainwat
harvest
said
octavio
ramirez
fao
countri
head
dure
the
ceremoni
at
roja
farm
do
so
would
help
farmer
deal
with
the
effect
of
climat
chang
said
falla
by
creat
a
water
reserv
to
suppli
their
farm
s
need
dure
drought
the
fao
focus
on
guanacast
becaus
it
lie
in
central
america
s
dri
corridor
one
of
the
region
whose
agricultur
the
agenc
regard
as
be
more
vulner
to
rise
temperatur
the
area
is
also
expos
to
extrem
event
such
as
el
nino
said
hydrologist
alejandra
roja
who
is
not

the
last
el

central
region
in
caus
loss
of
more
than
billion
costa
rican
colon
million
to

show
so
while
rainwat
harvest
will
help
farmer
deal
with
the
effect
of
climat
chang
and
lower
the
stress
on
aquif
it
will
take
much
more
than
that
to
minimis
the
effect
of
extrem
weather
event
she
said
what
happen
a
lot
of
the
time
is
that
the
system
goe
into
a
hydrolog
drought
in
other
word
there
is
a
decreas
in
all
water
sourc

s
control
fix
regul
around
rainwat
harvest
is
not
both
the
ministri
s
vasquez
and

from
the

a
lack
of
clear

is
hold
back
the
spread
of
rainwat
harvest
regul
about
water
use
have
long
been
complex
in
costa
rica

for
instanc
must
get
permit
if
they
want
to
use
rainwat
onc
it
ha
land
on
the
countri
s
soil
and
until
last
year
they
also
need
a
permit
to
captur
rainwat
from

that
chang
after
an
execut
order

said
falla
water

explain
that
remain
true
for
now
howev
as
the
execut

expir
next

it
is
unclear
what
will
happen
then
the
complic
do
not
end
there
regul

also
complex
falla
said
as
they
involv
strict
