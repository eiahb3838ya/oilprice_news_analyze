they
are
relat
to
the
pragmat
nation

of

when
in
i

i
spoke
about
the
fact

our

i
hope

think
it
would
have
veri
seriou
consequ
for
the
ukrainian
govern
in

pressur
on
russian
businessmen
in
britain
and
elsewher
with

a
few
year
ago
at
one
of
the
public
meet
with

busi
leader
i
warn
them
that
thi
situat
which
we
see
today
could
develop
i
warn
them
about
thi
and
recommend
at
the
time
that
our
busi
keep

capit
in
who
is
go
to
help
them
abroad
they
are
just
persecut
there
condit
are
creat

thi
is
a
big
mistak
by
those
who
are
do
thi
in
the
in
essenc
they
are
saw
the
branch
on
which
they
are
sit
thi
is
counterproduct
and
damag
for
those
involv
and
for
the
global
some
say
we
need
to
help
billionair
roman
abramovich
and
other
russian
businessmen
who
have
end
up
in
a
difficult
i
wouldn
t
want
to
speak
right
now
about
those
peopl
who
have
broken
variou
law
i
am
speak
about
peopl
who
acquir
their
capit
through
legal
mean
the
former
and
the
latter
are
better
off
be
in
firstli
the
use
of
our
arm
forc
in
the
battlefield
is
a
uniqu
experi
a
uniqu
tool
by
which
to
improv
our
arm
forc
no
amount
of
militari
exercis
could
compar
with
the
use
of
forc
in
combat
major
militari
oper
particularli
involv
russian
arm
forc
have
end
there
isn
t
even
a
need
for
them
our
soldier
are
there
in
syria
in
order
to
secur
russia
s
interest
in
thi
critic
import
part
of
the
world
which
is
so
near
to
us
and
they
will
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
is
in
russia
s
interest
for
them
to
do
as
yet
we
do
not
plan
to
withdraw
these
forc
but
i
direct
your
attent
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
call
these
base
by
ani
other
name
i
call
them
base
we
are
not
build
militari
structur
there
and
if
we
need
to
we
could
withdraw
our
militari
personnel
veri
quickli
without
incur
ani
financi
obvious
i
m
alway
think
about
it
a
successor
in
the
ordinari
sens
of
the
word
no
the
russian
peopl
the
voter
will
decid
who
that
will
be
but
of
cours
i
think
that
we
should
rais
a
new
young
gener
of
leader
respons
peopl
who
will
be
abl
to
take
on
the
respons
of
with
regard
to
the
infrastructur
these
stadium
of
cours
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
thi
and
it
is
imper
that
all
of
thi
infrastructur
i
complet
agre
it
must
work
and
abov
all
work
toward
the
develop
of
sport
on
a
larg
i
would
like
right
now
to
address
my
colleagu
in
the
region
to
ask
them
to
not
allow
under
ani
circumst
for
flea
market
and
the
like
to
appear
at
these
stadium
as
appear
in
other
build
in
moscow
dure
the
middl
of
the
i
think
our
russian
footbal
union
must
play
an
activ
part
in
and
develop
a
new
gener
of
sportsmen
and
soccer
overal
we
are
move
in
the
right
direct
we
have
start
on
the
trajectori
toward
robust
econom
growth
in
russia
ye
thi
growth
is
humbl
small
but
it
is
also
not
a
fall
growth
wa
at
percent
last
export
in
technic
equip
is
grow
which
show
that
some
structur
chang
are
go
on
in
the
economi
export
of
agricultur
produc
at

last
year
wa
higher
than

which
were
at
base
on
our
preliminari
calcul
we
may
in
the
next
six
year
spend
trillion
roubl
putin
said
billion
but
meant
trillion
but
to
achiev
the
goal
that
we
have
discuss
we
will
need
an
addit
trillion
roubl
and
it
is
clear
where
we
are
go
to
find
firstli
it
is
through
the
growth
of
the
economi
itself
that
s
the
main
sourc
of
addit
resourc
it
is
also
the
more

for
the

what
is
go
on
right
now
it
is
unaccept
it
is
wrong
howev
it
must
be
admit
that
it
is
the
result
of
inaccur
regul
that
wa
brought
in
recent
in
the
sphere
of
energi
in

by
the
autumn
of
thi
year
addit
measur
should
be
introduc
which
will
stabilis
the
situat

said
he
would
support
a
propos
to
rais
export
tariff
on
motor
fuel
equalis
them
with
tariff
on
oil
export
thi
is
a
method
by
which
to
restrain
russia
the
notori
sanction
becaus
endless
accus
lay
the
groundwork
for
introduc
restrain
it
is
becaus
russia
is
seen
as
a
threat
becaus
russia
is
seen
as
becom
a
competitor
i
believ
thi
approach
is
it
is
clear
to
us
that
we
have
to
defend
our
interest
and
to
do
so
consist
not
boorishli
or
rude
in
both
the
sphere
of

we
are
not

also
work

know
it

harder
to
