the

after

from

up

while

south

brought

put

these
four
countri
import
million
tonn
more
coal
from
the
seaborn
market
in
the
first
five
month
of
the
year
thi
ha
had
the
effect
of
tighten
the
market
given
the
lack
of
new
suppli
to
meet
the
demand
in
fact
export
from
the
top
three
shipper
to
asia
have
been
remark
flat
in
the
period
accord
to
the
data
australia
ship
million
tonn
in
the
first
five
month
up
slightli
from
the
million
in
the
same
period
in
indonesia
manag
million
tonn
up
from
million
while
south
africa
wa
steadi
at
million
thi
mean
that
the
increas
in
import
demand
isn
t
realli
be
met
by
the
tradit
export
powerhous
allow
countri
such
as
the
unit
state
and
russia
to
plug
the
gap
the
unit
state
ship
million
tonn
of
coal
in
the
first
five
month
of
with
million
tonn
head
to
asia
thi
is
up
percent
from
the
million
tonn
it
ship
in
the
same
period
in
of
which
million
went
to
asia
it
s
a
similar
stori
for
russia
with
total
shipment
up
percent
or
million
tonn
to
million
tonn
of
which
million
tonn
went
to
asia
a
gain
of
percent
what
the
number
show
is
that
even
though
price
are
high
and
rise
the
tradit
major
export
are
struggl
to
boost
shipment
in
australia
thi
is
most
like
becaus
of
an
inabl
to
boost
product
quickli
enough
in
indonesia
it
s
larg
becaus
the
govern
is
mandat
that
more
coal
be
suppli
to
the
domest
market
and
in
south
africa
there
are
infrastructur
constraint
mainli
on
the
rail
system
the
number
also
show
that
current
the
price
of
coal
is
high
enough
to
make
cargo
competit
in
asia
despit
the
greater
cost
of
freight
the
bulk
of
coal
export
to
asia
is
coke
coal
use
to
make
steel
but
with
the
thermal
price
abov
a
tonn
it
s
like
that
more
of
the
fuel
will
head
east
especi
to
buyer
in
south
asia
