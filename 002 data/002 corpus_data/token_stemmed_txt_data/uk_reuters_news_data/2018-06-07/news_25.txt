what

am
refer
for

to
the
creation
in

in

and
the
creation
of
such
a
control
stake
in
lead
oil
compani
nationalis
the
whole
oil

would
be
a
difficult
and
highli
danger
process
which
could
have
neg
consequ
not
onli
for
the
sector
but
for
the
whole
we
must
make
sure
that
no
matter
who
these
busi
belong
to
they
work
within
the
boundari
of
the
law
that
they
invest
in

extract
and
process
on

that
they
fulfil
their
duti
befor
the

and
make
their
busi
effect
busi
which
can
compet
on

and
in

our
oil

are
achiev
there

i
have
alreadi
mention
two
piec
of
hardwar

in
both
case
we
have
complet
the
main
develop
phase
in

everyth
to
do
with

the
but
thi
is
not
all
we
plan
to
produc
and
put
into
servic
it
s
too
earli
to
talk
about
it
but
we
will
do
so
firstli
the
use
of
our
arm
forc
in
the
battlefield
is
a
uniqu
experi
a
uniqu
tool
by
which
to
improv
our
arm
forc
no
amount
of
militari
exercis
could
compar
with
the
use
of
forc
in
combat
ye
we
know
that
the
use
of
forc
in
battlefield
condit
is
also
associ
with
loss
of
but
thi
wa
an
import
a
nobl
mission
aim
at
protect
the
interest
of
the
russian
feder
and
it
let
me
remind
you
that
thousand
of
milit
left
russia
and
the
countri
of
central
asia
with
whom
we
do
not
have
hard
border
and
gather
on
syrian
soil
it
wa
better
to
deal
with
them
there
to
get
to
work
there
so
to
speak
and
liquid
them
there
than
let
them
come
back
here
weapon
in
major
militari
oper
particularli
involv
russian
arm
forc
have
end
there
isn
t
even
a
need
for
them
our
soldier
are
there
in
syria
in
order
to
secur
russia
s
interest
in
thi
critic
import
part
of
the
world
which
is
so
near
to
us
and
they
will
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
is
in
russia
s
interest
for
them
to
do
as
yet
we
do
not
plan
to
withdraw
these
forc
but
i
direct
your
attent
to
the
fact
that
i
did
not
call
these
base
by
ani
other
name
i
call
them
base
we
are
not
build
militari
structur
there
and
if
we
need
to
we
could
withdraw
our
militari
personnel
veri
quickli
without
incur
ani
financi
russia
by
definit
can
not
have
it
own
crypto
currenc
just
as
no
other
countri
can
have
it
own
crypto
currenc
becaus
when
we
talk
about
crypto
currenc
we
refer
to
someth
that
goe
beyond
nation
secondli
crypto
currenc
mine
is
not
subject
to
regul
here
and
we
by
and
larg
treat
it
with
a
lot
of
caution
in
most
countri
crypto
currenc
are
not
use
as
a
mean
of
the
russian
central
bank
believ
that
crypto
currenc
can
t
be
a
method
of
payment
or
exchang
or
be
use
for
save
and
they
these
crypto
currenc
they
are
not
back
by
howev
thi
phenomenon
ha
it
place
in
the
world
and
it
s
develop
we
need
to
monitor
and
analys
what
s
go
on
thoroughli
and
at
some
stage
we
will
need
to
look
at
how
we
can
take
part
in
thi
process
how
we
can
use
it
to
avoid
all
sort
of
restrict
in
the
sphere
of
intern

among

are
turn

the

about

is
work
on
overal
we
are
move
in
the
right
direct
what
is
the
basi
for
say
thi
we
have
start
on
the
trajectori
toward
robust
econom

in
russia
ye
thi
growth
is
humbl
small
but
it
is
also
not
a
fall
growth
wa
at
percent
last
not
everyon
feel
thi

but
overal
thi
is
an
object
statist
that
s
how
it
is
it
is
the
truth
export

which
show
that
some

go
on
in
the
economi
export
of

last
year
wa
higher

which
were
at

on
our
preliminari
calcul
we
may
in
the
next
six
year
spend
trillion
roubl
putin
said
billion
but
meant
trillion
but
to
achiev
the
goal
that
we
have
discuss
we
will
need
an
addit
trillion
roubl
and
it
is
clear
where
we
are
go
to
find
firstli
it
is
through
the
growth
of
the
economi
itself
that
s
the
main
sourc
of
addit
resourc
it
is
also
the
more
effect
use
of
exist

in
some
sens
of
our

and
of
cours
adjust

our

stabil
of
tax
polici
must
be
absolut
guarante
for
the
next
six
mani
suggest
chang
the
person
incom

we
thought
about
thi
for
a
long
time
at
first
glanc
progress
person
incom
tax
seem
and
look
to
be
but
realiti
is
more
complic
than
theori
and
we
had
such
a
tax
a
tax
on
revenu
thi
is
a
seriou
strain
on
the
economi
overal
and
in
the
end
on
citizen
becaus
it
inevit
lead
to
a
rise
in
inflat
all
thi
convinc
us
that
introduc
thi
wa
also
not
the
thing
is
the
develop
plan
which
we
have
been
discuss
in
recent
year
it
wa
be
prepar
by
the
previou
govern
dure
at
least
the
past
one
and
a
half
year
i
know
full
well
that
if
we
were
to
replac
the
entir
govern
percent
and
bring
in
total
new
we
would
have
lost
at
least
two
year
and
we
do
not
have
those
two
but
it
wa
also
necessari
to
keep
those
who
made
the
decis
for
our
countri
s
progress
and
to
person
respons
for
what
ha
been
done
so
far
and
for
what
is
come
up
i
think
that
we
have
an
optim
make
up
of
govern
for
what
is
go
on
right
now
it
is
unaccept
it
is
wrong
howev
it
must
be
admit
that
it
is
the
result
of
inaccur
regul
that
wa
brought
in
recent
in
the
sphere
of
energi
in
energi
by
the
autumn
of
thi
year
addit
measur
should
be
introduc
which
will
stabil
the
situat
on
the
market
i
am
base
thi
on
the
fact
that
the
govern
will
be
monitor
thi
agreement
have
been
reach
at
the
govern
level
with
all
compani
to
increas
the
product
of
oil
product
and
on
deliveri
to
the
domest
market
to
not
permit
a
addit
we
have
work
out
a
seri
of
measur
aim
at
stabil
i
am
refer
to
the
possibl
of
introduc
export
tariff
by
the
russian
govern
on
deliveri
of
oil
product
for
export
a
law
ha
been
prepar
on
thi
and
we
will
be
readi
to
present
it
to
parliament
in
the
near
futur
and
will
ask
parliament
to
support
we
are
introduc
the
possibl
for
govern
to
rais
export
tariff
on
motor
fuel
and
to
make
it
equal
to
tariff
on
oil
export
we
realli
hope
we
will
now
have
to
put
it
to
putin
respons
i
will
support
with
regard
to
the
infrastructur
these
stadium
of
cours
we
spent
a
lot
of
money
on
thi
and
it
is
imper
that
all
of
thi
infrastructur
i
complet
agre
it
must
work
and
abov
all
work
toward
the
develop
of
sport
on
a
larg
scale
includ
children
s
i
would
like
right
now
to
address
my
colleagu
in
the
region
to
ask
them
to
not
allow
under
ani
circumst
for
flea
market
and
the
like
to
appear
at
these
stadium
as
appear
in
other
build
in
moscow
dure
the
middl
of
the
i
think
our
russian
footbal
union
must
play
an
activ
part
in
and
develop
a
new
gener
of
sportsmen
and
soccer
even
though
our
nation
team
ha
not
demonstr
strong
result
recent
but
the
number
of
fan
of
thi
beauti
sport
here
is
massiv
it
s
in
the
million
we
will
reli
on
the
fact
that
our
soccer
team
will
score
a
big
win
so
to
speak
and
will
show
it
best
thi
is
a
method
by
which
to
restrain
russia
the
notori
sanction
becaus
endless
accus
lay
the
groundwork
for
introduc
restrain
it
is
becaus
russia
is
seen
as
a
threat
becaus
russia
is
seen
as
becom
a
competitor
i
believ
thi
approach
is
mistaken
instead
of
restrain
whoever
it
would
be
better
to
establish
construct
cooper
and
then
the
overal
effect
on
the
global
economi
would
be
it
is
clear
to
us
that
we
have
to
defend
our
interest
and
to
do
so
consist
not
boorishli
or
rude
in
both
the
sphere
of
the
economi
and
of
defenc
we
have
done
so
and
we
will
continu
to
do
so
but
we
alway
look
for
compromis
we
aspir
toward
those
compromis
the
pressur
will
end
when
our
partner
will
be
persuad
that
the
method
they
are
use
are
ineffect
counterproduct
and
harm
to
the
understand
that
a
third
world
war
could
be
the
end
of
civilis
should
restrain
us
from
take
extrem
step
on
the
intern
arena
that
are
highli
danger
for
modern
the
threat
of
mutual
destruct
ha
alway
restrain
particip
of
the
intern
arena
prevent
lead
militari
power
from
make
hasti
move
and
compel
particip
to
respect
each
other
withdraw
from
treati
on
missil
is
an
attempt
to
put
an
end
to
strateg
pariti
but
we
will
respond
to
we
believ
that
the
unilater
introduct
of
all
kind
of
sanction
doe
not
resolv
problem
it
onli
worsen
when
it
come
to
the
posit
of
our
compatriot
in
the
countri
of
the
baltic
we
are
constantli
talk
about
thi
bring
it
to
the
attent
of
the
govern
of
the
baltic
state
includ
the
measur
that
we
take
to
protect
the
interest
of
our
compatriot
must
be
such
that
they
do
not
actual
worsen
their
thi
is
an
import
part
of
the
negoti
process
with
the
leader
of
franc
germani
also
with
our
austrian
friend
where
i
wa
visit
just
now
and
with
the
repres
of
mani
other
european
countri
let
alon
asia
they
don
t
just
say
thi
privat
now
they
are
talk
about
thi
it
appear
our
partner
thought
that
thi
would
never
affect
them
thi
counterproduct
polit
of
restrict
and
sanction
but
now
we
are
see
that
thi
is
the
introduct
for
exampl
of
restrict
tariff
on
steel
on
aluminium
not
onli
for
europ
but
also
for
canada
and
mexico
in
essenc
these
are
also
they
are
relat
to
the
pragmat
nation
interest
of
the
unit
we
need
to
work
out
unit
and
consist
understand
and
concret
rule
on
how
to
behav
in
the
realm
of
secur
and
in
the
realm
of
econom
when
in
i
spoke
in
munich
a
speech
that
is
frequent
quot
i
spoke
about
the
fact
that
the
unit
state
is

the
jurisdict
of
it
law
beyond
it
nation
border
and
that
thi
is
unaccept
and
that
s
exactli
what
s
happen
now
also
to
our
european
and
other
partner
whi
is
thi
happen
no
one
want
to
listen
and
no
one
did
anyth
to
stop
thi
from
if
as
britain
insist
a
militari
chemic
agent
wa
use
against
these
peopl
they
would
have
die
within
second
or
minut
on
the
spot
thank
god
thi
did
not
happen
clearli
we
are
deal
with
someth
other
than
a
militari
we
would
like
to
be
given
access
to
our
citizen
to
yulia
and
we
would
like
to
have
the
opportun
to
take
part
fulli
in

i
spoke
about
thi
a
few
year
ago
at
one
of
the
public
meet
with
our
busi
leader
it
sound
a
bit
rude
i
warn
them
that
thi
situat
which
we
see
today
could
develop
i
warn
them
about
thi
and
recommend
at
the
time
that
our
busi
keep
it
capit
in
russia
in
the
motherland
to
keep
capit
in
the
place
where
it
wa
earn
and
to
use
it
to
develop
the
russian
who
is
go
to
help
them
abroad
they
are
just
persecut
there
condit
are
creat
make
their
work
imposs
thi
is
a
big
mistak
by
those
who
are
do
thi
in
the
west
all
these
restrict
all
thi
persecut
of
our
busi
their
difficulti
with

transact

damag
the

from

and
damag
for

some
say
we
need
to
help
abramovich
and
other
russian
