washington
reuter
scientist
have
discov
the
most
distant
object
known
in
our
solar
system
so
remot
and
unusu
they
chose
the
nicknam
farout
for
the
ici
pinkish
dwarf
planet
about
to
time
further
from
the
sun
than
earth
astronom
scott
sheppard
of
the
carnegi
institut
for
scienc
in
washington
said
on
tuesday
the
dwarf
planet
offici
design
as
is
estim
to
have
a
diamet
of
to
mile
to
km
there
are
roughli
dwarf
planet
in
the
solar
system
the
biggest
are
pluto
with
a
diamet
of
about
mile
km
and
eri
with
a
diamet
of
about
mile
km
when
i
saw
the
object
for
the
first
time
it
wa
move
so
slowli
it
wa
the
slowest
thing
i
ve
ever
seen
so
i
kind
of
mutter
to
myself
far
out
kind
of
like
that
s
but
it
s
also
a
object
in
distanc
so
that
s
whi
i
went
with
call
it
farout
sheppard
said
it
discoveri
wa
announc
on
monday
by
the
intern
astronom
union
s
minor
planet
center
we
don
t
know
too
much
about
it
sheppard
ad
we
onli
detect
it
last
month
from
it
bright
we
can
determin
it
size
we
know
it
color
it
ha
a
pinkish
reddish
hue
to
it
if
you
put
ice
out
there
and
you
irradi
them
from
the
solar
radiat
over
time
ice
turn
kind
of
a
reddish
pinkish
color
so
we
think
it
surfac
is
probabl
sheppard

their
search
for
extrem

propos
the
exist
of
a
ninth
major

at
the
outer
reach
of
the
solar

they
said
farout
is
move
so
slowli
that
it
might
need
more
than
year
for
a
singl
orbit
of
the

the

is
eri
which
orbit
at
about
time
the
distanc
of
the
sun
to
the
earth
pluto
orbit
at
