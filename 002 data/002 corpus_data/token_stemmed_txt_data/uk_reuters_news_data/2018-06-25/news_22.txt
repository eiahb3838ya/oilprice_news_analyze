if
it
were
possibl
to
boil
the
crude
oil
market
down
to
just
one
determin
factor
for
the
come
month
it
would
be
thi
what
will
saudi
arabia
actual
do
the
saudi
appear
to
have
emerg
as
the
winner
from
last
week
s
meet
of
the
organ
of
the
petroleum
export
countri
opec
and
the
subsequ
talk
between
opec
and
it
alli
in
the
deal
to
restrict
output
the
outcom
of
the
meet
would
seem
to
indic
that
crude
oil
suppli
should
rise
by
as
much
as
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
that
s
base
on
the
assumpt
that
opec
and
alli
will
return
to
percent
complianc
with
the
novemb
cut
of
million
bpd
from
a
current
situat
of
howev
the
realiti
on
the
ground
is
that
mani
opec
countri
lack
the
abil
to
pump
their
full
quota
saudi
arabia
is
the
onli
produc
that
can
ramp
out
output
significantli
within
a
short
period
of
time
the
market
consensu
after
the
opec
meet
in
vienna
on
june
and
the
talk
with
alli
the
follow
day
wa
that
the
agreement
reach
wouldn
t
actual
result
in
an
extra
million
bpd
reach
global
market
while
there
is
some
debat
on
the
like
increas
in
suppli
the
upper
end
of
the
rang
is
around
bpd
the
question
is
whether
thi
would
be
enough
to
prevent
price
from
ralli
again
given
that
the
saudi
arabia
the
world
s
largest
crude
export
is
go
to
have
to
provid
the
lion
s
share
of
ani
increas
in
output
watch
it
export
number
and
price
signal
in
the
come
month
will
be
key
in
fact
the
saudi
alreadi
are
suppli
more
crude
accord
to
and
port
data
compil
by
thomson
reuter
oil
research
and
forecast
saudi
seaborn
crude
export
were
million
bpd
in
may
the
most
in
a
year
the
data
show
prior
to
the
novemb
agreement
saudi
arabia
wa
regularli
export
more
than
million
bpd
but
it
s
also
worth
note
that
onli
in
two
month
januari
and
februari
in
did
the
kingdom
ship
more
than
million
bpd
what
thi
show
is
that
the
saudi
definit
have
the
scope
to
export
more
crude
but
boost
output
abov
million
bpd
on
a
sustain
basi
isn
t
someth
they
have
done
in
recent
year
the
saudi
are
on
track
to
export
more
than
million
bpd
in
june
with
thomson
reuter
data
estim
seaborn
shipment
of
million
bpd
but
it
s
interest
to
note
that
the
saudi
have
been
somewhat
vagu
when
it
come
to
say
exactli
how
much
more
they
will
produc
saudi
energi
minist
khalid
said
after
last
week
s
meet
that
the
kingdom
s
oil
compani
will
increas
output
by
hundr
of
thousand
of
barrel
with
precis
figur
to
be
decid
later
there
is
also
some
confus
over
whether
saudi
arabia
will
be
permit
in
term
of
the
agreement
to
it
quota
to
make
up
for
shortfal
from
other
member
such
as
venezuela
and
libya
current
unabl
to
pump
more
iranian
oil
minist
bijan
zanganeh
said
saudi
arabia
wouldn
t
be
allow
to
pump
more
on
behalf
of
venezuela
mean
the
kingdom
can
increas
it
product
by
less
than
bpd
with
no
certainti
on
exactli
who
can
produc
what
it
becom
more
import
than
ever
to
monitor
crude
oil
flow
in
come
month
and
perhap
less
import
to
hang
on
everi
word
utter
by
the
variou
parti
to
the
agreement
anoth
factor
often
bypass
in
the
discuss
is
export
of
refin
fuel
saudi
arabia
s
export
of
gasolin
were
around
bpd
in
the
first
four
month
of
thi
year
accord
to
the
joint
organis
data
initi
jodi
that
s
up
by
around
bpd
from
last
year
s
averag
saudi
shipment
of
gasoil
averag
just
under
bpd
in
the
januari
to
april
period
about
bpd
more
than
for
for
all
oil
product
the
jodi
data
show
that
saudi
arabia
s
export
averag
million
bpd
in
the
first
four
month
of
up
percent
from
the
million
bpd
record
in
the
same
period
last
year
what
thi
show
is
that
saudi
arabia
is
alreadi
boost
export
to
global
market
but
in
the
form
of
refin
product
rather
than
crude
that
bring
us
back
to
the
burn
question
for
oil
market
how
much
more
can
or
will
the
saudi
add
to
the
global
suppli
of
both
crude
and
refin
product
there
is
certainli
a
risk
in
reli
on
the
kingdom
to
virtual
balanc
suppli
and
demand
therebi
keep
price
in
the
sweet
spot
of
around
a
barrel
which
seem
to
be
high
enough
to
prevent
fiscal
problem
in
most
produc
but
low
enough
to
prevent
demand
