is
mainli
becaus

is
the

and
the

it
struggl
to
make

citi
with
much
less

constraint
than
the

underscor
the
magnitud
of

a
shortag

the

leas
to

but
mani
complain
that
the

is
too
high
and
they
need

given
they
wast

one
of

that
after

and
shell
out

for

he
is
left
with
about

these
car
said
the
driver
who
had
just
spent
an
hour
wait
for
hi
turn
to
charg
the
car
and
would
have
to
wait
for
anoth
minut
while
it
charg
ola
founder

ceo
bhavish
aggarw
told
reuter
last
april
that
the
compani
would
pilot
a
few
thousand
electr
vehicl
in
sever
indian
citi
in
and
then
scale
up
in
a
major
way
howev
almost
a
year
later
it
ha
still
to
take
the
experi
beyond
nagpur
at
india
s
biennial
auto
show
in
februari
electr
car
took
centr
stage
but
most
were
at
a
concept
stage
or
sold
onli
in
global
market
as
automak
like
toyota
honda
and
renault
took
a
circumspect
approach
to
the
new
tilt
toward
electrif
onc
we
make
an
invest
there
are
huge
risk
said
akito
tachibana
manag
director
of
toyota
s
india
arm
ad
as
of
now
there
is
no
clariti
on
who
would
buy
such
car
and
what
incent
the
govern
will
offer
charg
infrastructur
is
a
big
piec
of
the
puzzl
that
need
to
be
resolv
for
ev
to

viabl
india
ha
onli
about
charg
station
with
charg
point
accord
to
a
januari
report
by
global
consult
ey
analyst
estim
it
cost
between
and
to
set
up
a
station
and
that
come
on
top
of
expens
land
purchas
need
to
build

the

worth

will
be
need
to
promot

automak
argu
in
the
the
govern
should
make
land
avail
and
invest
in
build
station
while
over
the
it
would
need
to
offer
incent
to
privat
investor
one
addit
problem
is
that
unlik
in
western
countri
most
car
owner
in
india
do
not
have
garag
or
formal
park
where
charger
for

could
be
instal
anoth
issu
is
lack
of
a
polici
outlin
incent
which
ha
help
countri
like
china
push
electr
vehicl
sale
govern
wrangl
over
polici
formul
in
india
is
make
it
difficult
for
carmak
to
plan
invest
ani
distract
from
the
focu
to
draw
a
plan
for
introduc
electr
vehicl
is
go
to

a
exercis
that
