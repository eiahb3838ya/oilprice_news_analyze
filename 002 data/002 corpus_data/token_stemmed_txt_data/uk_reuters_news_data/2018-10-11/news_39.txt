said
he
believ
the

alreadi
in

that
could
deepen
in
come

the
intern

predict
thi

that
the
economi
would
shrink
percent
thi
year
and
percent
in
befor
recov
slowli
that
would
make
the
slump
less
deep
than
the
recess
of
when
the
economi
shrank
over
percent
and
not
nearli
as
damag
as
the
war
of
when
it
shrank
by
about

also
forecast
the
averag

would
jump

abov

next

briefli
return
to
it
level
in
how
much
the
current
recess
resembl
past
period
of
econom
pain
for
iran
will
depend
on
the
extent
to
which
washington
can
use
the
sanction
to
push
other
countri
into
cut
oil
and
trade
with
the
islam
republ
offici
have
said
the
sanction
will
be
tougher
than
the
step
in
they
aim
to
reduc
iranian
oil
export
more
sharpli
and
to
disrupt
export
to
iran
from
trade
hub
such
as
dubai
more
aggress
i
think
the
return
of
the

ha
had
a
