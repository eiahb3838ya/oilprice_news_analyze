we

said
david

an
analyst
at

energi
in
vienna
thi
is
becaus
we
see
a
deficit
in
the

russian

i
am
quit
surpris
said
a
trader
focus
on
north
sea
crude
i
thought
there
would
be
more
pressur
on
the
market
given
the
extra
barrel
that
are
come
over
but
there
is
huge
demand
in
the
far
east
and
outag
in
the
unit
state
not
part
of
the
pact
is
send
more
oil
abroad
and
in
late
novemb
export
more
crude
and
fuel
than
it
import
for
the
first
time
on
record
nonetheless
loss
of
crude
from
libya
s
largest
oilfield
similar
in
qualiti
to
nigerian
and
north
sea
grade
have
offset
thi
el
sharara

taken
over
on

of

libya
is
not
the
