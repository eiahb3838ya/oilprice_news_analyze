the
new
shanghai
crude
oil
futur
have
been
trade
for
just
over
a
month
and
have
so
far
manag
to
build
up
reason
strong
volum
but
thi
success
may
onli
mask
some
wider
concern
the
contract
were
launch
on
march
by
the
shanghai
intern
energi
exchang
ine
and
are
enjoy
trade
volum
averag
around
a
day
with
the
open
interest
around
the
ine
contract
offer
seven
grade
of
middl
eastern
and
domest
crude
for
deliveri
to
variou
locat
in
china
the
world
s
largest
oil
import
while
the
contract
is
to
match
china
s
crude
buy
it
is
structur
so
that
deliveri
is
for
sever
month
ahead
make
it
difficult
to
compar
to
other
crude
oil
benchmark
such
as
brent
west
texa
intermedi
wti
and
the
dubai
mercantil
exchang
s
oman
the
shanghai
contract
includ
a
freight
compon
and
a
currenc
factor
make
it
challeng
for
trader
to
work
out
arbitrag
opportun
against
the
other
benchmark
nonetheless
the
volum
and
open
interest
compar
veri
favour
to
those
of
the
dme
contract
which
is
perhap
the
best
comparison
given
that
oman
crude
is
similar
in
qualiti
to
the
grade
be
offer
by
the
ine
daili
volum
for
the
dme
contract
are
usual
between
and
well
below
the
level
that
shanghai
futur
are
achiev
howev
both
are
dwarf
by
brent
and
wti
both
of
which
trade
in
the
hundr
of
thousand
of
contract
everi
day
it
s
also
the
natur
of
the
volum
on
the
ine
that
may
be
caus
for
concern
with
trade
domin
by
chines
player
includ
the
major
refin
smaller
trader
and
retail
investor
there
is
noth
wrong
with
thi
mix
per
se
but
the
ine
contract
may
end
up
like
the
iron
ore
futur
on
the
dalian
commod
exchang
insofar
as
they
attract
huge
volum
but
mainli
from
domest
player
who
respond
more
to
local
news
flow
than
market
fundament
thi
rais
the
risk
that
the
ine
contract
effect
becom
a
chines
domest
vehicl
for
investor
to
play
in
the
crude
oil
market
if
thi
doe
happen
it
would
undermin
the
aim
of
establish
shanghai
as
a
major
price
hub
for
crude
oil
so
far
it
appear
that
particip
by
western
oil
compani
trader
and
investor
in
the
ine
ha
been
limit
that
s
not
to
say
there
isn
t
interest
among
western
player
in
the
shanghai
market
but
it
seem
that
they
are
be
cautiou
as
how
best
to
benefit
from
particip
one
of
the
logic
way
to
particip
would
be
to
hedg
middl
east
crude
against
the
deliv
price
in
china
and
to
pocket
ani
arbitrag
differ
thi
mean
the
price
of
oman
futur
would
have
to
be
below
those
in
shanghai
and
other
cost
such
as
currenc
transact
and
freight
would
also
have
to
be
factor
in
the
oman
contract
which
is
for
juli
deliveri
end
at
a
barrel
on
tuesday
thi
is
the
contract
most
suitabl
for
comparison
to
the
ine
futur
which
is
for
deliveri
in
septemb
the
shanghai
futur
end
at
yuan
a
barrel
on
april
with
there
be
no
trade
on
monday
and
tuesday
due
to
public
holiday
thi
equat
to
about
a
barrel
mean
there
is
onli
a
tini
premium
of
cent
a
barrel
current
between
the
ine
and
dme
equival
contract
thi
isn
t
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
freight
and
currenc
convers
mean
the
arbitrag
window
between
dubai
and
shanghai
is
current
close
of
cours
thi
won
t
alway
be
the
case
but
market
particip
outsid
china
appear
to
be
adopt
a
attitud
when
it
come
to
the
ine
contract
have
a
mirror
contract
for
the
ine
futur
perhap
base
in
the
region
trade
hub
of
singapor
may
boost
interest
in
the
shanghai
futur
but
for
now
the
initi
success
of
the
shanghai
contract
is
temper
by
sign
that
it
may
not
be
work
as
intend
and
that
it
s
still
some
way
from
achiev
the
goal
of
becom
the
benchmark
for
crude
trade
in
asia
the
opinion
express
here
are
