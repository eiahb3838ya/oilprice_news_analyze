lead
me
to
think
that

the
minist
said
on
april
thi
part
of
the
cycl
is
normal
characteris
by
a
game
of
guess
the
threshold
at
which
rise
price
start
to
destroy
oil
demand
in
recent
week
some
analyst
have
suggest
demand
destruct
will
begin
if
and
when
price
rise
abov
per
barrel
while
other
put
the
threshold
as
high
as
other
express
the
same
idea
by
suggest
per
gallon
or
even
is
the
psycholog
import
limit
for
motorist
but
identifi
a
specif
price
threshold
is
probabl
the
wrong
way
to
think
about
the
issu
of
price
and
consumpt
in
realiti
there
is
a
continuum
of
consum
respons
to
price
rang
from
demand
stimul
to
demand
destruct
the
lower
price
fall
and
the
longer
they
are
expect
to
stay
there
the
more
consumpt
tend
to
be
stimul
the
higher
price
rise
and
the
longer
they
are
predict
to
stay
up
the
more
consumpt
tend
to
be
destroy
the
respons
of
consumpt
to
price
is
continu
but
highli
the
respons
also
take
time
to
materialis
as
consum
slowli
adjust
their
behaviour
and
buy
new
equip
and
it
take
even
longer
to
appear
in
the
offici
consumpt
statist
due
to
report
delay
ad
to
the
complex
oil
consumpt
is
also
respons
to
other
factor
includ
econom
growth
and
incom
car
ownership
and
vehicl
fleet
growth
averag
mile
travel
and

some
of
these
factor
are
themselv
more
or
less
relat
to
oil

at
differ

make

when

as
a
result
it
is
notori
difficult
to
estim
the
of
oil
demand
and
economist
have
gener
wide
vari
estim
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
oil
consumpt
doe
respond
to
price
chang
and
the
respons
is
not
gear
to
ani
particular
threshold
the
relationship
between
price
and
oil

is
evid
in
the
