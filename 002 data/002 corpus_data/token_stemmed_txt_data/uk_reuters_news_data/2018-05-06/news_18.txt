curb
it
nuclear

it
will
also
lead

fizzl
out
said
polit
analyst
hamid
farahvashian
it
is
a
delic
balanc
khamenei
know
that
iranian
mani
of
whom
took
to
the
street
earlier
thi
year
to
protest
against
high
food
price
can
onli
take
so
much
econom
pressur
but
the

not
want
too
much
of

despit
the

rouhani
unabl
to

such
polici
is
like
to
serv
out
hi
term
which
end
in

would
be
a
sign
of
weak

it
would
harm

legitimaci
abroad
the

said
but
he
will
be
blame
and
pressur
for

khamenei
gave
guard
back
to
rouhani
when
he
open
the
door
to
nuclear
diplomaci
with
world
power
in
order
to
end
iran
s
econom
and
polit
isol
but
the
suprem
leader
s
avers
to
the
unit
state
remain
a
formid
barrier
to

diplomat
solut
now
so
a
trump
withdraw
would
make
it
hard
for
rouhani
to
pursu
better
relat
with
the

the
intern
polit
will
make
it
difficult
if

as
long
as

wa
not
exclud
from
the
global
financi

it

mani
foreign

he
ha
sought
without
much
success
to
curb
the

under
the

economi
if

will
be
back

said
a
western

in

said
a

who
declin
to
