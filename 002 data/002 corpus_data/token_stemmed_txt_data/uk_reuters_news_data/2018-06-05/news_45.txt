the

which
provid

much
of

is
gener
by
produc
of
raw

such
as
cobalt
and
lithium
and
those
who
assembl
cell
into

expert
say
there
s
been
a
bit
of
imbal
in
that
valu

and
that
s
one
of
the
reason
you
see
a
limit
amount
of
player
in

said

we

chang
carlsson

pioneer

say
northvolt
can
make
a
profit
through
economi
of
scale
by
use
cheap
hydropow
and
control
the
process
of
raw
materi
but
northvolt
and
terra
will
probabl
need
about
billion
each
in
govern
fund
to

given
the

now
in

it

decreas
as

down

thing

he
said
the

now
are
also
like
to
be
overtaken
in

of

by

the

the
