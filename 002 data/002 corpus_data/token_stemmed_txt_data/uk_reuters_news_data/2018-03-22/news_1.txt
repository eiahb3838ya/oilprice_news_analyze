wa
hope

be
natur
for
the
unit
state
to
be
with
us
and
to
provid
us
not
onli
with
technolog
but
to
help
us
with
the
fuel
cycl
and
the
monitor
and
make
sure
we
do
it
to
the
highest
but
the
kingdom
ha
gener
uranium
resourc
it
want
to
develop
it
s
not
natur
for
us
to
bring
enrich
uranium
from

foreign
countri
to

our
reactor
falih

the
ironi
is
that
if

a
deal
then
somebodi
els
will
and
we
are
fortun
to

case
the
will
not
have
a
seat
at

he
said
perri
stuck
a
similar
chord
in
comment
dure
a
congression
hear
on

appear
to
me

civil
nuclear
capabl
in
the
kingdom
of
saudi
