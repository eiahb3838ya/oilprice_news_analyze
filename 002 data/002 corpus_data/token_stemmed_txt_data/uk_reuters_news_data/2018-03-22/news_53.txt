a
comfort
consensu
is
emerg

market
that
china

vast

certainli
the
common
theme
of
present
at
thi
week
s
global
iron
ore
and
steel
forecast
confer
in
perth
wa
that
the
current
premium
of
ore
with
a
higher
iron
content
is
now
a
defin
characterist
of
china
s
market
thi
shift
matter
as
china
buy
about
of
global
seaborn
iron
ore
with
the
vast
major
of
the
annual
demand
of
more
than
billion
tonn
come
from
australia
and
brazil
with
south
africa
a
distant
third
the
industri
benchmark
is
ore
with
an
iron
content
of
percent
a
qualiti
level
that
is
met
by
most
brazilian
ore
as
well
as
by

australian
miner

billiton
australia
s
produc
come
close
to
thi
level
with
it
output
but
fortescu
metal
group
deliv
a
grade
closer
to
the
percent
level
china
s
switch
to
use
iron
ore
in
it
blast
furnac
is
seemingli
built
around
three
main
factor
the
first
is
the
need
to
reduc
air
pollut
which
encourag
steel
mill
to
use
the
higher
grade
ore
as
they
requir
less
coke
coal
in
order
to
be
turn
into
pig
iron
and
then
crude
steel
use
iron
ore
with
a
percent
iron
content
consum
about
percent
less
coke
coal
than
use
percent
iron
ore
the
second
is
the
ongo
rationalis
of
the
steel
industri
with
capac
closur
of
around
a
total
million
tonn
be
achiev
in
and
up
to
million
tonn
more
wa
slate
to
be
shut
down
thi
year
thi
polici
is
aim
at
elimin
overcapac
and
clear
out
older
produc
therebi
boost
the
profit
of
the
remain
steel
mill
the
polici
ha
contribut
to
the
third
factor
drive
the
switch
to
higher
grade
ore
name
that
mill
are
enjoy
strong
profit
margin
from
be
for
sever
year
up
to
china
s
steel
produc
have
turn
strongli
profit
in
recent
month
with
the
margin
on
benchmark
steel
rebar
around
a
tonn
accord
to
s
p
global
platt
data
with
the
steel
futur
in
shanghai
current
trade
around
the
equival
of
it
s
clear
that
steel
maker
can
afford
to
use
the
iron
ore
as
they
are
still
incentivis
to
maximis
output
to
captur
the
avail
profit
if
the
current
market
consensu
is
correct
that
china
s
shift
to
higher
grade
iron
ore
is
structur
it
becom
appar
that
these
three
factor
will
also
have
to
be
structur
it
s
probabl
fair
to
say
that
the
first
two
the
focu
on
reduc
pollut
and
the
rationalis
of
capac
appear
to
be
ongo
polici
and
there
are
no
sign
that
they
will
be
relax
or
chang
in
ani
shape
but
the
most
import
factor
is
the
profit
of
steel
mill
and
thi
is
far
from
guarante
the
return
to
profit
wa
driven
by
stimulu
spend
on
infrastructur
and
a
recoveri
in
real
estat
invest
and
both
of
these
influenc
may
be
wane
somewhat
thi
isn
t
to
suggest
a
sharp
correct
is
loom
in
chines
steel
demand
and
price
but
at
the
same
time
construct
a
case
for
sustain
the
current
level
of
robust
profit
is
quit
challeng
steel
is
a
cyclic
busi
and
is
like
to
remain
so
mean
that
at
some
point
china
s
produc
will
onc
again
face
a
margin
squeez
when
that
happen
the
incent
switch
to
use
the
lowest
cost
input
and
accept
a
reduct
in
volum
from
the
blast
furnac
thi
could
well
put
lower
grade
iron
ore
back
in
play
and
shrink
the
current
wide
margin
the
spot
price
in
china
of
percent
iron
ore
as
assess
by
metal
bulletin
wa
at
a
tonn
on
wednesday
the
assess
for
the
percent
grade
wa
a
tonn
thi
make
the
lower
grade
ore
about
percent
cheaper
and
thi
ha
widen
from
the
percent
gap
that
prevail
at
the
end
of
the
current
gap
is
clearli
seen
by
mani
in
the
industri
as
the
new
normal
and
it
s
like
to
persist
as
long
as
china
s
steel
mill
enjoy
the
type
of
profit
they
are
get
current
but
it
may
be
a
touch
too
soon
to
say
that
thi
is
a
sustain
structur
chang
that
can
not
be
revers
if
market
circumst
chang
as
they
inevit
will
