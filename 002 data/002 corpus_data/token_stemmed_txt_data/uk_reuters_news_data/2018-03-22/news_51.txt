the
new
fund
will
be
a
rare
beast
in
the
market
where
commod
are
often
be
trade
by
macro
fund
base
on
trend
but
goldberg
say
the
world
will
face
a
number
of
tecton
chang
relat
to
commod
in
the
next
few
year
that
will
be
so
big
that
they
will
allow
the
trade
of
entir
countri
base
on
them
one
of
the
trend
he
say
is
the
upcom
chang
in
global
marin
regul
in
that
will
set
a
new
upper
limit
for
sulphur
content
in
fuel
use
for
ship
to
cut
pollut
the
rule
will
see
a
drastic
reduct
in
demand
for
fuel
oil
current
use
in
ship
and
rais
demand
for
cleaner
diesel
that
in
turn
will
depress
the
valu
of
heavi
sulphur
crude
oil
from
place
such
as
canada
as
they
tend
to
yield
more
fuel
oil
than
diesel
what
happen
to
the
balanc
of
payment
of
canada
when
your
main
export
product
get
less
valu
and
who
which
countri
and
currenc
doe
better
in
thi
scenario
that
is
what
the
fund
will
be
look
at
said
goldberg
the
wall
street
journal
wa
first
to
report
about
the
launch
of
the
fund
the
impact
from
new
marin
fuel
regul
might
be
as
big
as
if
not
bigger
than
those
from
the
shale
boom
on
the
global
oil
industri
said
goldberg
when
shale
oil
product
soar
in
the
world
had
an
oversuppli
of
million
barrel
per
day
of
oil
equal
to
around
one
percent
of
demand
but
when
new
marin
fuel
regul
come
into
play
demand
for
diesel
will
probabl
increas
by
about
million
barrel
per
day
or
by
over
six
percent
of
current
global
diesel
demand
said
goldberg
he
said
the
fund
will
be

the
advantag
