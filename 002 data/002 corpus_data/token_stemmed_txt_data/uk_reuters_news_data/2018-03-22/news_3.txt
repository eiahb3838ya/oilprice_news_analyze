falih
said
the
kingdom
may
still
move
forward
with
the
plan
initi
public
offer
ipo
in
the
second
half
of
despit
previous
rais
doubt
it
could
be
delay
to
next
year
the
time
of
a
float
would
depend
on
market
condit
and
the
kingdom
is
readi
to
execut
the

at
ani
time
we
have
prepar
all
document
to
be
readi
to
do
both
domest

list
falih
said
we
have
not
close
the
door
on
he
said
the
kingdom
need
to
be
sure
that
the
market
is
readi
and
is
thi
an
optimum
time
to
falih
said
the
compani
could
be
float
either
domest
or
intern
late
thi
year
new
york
is
still
in
the
run
for
the
ipo
but
saudi
offici
still
need
to
weigh
the
potenti
legal
risk
of
a
list
in
the
unit
state
he
said
we
have
concern
obvious
aramco
is
too
big
and
too
valuabl
and
too
import
he
said
we
could
be
potenti
at
risk
from
some
frivol
lawsuit
and
litig
that
we
have
to
consid
in
our
final
legal
challeng
could
aris
