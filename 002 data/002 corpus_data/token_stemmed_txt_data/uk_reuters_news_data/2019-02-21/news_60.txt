aston

vauxhal
are
as
differ
as
two
auto
compani
can
be
now
brexit
ha
thrown
palmer
and
norman
into
the
same
precari
boat
as
like
their
rival
they
seek
to
minimis
the
potenti
harm
of
a
disorderli
british
exit
the
two
compani
have
signific
british
manufactur
oper
and
togeth
have
thousand
of
employe
in
the
countri
palmer
and
norman
both
said
in
interview
that
the
impact
of
brexit
would
be
more
complic
more
pervas
and
take
longer
to
play
out
than
policymak
and
the
public
appreci
for
aston
martin
which
sell
sport
car
at
price
well
abov
pound
new
european
tariff
on

are
not
a
signific
concern
palmer
said
like
other
smaller
player
such
as
bentley
and
mclaren
aston
ha
much
larger
margin
on
it
car
and
extra
cost
can
be
more
easili
pass
onto
wealthi
custom
that
s
not
a
luxuri
enjoy
by
player
what
concern
palmer
more
is
the
disrupt
to
hi
compani
s
network
of
supplier
and
it
meticul
schedul
product
system
as
he

peopl
have
ask

you
awak
palmer
said
it
veri
much
is
the
suppli

and
the
capabl
of
that
suppli
chain
to
absorb
all
the
macroeconom
that
are
thrown
at
aston

not
alon
in

gener
motor
and
is
chart
a
new
strategi
under

group
psa
vauxhal
believ
a
brexit
would
lead
to
as
much
as
a
percent
fall
in
british
new
vehicl
demand
but
a
bigger
market
share
for
vauxhal
psa
ha
commit
last

to
fresh

to
launch

plant
open
after
the
current
run

end
that
decis
is
not
a
simpl
one
norman
said
it
would
not
be
true
to
say
that
a
hard
brexit
automat
mean
the
closur
of

in
the
unit
kingdom
neither
for
us
nor
for

certainli
mean
they
