given
the

now
surround

it
still
appear
that
they
are

with
refinitiv
data
show
shipment
of
million

last

up
million
from
the
previou

still
if
export

are
run
at
around
million
barrel
per

bpd
thi
is
still
well
below
their
potenti
of
closer
to
million
bpd
but
for
now
it
doe
seem
the
market
for
middl

is
rel
and
the

back
thi
view
oman

futur
for

on
the

mercantil
exchang
close
at
a

on
tuesday
put
them
at
a
premium
of
cent
to
dubai
swap
for
decemb
thi
premium
ha
emerg
in
recent
day
as
the
imbroglio
over
the
fate
of
khashoggi
ha
escal
given
that
on
the
swap
were
command
a
premium
of

a

over
the

while
both
oman
futur
and
physic
dubai
crude
have
gain
in
recent
day
the
paper
oil
ha
done
so
at
a
faster
pace
suggest
investor
are
more
concern
than
the
trader
refin
and
produc
who
buy

sell
actual
cargo
current
there
isn
t
a
larg
disconnect
between
the
paper
and
physic
crude
market
in
the
middl
east
but
futur
trade
at
a
premium
to
physic
doe
suggest
the
market
may
not
be
as
tight
as
fear
