the

market
is
like
to
be
fixat
in
come

on
the
interact
of
presid
donald

hi
russian
counterpart
vladimir

and
saudi

throw
in
a

at
a

dinner
on
saturday
between
trump
and

is
potenti
go
to
deliv
a
smorgasbord
of
juici
headlin
to
drive
crude
price
while
the
focu
of
crude
oil
market
particip
is
correct
and
inde
they
have
littl
choic
but
to
focu
on
the
machin
of
trump
putin
and
bin
salman
there
is
alway
a
risk
of
place
too
much
emphasi
on
the
polit
of
oil
the
meet
may
do
noth
more
than
to
confirm
what
is
alreadi
wide
known
name
that
trump
want
oil
price
at
least
as
low
as
they
current
are
and
that
putin
and
bin
salman
want
them
higher
but
not
so
high
as
to
risk
a
continu
blast
of
twitter
spray
from
the
mercuri
leader
it
would
take
a
major
surpris
from
the
summit
to
alter
the
market
view
that
crude
is
current
oversuppli
and
that
the
organ
of
the
petroleum
export
countri
opec
and
it
alli
includ
russia
are
plan
on
reduc
output
at
their
meet
in
the

there
are
other
develop
in
the

that
may
not
be
as
such
as
the

are
on
track
to

thi
would
be
up

by

which
wa
the
highest
on
record
exceed
the

the

slight
differ
in

as
have
arriv

been
clear
howev
even
if
the

is
on
the
optimist
side
it
s
still
possibl
that
china
s
crude
import
will
exceed
million
bpd
in
a
month
for
the
first
time
ever
it
s
also
worth
note
that
the
novemb
import
like
don
t
reflect
the
full
impact
of
brent

plung
from
a
close

would
have
been
arrang
and
paid
for
when

were
near
their
recent
peak
thi
rais
the
possibl
that
china
will
import
more
crude
in
come
month
especi
if
the
author
in

major
decid
to
use

china

also

also

the

believ
to
have

prior

thi
may
result
in

there
may
be
some
temptat

the

by
the

seven
other

what
is
certain
is
that
china
isn
