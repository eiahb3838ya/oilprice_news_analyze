thi
figur
may
be
revis
as
it
becom
clearer
when
ship
will
arriv
and
discharg
their

but
the
august
import
are
like
to
be
more
or
less
in
line
with
the
million
tonn
import
in
juli
which
wa
the
strongest
monthli
outcom
so
far
in

no
matter
what
the
exact
level
of

turn
out
to
be
india
s
coal

have
been
except
strong
and
are
on
track
to

the

indian
coal
import
especi
for
thermal

use
to
gener
electr
have
been
thought
to
be
sensit
to
price
and
like
to
declin
if
price
move
rapidli
higher
as
they
have
done
thi
year
but
indian
import
have
been
on
an
upward
trend
in
recent
month
despit
the
rise
price
an
easi
answer
as
to
whi
is
to
point
to
the
recent
difficulti
state
miner
coal
india
ha
experienc
in
transport
the
pollut
fuel
from
pit
to
power
plant
but
as
tim
buckley
director
of
energi
financ
studi
at
the
institut
for
energi
econom
and
financi
analysi
ieefa
point
out
in
a
recent
note
there
is
more
to
the
situat
data
from
india
s
central
electr
author
show
that
coal
import
for
what
are
term
power
plant
those
that
suppli
power
to
the
network
are
actual
declin
fall
percent
in
the
june
quarter
so
as
far
as
thermal
coal
import
for
the
power
sector
are
concern
the
price
signal
is
work
insofar
as
they
are
declin
as
price
rise
howev
as
buckley
note
a
larg
part
of
india
s
coal
import
are
use
by
consum
other
than
power
plant
there
is
a
about
gigawatt
gw
of
gener
capac
that
is
use
by
captiv
power
plant
buckley
said
in
a
recent
paper
sent
to
reuter
these
user
includ
aluminium
smelter
cement
maker
and
other
industri
user
and
they
are
more
reliant
on
coal
import
as
their
demand
isn
t
prioritis
by
coal
india
effect
mean
they
are
last
in
line
for
domest
suppli
if
thi
gw
wa
run
at
percent
capac
it
would
need
about
million
tonn
of
thermal
coal
a
year
buckley
said
a
figur
that
repres
about
of
current
thermal
coal
import
given
these
consum
have
to
run
their
captiv
power
plant
in
order
to
produc
their
good
they
have
no
option
but
to
turn
to
import
when
coal
india
can
t
meet
their
need
thu
it
appear
that
as
much
as
of
india
s
current
coal
import
demand
is
from
buyer
that
aren
t
price
sensit
thi
like
mean
that
coal
import
will
remain
robust
at
least
for
as
long
as
coal
india
is
struggl
to
meet
the
need
of
the
variou
consum
of
the

thi
dynam
of

also
appear
to
be

the

suppli
higher

it
make
