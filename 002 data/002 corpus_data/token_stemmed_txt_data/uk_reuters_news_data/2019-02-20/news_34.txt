india
s
demand
for
electr
is
expect
to
doubl
in
the
next
two
decad
and
coal
ha
been
long
forecast
to
be
the
fuel
of
choic
for
power
gener
but
thi
may
no
longer
be
the
case
it
s
not
that
india
doesn
t
have
plenti
reserv
of
coal
it
doe
and
it
is
the
world
s
produc
and
import
follow
china
it
s
not
even
that
india
s
reserv
are
expens
to
mine
they
aren
t
it
s
not
even
that
transport
coal
from
where
it
s
mine
to
where
it
s
need
is
too
difficult
ye
it
is
an
issu
but
thi
challeng
could
be
overcom
with
suffici
invest
in
rail
and
other
infrastructur
no
the
main
reason
coal
may
battl
to

india
s
futur
energi
need
is
that
it
s
simpli
becom
too
expens
rel

energi
altern
such
as

in
recent

power

have
shown
that
renew
can
be
offer
at
less
than
rupe
cent
per

a

that

difficulti
match
there
is
also

are
start

the

assum
that

but
with

gw
current
permit
the
pipelin
of

would
appear
to
be
consider
lower
than
what
the
govern
is
forecast
a
further
issu
for
india
s
coal
sector
is
that
bank
are
becom
reluct
to
lend
to
new
ventur
and
insur
are
also
becom
less
keen
to
offer

thi
is
larg
becaus
the

that

thi
is
some

short

also
possibl
the

may
be

if
