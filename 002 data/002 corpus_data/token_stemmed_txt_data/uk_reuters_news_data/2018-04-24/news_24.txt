opec

opec

deni
that
they
are
princip

increas
in

price
over

last

or
that
they
should
adjust
their
product
polici
in
respons
they
can
point
to
unplan

in
venezuela
and
other
produc

as
well
as
unexpectedli
strong
demand
from
consum
for
draw
down
inventori
faster
than
they
predict
at
the
end
of

they
can
also
point
to
grow
concern
among
trader
about
the
imposit
of

on
venezuela
and
of

on
iran
for

increas
all
these
argument
are
true
and
all
these
