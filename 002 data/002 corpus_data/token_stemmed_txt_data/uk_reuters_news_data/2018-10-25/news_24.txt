the

two
thing

iran

there
is
still
debat
over
how
much
oil
is
like
to
be
lost
and
for
how
long
the
situat
will
persist
what
china
doe
is
key
in
thi
regard
given
that
it
import
about
barrel
per
day

of
iranian
crude
in

month
of

iran
s
crude
export
have
been
in
the
region
of
about
million
bpd
in
recent
month
and
it
appear
to
be
on
track
to
record

level
in

transpond

their

make
it
challeng
to
monitor
the
true
state
of
the
nation
s
export
even
take
that
into
account
it
s
worth
note
that
of
the
nine
cargo
shown
as
arriv
at
their
destin
in
novemb
six
are
head
to
china
one
each
to
india
and
greec
and
one
to
an
as
yet
undetermin
asian
port
there
are
also
question
over
what
exactli
is
happen
to
the
iranian
crude
arriv
in
china
much
of
the
crude
is
head
to
the
northern
port
of
dalian
where
it
is
like
to
end
up
in
bond
storag
that
would
mean
it
would
be
in
china
but
wouldn
t
have
clear
custom
and
therefor
unavail
to
domest
refin
thi
rais
the
possibl
that
some
of
iran
s
crude
export
are
in
or
are
head
into
storag
tank
and
are
effect
lost
to
the
market
thi
lead
to
a
coupl
of
point
to
consid
firstli
that
the
market
is
adjust
quit
well
alreadi
to
the
loss
of
iranian
barrel
and
secondli
that
the
oil
in
storag
at
some
point
will
come
to
market
which
may
depress
demand
from
other
supplier
when
thi
happen
iran
s
other
key
custom
is
india
which
took
about
bpd
in
the
first
nine
month
of
the
year
accord
to
the
refinitiv
data
thi
ha
yet
to
declin

there
are

may
be
the

instead
other
indian
refin
are
still
aim
to
secur

question
over
insur

them
to

those

overal
it
appear
both
china
and
india
are
cut
back
on

crude
from
iran
but
by
how
much
and
for
how
long

it
also
appear

of

s
crude
