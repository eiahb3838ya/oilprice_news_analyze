the
opinion
express
here
are
those
of
the
author
a

reuter
the
term
demand
destruct
is
again
enter
the
lexicon
of
the
current
crude
oil
market
as
the
sharp
rise
in
price
rais
concern
about
when
do
consum
start
cut
back
on
their
fuel
consumpt
while
it
s
probabl
imposs
to
pick
the
exact
point
at
which
thi
happen
the
risk
in
the
current
cycl
of
rise
price
is
that
it
happen
earlier
than
in
the
past
in
asia
the
main
region
drive
rise
crude
demand
the
reason
for
thi
is
that
mani
countri
in
asia
use
the
prior
period
of
fall
crude
price
to
end
or
dramat
scale
back
their
fuel
subsidi
thi
mean
that
thi
time
consum
in
countri
such
as
india
indonesia
and
malaysia
are
fulli
expos
to
rise
crude
price
someth
that
hasn
t
been
in
the
case
in
previou
bull
cycl
the
combin
oil
consumpt
of
those
three
countri
is
about
million
barrel
per
day
bpd
with
india
alon
account
for
about
million
bpd
even
a
percent
drop
in
demand
for
fuel
in
those
countri
would
knock
about
bpd
from
global
crude
oil
consumpt
so
far
it
appear
that
consum
in
those
countri
haven
t
been
expos
to
the
full
extent
of
the
crude
oil
increas
global
benchmark
brent
crude
close
at
a
barrel
on
april
up
percent
sinc
the
end
of
last
year
and
percent
from
last
year
s
low
in
june
the
price
of
a
litr
of
diesel
in
new
delhi
wa
rupe
on
sunday
accord
to
data
on
the
websit
of
indian
oil
thi
is
equival
to
about
a
litr
at
the
end
of
last
year
the
price
of
a
litr
of
diesel
wa
rupe
mean
it
ha
risen
by
percent
so
far
thi
year
not
quit
keep
pace
with
the
rise
in
brent
crude
oil
when
crude
wa
at
it
low
in
june
diesel
wa
rupe
a
litr
in
new
delhi
mean
it
ha
risen
about
percent
sinc
then
while
brent
ha
jump
by
percent
what
appear
to
have
happen
is
that
the
oil
major
such
as
indian
oil
have
larg
absorb
the
cost
of
rise
crude
price
partli
becaus
of
govern
pressur
to
do
so
but
there
ha
to
be
a
question
mark
as
to
how
long
thi
can
continu
to
be
the
case
indian
oil
s
share
price
ha
plung
percent
sinc
it
high
reach
in
august
and
there
will
like
come
a
point
where
the
pain
of
the
slump
stock
price
outweigh
the
polit
pressur
to
keep
absorb
the
cost
of
higher
crude
oil
price
there
is
also
some
preliminari
evid
that
india
s
appetit
for
crude
oil
is
level
off
with
import
trend
lower
so
far
thi
year
accord
to
and
port
data
compil
by
thomson
reuter
oil
research
and
forecast
for
the
first
day
of
april
the
data
which
ha
been

to
show

at
million

thi
is
down
from
million
bpd
in
march
million
bpd
in
februari
and
million
bpd
in
januari
while
there
may
be
some
season
slow
in
india
s
crude
demand
it
s
worth
note
that
april
thi
year
appear
to
be
slightli
weaker
than
the
million
bpd
import
in
the
same
month
in
in
indonesia
which
end
gasolin
subsidi
in
and
lower
the
diesel
subsidi
to
rupiah
cent
per
litr
in
retail
price
also
haven
t
risen
by
as
much
as
the
price
of
crude
oil
diesel
wa
about
the
equival
of
about
cent
a
litr
last
week
up
from
cent
at
the
start
of
the
year
accord
to
data
on
the
websit
similar
to
india
thi
mean
indonesian
consum
have
onli
been
partial
slug
the
increas
in

mean
the
fuel
retail
ha
been
absorb
the
differ
via
shrink
profit
margin
again
how
much
longer
thi
can
continu
is
uncertain
but
one
would
imagin
at
some
point
rise
crude
price
will
have
to
be
reflect
in
higher
retail
price
for
diesel
and
gasolin
even
when
retail

do

pick
the

at
which

indirectli
by

fewer
good
and
servic
as
they
divert
incom
to
rise
fuel
bill
is
a
challeng
and
will
vari
from
countri
to
countri
but
the
absenc
of
fuel
subsidi
in
most
asian
nation
is
like
to
mean
the

feel
the

of
the
jump
in

far
faster
