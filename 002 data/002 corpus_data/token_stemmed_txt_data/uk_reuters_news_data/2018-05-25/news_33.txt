the
support
yacht
in
yokohama
s
baysid
marina
on

the
way
i
look
at
it
is
as
a
way
to
express
myself
it
didn
t
happen
veri
soon
after
the
atlant
swim
becaus
i
got
marri
i
had
children
so
i
put
that
asid
but
i
knew
i
wa
go
to
come
back
to
that
project
the
s
plan
is
to
swim
for
eight
hour
a
day
as
well
as
consum
over
calori
as
he
undertak
an
extraordinari
journey
that
is
and
experi
much
of
lecomt
back
come
from
scientif
publish
who
will
be
provid
daili
updat
on
hi
progress
as
well
as
promot
research
on
the
data
collect
by
the
support
team
more
than
differ
scientif
organ
some
medic
and
some
oceanograph
will
be
benefit
from
the
data
gather
dure
the
expedit
much
of
the
research
will
focu
on
plastic
pollut
in
the
pacif
ocean
specif
the
of
plastic
smog
contain
billion
of
piec
of
microplast
there
is
increas
concern
among
scientist
about
the
effect
of
pervas
plastic
pollut
on
marin
ecosystem
in
particular
they
are
worri
about
microplast
particl
bit
measur
no
more
than
of
an
inch
mm
which
come
from
larg
plastic
trash
that
ha
fragment
into
smaller
piec
or
microbead
in
product
like
facial
soap
bodi
wash
and
toothpast
for
lecomt
rais
awar
of
these
issu
is
more
import
than
set
ani
record
i
rememb
my
father
and
he
wa
the
one
who
taught
me
how
to
swim
in
the
atlant
i
rememb
time
when
we
would
go
on
the
beach
and
walk
and
never
see
ani
plastic
now
everywher
i
go
on
the
beach
i
see
plastic
everywher
said
lecomt
if
we
are
all
awar
of
it
then
after
it
is
much
easier
to
take
action
and
to
chang
our
behaviour
becaus
the
solut
is
in
our
hand
we
know
what
we
have
to
the
frenchman
whose
atlant
cross
wa
never
ratifi
by
guin
world
record
becaus
it
can
not
be
fulli
verifi
that
he
resum
hi
swim
in
the
exact
point
he
stop
them
the
day
befor
believ
the
mental
battl
will
be
tougher
than
the
physic
endur
it
is
mind
over
matter
said
lecomt
who
is
also
an
architectur
consult
base
in
austin
texa
when
not
in
the
water
to
do
the
physic
aspect
of
it
sure
it
is
difficult
and
all
that
but
what
is
much
more
difficult
is
to
be
in
that
veri
hostil
environ
to
do
that
day
in
and
day
out
to
push
you
and
to
push
your
limit
then
the
mind
ha
to
be
super
to
overcom
thi
lecomt
will
make
a
strict
plan
for
what
he
will
think
about
for
eight
hour
in
the
water
each
day
the
worst
thing
that
can
happen
is
not
know
what
you
are
go
to
do
with
your
mind
and
go
to
the
wrong
place
he
said
as
well
as
mental
challeng
lecomt
will
have
to
endur
turbul
and
unpredict
weather
potenti
freez
cold
water
as
well
as
shark
and
jellyfish
howev
right
now
lecomt
just
want
to
get
start
i
am
a
littl
bit
like
a
tiger
