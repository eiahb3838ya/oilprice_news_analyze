when
the
worst
flood
in
a
centuri
swept
through
india
s
southern
kerala
state
in
august
they
kill
more
than
peopl
and
left
behind
more
than
billion
in
damag
but
one
thing
surviv
unscath
india
s
first
float
solar
panel
on
one
of
the
countri
s
largest
water
reservoir
as
india
grappl
with
wilder
weather
surg
demand
for
power
and
a
goal
to
nearli
quintupl
the
use
of
solar
energi
in
just
four
year
we
are
veri
much
excit
about
float
solar
said
shailesh
mishra
director
of
power
system
at
the
govern
solar
energi
corpor
of
india
india
is
plan
new
instal
of
the
technolog
on
hydropow
reservoir
and
other
water
bodi
in
tamil
nadu
jharkhand
and
uttarakhand
state
and
in
the
lakshadweep
island
he
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
the
cost
is
come
almost
to
the
same
level
as
ground
solar
and
then
it
will
go
forward
veri
fast
he
predict
as
countri
move
to
swiftli
scale
up
solar
power
to
meet
grow
demand
for
energi
and
to
tri
to
curb
climat
chang
float
solar
panel
instal
on
reservoir
or
along
coastal
area
are
fast
gain
popular
particularli
in
asia
expert
say
the
panel
now
in
place
from
china
to
the
maldiv
to
britain
get
around
some
of
the
biggest
problem
face
tradit
solar
farm
particularli
a
lack
of
avail
land
said
oliv
knight
a
senior
energi
specialist
with
the
world
bank
the
water
bodi
is
alreadi
there
you
don
t
need
to
go
out
and
find
it
he
said
in
a
telephon
interview
and
site
solar
array
on
water
most
cover
up
to
percent
of
a
reservoir
can
cut
evapor
as
well
a
signific
benefit
in
place
knight
said
pakistan
s
new
govern
for
instanc
is
talk
about
use
float
solar
panel
on
water
reservoir
near
karachi
and
hyderabad
both
to
provid
power
and
to
curb
water
loss
as
climat
chang
bring
hotter
temperatur
and
more
evapor
he
said
solar
array
on
hydropow
dam
also
can
take
advantag
of
exist
power
transmiss
line
and
excess
solar
can
be
use
to
pump
water
effect
store
it
as

china
current
ha
the
most
of
the
gigawatt
of
float
solar
gener
capac
now
instal
accord
to
the
world
bank
but
the
technolog
s
potenti
is
much
bigger
about
gigawatt
or
about
as
much
gener
capac
as
all
the
solar
photovolta
panel
instal
in
the
world
through
the
bank
said
if
you
cover
percent
of
manmad
water
bodi
you
re
alreadi
look
at
gigawatt
knight
said
that
s
veri
grow
use
of
the
technolog
ha
rais
fear
that
it
could
block
sun
into
reservoir
affect
wildlif
and
ecosystem
or
that
electr
system
might
not
stand
up
to
a
wateri
environ
particularli
in
salti
coastal
water
but
backer
say
that
while
environment
concern
need
to
be
better
studi
the
rel
small
amount
of
surfac
area
cover
by
the
panel
at
least
at
the
moment
doesn
t
appear
to
creat
signific
problem
peopl
worri
what
will
happen
to
fish
to
water
qualiti
said
india
s
mishra
now
all
that
attent
ha
what
may
be
more
challeng
is
keep
panel
work
and
free
of
colonis
sea
creatur
in
corros
salti
coastal
instal
which
account
for
a
rel
small
percentag
of
total
project
so
far
note
thoma
reindl
of
the
solar
energi
research
institut
of
singapor
he
said
he
expect
the
technolog
will
draw
more
invest
when
durabl
and
reliabl
ha
been
proven
in
real
world
instal
current
float
solar
array
cost
about
percent
more
than
tradit
solar
photovolta
array
knight
said
but
that
cost
is
often
offset
by
other
lower
cost
in
mani
place
one
ha
to
pay
for
land
for
resettl
of
peopl
or
prepar
and
level
land
and
build
road
he
said
with
float
solar
you
avoid
quit
a
bit
of
solar
panel
use
on
water
which
cool
them
also
can
produc
about
percent
more
electr
he
said
mishra
said
that
while
in
hi
view
india
ha
suffici
land
for
tradit
solar
instal
much
of
it
is
in
remot
area
inhospit
to
agricultur
includ
desert
put
solar
panel
on

by
comparison
cut
transmiss
cost
by
move
power
gener
closer
to
the
peopl
who
need
the
energi
he
said
he
said
india
alreadi
make
the
solar
panel
it
need
and
is
now
set
up
manufactur
for
the
float
and
anchor
need
for
float
solar
system
when
that
capac
is
in

then
the
