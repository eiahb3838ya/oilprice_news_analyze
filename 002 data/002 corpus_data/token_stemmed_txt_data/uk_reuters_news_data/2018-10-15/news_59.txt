it
s
tempt
to
look
at
the
rel
resili
of
china
s
import
of
major
commod
in
septemb
and
conclud
that
the
world
s
economi
is
weather
the
trade
disput
with
the
unit
state
quit
well
the
problem
with
thi
view
is
that
while
the
trade
conflict
certainli
loom
as
an
issu
in
china
s
commod
trade
it
s
not
yet
the
drive
factor
and
ani
strength
or
weak
in
variou
import
is
larg
a
result
of
differ
dynam
take
copper
for
exampl
where
import
of
unwrought
metal
in
septemb
were
tonn
up
percent
from
the
tonn
in
august
to
the
highest
in
year
thi
look
like
an
extrem
strong
monthli
gain
and
would
seem
to
be
at
odd
with
the
narr
of
a
loss
of
momentum
in
the
chines
economi
as
trade
war
fear
escal
but
the
main
driver
of
septemb
s
strong
result
is
as
a
result
of
a
crackdown
on
the
use
of
copper
scrap
part
of
govern
effort
to
limit
the
import
of
wast
product
thi
ha
forc
china
s
smelter
to
turn
to
other
sourc
of
the
industri
metal
in
order
to
satisfi
demand
there
may
be
an
element
of
the
trade
disput
with
the
administr
of
presid
donald
trump
insofar
as
beij
ha
impos
a
percent
import
tax
on
scrap
import
from
the
unit
state
as
part
of
it
tariff
measur
but
thi
would
onli
elimin
a
small
amount
of
copper
scrap
from
the
overal
chines
market
mean
the
trade
war
ha
yet
to
emerg
as
a
major
factor
in
the
copper

that
appear
to
have
a
rel
strong
septemb

gain
percent
from
the
prior
month
to
hit
million
tonn
similar
to
copper
one
would
expect
that
iron
ore
would
be
vulner
to
trade
tension
given
the
use
of
steel
in
mani
of
china
s
manufactur

it
appear
that
steel

have
been
ramp
up

ahead
of

which
ha
in

driven
demand
for

wa
one
of
the
commod
to
have
a

one
factor
that
doesn

gain
as
much
attent
as
it
should
in
analysi
of

s

is
price
while

isn

the
most

factor
it
doe
often
help
explain
some
of
the

movement
in
