remark
by

the
agreement
between
opec
and

is
therefor
like
to
be
extend
and
evolv
rather
than
termin
in
that
sens
barkindo
is
correct
to
note
exit
is
not
on
the
agenda
the
critic
question
is
how
and
when
the
agreement
is
modifi
not
whether
it
is
end
complet
the
most
like
outcom
is
that
the

is

to
includ
a
new
set
of
higher

limit
while
maintain
the
framework
of

with

but
if

the

is
now

in

they

onli
at

of

the
dilemma
of
whether
to
prioritis
the

is
familiar
opec

even
at

the
prioriti
shift
toward
recaptur
market
share
at
the
expens
of
a
wrench
slump
in
price
sinc
decemb
the
focu
ha
been
on
cut
excess
oil
stock
and
push
up
price
even
though
it
ha
cost
some
market
share
especi
in
asia
the
strategi
of
cut
stock
and
boost
price
ha
been
success
but
the
cost
associ
with
it
are
start
to
rise
as
shale
produc
captur
more
and
more
of
global
demand
growth
at
some
point
opec
and
it
alli
will
be
forc
to
shift
their
focu
back
toward
boost
output
and
stem
the
eros
of
their
market
share
the
onli
question
is
when
opec
and
it
alli
will
probabl
adjust
the
declar
at
some
point
to
includ
higher
product
limit
with
the
aim
of
defend
their
market
share
without
trigger
a
steep
fall
in
price
the
challeng
is
to
get
the
time
and
the
scale
of
the
output
increas
right
so
the
extra
suppli
is
absorb
by
grow
consumpt

experi
suggest
opec
will
leav
the
adjust
too
late
tighten
the

too
much
and
send

surg
the

will
then
increas
suppli
at
the
moment
when

is

slow
opec
allow
the
market
to
tighten
too
much
after
both
the
two

with
the
result

overshot
it
