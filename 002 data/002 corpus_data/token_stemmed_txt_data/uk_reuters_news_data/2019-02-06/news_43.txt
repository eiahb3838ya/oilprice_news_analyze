the

becaus

a
continu
widespread
upturn
albeit
more
slowli
than
the
frenzi

in

in

the

push
the
global

toward

in

the
biggest
impact
of
the

is
be
felt
in
the
consumpt
of

such
as

distil
consumpt
and
price
have
been
close
correl
with
the
busi

at

in
the
last

if
the
economi
slide
into
an
extend
slowdown
or
wors
an
outright
recess
distil
price
will
come
under
renew
pressur
and
take
crude
price
down
with
them
the
global
economi
ha
been
batter
by
a
seri
of
neg
shock
in
the
last
six
to
month
includ
the
stall
brexit
negoti
rise
interest
rate
an
appreci
dollar
and
sharp
fall
in
world
equiti
market
but
the
largest
sourc
of
uncertainti
stem
from
the
deterior
trade
relationship
between
the
unit
state
and
china
which
is
spill
over
to
both
countri
trade
network
the
resolut
of
tension
will
therefor
have
more
impact
on
the
global
econom
outlook
and
oil
consumpt
than
ani
other
singl
factor
in
of
all
possibl
outcom
four
are
the
most
like
comprehens
agreement
settl
all
or
nearli
all
outstand
issu
between
the
two
countri
limit
agreement
settl
some

but
leav
more
difficult
item
to
be
dealt
with
later
risk
recurr

no
deal
but
with
an
agreement
to
postpon
the
tariff
deadlin
while
the
two
side
continu
negoti
risk
recurr
tension
no
deal
with
an
immedi
imposit
of
tariff
on
china
s
export
a
comprehens
agreement
on
all
issu
would
be
the
most
posit
result
and
could
lead
to
a
major
boost
in
busi
confid
but
becaus
some
issu
are
so
difficult
it
is
also
probabl
the
least
like
of
those
four
possibl
outcom
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
no
deal
and
immedi
imposit
of
tariff
would
be
the
most
neg
outcom
and
the
result
shock
to
confid
and
market
would
make
a

the
risk
of

to

the
intermedi
outcom
of

would
avoid
the
worst
recess
risk
but
do
littl
to
rekindl
busi
confid
so
have
littl
impact
on
the
trajectori
of
the
economi
comprehens
agreement
is
obvious
more
posit
for
oil
consumpt
while
no
deal
would
pose
the
greatest
risk
for
oil
demand
comprehens
agreement
would
allow
the
organ
of
the
petroleum
export
countri
and
it
alli
to
contempl
relax
their
output
curb
but
might
make
the
white

hesit
about
toughen
sanction
on
iran
by
contrast
no
deal
would
probabl
forc
opec
and
it
alli
to
consid
even
deeper
product
cut
but
also
give
the
white
hous
more
scope
to
reduc
or
elimin
sanction
waiver
for
iran
s
crude
custom
opec
and
it
alli
will
need
a
clear
idea
of
the
white

s
approach
to

befor
they
make
ani
decis
about
adjust
output
to
avoid
repeat
the
miscommun
that
dog
the
last
sanction
deadlin
in
the
white

will
therefor
come
under
pressur
to
make
it
posit

sanction
clear
befor
the

in

further
complic
the
outlook
the
scope
of
the
sanction
remain
unclear
intent
but
they
appear
to
includ
primari
sanction
on
buyer

oil
and
secondari
sanction
on

do
busi
with
pdvsa
if

remov
sever
hundr
thousand
barrel

which
would
tighten

the

seem

the
