repeat
with
no
chang
to

the
opinion
express
here
are
those
of
the
author
a

the
respons
to
the
horrend
dam
collaps
at
a

ha
focus
on
iron
ore
price
and
how
a
disast
that
will
like
claim
more
than
live
occur
and
what
must
be
done
to
make
sure
thi
doesn
t
happen
again
these
are
valid
concern
but
the
risk
of
focus
on
the
immedi
issu
is
that
the
much
larger
problem
of
the
mine
industri
are
onc
again
gloss
over
name
that
miner
aren
t
trust
and
suffer
from
a
seriou
imag
problem
it
may
seem
somewhat
trivial
to
talk
about
imag
in
the
face
of
such
a
human
tragedi
but
mine
s
poor
imag
across
a
rang
of
stakehold
is
the
major
issu
for
the
industri
if
mine
ha
a
poor
safeti
and
commun
imag
it
becom
uninvest
to

at
the
mine
invest
event
in
cape
town
thi
week
held
under
chatham
hous
rule
if
investor
don
t
want
to
commit
fund
to
the
industri
becaus
of
fear
over
damag
to
their
own
imag
from
poor
mine
practic
then
the
industri
will
be
starv
of
capit
lack
of
capit
mean
it
becom
harder
and
harder
to
get
new
mine
built
or
explor
drill
undertaken
there
is
also
the
risk
of
a
cascad
of
neg
outcom
for

if
major
bank
and
pension
fund
make
it
clear
they
are
