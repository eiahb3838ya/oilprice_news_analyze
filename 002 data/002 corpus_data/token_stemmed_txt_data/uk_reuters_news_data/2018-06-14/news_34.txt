somewhat
myopic
demand
is
probabl
the
more
import
driver
of
the

over
the
longer
term
and
the
simpl
truth
is
that
the
global
market
is
effect
now
hostag
to
just
two
countri
china
and
india
have
so
far
thi
year
account
for
about
percent
of
the
expect
growth
in
crude
oil
demand
mean
that
what
happen
in
those
two
behemoth
is
like
of
far
more
import
to
the
crude
market
than
what
may
or
may

the
intern

forecast
last

that
global
crude
oil
demand
would
rise
by
million

in
down
from
an
earlier
estim
of
million

for
the
first
five

of
the
year
china
s
crude
oil
import
were
million

accord
to
custom
data
a
rise
of
bpd
on
the
same
period
in
india
s
crude
import
were
million
bpd
in
the
period
up
bpd
from
the
same
period
last
year
accord
to
vessel
and
port
data
and
industri
sourc
togeth
these
two
countri
the
world
s
biggest
and
crude
import
have
brought
in
bpd
more
in
the
first
five
month
of
than
in
same
period
last
year
if
thi
pace
of
growth
wa
maintain
for
the
whole
year
it
would
mean
that
china
and
india
would
account
for
the
lion
s
share
of
the
iea
s
forecast
for
the
increas
in
global
demand
most
investor
or
compani
would
tell
you
that
have
more
than
of
your
expect
growth
expos
to
just
two
player
is
extrem
riski
yet
the
oil
market
seem
almost
blase
about
the
outlook
for
both
these
countri
while
the
major
of
econom
forecast
are
for
strong
outcom
in
both
china
and
india
they
aren
t
without
risk
and
those
risk
may
be
rise
for
china
there
is
the
perenni
threat
of
credit
problem
with
sever
part
of
the
economi
still
highli
leverag
and
struggl
to
servic
loan
there
is
also
the
rise
risk
of
an
escal
of
trade
tension
and
a
tariff
war
with
the
administr
of
presid
donald
trump
and
then
there
is
the
govern
s
polici
of
reduc
air
pollut
which
is
result
in
a
shift
to
electr
car
and
truck
power
by
liquefi
natur
ga
lng
for
india
the
greatest
risk
to
it
econom
outlook
is
high
energi
price
given
it
relianc
on
import
crude
and
natur
ga
and
to
some
extent
import
coal
the
price
of
a
litr
of
diesel
in
the
capit
new
delhi
wa
indian
rupe
on
wednesday
which
is
up
percent
from
thi
time
a
year
ago
the
price
of
brent
crude
ha
risen
by
about
percent
in
the
past
year
mean
indian
consum
have
been
spare
the
worst
of
the
increas
but
there
have
to
be
question
mark
over
how
long
the
govern
can
lean
on
the
refin
to
absorb
the
cost
increas
overal
there
is
no
immedi
reason
to
expect
lower
crude
oil
demand
growth
in
china
and
india
but
the
risk
are
mainli
angl
toward
an

than
an
