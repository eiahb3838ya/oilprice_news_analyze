slid
by
about
percent
to
close
at

it
s
no
secret
that
the
saudi
and
other
produc
in
the
organ
of
the
petroleum
export
countri
opec
and
it
alli
would
prefer
crude
price
to
remain
north
of
a

level
that
they
believ
is
sustain
the
eleph
in
the

part
of
the
reason

china
and
india
the
waiver
effect
kick
the
can
on
iranian
sanction
down
the
road
while
the
problem
of
how
effect
the
sanction
will
eventu
be
is
still
there
it
s
not
an
issu
for
the
short
term
what
is
also
uncertain
is
exactli
how
saudi
arabia
russia
and
other
produc
feel
about
the
action
of
the
trump
administr
the
saudi
agre
in
the
middl
of
the
year
to
suppli
more
crude

the
market
larg
in
respons
to
twitter
pressur
from

they
may
now
feel
they
ve
been
play
by
the
presid
trump
may
have
succeed
in
get
oil
price
to
declin
with
the
iran
waiver
seemingli
be
the
last
straw
for
ani
bull
left
in
the
market
but
now
the
saudi
have
step
in
to
tri
and
prevent
price
from
fall
further
with
brent
gain
as
much
as
percent
in
earli
asian
trade
on
monday
that
gain
may
not
seem
too
impress
but
it
doe
mean
that
brent
ha
avoid
for
now
fall
into
the
tradit
definit
of
a
bear
market
it
briefli
touch
the
threshold
of
a
percent
declin
dure
trade
on
but
avoid
close
in
bear
territori
if
the
saudi
and
other
produc
do
take
step
to
limit
suppli
in
order
to
support
price
thi
will
almost
certainli
spark
the
ire
of
the
mercuri
presid
the
unit
state
still
ha
consider
leverag
in
the
middl
east
and
trump
may
be
prepar
to
use
thi
in
order
to
keep
oil
price
low
the
kill
of
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
the
saudi
consul
in
istanbul
last
month
remain
a
wild
card
the
exact
role
of
the
saudi
govern
and
the
crown
princ
moham
bin
salman
is
still
to
be
clarifi
even
though
riyadh
ha
acknowledg
that
it
agent
carri
out
a
premedit
kill
while
there
are
still
uncertainti
surround
the
outlook
for
crude
oil
it
seem
the
market
is
choos
to
focu
on
the
narr
of
increas
suppli
the
market
structur
ha
shift
from
backward
where
price
for
month
are
lower
than
those
for
prompt
deliveri
to
contango
where
prompt
price
are
lower
than
those
for
later
deliveri
thi
is
usual
a
sign
that
the
market
is
face
while
the
contango
is
still
modest
the
risk
is
that
it
steepen
if
investor
continu
to
take
the
view
that
there
is
no
shortag
of
crude
certainli
the
rise
to
a
high
in
the
drill
rig
count
in
the
unit
state
last
week
suggest
that
more
suppli
is
come
on
stream
what
the
market
will
now
have
to
assess
is
how
success
the
saudi
will
be
in
restrain
their
own
output
and
that
of
their
alli

complet

past
few
week
the
market
may
well
have
to
swing
