further
there
is
some

have
influenc
the

polici
the

between

coincid
with
a
sharp
chang
in
saudi
rhetor
about
the
state
of
the
oil
market
and
need
for
more
suppli
follow
quickli
by
a
ramp
up
in
the
kingdom
s
product
while
some
comment
have
dismiss
the
tweet
as
empti
polit
theatr
they
have
probabl
had
a
real
impact
on
suppli
the

s
intervent
on

and
are
therefor
signific
for
price
at
least
in
the
short
and
medium
term
oil
price
are
alway
polit
sensit
in
the

but
especi
now
with

on

due
to
be

congression
elect
on
neither
the

are
therefor
an
attempt
to
shift
blame
as
well
as
push
alli
to
increas
output
faster
and
further
than
they
might
otherwis
so
the
renew
rise
in

oil

is
unlik
to
be
welcom
by
