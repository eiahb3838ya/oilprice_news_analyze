polici
explicit
in

the

will
counter
the

of
iran
saudi

rival
by
impos
tough
sanction
in
return
saudi

will
protect

the

note
that
the

he
said
in

defend

for
veri
littl

saudi
arabia
s
object
reveal
at
the

ha
been
to
stabilis

indic
that
they
will
lift
product
by
about

barrel
per

bpd
to
offset
loss
from

and
iran
but
not
more
the
implic
is
that
saudi

want
to
keep
price
around
a

and
see
that
level
as
sustain
in
the
medium
