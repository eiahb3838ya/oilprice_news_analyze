it
s
littl
surpris
that

the
common
theme
at
work
is
that
coal
is
find
it
harder
to
secur
a
futur
in

it
s
worth
unpack

to

anoth

while
glencor
may
genuin
be
tri
to
do
it
part
to

warm
it
s
also
like
the
mine
giant
ha
calcul
that
restrict
coal
output
will
be
good
for

it
is
accept
that
coal
consumpt
is
like
to
drop
in
the
come
decad
to
virtual
noth
in
europ
and
north
america
and
will
even
start
to
declin
in
asia
but
glencor
ha
probabl
calcul
that
thi
will
be
a
slow
profit
death
and
is
posit
itself
to
take
advantag
while
overal
coal
consumpt
is
import
for
climat
consider
glencor
s
interest
lie
in
the

market
and
it
s
here
that
busi
may
actual
be
good
for
an
extend
period
even
as
overal
coal
demand
drop
the
seaborn
market
is
set
to
becom
tighter

in

howev
all

variou
reason
as
to
whi
they
may
not

indonesia

australia
the

and
number
two
in

south

is
also
tri
to

probabl
acquir
all

it
mission
now
is

oper
these

to
tri
and
ensur
that

remain
as
high
as
possibl
it
may
be
cynic
but
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
say
the
compani
will
cap

help
to
keep
the
seaborn
market
tight

china
is
show
that
two
can
play
that
game
with
custom

reuter
report
on
thursday
thi
isn
t
the
first
time
china
ha
taken
such
measur
and
the
most
like
outcom
is
that
import
will
declin
for
a
period
of
time
but
may
eventu
recov
much
of
the
coal
china
import
from
australia
is
coke
coal
and
thi
is
harder
to
sourc
from
other
countri
with
the
onli
real
altern
be
canada
and
the
unit
state
what
is
clearer
is
that
china
the
world
s
biggest
coal
import
want
to
limit
it
total
import
which
mean
that
over
time
it
s
unlik
to
be
much
of
a
growth
market
india
the
coal
import
loom
as
a
great
hope
for
the

but
the
coaltran

confer
thi
week
in

show
that
while
import
may
grow
thi
year
and
next
a
dearth
of

the
