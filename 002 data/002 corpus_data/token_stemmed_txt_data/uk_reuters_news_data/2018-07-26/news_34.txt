accord

india
is
like

the

and
up

sinc
the

howev
australia
isn

a

to

with
the
bulk
of

export
to
the
south
asian
nation
be
coke
coal
india
s
main
supplier
of
thermal
coal
is
indonesia
where
price
have
also
been
rise
but
perhap
not
quit
so
dramat
as
for
the
australian
grade
indonesian
coal
with
a
calorif
valu
of
kilocalori

have

sinc
the

it
s
also
down
from
it
peak
so
far
in
of
a

hit
in
late
februari
although
it
is
also
well
abov
the
trough
of
from
the
week
to
apr
what
the
price
show
is
that
indonesian
coal
ha
underperform
australian
coal
mean
that
it
should
be
enjoy
a
rel
advantag
in
a
buyer
such
as
india
but
the
data
isn
t
show
thi
with
import
from
indonesia
weaken
in
june
and
juli
juli
s
total
is
like
to
be
around
million
tonn
down
from
june
s
million
and
million
in
may
which
wa
the
best
month
sinc
decemb
last
year
in
contrast
coal
shipment
from
australia
to
india
have
been
move
sharpli
higher
with
million
tonn
like
to
have
arriv
in
juli
the
strongest
month
sinc
ship
data
start
in
of
cours
the
bulk
of
thi
will
still
be
coke
coal
use
to
make
steel
but
look
at
the
breakdown
of
the
vessel
and
it
appear
at
least
some
cargo
were
thermal
coal
the
other
winner
is
india
s
supplier
south
africa
with
import
rise
to
around
million
tonn
in
juli
also
a
record
south
africa
s
export
are
thermal
coal
and
are
of
a
higher
calorif
valu
than
the
bulk
of
shipment
from
indonesia
thi
show
that
indian
util
are
prepar
to
pay
more
for
coal
which
may
be
a
sign
that
they
are
seek
to
maximis
the
effici
of
their
boiler
or
are
concern
about
minimis
the
amount
of
pollut
per
unit
of
electr
gener
it
also
seem
like
that
coal
import
may
remain
elev
for
at
least
the
come
month
given
the
difficulti
be
experienc
by

coal
india
in

howev
as
the

it
s
also
like
that
