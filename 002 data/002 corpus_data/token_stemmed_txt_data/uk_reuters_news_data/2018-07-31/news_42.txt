up
in

of

while
investor
are
usual
pleas
to
get
their
hand
on
a
pile
of
cash
the
fact
that
bhp
intend
to
hand
over
the
cash
and
rio

may
do
the
same
illustr
that

were
heavili
criticis
for

which
end
in

wa
follow
by
five
year
of
declin
price
for
most
major

such

thi
result
in
the
compani
turn
their
focu
to
oper
effici
and
boost
return
to

a
shift
that
is
still
the
current
mantra
most
often
heard
from
top
mine
execut
but
while
thi
wa
a
necessari
chang
in
mindset
it
is
also
a
strategi
that
s
unlik
to
work
in
the
long
term
bhp
retain
offshor
crude
oil
asset
in
the
unit
state
and
it

in

ga
in

but
the
sale
of
the
shale

mainli
to

is
an
effect
retreat
from
a
busi
that

shale
also
came
at
a
substanti

for

given
the

cost
about
billion
when

have
been
written
down
in

then
hand
the
money
back
to

through

dividend
or
a

will
provid
investor
with
a
sugar
hit
but
do
littl
to
enhanc
the
valu
of
bhp
bhp
s
biggest
divis
is
it
western
australia
iron

and
the
compani
remain
heavili
expos

the

suppli
rio

is
even
more
expos
to

with

account
for
about
percent
of

both
bhp
and
rio

have
struggl
to
diversifi

and
both
have
made
costli
and
unsuccess

in
the
past
year
bhp
s
massiv

these
asset
are
good
enough
to
be
worth
invest

the
difficulti
both

have
encount

there
are
probabl
no
easi
major

left
in

thi
pose
the
question
what
next
for
bhp
rio
tinto
and
other
major
miner
such
as

s
vale
they
run
the
risk
of
be
compani
that
can
return
cash
to

in
the
good
time
but
will
lag
when
commod

go
through
the
inevit

downturn
while
it
would
be
foolish
to
advoc
the
compani
jump
headlong
into

such
as
