at
the
back
of

is
the

how

wa
come
to

wa
it
wa
pretti
much
all
wrong
a

boldli

in

that
china
would
be

billion

would
be
up
to

while
thi
wa
probabl
the
most
bullish
forecast
it
wasn

terribl
out
of
line
with
sever
other
predict
but
these
forecast
now
look
hopelessli
optimist
given
china

coal
import
were
million
tonn
in
while
import
have
risen
for
two
year
they
are
still
well
below
the

from
while
china
s
coal
import
may
rise
slightli
thi

it
s
unlik
they
will
reach
million
tonn
and
that
billion

forecast
look
well
out
of

howev
there
is
still
no
shortag
of
optim
among
australia
s

with

group
the

of

releas
a
report
thi

that
hark
back
to
the

of

asian

the

assum
that

then
also

howev
the

as

increasingli
tighten

in

it

not
be
enough
to
replac
the
closur
of

the

also
fail
to
account
for
polit
pressur
to
move
away
from

not
onli
in
china
but
increasingli
in
india
it
s
like
that
those

in

if
there
wa
anoth
common
theme
to

it
s
that
the
coal

still
doesn
t
fulli
grasp
that
array
of

the
mantra
of

and
the

still
without

wa
still
repeat

scratch
a
littl
further
and

will
tell
