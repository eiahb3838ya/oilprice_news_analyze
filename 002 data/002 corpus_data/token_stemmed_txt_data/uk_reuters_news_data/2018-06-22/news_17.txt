not

it
s
a
victori
for
iran
they
were
kind
of

here
to
the
extent
they
get
the
blame
for
higher

it

those

posit
all

that

of

oil

should
remain
tight
as
a

they
were
veri

on

and
seem
to
have
abandon

no
inform
on
who
will
make
up

wa
announc
market
were
expect
larger
product
increas
price
should
rise
as
a
the
real
rise
in
suppli
for
opec
and
will
probabl
be
around
bpd
barrel
per
day
it
will
be
enough
for
now
but
not
enough
for
to
address
a
declin
in
iranian
and
venezuelan
export
plu
there
isn
t
a
lot
of
spare
capac
in
the
world
if
we
lose
a
million
bpd
of
output
from
venezuela
and
iran
in
where
will
all
these
barrel
come
from

the
effect
increas
in
output
can
easili
be
absorb
by
the
market
and
is
not
go
to
tip
the
oil
balanc
into
neg
territori
so
i
suspect
the
market
will
continu
to
grind
higher
notabl
in
view
of
oil
inventori
in
the
oecd
be
below
the
famou
averag
target
and
the
ever
present
risk
of
suppli
outag
in
venezuela
and
libya
and
eventu
there
will
be
some
shutter
of
suppli
in
iran
as
start
have
a
neg
impact
on
the
countri
s
in
the
short
term
we
are
like
to
see
crude
oil
be
support
by
continu
risk
relat
to
suppli
concern
from
venezuela
and
not
least
iran
as
the
deadlin
for
the
implement
of
sanction
approach
these
concern
may
howev
eventu
be
replac
by
a
shift
focu
toward
a
continu
rise
in
suppli
and
not
least
demand
growth
which
may
begin
to
suffer
due
to
a
slowdown
among
emerg
market
opec
wa
like
to
agre
to
rais
output
but
the
increas
is
slightli
more
than
we
assum
base
on
our
previous
publish
balanc
we
expect
opec
crude
output
to
increas
by
about
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
year
assum
libya
s
oil
output
can
rebound
to
bpd
thi
agreement
is
consist
with
those
expect
though
we
see
a
slight
upsid
risk
in
saudi

kuwaiti
output
expect
compar
with

go
into

real
opec
meet
today
follow
by

the
recommend
to
the
member
after
longer
than
expect
discuss
and
debat
yesterday
is
for
a
formal
increas
of
million
bpd
to
be
split
with
some
calcul
which
will
result
in
a
real

howev
not
