donald

the
tariff
on

were
moot
by
the
chines
on
june
as
part
of
their
respons
to
the
announc
of
tariff
on
billion
worth
of
import
to
be
clear
the
tariff
on
crude
oil
and
product
and
coal
are
still
in
the
realm
of
the
possibl
and
it
will
like
take
a
further
deterior
in
the
relationship
between
the
world
s
two
largest
economi
to
turn
them
into
a
realiti
it
wa
also
curiou
that

crude

the
chines
threat
to
impos
tariff
on
energi
import
make
sens
from
two
perspect
the
first
is
that
in
econom
term
it
s
gener
best
to
put
tariff
on
good
with
high
elast
in
other
word
good
you
can
substitut
rel
easili
from
other
supplier
the
second
is
that
if
the
aim
of
your
tariff
is
to
inflict
suffici
pain
on
the
other
countri
it
s
best
to
target
them
where
they
can
do
the
most
damag
to
the
economi
or
the
politician
promot
the
trade
war
look
at
the
first
point
it
s
clear
that
china
would
be
abl
to
sourc
crude
oil
refin
product
and
coal
from
other
countri
even
if
it
had
to
pay
slightli
more
the
chines
have
becom
a
major
buyer
of
crude
import
about
barrel
per
day
bpd
in
the
first
five
month
of
the
year
accord
to
and
port
data
compil
by
thomson
reuter
oil
research
and
forecast
thi
make
china
the
biggest
net
buyer
of
crude
canada
import
more
but
also
export
to
the
and
therefor
an
import
custom
for
the
boom
shale
industri
with
crude
export
run
at
about
million
bpd
china
s
purchas
repres
about
percent
of
the
total
howev
crude
suppli
to
china
account
for
onli
about
percent
of
the
countri
s
total
daili
import
what
thi
is
like
to
mean
is
that
china
will
find
it
easier
to
replac
crude
import
than
produc
will
to
get
new
custom
it
s
not
hard
to
imagin
a
scenario
wherebi
china
encourag
saudi
arabia
and
russia
the
world
s
top
oil
export
and
partner
in
the
agreement
to
restrict
output
to
pump
more
crude
china
would
then
buy
the
addit
saudi
and
russian
output
use
it
to
replac
cargo
from
the
unit
state
and
even
from
iran
assum
the
renew
sanction
against
the
islam
republ
forc
beij
to
curtail
import
turn
to
coal
the
major
of
china
s
import
from
the
unit
state
are
coke
coal
use
in
steel
make
suppli
of
thi
type
of
coal
is
more
concentr
with
australia
domin
the
seaborn
market
but
absent
a
disrupt
in
australia
it
s
like
china
could
buy
all
it
need
without
tap
suppli
although
thi
may
result
in
a
shuffl
among
buyer
for
exampl
japan
may
buy
more
from
the
unit
state
and
less
from
australia
look
at
natur
ga
and
while
lng
remain
off
the
custom
list
for
the
time
be
the
chines
could
also
probabl
replac
what
they
buy
from
the
unit
state
from
other
countri
if
need
in
the
first
five
month
of
the
year
the
unit
state
suppli
about
percent
of
china
s
lng
import
accord
to
data
howev
china
bought
about
percent
of
all
lng
export
mean
that
china
is
more
import
to
lng
produc
than
they
are
to
the
chines
by
put
energi
import
on
the
agenda
for
tariff
even
if
lng
is
exclud
so
far
the
chines
have
put
doubt
in
the
mind
of
investor
think
of
put
capit
into
a
new
lng
project
the
second
leg
to
china
s
threat
is
that
ani
tariff
on
energi
import
will
strike
at
the
heart
of
presid
trump
s
support
base
coal
miner
count
among
trump
s
most
vocal
backer
but
if
china
doe
stop
buy
coke
coal
it
may
forc
produc
to
accept
lower
price
from
other
buyer
in
order
to
move
cargo
the
oil
and
natur
ga
industri
have
also
been
view
as
larg
in
trump

corner
and
they
are
concentr
in

as
big
a

as
china
may
forc

energi
is
also
one
of
the
few
area
where
the
chines
have
genuin

across
as
a
