that

but
doesn

with
the

also
the

the
ship
data
doe
show
that
lng
demand
wa
strong
for
the
first
part
of
the
northern
winter
but
it
doesn
t
yet
give
a
pictur
of
how
the
rest
of
the
cold
season
will
play
out
it
s
here
that
the
spot
price
come
into
play
and
thi
is
point
to
a
weak
of
winter
the

price
for

deliv
to

british

it
ha
been

down
sinc
a
minor
earli
winter
peak
of
per
mmbtu
in
the
week
to
and
is
well
below
the
of
reach
in
the
week
to
june
the
spot
price
is
usual
for
deliveri
of
around
four
to
eight
week
in

so
the
current

reflect
cargo
that

it
s
worth
note
that
the
reach
in
reflect
cargo
deliv
in
decemb
when
demand
reach
an
high
in
northeast
asia
the
fact
that
even
thi
strong

couldn
t
spark
a
sustain
ralli
in
price
show
that
it
s
more
like
ampl
suppli
is
play
a
greater
role
than
demand
thi
view
is
support
by
spot
price
for
march
deliveri
at
around
per
mmbtu
be
weaker
than
those

the

swung

from
one
of

that
strong

growth
in

will
lead
to

unless

while
thi
view
may
well
be
correct
from
a
perspect
it
doesn

preclud
the
possibl
of
to

may
be
the
