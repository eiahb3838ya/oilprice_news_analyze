demand
that
sound

plausibl
but
doesn

talli
with
the
fact
that

a
total
of
million

also
the

the

in

whilst
south

record
an
increas
to
million

the
ship
data
doe
show
that
lng
demand
wa
strong
for
the
first
part
of
the
northern
winter
but
it
doesn
t
yet
give
a
pictur
of
how
the
rest
of
the
cold
season
will
play
out
it
s
here
that
the
spot
price
come
into
play
and
thi
is
point
to
a
weak
of
winter
the
spot
price
for

deliv
to

british

in
the

it
ha
been

down
sinc
a
minor
earli
winter
peak
of
per
mmbtu
in
the
week
to
and
is
well
below
the
of
reach
in
the
week
to
june
the
spot
price
is
usual
for
deliveri
of
around
four
to
eight
week
in
advanc
so
the
current
price
reflect
cargo
that
will
arriv
in

it
s
worth
note
that
the
reach
in
reflect
cargo
deliv
in
decemb
when
demand
reach
an
high
in
northeast
asia
the
fact
that
even
thi
strong
demand
couldn
t
spark
a
sustain
ralli
in
price
show
that
it
s
more
like
ampl
suppli
is
play
a
greater
role
than
demand
thi
view
is
support
by
spot
price
for
march
deliveri
at
around
per
mmbtu
be
weaker
than
those
for

there
is
usual
a

as

the

on
how
hot
the

thi

demand
for
the
fact
that
the
winter
ralli
in

didn
t
materialis
even
in
the
face
of

growth
rais
the
possibl
of
a
the

narr
of

ha
swung
in
recent
month
from
one
of
an
expect
oversuppli
on
the
back
of
a
raft
of
new
project
mainli
in
australia
and
the
unit
state
to
a
consensu
that
strong

growth
in

will
lead
to
a
deficit
in

year
unless
new

howev
while
thi
view
may
well
be
correct
from
a
perspect
it
doesn
t
preclud
the
possibl
of
to
period
where
suppli

thi
may
be
the
situat
