way
or
the
other
the
minist
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
in
an
interview
we
re
a
small
countri
but
when
it
come
to
ship
we
are
a
forc
to
reckon
the
marshal
island
a
pacif
nation
where
the
unit
state
carri
out
nuclear
test
in
the
and
is
home
to
peopl
the
major
of
them
live
in
majuro
the
capit
and
ebey
the
second
largest
citi
alreadi
it
is
struggl
with
climat
chang
pressur
from
stronger
king
tide
that
flood
home
and
field
and
seep
into
the
countri
s
underground
fresh
water
to
worsen
drought
said
paul
who
repres
kwajalein
atol
the
countri
s
largest
island
in
the
countri
s
legislatur
in
the
marshal
island
we
re
at
the
forefront
of
climat
chang
we
are
experienc
it
day
in
and
day
out
he
said
as
saltwat
destroy
field
and
water
suppli
it
s
becom
far
harder
for
us
to
live
in
certain
part
of
the
countri
than
ever
befor
such
creep
loss
don
t
attract
the
intern
attent
that
power
cyclon
do
but
the
frequenc
of
these
event
add
up
and
it
realli
take
a
toll
on
the
countri
he
said
despit
that
there
s
no
way
we
re
go
to
migrat
and
leav
the
countri
he
said
instead
the
countri
aim
to
put
pressur
on
bigger
nation
to
cut
their
emiss
and
at
home
to
adapt
and
adjust
to
build
a
commun
far
more
resili
than
befor
so
far
the
marshal
island
govern
is
promot
water
harvest
tri
out
new
roof
design
aim
at
captur
and
channel
rain
and
experi
with
desalin
among
other
effort
but
the
biggest
push
is
to
reduc
the
island
own
emiss
particularli
from
gener
that
still
provid
much
of
the
countri
s
electr
home
solar
power
system
are
alreadi
in
widespread
use
in
some
remot
atol
and
the
countri
is
develop
a
plan
to
instal
solar
power
more
wide
and
becom
carbon
neutral
by
that
will
happen
larg
by
cut
fossil
fuel
use
from
electr
product
and
transport
and
burn
trash
to
produc
electr
paul
said
the
plan
expect
to
be
in

would
be
a
first
for

we
absolut
believ
we
can
becom
carbon
neutral
by
he
said
but
find
fund
to
make
the
switch
remain
a
frustrat
not

becaus
the

like
