respond
to
the
ipcc
report
by
say
in
a
statement
on

that

vital
and
that
the

group
will
push
for
it
to

on

it
acknowledg
that
current
progress
of

is
too
slow
to
allow
necessari
emiss
reduct
goal
to
be
achiev
it
solut
is
to
spend
more
on

develop
but
it
s
here
that
the
coal

will
run
into
problem
alreadi
renew

which
have
benefit
from

cheaper

a
trend
like
to
continu
gener
with

would
like
requir
huge

in
order
to
be
and
sell
such
largess
with
public

will
be
incred
hard
for

in

it
s
therefor
like
that
the
scenario
current
be
play
out
in

will
be
extend
to
other
part
of
the
world
with
power
be
replac
by
a
combin

batteri
storag
and
even
nuclear
coal
will
further
be
hamstrung
by
the
flight
of

while
it
s
like
that
the
develop
world
will
wit
ongo
bitter
debat
over

the
actual
key
to
the
ipcc
target
is
china
and
to
a
lesser
extent
the
rest
of
develop
asia
china
is
the
world

produc
consum

import

and
ani
genuin
attempt

the
posit

given

what

especi
if

s
also

the
