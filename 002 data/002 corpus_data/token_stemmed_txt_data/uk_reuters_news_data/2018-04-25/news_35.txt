german
economi

said
on

it
would
be
neglig
to
end

which
ha
impos
tariff
on
import
of
steel
and

speak
just

befor

on

altmaier
said
i
remain
convinc
that
it
would
be
careless
to
stumbl
into
a
trade
conflict
so
i
think
a

solut
should
take
preced
over

trump
ha
given
the

ask
whether

forecast
includ
the
scenario
of
a
hard
brexit
altmaier
said
we
don
t
know
whether
there
will
be
a
hard
brexit
we
are
all
interest
in
avoid
it
and
the
eu
commiss
is
negoti
with
britain
in
thi
spirit
even
if
these
negoti
were
not
to
lead
to
the
desir
outcom
there
would
unlik
be
an
impact
on
econom
growth
thi
year
so
we
are
safe
with
the
forecast

thi
