of
the
standout
commod
perform
thi
year
ha
been
thermal
coal
but
not
all
coal
is
creat
equal
and
dispar
in
price
may
help
explain
whi
india
s
import
have
stay
strong
despit
the
higher
cost
the
main
benchmark
for
thermal
coal
in
asia
is
price
at
australia
s
newcastl
port
the
world
s
largest
harbour
the
price
ha
gain
percent
so
far
thi
year
to
close
at
a
tonn
in
the
week
to
accord
to
assess
by
argu
media
thi
isn
t
far
off
the
year
high
of
nearli
a
tonn
hit
in
juli
with
the
price
surg
thi
year
larg
come
on
the
back
of
increas
chines
demand
for
coal
to
be
burn
in
power
station
what
ha
been
somewhat
surpris
is
that
india
the
world
s
coal
import
behind
china
ha
defi
it
prior
histori
of
be
a
buyer
and
boost
it
import
thi
year
but
delv
into
the
detail
offer
an
explan
as
to
whi
thi
is
the
case
the
price
of
the
bulk
of
the
coal
india
import
ha
been
declin
especi
in
recent
month
india
import
million
tonn
of
coal
in
the
first
eight
month
of
the
year
up
percent
on
the
same
period
last
year
accord
to
and
port
data
compil
by
thomson
reuter
of
thi
million
tonn
came
from
indonesia
make
the
southeast
asian
nation
india
s
top
supplier
india
tend
to
import
lower
qualiti
coal
from
indonesia
with
a
typic
grade
be
fuel
with
an
energi
rate
of
kilocalori
per
kilogram
the
price
for
thi
type
of
coal
as
assess
by
argu
media
ha
been
declin
sinc
late
june
drop
to
a
tonn
in
the
week
end
it
ha
fallen
percent
sinc
june
and
is
now
down
percent
so
far
thi
year
the
gap
between
newcastl
coal
with
an
energi
content
of
and
indonesian
is
now
at
it
widest
sinc
earli
thi
appear
to
have
shore
up
indian
buy
of
indonesian
coal
with
import
rise
in
august
to
million
tonn
up
from
million
in
juli
accord
to
the
data
given
the
recent
difficulti
coal
india
ha
experienc
in
meet
domest
requir
it
s
littl
surpris
that
indian
buyer
have
ramp
up
purchas
from
indonesia
it
s
also
worth
note
that
india
hasn
t
increas
the
amount
of
coal
it
buy
from
other
top
supplier
australia
is
india
s
supplier
but
it
ship
almost
exclus
coke
coal
use
in
steelmak
and
is
thu
not
a
competitor
with
indonesia
howev
south
africa
export
thermal
coal
which
is
similar
in
qualiti
and
price
to
australia
s
newcastl
benchmark
india
import
million
tonn
from
south
africa
in
august
down
from
million
in
juli
perhap
indic
less
of
an
appetit
for
the
more
expens
but
higher
qualiti
fuel
one
question
that
remain
to
be
answer
is
whi
is
the
price
of
indonesian
coal
fall
while
higher
grade
are
still
either
rise
or
stay
close
to
high
while
it
s
too
earli
to
provid
a
definit
answer
it
appear
that
china
may
be
buy
less
indonesian
coal
with
import
drop
to
million
tonn
in
august
from
million
tonn
in
both
juli
and
june
accord
to
data
china
ha
also
struggl
with
domest
coal
avail
mainli
as
a
result
of
output
restrict
as
part
of
effort
to
combat
air
pollut
thi
ha
boost
demand
for
import
but
it
seem
chines
buyer
are
prefer
higher
energi
content
australian
coal
over
indonesian
grade
much
of
the
coal
china
buy
from
indonesia
is
use
as
a
blend
feedstock
with
domest
suppli
in
a
compromis
that
see
a
drop
in
overal
energi
content
but
also
a
drop
in
sulphur
and
ash
given
indonesian
coal
is
low
in
these
pollut
the
opinion
express
here
are
those
