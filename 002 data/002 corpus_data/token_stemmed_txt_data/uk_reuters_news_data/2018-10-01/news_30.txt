of

in
the
past
decad
most
recent
in

last

and
then
onli
for
a
day
and
at
a
rel

of

accord
to
calcul
by
s
p

oman
and
brent

have

but
when
the

finish
on
it
wa
at
a

while
at
that
time
brent
wa
at
oman
normal
trade
below
brent
as
it
is
a
crude
which
is
typic
more
costli
for
refin
to
process
and
doesn
t
yield
as
much
of
the
product
such
as
gasolin
as
doe
brent
which
is
a
light
sweet
oil
for
oman
to
romp
to
such
a
larg
premium
to
brent
and
maintain
it
for
four
session
is
unusu
and
will
no
doubt
be
of
concern
to
both
the
dme
and
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
the
refin
who
buy
saudi
crude
trader
appear
larg
to
have
been
caught
by
surpris
by
last
week
s
spike
in
oman
if
comment
at
the
annual
industri
gather
in
singapor
were
anyth
to
go
by
but
the
likelihood
is
that
the
increas
in
oman
will
be
unwound
in
come
day
given
that
it
seem
to
have
been
larg
driven
by
buy
by
chines
refin
the
bulk
of
deliv
oman
head
to
china
and
it
appear
that
refin
in
the
world
s
largest
crude
import
especi
smaller
independ
oper
were
keen
to
stock
up
befor
the
end
of
the
year
to
use
up
their
import
alloc
chines
buy
may
also
have
been
boost
by
the
fact
that
thi
week
is
a
holiday
for
the
countri
s
nation
day
mean
most
crude
trade
busi
will
be
close
there
is
also
like
a
smaller
element
of
buy
boost
the
oman
contract
and
that
is
the
potenti
loom
shortag
of
heavier
and
sour
grade
of
crude
as
renew
sanction
against
iran
ramp
up
to
includ
all
of
the
islam
republ
s
crude
export
from
novemb
mani
asian
refin
prefer
heavier
crude
have
invest
in
unit
that
can
process
these
grade
into
higher
valu
product
especi
middl
distil
such
as
diesel
and
jet
fuel
while
it
s
like
that
oman
s
premium
to
brent
will
be
unwound
in
come
day
the
time
couldn
t
have
been
wors
for
saudi
aramco
the
produc
that
is
the
world
s
largest
export
of
crude
from
octob
aramco
wa

the

for
the
first

the
the
saudi

the

the

perhap
more
vulner

given
the
rel
small

as
of

wa
suppos
to
make
the

more
transpar
and
robust
given
the
oman
contract
ha
more
physic
volum
behind
it
and
the
back
of
a
clear
exchang
but
last
week
s
surg
ha
shown
that
the
oman
contract
can
also
shift
dramat
in
a
short
space
of
time
if
the
demand
for
crude
is
there
the
saudi
osp
tend
to
set
the

will
now
be

that
last

action
will
result
in

like
to
announc
their

at

thi
isn

the
start
the
dme
and
aramco
would
have
want
for
the
new

the
chanc
