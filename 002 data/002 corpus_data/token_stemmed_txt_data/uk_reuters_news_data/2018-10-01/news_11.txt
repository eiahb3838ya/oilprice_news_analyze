in
the
oil

balanc
is
a
difficult
game
calcul
whether
the
million
barrel

world
market
is
like
in
the
month
ahead
to
have
a
surplu
or
deficit
of
suppli

be
balanc
where

seb
it

hard

just
right
that
mean
that
the
oil

natur
will
move
between
the
two
extrem
of
low
price
demand
boost
and
suppli
destruct
or
high
price
suppli
boost
and
demand
and
sinc
the
middl
ground
between
these
two
seem
to
be
the
rang
where
it
is
neither
