amid
call
from
major

to
cool
down

three
opec

iran
venezuela
and

have
been
reluct
to
consent
to
a
formal

in
opec

as
part
of
a

with
russia
and
other

run
until
the
end

on
wednesday
iranian
oil
minist
bijan

said
opec
member
that

on
cut
should
return

a
possibl
compromis
to
keep
both
the

and
produc
more

if
all
opec

produc
as
much
as
they
were

would
in
theori
rise
by
about
barrel
per

base
on
reuter
estim
of
the

in
may
but
in
practic
it
would
mean
a
much
smaller
boost
of
less

consid
the

had
a
larger
impact
and
can
not

so
a

so
far
there
is
no

although
with

extens
talk
in

further

could
be
made
if
the

felt
there
