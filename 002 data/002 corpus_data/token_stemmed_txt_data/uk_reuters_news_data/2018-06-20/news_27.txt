the
world
s

unless

the

tri
to

my
biggest
worri
about
brexit
is
that
i
don
t
know
what
we
are
plan
for
juergen
maier
the
uk
ceo
of
german
engin
giant
siemen
told
reuter
in
an
interview
we
need
to
put
someth
in
place
quickli
that
work
and
if
that
is
not
possibl
and
until
that
point
then
we
have
to
just
default
to
stay
in
the
custom
union
maier
said
may
ha
rule
out
stay
in
the
eu
custom
union
which
club
the
eu
member
in
a
area
where
there
is
a
common
import
tariff
for
good
but
the
natur
of
the
futur
trade
relationship
with
the
world
s
biggest
trade
bloc
ha
split
may
s
govern
and
conserv
parti
under
the
current
timet
both
london
and
brussel
are
work
toward
a
final
brexit
deal
in
octob
to
give
enough
time
to
ratifi
it
by
brexit
day
in
march
maier
said
we
ship
thousand
of
good
daili
across
the
border
that
help
keep
power
station
run
that
help
keep
train
run
that
help
keep
british
manufactur
run
are
those
part
go
to
be
abl
to
pass
pretti
frictionlessli
over
the
border
or
are
we
go
to
be
in
a
situat
where
we
have
suppli
chain
that
are
struggl
to
deliv
to
us
and
where
we
are
struggl
to
export
from
the
uk
the
view
of
the
siemen
boss
highlight
the
grow
sens
of
nervous
among
busi
leader
about
the
prospect
of
britain
crash
out
of
the
bloc
without
a
deal
or
with
a
deal
that
would
silt
up
the
arteri
of
trade
the
uk
is
siemen
market
after
the
unit
state
germani
and
china
it
employ
peopl
in
the
uk
and
uk
job
depend
on
it
if
the
brexit
we
end
up
have
provid
signific
friction
provid
signific
cost
then
of
cours
that
will
be
an
argument
against
make
invest
here
in
the
uk
he
said
maier
who
wa
born
in
germani
and
move
to
the
uk
when
he
wa
said
he
wa
not
seek
to
stop
brexit
but
want
britain
to
seek
a
soft
and
reason
departur
around
percent
of
the
uk
s
total
trillion
trade
in
good
last
year
wa
with
the
eu
so
may
want
to
sign
a
free
trade
agreement
and
negoti
an
as
yet
rel
undefin
custom
arrang
to
ensur
as
frictionless
trade
as
possibl
the
option
discuss
so
far
though
offer
noth
close
to
the
current
eas
of
trade
accord
to
maier
i
would
like
to
stay
in
the
custom
union
until
we
see
a
workabl
altern
and
i
haven
t
seen
one
yet
he
said
maier
said
that
ad
just
two
minut
onto
everi
lorri
s
custom
procedur
pass
through
the
southern
english
port
of
dover
would
produc
a
tailback
on
either
side
of
the
channel
after
one
day
support
of
brexit
admit
there
may
be
some
pain
for
the
uk
s
trillion
economi
but
that
it
will
prosper
when
cut
free
from
the
eu
which
they
cast
as
a
fail
experi
in
european
integr
mani
ceo
though
fear
that
a
disorderli
brexit
will
disrupt
suppli
chain
across
europ
and
crippl
the
economi
for
at
least
a
decad
by
deter
invest
maier
said
plan
for
brexit
wa
tough
the
fact
is
it
is
veri
difficult
becaus
we
don
t
know
exactli
what
we
are
plan
for
conting
plan
is
veri
difficult
when
the
option
are
so
we
have
got
conting
plan
that
we
can
implement
depend
on
variou
scenario
and
one
of
those
scenario
is
a
no
deal
but
let
me
tell
you
that
scenario
doesn
t
look
veri
good
he
said
so
how
much
ha
all
that
brexit
worri
cost
siemen
so
far
we
haven
t
put
a
figur
on
what
brexit
ha
cost
us
so
far
but
it
is
rel
small
to
what
a
brexit
is
like
to
cost
especi
in
a
no
deal
