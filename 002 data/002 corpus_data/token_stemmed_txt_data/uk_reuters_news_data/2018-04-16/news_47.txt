it

is
look

to
draw
up

and
the
eni
execut
could
not
say
at
thi
stage
how
much
it
would
be
readi
to

he
said
eni
had

the

said
the
mit
project
is
vy
with
research
team
in
franc
china
and
britain
to
develop
a
reactor
that
can
gener
more
energi
than
the
enorm

that
fusion
consum
and
can
also
safe
contain
a
mass
of

itali
also
recent
enter
the
race
though
eni
is
stick
with
mit
say
the
boston
project
is
uniqu
in
it
aim
to
produc
electr
while
other
have
scientif
object
all
project
are
base
on
a
system
known
as
tokamak
which
use
superconduct
magnet
to
hold
the
plasma
at
temperatur
of
up
to
million
degre
suspend
it
insid
a
vacuum
chamber
without
it
touch

to
make

steam
turbin
in

the
iter
project
is
the
largest

with
a
budget
of
around
billion
euro
a
collabor
between
europ
the

state
china
india
japan
russia

it
is
more
than
halfway
toward
the
first

say
thi
will
be
further
in

and
is
be

rather
than
the
privat

base
on
our

the

plan
to

befor

within

our
goal
is
to
do

even
faster

becaus
it

differ
mainli

the

thi

mumgaard
said

that
