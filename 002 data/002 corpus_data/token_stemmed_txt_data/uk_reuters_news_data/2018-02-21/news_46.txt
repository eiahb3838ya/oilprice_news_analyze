an
aw
lot
of
extrem
weather
hit
us
said
richard
dawson
the
drought
now
threaten
water
suppli
in
cape
town
is
a
stark
exampl
of
how
citi
need
to
adapt
long
befor
a
drought
or
flood
hit
onc
a
drought
kick
in
and
the
water
start
to
run
dri
it
may
be
too
late
to
build
anoth
reservoir
or
desalin
plant
dawson
said
heatwav
and
flood
pose
similar
problem
so
you
have
to
realli
start
think
longterm
in
term
of
prepar
and
adapt
citi
for
ani
sort
of
climat
event
he
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
citi
can
build
larg
infrastructur
such
as
reservoir
or
flood
barrier
or
can
make
smaller
increment
chang
repeatedli
he
said
build
also
could
be
design
to
be
natur
cooler
use
less
water
or
be
more
resili
to
flood
peopl
too
can
chang
their
behaviour
to
use
less
water
he
said
a
combin
of
all
of
those
thing
is
probabl
the
best
way
to
adapt
dawson
said
if
a
citi
can
reduc
it
need
for
water
or
it
exposur
to
climat
risk
by
cut
the
number
of
peopl
live
in
flood
plain
for
exampl
then
it
overal
vulner
goe
down
he
said
and
if
we
make
build
more
resili
to
flood
and
heat
and
more
effect
at
use
water
resourc
then
we
can
creat
more
headroom
for
adapt
to
more
extrem
event
