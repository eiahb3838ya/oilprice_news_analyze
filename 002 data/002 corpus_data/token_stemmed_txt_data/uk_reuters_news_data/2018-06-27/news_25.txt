of

that

said
the

could
use

collect
in
environment
restor
project
and
current
simpli
store
or
abandon
as
the
raw
materi
for

such
store
of
dri
plant
today
can
present
a
wildfir
risk
in
a
countri
suffer
drought
so
are
often
purpos
burn
to
avoid
that
risk
she
said
but
the
wast
could
provid
job
in
it
harvest
collect
and
transport
dinan
told
the
thomson
reuter
foundat
she
and
said
no
biomass
will
be
produc
for
be
convert
to
fuel
as
the
name
suggest
the

will
focu
on

biomass
includ
leftov

and
furnitur
product
said
at
the
moment
most
of
the
agricultur
wast
produc
in
the
countri
is
burn
she
said
in
some
area
harvest
invas
plant
alreadi
are
be
use
to
produc
charcoal
or
fibrou
product
such
as
coffin
but
most
of
the
wast
is
unus
she
said
and
onli
that
unus
suppli
will
be
divert
to
the
jet

project
said
the
project
wa
design
to
stand
up
to
worsen
drought
link
to

chang
in
southern

and
ensur
land
isn
t
use

instead
south
africa
still
ha
larg
swath
of
invas
plant
to
clear
and
the
weed
are
spread
faster
than
they
can
be
cut
back
dinan
said
which
mean
the
jet
fuel
project
could
both
aid
that
effort
and
is
unlik
to
run

sampson
mamphw
director
of
the
centr
for
renew
and
sustain
energi
studi
at
stellenbosch
univers
agre
the
countri
ha
plenti
of
organ
wast
whether
they
use
organ
wast
or
they
plant
the
biomass
for
energi
whichev
way
the
project
is
worth
investig
he
said
one
huge
challeng
with
such
project
is
the
cost
of
transport
plant
wast
so
materi
would
need
to
be
sourc
as
close
as
possibl
to
where
jet
biofuel
is
produc
mamphw
said
and
the
cost
of
the
actual
biomass
materi
is
also
a
big
factor
he
said
often
a
onc
useless
and
free
materi
becom
valuabl
when
there
is
a
use
for
it
he
said
said
it
wa
too
soon
to
get
ani
real
pictur
of
how
much
of
south
africa
s
aviat
fuel
need
might
be
met
by
the
project
but
our
previou
research
into
biomass
avail
suggest
that
technic
there
could
be
enough
biomass
to
meet
percent
of
our
aviat
fuel
demand
she
said
but
under
current
technolog
the
biofuel
would
need
to
be
blend
with
convent
jet
fuel
mean
the
wast
technolog
could
suppli
at
best
half
of
the
countri
s
need
