thi
is
the

bp
like

surg
in

ga
is
also
play
a
key
role
as
a
to
renew
energi
such
as
wind

solar
in
power
gener
to
that
end
bp
is
expand
it
ga
product
through
new

in
oman
egypt
and
trinidad
and
tobago
ga
alreadi
account
for
over

i
am
optimist
about
the
climat
chang
if
you
can
combin
renew
wind
and
solar
and
natur
ga
to
me
that
s
part
of
the
big
answer
dudley
said
in
an
interview
with
reuter
in
the
earli
bp
introduc
the
slogan
beyond
petroleum
and
adopt
a
sunburst
logo
after
launch
an
billion
expans
into
renew
the
compani
wa
forc
to
write
off
it
solar
busi
year
later
but
still
retain
a
larg
onshor
wind
busi
and
biofuel
plant
now
dudley
is
take
a
cautiou
approach
invest
in
smaller
compani
in
renew
clean
fuel
and
batteri
charg
dock
we
have
to
go
slow
and
pick
the
right
low
carbon
fuel
he
said
bp
will
be
a
compani
that
suppli
all
form
of
energi
that
are
need
that
can
be
done
the
compani
will
invest
million
per
year
in
energi
and
technolog
in
the
come
year
out
of
a
total
spend
of
to
billion
a
rang
which
dudley
said
the
compani
could
stay
within
if
a
sharehold
or
someon
els
came
to
bp
tomorrow
and
said
here
is
billion
to
invest
in
low
carbon
energi
for
us
we
would
not
know
how
to
do
that
bp
is
also
expand
it
vast
global
network
of
petrol
station
and
invest
in
conveni
store
and
charg
spot
hope
to
retain
it
domin
brand
as
electr
vehicl
becom
more
popular
i
m
not
worri
about
bp
in
thi
area
the
most
strateg
thing
we
can
do
is
to
get
our
balanc
sheet
strong
so
that
when
we
have
the
firepow
we
can
do
anyth
in
these
bp
expect
demand
for
oil
to
peak
in
the
late
after
which
it
will
plateau
and
gradual
declin
for
bp
whose
root
go
back
to
with
the
discoveri
of

the

gold
are
far
from

while

week
have
hit
their
highest
level
sinc
late
at
a
barrel
bp
are
work
on
an
assumpt
that
price
will
remain
at
a
rang
of
per

due
to
surg
shale
output
and
opec
s
abil
to
crank

mega

involv
complex
facil
such
as
huge

that
came
to
symbol
the
technolog
prowess
of
the
world
s
top
oil
compani
are
most
like
a
thing
of
the
past
dudley
said
instead
bp
is
opt
for
phase
develop
that
requir
less
capit
and
less
time
to
construct
which
make
them
easier
to
control
at
a
time
of
uncertainti
over
oil
price
mani
of
the
compani
in
the
industri
are
rememb
the
lesson
learn
dure
the
oil
era
which
is
take
it
in
phase
dudley
said
bp
is
appli
thi
approach
in
mani
of
it
main
product
hub
such
as
egypt
and
gulf
of
mexico
where
it
can
continu
rais

into
the

dudley
said
bp
s
oil
and
ga
output
is
set
to
reach
around
million
bpd
by
the
end
of
the
decad
a
level
last
seen
in
with
more
than
a
fifth
of
that
come
from
project
start
sinc
it
is
partner
with
top
oil
produc
nation
which
have
some
of
the
lowest
cost
of
extract
such
as
oman
azerbaijan
and
most
importantli
russia
where
bp
ha
a
percent
stake
in
rosneft
and
where
it
draw
one
third
of
it
product
bp
ha
a
rel
small
shale
busi
focus
mostli
on
ga
but
dudley
is
consid
grow
in
the
sector
which
ha
attract
billion
of
dollar
in
invest
in
recent
year
shale
come
down
to
econom
and
competit
on
what
is
on
offer
so
far
they
feel
overh
it
is
not
a
burn
need
to
fill
that
in
the
portfolio
but
if
it
is

we
bp
could
place
a
bid
for
bhp
billiton

dudley
said
bp
s
posit
in
russia
ha
put
the
firm
in
the
spotlight
as
the
unit
state
and
europ
tighten
sanction
on

dudley
who
sit
on
the
board
of

believ
bp
can
continu
there
and
act
as
a
bridg
between

said
dudley
certainli
today
within

without
bp
will
continu
to
oper
in

and
expand
project
with
rosneft
even
though
the

ha
had
to
